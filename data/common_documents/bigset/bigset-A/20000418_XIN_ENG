<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Permanent Deputy Prime
Minister Nguyen Tan Dung and visiting Singaporean Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong held talks here Monday, agreeing to boost
comprehensive cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Lee, accompanied by a number of Singaporean senior officials,
arrived here Monday afternoon for a four-day official visit to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two deputy prime ministers expressed
their satisfaction at the quick and fine development of the
friendship and comprehensive cooperation between Vietnam and
Singapore, especially after the March 1999 official visit to
Singapore by Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong.
</P>
<P>
Dung and Lee agreed that the two sides should promote the
exchange of high-level delegations and contacts between business
people of the two countries, maintain existing cooperative
mechanisms and effectively implement the two countries' high-level
agreements and other accords which were signed at the 5th session
of the Vietnam-Singapore Cooperation Commission.
</P>
<P>
Dung affirmed that Vietnam will pursue the policy of attaching
importance to boosting and expanding its friendship and
comprehensive cooperation with Singapore in the framework of the
two countries' bilateral ties and between ASEAN member countries'
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Lee affirmed that Singapore would continue supporting its
business people to promote investment in and trade with Vietnam.
Singapore is ready to share with Vietnam its experiences in
training, infrastructure construction, finance and banking,
development strategy, and international integration.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed regional and international issues
of common concern.
</P>
<P>
By 1999, Singapore had become the biggest investor in Vietnam
with 234 projects worth more than 6.7 billion U.S. dollars and
Vietnam's second biggest trading partner with two-way trade
reaching about 2.7 billion dollars.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia have arrested two foreigners on the charges of alleged
espionage in Kabul, Afghan sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two foreigners, whose nationality and names were not
disclosed, were arrested in the Afghan capital a couple of days
ago with some documents that substantiated their involvement in
spying, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They had recently arrived in Afghanistan. Further investigation
against the detainees are going on. The sources, however, did not
elaborate for whom they were spying.
</P>
<P>
Taliban in the past had arrested several Arab nationals for
their alleged involvement in spying against the Saudi dissident
Osama bin Laden, who is under the Islamic militia's protection
against the efforts by the United States to seize him.

ULAN BATOR, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagabandi and his Vietnamese counterpart, Tran Duc Luong, agreed
here on Monday to strengthen cooperation in trade, economic,
scientific and technical areas between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Bagabandi, Luong said that it is
important for both countries to improve bilateral cooperation in
various sectors commensurate with the level of their present
political relations.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the two sides should effectively use sea and
land transport through China's Tianjin port and the railway
linking the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, Beijing and Ulan Bator.
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam is interested in setting up links between banks and
establishing cooperation among small- and medium-sized enterprises
in agricultural and other sectors" said Luong, who arrived here
Saturday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bagabandi said Mongolia has paid great attention
to increasing cooperation with Vietnam in both international and
regional affairs. Developing relations with Asia-Pacific countries,
especially Vietnam, has taken an important place in Mongolia's
foreign policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian government decided in 1999 to try to increase
bilateral trade to 10 million U.S. dollars in the following five
years, he added.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Industrial Output Grows 112 Percent After War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's industrial
production in last month increased by 112 percent over that of
last May, when NATO ended air strikes against the country.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production of last month increased 8.5 percent
over February. The building material and non-metal sector
registered the highest growth rate of 34.6 percent, the Statistics
Bureau said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Despite high speed of economic growth during the past 10 months
after 78-day bombing of NATO, most industrial sectors have not
regained the production level before March, 1999, when the war
began, due to heavy losses in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production in the first quarter of this year
decreased 5.3 percent over the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Bond Issue Not to Trigger off Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua)-- Increasing bond issues will not
trigger off inflation, let alone cause a government debt crisis,
said Xiang Huaicheng, Chinese minister of finance here today.
</P>
<P>
Xiang, speaking at the ongoing China Business Summit 2000, said
that China's economy is developing on a healthy track in general
but there are still problems and contradictions resulting from
insufficient demand.
</P>
<P>
To drive domestic demand, China has decided to issue 100
billion yuan long-term bonds to support infrastructure
construction, technical upgrading in State-owned enterprises,
developing the western region, and education and science and
research projects, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that the ratios of fiscal deficit and outstanding
bonds in the GDP stood at 2.8 percent and 12.7 percent
respectively last year, both within the safe limits as agreed
internationally.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is also strengthening study on preventing
financial crisis and are constantly improving on policy means to
maintain a safe financial situation.

<HEADLINE> Iran Bases Economic Plan on Attracting Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Third Economic Development
Plan (2000-2005) is based on attracting foreign investments,
boosting foreign trade, and also technical and economic cooperation
with other countries, officials said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iran has to reach an economic growth rate of 6 percent in the
five years to solve the problem of unemployment, currently as high
as 16 percent, according to Masoud Nili, deputy director of
economic affairs at the Plan and Budget Organization.
</P>
<P>
Briefing foreign ambassadors and representatives here on Iran's
third five-year plan, Nili said Iran needs an annual growth rate of
7.1 percent of investments to achieve the economic goal.
</P>
<P>
The government must realize the advantages for and set
regulations to facilitate foreign investments in Iran, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of Iran's costs in the program is estimated at
112 billion U.S. dollars, and the government has been allowed to
use 20 billion dollars from foreign credits, Mohammad Hussein
Adeli, deputy foreign minister in economic affairs, said on the
same occasion.
</P>
<P>
He considered developing non-oil exports and providing
investment security via introducing a framework with a legal
support as perspectives of Iran's new development plan.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, endorsed by the parliament and the
Council of Guardians recently, the total imports of Iran will be
112.4 billion dollars during the period.
</P>
<P>
The revenues derived from oil exports, non-oil exports and
services would reach 64.1 billion dollars, 34.8 billion dollars and
6.2 billion dollars respectively during the five-year period.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, UAE Discuss Opening Land Transport Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Officials from Iraq and the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) have held talks on opening up a land transport
line beside the already-existed sea route between the two
countries, a report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to greatly facilitate the bilateral trade
as well as trade among countries of the Gulf region, said Mohammad
Sabbar Al-Mosawi, general director of the Iraqi Land Transport
Company subordinate to the Iraqi Ministry of Transport and
Communication.
</P>
<P>
The issue was touched upon in a recent meeting between Al-Mosawi
and representatives from the Jawan Transport Company of the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Iraq and the UAE, within the framework
of the U.N. oil-for-food program, has reached 400 million U.S.
dollars, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. program, Iraq is allowed to sell a certain amount
of oil and use part of the revenues to import food, medicines and
other humanitarian goods for its people, who have been under
crippling U.N. sanctions ever since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In the coming weeks, the UAE is expected to reopen its embassy,
which has been closed since the 1991 Gulf War, in the Iraqi capital
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will also reopen its consulate in Dubai, the commercial
center of the UAE.
</P>
<P>
UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan has called for
lifting the trade embargo on Iraq, stressing the need to end the
sufferings of the Iraqi people and restore normal relations among
Arab nations.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Seeks for Political Solution to Internal Dispute, EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides said here Tuesday that the Cyprus government aims to
find a just and viable solution to the Cyprus issue and to work for
accession to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 17th meeting of the EU-Cyprus Joint
Parliamentary Committee, Kasoulides reiterated that the two
objectives are two parallel courses "which aim at strengthening
each other".
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting opened here Monday to mainly discuss the
political situation in Cyprus, current EU-Cyprus relations and
Cyprus' accession negotiations with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.N.-sponsored peace talks on the Cyprus issue,
Kasoulides criticized Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash for
expecting to have his preconditions met before engaging in serious
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has been asking for recognition of his breakaway state
in northern Cyprus, now recognized only by Turkey, and the
withdrawal of Cyprus' application for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The eastern Mediterranean island has remained divided into the
Turkish Cypriots-controlled north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the northern
third in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored indirect talks between the two
sides were held last December in New York and in February in
Geneva, and a third round is due to begin on May 23 in New York.
The talks were aimed at preparing the ground for substantive
negotiations which may bring the two communities together.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said that now is the time for serious negotiations to
pave the way for a final solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He assured the European parliamentarians attending the meeting
that the Cyprus government will always be positive and constructive
in the search of a solution.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of refusing Cyprus' EU entry would be a severe
blow to the effort for stability in the eastern Mediterranean,"

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Guerrilla Rockets Hit Israeli North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Several guerrilla rockets hit
settlements in northern Israel along the border with Lebanon, but
no casualties were reported yet, Israel Defense Forces officers
said Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 Russian-made Katyusha rockets were fired by Lebanese
Hezbollah guerrillas, who have been fighting to end Israeli
occupation in south Lebanon since early 1980s, but only three or
four of them landed at the entrance to two Jewish settlements in
western Galilee, the officers in Jerusalem revealed.
</P>
<P>
There were reports of damages to an electric company
transformer, while most communities' leaders worried that the
rocket attack will harm local tourism in the Jewish Passover
Holiday that begins Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
IDF officers said the army has not ordered local residents to
lock themselves into bomb shelters or their basements, and the
situation in the north is quiet. But they will watch out for any
further attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was reported that the condition of the IDF soldier
injured in the Israeli-occupied security zone in south Lebanon
earlier in the day is more serious than previously announced.
</P>
<P>
The soldier, who reportedly had sustained light injuries from an
Hezbollah anti-tank rocket, was diagnosed later as having a
fractured skull.
</P>
<P>
He was transferred to Haifa's Rambam Hospital, a hospital having
more advanced medical instruments than battleground aid stations,
for an emergency surgery.
</P>
<P>
However, his condition remains stable and his life is not at
risk, according to doctors in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, who had killed seven IDF soldiers and wounded dozens
since the beginning of this year, has claimed responsibility for
both incidents.
</P>
<P>
The group launched a series of attacks on IDF and Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army (SLA) outposts in the occupied buffer zone in
retaliation for Israeli artillery strikes earlier, which killed a
Syrian civilian worker and wounded his three colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The zone was set up by Israel in 1985 with a self-claimed aim to
protect its north from cross-border guerrilla attacks. However, the
fierce fighting of Hezbollah and other resistant militias had
forced Israel to seek an exit way from the zone.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israel's cabinet adopted a proposal submitted by
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to carry out withdrawal from the
zone to the international border by July, with or without a peace
deal with Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy also made the plan
internationally official after sending a letter to United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan regarding the pullback.
</P>
<P>
However, some strategy analysts had warned that Hezbollah, which
is backed by Syria and Iran, will not keep Israel's northern border
quiet in the case of a pullout without agreements.
</P>
<P>
Barak expressed his determination to retaliate any such attacks
in the future by saying several times in the past few weeks that he
does not recommend any sides to test Israel's strains on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, Israeli troops struck at suspected
Hezbollah targets and Lebanese civilian infrastructure sites in a
reprisal attacks, wounding at least two dozen civilians and
leading to a total damage cost at 200 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Blair Travels to N.Ireland, Trying to End Peace Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua)-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
is visiting Northern Ireland on Tuesday in an attempt to breathe
new life into the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from British and Irish governments have been
trying to work out a formula which would allow the re-
establishment of the political institutions in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
There is no suggestion Blair's visit will mark any major
breakthrough, but he will hold face-to-face discussions with
political leaders concerning the peace process in that region.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman said he would not take any "blueprint" that
the parties could use to help resolve the impasse between
unionists and republicans over the issues of paramilitary arms and
sharing power.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister wants to "take stock" of the current
difficult situation with the key players, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
This is Blair's first trip to Northern Ireland in nine months.
He will then travel to the Irish capital city of Dublin to meet
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said he expected Blair
demand assurances from republicans that there would be no return
to violence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster, he also said he wanted Blair to
persuade the Irish government to put pressure on Sinn Fein and the
IRA to fulfill their obligations under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Problems all come back to the same point, the absolute refusal
of republicans to recognize they too must change. This whole
prospect is about creating a new Northern Ireland, the old is
going to fade away," Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
"That means the old paramilitarism and old terrorism - we don't
want to see that in the future we want to construct," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's Mitchel McLaughlin said that if a breakthrough was
to be achieved over the suspension of the institutions, his party
would need to know that devolution was not "an experiment".
</P>
<P>
He said republicans needed to know it was not being implemented
for a "trial period, but is the real thing".
</P>
<P>
He said Sinn Fein would require in writing a "guarantee that
neither Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson nor any other
Secretary of State would ever again activate legislation
suspending the devolved institutions".

<HEADLINE> NASA And NCI Jointly Develop Microscopic Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Imagine ingesting a capsule
containing microscopic sensors to detect, diagnose and treat
disease inside the human body.
</P>
<P>
It sounds like fiction. However, NASA, in collaboration with
National Cancer Institute (NCI), is working to turn this vision
into "science fact."
</P>
<P>
NASA and National Cancer Institute have reached an agreement in
mid-April to develop new biomedical technologies that can detect,
diagnose and treat disease on Earth and in space.
</P>
<P>
The joint collaboration comes as NASA and NCI each move forward
with historic initiatives requiring major advances in available
technology.
</P>
<P>
NCI is attempting to define cancer for the first time based on
the unique molecular characteristics of tumors.
</P>
<P>
NASA is seeking to develop a new form of patient care - "
microscopic explorers" -- that would travel through the human body
looking for disease. This technology will allow NASA to monitor
astronaut health and treat conditions in space, where medical test
capabilities and communication with Earth will be limited.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- At least 500 gulls have been found
dead with evidence of poisoning since the weekend in St. John's,
Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
Dumped human food may have caused the sudden deaths of the
seabirds, local chief veterinarian Hugh Whitney said in his
initial report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them have human food in their mouths," such as bits
of hot dogs, potatoes, meat, peas and beans, he said after
examining the bodies of the dead birds.
</P>
<P>
"That seems to be the one common factor so far," he stated,
adding there are forensic clues for another incidence of botulism.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of ducks and shorebirds have died of avian
botulism at Whitewater Lake, Manitoba since 1996, with up to 117,
000 birds found dead in the year alone.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Wildlife Service is conducting a study to examine
the causes of avian botulism outbreaks.

LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Europe's leading stock markets
closed higher Tuesday, bolstered by signs of a continued rebound
in the Nasdaq composite index and despite concerns about the
region's inflation pressure.
</P>
<P>
London share prices have surged, fallen back and firmed again
in another turbulent day on the markets. The FTSE 100 rose 79.4
points, or 1.3 percent, to 6,074.
</P>
<P>
Worries over possible interest rate rises are continuing to
trouble investors, who are not convinced that the worst of the
falls has passed.
</P>

percent, which includes mortgage interest payments, was slightly
higher than economists had predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt edged up 9.35 points, or 0.1 percent,

The incident took place in a 14-story apartment building in
Lincoln Park, which is a suburb located directly south of Detroit
in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
Local officials confirmed two women were killed. A third victim
was in critical condition at Henry Ford Hospital with multiple
gunshot wounds, said hospital spokesman Jonh Lewandowski.
</P>
<P>
The gunman remained at large Tuesday afternoon as residents
were told to stay in their apartments. Police cordoned off an area
around the building.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted a witness as saying that the man had been
summoned to a meeting with apartment officials in an office
earlier on Tuesday to discuss complaints from other residents that
he behaved inappropriately, told off-color jokes and used foul
language.
</P>
<P>
"He was very upset, and was very upset with some of the ladies
who were complaining about him," the witness told a local
television station.
</P>
<P>
After leaving the meeting, the gunman returned to the office
with a rifle and gunned down two women, then searched and shot at
others before retreating to a tower where he was holding police at
bay, sometimes firing out of windows.
</P>
<P>
While police surrounded the area, ambulances lined up nearby.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Proposal to Relax Turtle Trade Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's request to relax the ban
on the turtle trade was rejected Tuesday at the 11th Conference
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.
</P>
<P>
Delegates at the 150-country conference voted down a proposal
allowing Cuba to sell 6,900 kg of hawksbill shells to japan in a
one-off auction.
</P>
<P>
Cuba needed a two-thirds majority but fell short with 66
nations voting in favour, 38 against and 15 abstained.
</P>
<P>
Cuba withdrew the request for an annual export quota of 500
hawksbill specimens in the face of strong opposition just before
the vote.
</P>
<P>
However, it is likely that cuba will ask for another vote at a
plenary session on Wednesday or Thursday since it failed
narrowly.
</P>
<P>
The trade ban in Hawksbill turtles in the Atlantic was imposed
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The Hawksbill shells are used for jewellery and ornaments and
hides are cured to make leather boots.
</P>
<P>
Hawksbills can weigh up to 60 kg in weight and their shells are
 patterned with streaks of amber, yellow and brown, making them
the most sought after among the world's seven species of marine
turtle.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is making a master
plan to promote water resources utilization and to improve
sanitation in the country, a senior official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water Resources is working out a water supply
and sanitation master plan framework estimated to cost 120
million birr (about 14.5 million U.S. dollars) since last
August, the national project's coordinator Woubishet Demeke told
a workshop on logical framework of the project.
</P>
<P>
The project, due to be finished within four years, is aimed at
 promoting sustainable resources utilization in the areas of
natural resources and environmental management in the country,
Woubishet said.
</P>
<P>
According to the coordinator, the government of Netherlands
finances 81 percent of the cost of the project and Ethiopia
covers the balance.
</P>
<P>
Currently only about 26 percent of the 62-million Ethiopian
population get access to clean water, Ethiopian Water Resources
Minister Shiferaw Jarso announced at the workshop.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Confesses to Assassination Attempt on Iranian Reformist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The principal suspect in the
abortive assassination against a prominent Iranian reformist and
close ally of President Mohammad Khatami has confessed to his
crime, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iran's First Deputy Chief of the Judiciary Hadi Marvi told the
agency in Bushehr in southern Iran that he had talked personally to
the main suspect, who has explicitly confessed to the murder
attempt.
</P>
<P>
"He (the suspect) explicitly confessed to having committed the
act and said he would tell the court the same thing," Marvi said,
without giving the name of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
He said that the suspect confessed "without being under any
pressure" to the assassination attempt against the life of Saeed
Hajjarian, which he would reveal to the court.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, vice chairman of the Tehran Municipal Council and a
senior advisor to President Khatami, was shot and seriously wounded
in front of the council's hall in downtown Tehran on March 12.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that, Saeed Askar, a chemistry student, shot
Hajjarian and is the principal accused in the assassination case.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, a former deputy intelligence minister, has recovered
his consciousness following a long coma.
</P>
<P>
The assassination triggered a hot power struggle between the
powerful conservatives, who dominate most of the country's
sensitive organs, and reformists, the main supporters of the reform
programs of President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The reformist councilor was believed to be a main architect of
the reformists' landslide victory in February's key parliamentary
polling, a result which humiliated the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The reformists and conservatives have accused each other of
having a hand in the assassination attempt, particularly after the
arrest of another Tehran Municipal Council member Ahmad Hakimipour
on Friday in connection with the assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
Hakimipour became a suspect in the assassination case because a
letter handed over to Hajjarian, which prepared the ground for the
assassination attempt, was signed by Hakimipour.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives urged authorities concerned to find out the
relations between the suspects and Hakimipour as well as possible
links with the serial political killings in the country during the
recent two years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the reformists claimed that bringing Hakimipour's
letter to the assassination scene was a well-designed plot by
certain people against the reformists.
</P>
<P>
The reformist-dominated city council on Monday lodged a strong
protest against Hakimipour's arrest and said that "the agents of
threat who are known to the public are free" while Hakimipour who
rushed Hajjarian to hospital has been arrested.

<HEADLINE> Assad Has Strong Desire to Establish Peace: Canadian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien said here Tuesday Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
wanted to carry on the Middle East peace process to the end and had
a strong desire to establish peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Winding up his two-day visit to Syria, Chretien told reporters
at the Damascus International Airport Tuesday afternoon after his
talks with Assad that Assad briefed him on Syria's stance towards
the peace process and the talks were very good.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the dispute between Syria and Israel over Lake
Tiberias, the Canadian leader said the Syrian position was made
clear to the public and "this issue should be solved through
negotiations with Israel."
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks were snagged since January partly
due to the dispute as Israel claims full sovereignty over the lake
while Syria wants to restore its sovereignty over the northeastern
coast according to the border lines of June 4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
However, there are some proposals to launch joint tourist
projects on the coasts of the lake between the two countries or
declare it a nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said both Canada and Syria are for Israel's withdrawal
from the Golan Heights which Israel seized from Syria in 1967 and
south Lebanon where Israel maintains an occupation zone with the
claim to protect its north.
</P>
<P>
His talks with Assad also dealt with the issues of Palestinian
refugees and Canada's participation in the Untied Nations truce-
monitoring mission in the Golan area, Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
There are 11 Canadians in the 190-strong mission.
</P>
<P>
The talks also touched on bilateral ties, especially on boosting
trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Canadian trade volume stood at just 23.4 million U.S.
dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the results of his tour in the region, which had
taken him to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Egypt,
Lebanon, Jordan, Chretien said "In all my stops in the region I
found a genuine desire to establish a permanent peace and
stability."
</P>
<P>
"This reflects the common interests of all concerned parties.
Thereby, the parties should find the way for peace and we encourage
them to do so," the Canadian leader added, noting that peace was
very important for the economic and social development of the
region.
</P>
<P>
The world is heading for globalization and every country should
concentrate on investment in the fields of science and technology
in order to assume the best position in "the global village," he
pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Iranians Protest Cancellation of Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A group of residents blocked a main
road in southern Iran on Tuesday to protest the nullification of
parliamentary election results in certain constituencies by the
conservative Guardians Council (GC).
</P>
<P>
The protesters blocked the main road linking important cities of
Shiraz in Fars province and Bandar Abbas in Hormogan province,
forcing vehicles to change their way, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The angry people, mainly from the Saravan Kovar and Kharameh
constituency of Fars Province, staged the protest following the GC
cancelled the election result in the constituency with no sound
reasons, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The protestors also gathered in front of the district governor's
office and chanted slogans to voice their opposition to the
nullification of the election tally.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the protestors also damaged some public
buildings and facilities in the provincial town of Sarvestan.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been clouded by political tension since reformers
allied to President Mohammed Khatami won an overwhelming victory in
the sixth parliamentary election in February, ending a long-time
conservative majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The powerful conservatives, unwilling to accept the humiliating
defeat, have taken strong measures to counter the reformist
campaign, including summoning reformist journalists to courts and
overturning by force part of the election results.
</P>
<P>
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the elite Islamic
Revolutionary Guards have also warned against American-style
reforms in the country, even hinting that "violent" measures may be
taken to safeguard the Islamic order in the country.
</P>
<P>
As a watchdog on elections, the GC has so far announced the
invalidity of elections in a number of constituencies around the
country. In some cases, it even directly transferred the victories
of reformers to conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The measure has stirred up a series of protests recently,
including some violent ones which resulted in the arrest of scores
of people by the police.
</P>
<P>
The council on Monday also announced that the votes of six
candidates in Tehran Province will be recounted due to certain
complaints.
</P>
<P>
The six candidates ranked from the 28th to the 33rd in the first
round of election in the constituency, which has 30 seats. Former
president Hashemi Rafsanjani, supported by the conservatives,
ranked the 30th as the last winner in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Since the election was held on February 18, the announcement of
the final results has been delayed again and again, with several
recounting of votes.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Majlis Passes Hard-line Amendment to Press Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran's outgoing conservative Majlis
(parliament) on Tuesday passed a hard-line amendment to the press
law, imposing more restrictions on the country's freedom-seeking
press.
</P>
<P>
The newly-approved amendment sets more strict conditions for
authorities to grant licenses to publications and instructs the
Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance to investigate any
complaints against the press.
</P>
<P>
It also authorizes public courts, Islamic revolutionary courts
and other judicial bodies to hold open trials on press violations
with the presence of a press jury, which will be formed by 21
members in Tehran and by 14 members in the other provincial capital
cities.
</P>
<P>
The amendment, which will become a legislation only after the
approval of the conservative Guardians Council, also bans any new
publications to replace the closed ones or use the symbols or
similar frames of the closed ones, the conservative evening paper
Kayhan reported.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the outlines of the amendment last July
triggered a political disturbance with serious street clashes
between students and anti-riot police, the worst since the 1979
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Iran's moderate Minister of Culture and the Islamic Guidance
Ataollah Mohajerani said in a reaction that the amendment to the
press law contradicts the constitution of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We should wait and see, what the Guardians Council will say
when the body examines whether or not the legislation is in
conformity with the constitution," the Islamic Republic News Agency
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservative Majlis Speaker Nateq Nouri said the
amendment has removed ambiguities in the press law to some extent
and he favors the removal of all ambiguities in order to prevent
any possible conflict among related organs.
</P>
<P>
The amendment was approved amid mounting pressure on the pro-
reform newspapers and journalists, only one month before the
conservatives hand over the powerful Majlis to the reformists who
won an overwhelming victory in the February parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
In the past one month, at least four managing directors of
reformist newspapers have been summoned to the conservative courts
and a number of journalists and writers have been interrogated.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani said last week his ministry is determined to defend
the press freedom and will propose a bill to the new reformist
Majlis to revise the press law annulling the right of any state
organs to revoke the licenses of any newspapers.
</P>
<P>
He said the reformists will amend the press law in favor of the
media in the new parliament.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Authorities Urged to Rescue Cuban Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) TV show, Dr.
Irwin Redlener said a home video about Elian released by the
relatives last week looks "exactly like we might see in a hostage
situation."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the U.S. Immigration Naturalization Service (INS)
released a letter by Redlener, saying that Elian is now "in a
state of imminent danger to his physical and emotional well-being
in a home that I consider to be psychologically abusive."
</P>
<P>
The letter, addressed to Attorney General Janet Reno and INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner, said that the six-year-old boy was
being "horrendously exploited" and "needs to be rescued."
</P>
<P>
Redlener, professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine in New York City, told NBC that he was
particularly disturbed by the videotape the relatives made of the
boy.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Miami relatives defied a deadline by the
government to surrender Elian and filed an emergency asylum for
the boy to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta,
which has not made a ruling.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department asked the court to lift a temporary order
that bars Elian's removal from the United States and to order
Lazaro Gonzalez to release the boy. Such a ruling could allow the
government to take immediate action.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued near a shipwreck in the Atlantic sea off
Florida on November 25 last year and was sent to his Miami
relatives who has been taking custody of the boy ever since then.
</P>
<P>
The INS ruled that Elian belongs to his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, while the Miami relatives insist the boy should stay
with them in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Kuchma, Putin Discuss Gas, Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Putin, on his first overseas trip since he won the March 26
presidential elections, said the two neighboring countries should
strengthen their strategic partnership, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that cooperation in economy, security and the
humanitarian area was of particular importance.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed cooperation in arms trading
enterprises and the joint manufacture and sales of An-70 jet
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
They also addressed ways of coordinating their short-term and
long-term energy policies and Ukraine's gas debts to Russian
natural gas giant Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
Together with penalties and interest, Ukraine now owes Gazprom
2.1 billion dollars for gas, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma and Putin ordered the chiefs of the intergovernmental
commission to come up with proposals before May on how to solve
bilateral problems, especially those related to the gas debt.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to keep permanent personal contacts in an
effort to solve the outstanding issues, Kuchma told reporters
following enlarged negotiations, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kuchma pledged to take immediate and "tough
measures" to prevent the re-export of Russian gas exported to
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted Gazprom Chief Executive Rem Vyakhirev as saying
earlier that Ukraine had stolen 7.1 billion cubic meters of
Russian gas.
</P>
<P>
Following their meeting in Kiev, Kuchma and Putin flew to the
Black Sea port of Sevastopol aboard the Ukrainian president's
private aircraft.
</P>
<P>
They continued their working discussions aboard the plane
during the flight, Interfax reported, quoting Kuchma's press
secretary, Alexander Martynenko.
</P>
<P>
According to their schedule, Kuchma and Putin will lay wreaths
at the monument to the defenders of Sevastopol and board the
Ukrainian Navy cruiser "Getman Sagaidachny" and the Russian Black
Sea Fleet cruiser "Moskva."
</P>
<P>
While in Sevastopol, Putin reiterated Moscow's staunch
opposition to NATO eastward expansion that could incorporate
former Soviet republics and push its borders closer to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is dictated by our national interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin, who visited Belarus and Britain prior to his arrival in
Ukraine, will leave for Moscow Tuesday evening and Kuchma will
return to Kiev, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Increased Capital, Technology Transfer for Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 18(Xinhua) -- China on Tuesday stressed
that the developed countries, as the main beneficiaries of
economic globalization, should truly adopt measures to increase
capital, technological transfers and open up markets to developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Third High-Level Meeting of the U.N. Economic
and Social Council(ECOSOC) And the Bretton Woods Institutions,
Xiao Gang, Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, said
economic globalization in the 1990s was a process in which
favorable opportunities and difficult challenges coexisted, and
globalization must adhere to the principles of equality, mutual
benefit and shared prosperity as their purpose.
</P>
<P>
Yet the developed countries currently have a "double standard"
when it comes to opening up markets, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, they request that the markets in which
developed countries have an advantage be opened. on the other hand,
they practice protectionism in the case of their own markets that
lack a comparative advantage," Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
"This approach not only harms the interests of developing
countries, but is also detrimental to global development, peace
and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the past ten or so years, the trend towards economic
globalization has intensified, but the developing countries' share
of world GDP and world trade volume has in fact undergone a
continual decline, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the financial crisis has caused the economies of
many countries to undergo serious reversals, and at the same time
that international society has promoted the free flow of capital,
it has neglected monitoring and regulating short-term capital flow,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The industrialized nations are very concerned with the free
flow of commodities and capital, but they have not paid serious
attention to the free flow and dissemination of labor and
technology, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
If the situation described above does not change, the process
of economic globalization will be the process whereby developing
countries are marginalized.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of Bretton Woods with ECOSOC, in 1998, tool
place against the backdrop of worldwide financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Last year's meeting addressed the functioning of international
financial market and prospects for the availability of sufficient
resources for global development needs.

<HEADLINE> Romania Discovers Largest Gold Deposits in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The geological and exploration
studies performed in Rosia Montana-Bucium area of western Romania
made obvious the existence of some resources of eight million gold
ounces, the largest gold deposits ever discovered in Europe, the
Gabriel Resources Ltd. Company's president Frank Timis announced
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Drilling-exploration studies in Rosia Montana-Bucium area were
performed by Rosia Montana Gold Corporation joint venture and were
worth 20 million U.S. dollars. They were followed by a re-
feasibility study achieved by an American company.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Agency for Mineral Resources'
president Mihail Ianas, the feasibility study has to be concluded
until the end of the year. If it is going to be a positive one,
the project for the exploitation of the deposits must be prepared
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"If the project receives the okay from the government, the
construction will start in 2001 and the production will start in 2-
3 years", Ianas said, adding that the investment would be a huge
one,worth over 250 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
For Romania's government, this investment is very important not
only because it might bring 200 million U.S. dollars but also for
the fact it will eliminate the subsidies and will create new jobs,
according to the Trade and Industry Ministry's state secretary Ion
Roman.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of this project in Rosia Montana area
requires the construction of all facilities of a modern
infrastructure at the standards imposed by the EU and the World
Bank.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Have Most Performing Weather Survey System in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Romania, in 30 months at the
latest, will benefit from one of the most performing weather
survey systems the world over, the official Rompres news agency
Tuesday quoted the Director of the National Meteorology and
Hydrology Institute Ioan Sandu as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Romanian authorities signed on Monday a
contract with the America-based Lockheed Martin Overseas
Corporation, for putting in place the National Integrated
Meteorological System.
</P>
<P>
"It's the first European country benefiting from such a system,
"Ioan Sandu said, adding that five Doppler radars in S band will
be bought as well as a radar for wind detection, 5 lightning
stations for the aviation protection, a high performance computer,
50 automated weather forecasting stations, more than 75 working
station for information viewing and 10 weather stations for
forecasts concerning the Danube and the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
The contract is worth 55 million U.S. dollars, a loan re-
payable in 10 years, with a grace period of 30 months. "A
condition in the contract says that in the 30 months the system
has to turn operational. The loan has governmental guarantees,"
Ioan sandu added.
</P>
<P>
The buying of this equipment and its introduction into the
Integrated Meteorological System allows for the place and the
moment to be anticipated when floods, strong winds causing
disasters take place, as well as hail storms, ice, fog, thunder
storms, air turbulence, forest and technological fires, air
pollution dispersion.
</P>
<P>
"When we have this system, nobody can say any longer that
people have not been warned. The system will be the most
performing in Europe, it will be compatible with NATO's and the
World Meteorological Organization's. As a matter of fact the
system covers all the Balkans and we shall supply weather
information to Yugoslavia, Greece, Bulgaria,'' the director
concluded.

<HEADLINE> EU Draws Up New Financial Assistance Programs for Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
drawn up recently two new financial assistance programs for
Romania and nine other candidate countries, the official Rompres
news agency Tuesday quoted the EU representative here as saying.
</P>
<P>
One of these is the ISPA program worth one billion euros for
pre-accession structural policies. Romania will benefit up to 26
percent of the available funds to be used for transport and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
According to EU statistics, it will take Romania between 11 and
17 billion euros to upgrade its transport infrastructure to EU
standards and 20 billion euros to bring the environment in line
with EU regulations. EU will contribute about 75 percent of the
program costs for these fields, while the remaining will be borne
by Romania.
</P>
<P>
Prioritized under the ISPA program will be the finalization of
three European transport corridors to link Romania with the
Western countries. This year, two road rehabilitation and up-
grading projects as well as a railway project are proposed to be
unfolded.
</P>
<P>
They will concern the Bucharest-Giurgiu road, the Bucharest-
Constanta road and the railway road from Bucharest to Giurgiu.
Upgrading works on the Craiova-Lugoj-Timisoara road as well as
construction works on belt roads around Pitesti, Sebes, Deva,Alba
Iulia and Sibiu are also planned to be performed under the same
program next year.
</P>
<P>
Three priorities under the ISPA environmental headings will be
water supply, air pollution and waste treatment.
</P>
<P>
The second program - SAPARD, worth 500 million euros, will be
aimed at agriculture and rural development. Romania is planned to
receive 30 percent of the amount.
</P>
<P>
European financiers have identified four field all concerning
the private farming sector, among which the development of private
farms and farm processing units and agro-tourism. In order to
ensure a viable character of the projects under this program,
important funds will be allotted for the improvement of rural
telecommunications, power and water supply as PHARE program stands
at 240 million euros. All the funds will be used for the
harmonization of Romanian legislature with the European one, the
intaking of the EU aquis communautaire, as well as for regional
development and infrastructure investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) - Salvaging Britain's crisis-hit
transport system will cost more than 200 billion pounds over the
next ten years, according to the Confederation of British Industry
(CBI).
</P>
<P>
The CBI's National Council, the ruling body of members,Tuesday
agreed overall transport spending proposals. It calculated its
figures by costing the measures needed to achieve the government's
best-case projections for reducing congestion over the period to
2010.
</P>
<P>
The total includes 25 billion pounds on trunk roads and
motorways, 79 billion pounds on local transport, 62 billion pounds
on rail, 9 billion pounds on aviation, 3 billion pounds on ports
and waterways, and 2 billion pounds on research into technology.
</P>
<P>
Digby Jones, CBI Director-General, said: "After years of under-
investment and delayed projects, the present transport system is
failing business and society. That is damaging to wealth creation,
social inclusion and employment."
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time for the government to turn words into action
by making tough spending and funding choices. That is the only way
to tackle the poor services, overcrowding,unacceptable congestion
and concerns about safety," he added.

JOHANNESBURG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's headline
inflation rate for March this year increased to 3.4 percent
year-on-year, up from February's 2. 4 percent, official statistics
released on Tuesday showed.  The increased rate -- the annual
rate of change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for metropolitan
areas -- was mainly due to annual increases in transport
(especially a 27.9 percent rise in the petrol price over the year)
, food, medical care and household operation, Statistics South
Africa said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"These were partially offset by the large decrease in mortgage
interest rates over the 12-month period. The average interest rate
on home loans dropped from 21 percent to 14.5 percent in the last
12 months," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for metropolitan and other areas in March

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Pledges to Resolve land Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said on Tuesday that his government was determined to resolve the
land issue once and for all.
</P>
<P>
In his national address to mark 20 years of independence,
Mugabe said the issue of land was the last colonial question
heavily qualifying the sovereignty of the people of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said he could understand the frustration of the war veterans
and the pressures faced by white commercial farmers which was
emanating from the unwillingness of the British government to
honor its commitment to land reform and the resistance to the land
clause in the rejected draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
"Two weeks ago I met with British Foreign Secretary who
suggested Zimbabwe sends a delegation to the United Kingdom to
re-open negotiations on land reforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Zimbabweans to desist from engaging in fist fights
because this had been called for to remove the white colonialists
which they had successfully achieved.
</P>
<P>
"We called for those with strong fists to join us in the war
and we succeeded in removing white rule, but now it is time to
take care of ourselves, to build Great Zimbabwe's collapsing walls
and to work hard in peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the past 20 years had seen enormous developmental
changes that had touched practically every life with dramatic and
unmatched stride being made in education at all levels.
</P>
<P>
He said in education from 2,401 primary schools with a combined
 enrolment of 82,000, there were now over 4,500 with a combined
enrolment in excess of 2.3 million pupils while secondary schools
had grown from 177 with 66,215 pupils to 1,548 catering for over
700,000 pupils.
</P>
<P>
He said literacy levels grew from 62 percent at independence to
82 percent the best on the continent while 456 health centres, 612
rural hospitals, 25 district hospitals as well as one provincial
hospital in all eight provinces had been upgraded or built.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, the enormous progress we have been making over
the years have been reversed by the growing HIV/AIDS menace, but a
lot is happening by way of raising awareness," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the economy, he said more needed to be done because gains
had been both lean and erratic.
</P>
<P>
He said economic growth had been marginal and unemployment had
risen accounting for current hardships.
</P>
<P>
He added that interest and inflation rates had made life
difficult for many people while export performance had been dismal
and made worse by the depressed nature of prices of those
commodities that trade in on the international market.
</P>
<P>
To this end Mugabe said the government had initiated the
Millennium Economic Recovery Program which was seeking to
consolidate fiscal reform, accelerate public enterprise reforms,
stabilize prices at lower levels, stabilize the value of the
Zimbabwean dollar and resolve the foreign currency shortage.
</P>
<P>
He said this year's national independence celebrations had been
 cancelled because the resources that were going to be used in the
 celebrations had been channeled to assisting the victims of the
Cyclone Eline.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Not to Intervene in Zimbabwe's Land Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Jacob Zuma on Tuesday shrugged off opposition calls for
a tough stance towards Zimbabwe in the wake of violence over land
issue.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking amid reports that a second Zimbabwean farmer
was shot dead on his farm by war veterans who have occupied
white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we accept that matters must be resolved through
violence. We hold a view that conflicts must be resolved amicably
and peacefully," Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will not be able to play a responsible role in the
region " if it is going to stand up whenever there is something
and condemn everybody", he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are running a country, we are running relations with
countries around us. We can't be standing and condemning everybody
when in fact you are not informed about the issues. If you do so
you are reducing the scope of your own involvement," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zuma added South Africa has to look at the issue more broadly
rather than just "to stand and condemn".

HARARE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Students
Union on Tuesday strongly condemned the rising political violence
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We implore Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri to move fast
in combating politically motivated violence," Information

</P>
<P>
He urged opposition leaders and those of the ruling Zanu-pf

"We also implore Zimbabwe's human rights watch-dog, Zimrights,

Zimbabwe has seen increased incidents of politically motivated
violence in the run-up to parliamentary elections with many people

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Stresses Need for North-South Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- At the just concluded first-ever
South Summit of the G-77, Bangladesh stressed the need for North-
South cooperation and held the view that the North should help the
South "equitably share the benefits of globalization," said
Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen at the Conference Room of the Foreign Ministry,
Azad said that at the Plenary of the Summit which was held in
Havana from April 10 to 14, he presented the statement of the
Bangladeshi government, saying that globalization presents
opportunities and challenges to the countries of the South.
</P>
<P>
"Our objectives should be to regulate the forces of
globalization in a manner that will permit each country to develop
through participation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the role of the Bangladesh delegation, the
foreign minister said that as coordinator of the Least Developed
Countries (LDCs), Bangladesh was required to play an important
role in projecting the LDC interests.
</P>
<P>
According to Azad, at the initiative of Bangladesh, a very
important paragraph on the LDCs was included in the declaration,
which highlighted the eradication of poverty, equitable
implementation of the World Trade Organization Agreements, free
access to LDC exports in the world markets and debt cancellation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the next NAM Summit to be held in Dhaka in 2001,
Azad said it would be "a historic one with the movement making a
significant leap forward in securing its position at the
international level."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Drop Sharply in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. housing starts dropped 11.
2 percent in March, the biggest plunge in six years, suggesting
that rising mortgage rates are cutting into demand, the government
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that builders began work on new
homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.60 million units
last month. The 11.2 percent drop was the steepest since a 17
percent decline posted in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The March performance was much weaker than the 3.9 percent
decline many analysts were anticipating.
</P>
<P>
In February, builders began work on 1.80 million units, a 3.6
percent increase, stronger than the government previously
estimated.
</P>
<P>
In March, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate
mortgage was 8.24 percent compared with an average 7.04 percent
for the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Housing starts took the biggest dive in the Midwest, falling 31.
9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 320,000. In the
Northeast, starts fell by 18 percent to a rate of 159,000. In the
West, starts dropped by 4.5 percent to a rate of 379,000. Housing
starts held steady at a rate of 746,000 in the South.
</P>
<P>
Starts of apartments, condos and other multifamily housing
dropped by 41 percent to a rate of 295,000 in March, following a
30.5 percent rise the month before. But starts of single-family
homes rose 0.2 percent to a rate of 1.30 million after a nearly 4
percent drop in February.
</P>
<P>
New building permits, a sign of future construction activity,
declined by 4.5 percent in March to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.58 million, following a 6.7 percent drop the month
before.
</P>
<P>
Housing construction has been an engine of the booming U.S.
economy and even with higher interest rates, activity has remained
at healthy levels.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF:Education Efforts in 21st Century Must Give Priority to Excluded Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on Tuesday that the world's failure
to achieve education for all can no longer be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Carol Bellamy, UNICEF's Executive Director, made the statement
ahead of the World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, April 26-28,
the biggest global meeting on education in a decade.
</P>
<P>
"As we enter the third millennium, more than 110 million
children, almost two-thirds of them girls, are excluded from
schooling," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"Given that we now have a global economy of 30 trillion U.S.
dollars, this is indefensible," she said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy urged that five key areas be embraced by the 1,000
representatives of governments, funding agencies, and education
and civil society organizations who will agree a framework for
action at the Dakar Forum: enrich early development and learning,
reach excluded children, enhance girl's education, improve the
quality of education and restore education in conditions of crisis
and emergency.
</P>
<P>
"If I had only one wish for Dakar, girls' education would
become the global action priority of the coming decade. Investment
in the education of girls is the foundation of equality between
men and women, boys and girls," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
The Dakar meeting is a follow-up to the World Conference on
Education for All held in Jomtien, Thailand, in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Forces to Be Cut below 60,000 People, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian forces will soon be
trimmed down to 59,000 personnel, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing the new Department of National Defense planning document,
the newspaper said the forces will be reduced by about 1,000
people, including 28 warrant and chief warrant officers, 48
captains and majors and nine colonels and lieutenant colonels.
</P>
<P>
The number of brigadier and major generals remains at a total
of 61, with one position of lieutenant general expected to be
eliminated to reduce the number of that rank to nine, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Defense Department spokesman Navy Lieut. Ken MacKillop was
quoted as saying the drop to 59,000 is expected to be reached this
year, not in 2002 as suggested in the document.
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that there is not enough money to modernize
and to keep the forces at the 60,000 level, which was set in the
country's 1994 defense White Paper, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The federal government announced last month that the Canadian
forces would receive 1.5 billion Canadian dollars (about 1.1
billion U.S. dollars) extra over a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
The money is in the main earmarked for upgrading and purchasing
equipment, training, quality-of-life initiatives and the
continuing cost of Kosovo, the newspaper said.

items in leading U.S. newspapers on Tuesday.

<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- After three months of furious preparations by police and
protesters for what many in Washington had feared might be a
Seattle-style, tear gas-drenched battle over global capitalism,
demonstrations wound down in relative peace on Monday with a
negotiated climax involving voluntary arrests.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The world's top financial officials, trying to show
sensitivity to poverty as protesters braved a chilling rain and an
impenetrable police force outside, pledged to pay more attention
to globalization's victims and to commit "unlimited money" to
fight AIDS in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Stocks bounced back, shrugging off fears of another Black
Monday and driving the Nasdaq composite to its second-biggest
percentage gain ever. Asian markets, however, suffered some of
their worst one-day losses, with the region's high-tech shares hit
hardest. European markets closed with relatively minor damage. The
Nasdaq soared 217.87 points, or 6.56%, to 3539.16, while the Dow
Jones industrials rose 276.74 to 10582.51.
</P>
<P>
-- Vladimir Putin pledged on his first visit to the West as
Russian president-elect that Moscow would seek friendlier ties
with Europe despite differences over Chechnya. Speaking at a news
conference in London with Blair, the Russian leader promised to
implement economic reforms and root out corruption.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Benefit From Environmental Projects (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Qingneng, a farmer from east
China's Jiangxi Province, can not help laughing every time he
talks about an ecological project which has brought him a lot of
money and greatly improved the environment in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, head of the Chang'an Horticulture Farm in Xinfeng County,
owns a 66.67-hectare orchard, a fish pond with a water area of 13.
33 hectares, and a pig farm with over 1,400 pigs.
</P>
<P>
Zhu explains that he uses the swine waste for generating
methane, and then the waste residue from the methane pits is
planted under fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
This ecological project has been expanded in an area of over 50
kilometers this year, which produces 10 million yuan (1.2 million
U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
Yang Shidi, deputy chief of the Jiangxi Provincial Agriculture
Bureau, said that at present more than 600,000 rural families in
the province have built methane pits, saving over 200,000 hectares
of fuel forest and 88 million U.S. dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
Another project designated to comprehensively harness the
province's mountains, rivers and lakes also results in good
ecological and economic returns. Sixteen countries and
international organizations have shown great interest in the
project and have visited Jiangxi.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's to Open Branch in China's Most Populous Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- US fast food giant McDonald's
has signed a contract with the Zhengzhou Friendship Commercial
Group Corp. worth five million U.S. dollars during the just-ended
Henan trade fair, planning to set up over 30 Mcdonald's
restaurants in China's most populous province.
</P>
<P>
Herbert Wong, purchasing director with McDonald's (China) Co.
Ltd., said though there is an economic gap between Henan and the
eastern provinces. They are substantial economic returns in the
business expansion in the province. The first McDonald's
restaurant in Zhengzhou is expected to open in July.
</P>
<P>
McDonald's has opened 25,000 restaurants in 119 countries and
regions since the first restaurant opened in the United States in
1955. There are 257 McDonald's restaurants in 17 provinces and
municipalities in China.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jichen, president of the Zhengzhou Friendship Commercial (
Group) Corp., said he hopes that cooperation with McDonald's will
bring mutual benefit to both parties. The Group has so far opened
over 30 department stores in Zhengzhou.
</P>
<P>
Henan has a population of some 93 million. Its GDP was 456.5
billion yuan (about 54.78 billion U.S. dollars) last year, ranking
fifth in China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Benefit From Environmental Projects (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As early as 1984, the State Council made a decision to develop
ecological agriculture in China. In 1999, the State Council vowed
to put an end to the deteriorating ecological system within 50
years.
</P>
<P>
China plans to expand the ecological pilot zones to many cities
and counties in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yaobang, minister of agriculture, said that to support the
development of the country's western region, his ministry will
select one or two counties from each province in the western
region for implementing ecological agricultural projects.
</P>
<P>
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2001-2005) period, the
Ministry of Agriculture will launch a program in 150 counties in
the western region.
</P>
<P>
Many other provinces in China have joined in the efforts to
develop ecological agriculture. Hainan, the country's largest
special economic zone, announced recently that it will turn itself
into an ecological agricultural giant in China.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that ecological agriculture plays a very
important role in reforming China's traditional agriculture and
speed up China's access into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Given that organic food products are popular in developed
countries and the coastal areas of the country, the province is
spending more efforts in developing ecological agriculture and
some 100 varieties of organic food products.
</P>
<P>
The Dazhangshan Mountain organic tea produced in Maoyuan County
has accounted for 60 percent of the organic tea market in the
European Union, earning 2.5 million U.S. dollars in foreign
exchange annually.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Insurer Praises China's New Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China has made progress in its
regulatory system of the insurance industry by issuing new
regulations on branches of foreign insurers in China, said Ian
Lancaster, senior Vice President of Chubb Group of Insurance
Companies.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference at Chubb's Beijing office today
that the new regulations conform with international practices.
This demonstrates that China is introducing laws and regulations
according to the agreement that the United States and China
reached on China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
As the executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
in China, Lancaster flew to Washington with other U.S. businessmen
to lobby for granting China normal trade relations last week. "I
am very optimistic about that China will live up to its
obligations under the WTO," said Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's accession to the WTO will have a win-win
outcome for both the U.S. and China. He also gave high marks to
the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) and other
relevant authorities for introducing international-standard laws
and regulations and building an insurance industry in accordance
with international practice.
</P>
<P>
According to Lancaster, the CIRC has already approved Federal
Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Chubb, to set up its China General
Representative Office in Shanghai. Lancaster will be in charge of
the Office.

over two trillion US dollars in the next ten years, said Li
Rongrong, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission,
here today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> NASDAQ Official Says Fluctuations Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- An NASDAQ official said here
today that recent NASDAQ Index fluctuations are normal and that it
doesn't mean bubble blowing for new and high technological shares.
</P>
<P>
Harry H. Huang, NASDAQ chief representative to China, told a
news conference on international fund-polling that the NASDAQ
Index had dropped by 25 percent last week, compared with last year
's 85.6 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
He attributed NASDAQ's development mainly to its adaptation to
new economies and its new criteria and policies for new economies
to be listed on stock markets.
</P>
<P>
"Whether it goes up or down, we call it a normal process,"
Huang said. On Monday, the NASDAQ Index began to bounce back, up 6.
6 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Our predicted index bottom line is around 3,200 points, and by
year end, it will probably climb to 4,000 or 4,300 points," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Huang said he couldn't see any impact of NASDAQ Index drops on
businesses. If any, it would be man-made factors that have nothing
to do with market.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. will be listed,
aiming to poll more fund to build up the NASDAQ global market
network.
</P>
<P>
Any enterprise that is listed on U.S. stock markets only covers
one third of global economic activities. NASDAQ opened NASDAQ
Japan, Hong Kong, and Europe to link world markets for the benefit
of listed companies, investment banks and investors, he said.

BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Municipal departments
today donated 105 computers to middle and primary schools in rural
areas outside of Beijing for computer classes as part of a
civility project.
</P>
<P>
Vice-premier Li Lanqing has written a letter to Beijing, in

</P>
<P>
Computer education in middle and primary schools is very
important at a time when the hi-tech industry is developing
rapidly, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not practical to wholly rely on the state to provide
computers for schools as China has a huge number of students.
Members of society can also donate computers to rural areas," the
vice-premier said, calling on other localities to do the same as
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The project was advocated by Li himself, and met with positive
response across the country. Beijing has received more than 2,000
donated computers for 17 computer classes it has set up.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- To strive for the development of
China's agriculture when the country joins the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the top legislature is taking radical measures
to adjust its laws on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"The National People's Congress and its Standing Committee
shall step up its legislation on agriculture, formulate, revise or
abolish outdated laws as soon as possible," said Gao Dezhan,
chairman of the NPC sub-committee on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Gao was addressing a two-day NPC meeting on agricultural
legislation, which opened today and attended by officials from
both national and local legislatures.
</P>
<P>
"Existing laws provide too much red tape that violates rules of
the market economic development," Gao said, adding that "Moreover,
as China is going to face greater challenges in agricultural
development when it joins the WTO, our existing legal system on
agriculture lags far behind the rural economic reform."
</P>
<P>
The NPC subcommittee on agriculture is busy studying what makes
a comprehensive legal system on agriculture, Gao said, adding that
"China's farming industry will not only face market risks, but
also risks from the ever changing nature and climate."

insurance, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has launched a pilot scheme to replace various fees on
farmers with nationally unified taxes in a bid to ease economic
burdens.
</P>
<P>
Gao said legislators should draw experience from the trial
reforms to formulate laws on reducing exorbitant burdens on
farmers by local governments and better protect their legitimate
rights.
</P>
<P>
He proposed to make laws on the reasonable exploitation of
water resources, protection of forestry and prevention of
desertification to ensure sustainable economic development in
rural areas, especially in the country's vast western region.
</P>
<P>
More laws should also be worked out in restructuring
agricultural production and governing various market entities in
rural areas such as the cooperative farms and share-holding rural
industries.
</P>
<P>
Local legislators and legal experts said at today's meeting
that legislation should be implemented as soon as possible, with
soliciting public opinion to ensure a sound development of China's
rural economy in the next century.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economy Improving, But Domestic Demand Still Weak: Lawmakers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Financial and Economic
Committee of the National People's Congress said today that the
Chinese economy is showing obvious signs of improving in the first
quarter this year, but the problem of insufficient domestic demand
remains.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the State Development and Planning Commission,
State Economic and Trade Commission, Finance Ministry, the central
bank and the State Statistics Bureau have reported on China's
current economic situation to the Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter this year, gross domestic product growth
reached 8.1 percent compared with the same period last year, and
industries achieved added value totaling 501.2 billion yuan (60.4
billion dollars), up 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
China's fixed asset investment surged a year-on-year by 8.5
percent to 223.5 billion yuan (27 billion US dollars), and 123.5
billion yuan has gone to infrastructure projects. Some 37.7
billion yuan has been directed to technical upgrading, a 12.6
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade increased with import up 39.1 and exports
up by 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a news release, the NPC committee said these positive
economic signs have paved the way for the realization of a 7
percent economic growth in 2000.

However, there are still problems, the committee members said.
For example, the 8.5 percent growth of fixed asset investment in
the first three months was far from adequate to meet the ten
percent goal for 2000.
</P>
<P>
Currency issue was down by 1.7 percent, which will curb the
growth of market demand this year. Production capacity in some
sectors still greatly exceeds market demand.
</P>
<P>
The members held that the role of treasury bonds will stimulate
fixed asset investments.
</P>
<P>
Neglect of agriculture development should be avoided to sustain
the production of grain. Problems relating to laid-off workers
from state-owned enterprises, pensioners and rural residents
should be effectively addressed to ensure social stability,
according to the lawmakers.

<HEADLINE> Djiboutian Delegation Optimistic About Somali Peace Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A top level Djiboutian
delegation expressed tangible optimism Tuesday for a broader
participation by the Somalis in the forthcoming reconciliation
conference due to open in Djibouti on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which was here on an assessment tour, made the
remarks after five days of serious consultations with the various
communities and groups in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen traditional leaders from Mogadishu
accompanied the delegation on departure. The main traditional
leaders of Ugas Abdulkadir Ugas Hashi Ugas Fara-Addeh and Imam
Mohamud Imam Omar are also expected to join them in Djibouti in
the next two days.
</P>
<P>
Speaking briefly to the press before his departure, Osman Ahmed
Yussuf, leader of the six-member delegation and advisor to
Djiboutian President Ismael Omar Ghelleh, commended the people of
Mogadishu for their warm welcome and acceptance of the Djibouti
peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
"Mogadishu is a peaceful place which is contrary to what the
people outside believe," he said.
</P>
<P>
During its visit in Mogadishu, the delegation distributed
invitations for traditional leaders and their companions to give a
specific quota for each party.
</P>
<P>
Each of the clans, subclans and minority groups has asked for
more people from their side to be included in those invited for
the conference, and to some extent the delegation has convinced
them all.
</P>
<P>
The delegation Monday met with the Abgal clan representatives
dominating North Mogadishu. In a launch party with the delegation,
faction leaders Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Hajji Bod accepted
the offer of the delegation and declared their readiness to attend
the conference in Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also met with faction leader Muse Sudi Yalahow
in Medina district Monday evening and he accepted his personal
invitation to attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
Although the delegation brought more invitation letters for the
armed faction leaders who earlier declared their opposition to the
conference, they had no any response to them.
</P>
<P>
"Those faction leaders were included in the list of those whom
we wanted to see," said the leader of the Djibouti delegation.
"They may join their fellow Somalis since they too are invited to
attend the reconciliation conference in Djibouti."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the traditional leaders of Puntland issued a
statement and sent it to the government of Djibouti on Monday
asking for a delegation to visit the Northeastern regions to see
everything for themselves and how the people of Puntland support
the Djibouti peace plan.
</P>
<P>
However, when a copy of this letter was given to the president
of the regional government Abdullahi Yussuf Ahmed, he was so angry
that he issued another statement prohibiting the Djiboutians from
visiting Puntland.
</P>
<P>
All of Somalia's faction leaders except Ali Mahdi Mohamed
immediately forwarded their opposition to the Djibouti initiative
ever since the peace plan was announced late last year.
</P>
<P>
Among those are Mohamed Hajji Ibrahim Egal of Somaliland,
Abdullahi Yussuf Ahmed of Puntland and Hussein Mohamed Aidid,
Mohamed Qanyareh Afrah and Osman Ali Atto of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
However, despite all these oppositions, the popularity of the
Djibouti initiative has been increasing dramatically among the
common Somalis, with the faction leaders having been loosing their
grounds and support day after day.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Top Rebel Commanders Surrender to Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Two top commanders of the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF), a rebel group fighting the Ugandan
government in the western part of the country, have surrendered to
the government.
</P>
<P>
The two commanders, ADF Chief of Staff Commander Benz and
Director of Training Rwigyema Junior, surrendered two days ago
with their six escorts and family members, according to military
spokesman Shaban Bantariza.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua on Tuesday that these people are free to choose
their destiny.
</P>
<P>
"They can join the government army," he said. "And they can
also choose a life style of a different nature."
</P>
<P>
"The recently passed Amnesty Law guarantees their safety and
their right to reintegration into the society," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of increasing attacks against the ADF rebels active
in western Uganda, the rebels' number has dropped to about 100,
Bantariza said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ugandan government troops have destroyed a total of
33 rebel camps in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo from where they launched their attacks.
</P>
<P>
The ADF rebels have often come to Uganda to abduct, kill and
maim people since January 1996. Tens of thousands of people,
including some security personnel, have been displaced due to
rampant rebel activities.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff of Ugandan forces James Kazini is currently
based in the western district of Kasese, spearheading the
government's efforts against ADF incursions.

<HEADLINE> Angola Calls for Further Sanctions Against Savimbi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan foreign ministry has
called for the urgent reinforcement of the sanctions against the
Angolan rebels led by Jonas Savimbi, official news agency Angop
reported here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry urged the member countries of the United Nations
Security Council to agree on the urgent enforcement of the
recommendations contained in a report put forward by the U.N.
Angola Sanctions Committee against Angolan rebels, according to
Angop.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council is currently meeting in New York to
analyze the "Angola dossier", especially the proposals contained
in the report submitted by Robert Fowler, head of the U.N.
Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We would like the application of these recommendations to be
immediate, that is, without dictating the U.N. security council's
will nor the interests defended by the international community,"
said spokesman for Angolan foreign ministry Joao Pedro.
</P>
<P>
The report, signed up by Robert Fowler, contains 39
recommendations, essentially based on the enforcement of the
resolutions that have been passed since 1993, including the
registration of arms traders.
</P>
<P>
Of the bulk of recommendations, stress goes for the punishment
on U.N. resolution violators and the creation of mechanisms of
control, though it is not yet clear where the funds will come
from.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi's organization has been since September 1993 under a
package of sanctions that include a visa ban on his aides and
respective relatives, closure of the organizations bureaus and so
on.

<HEADLINE> Fraud Costs S. Africa 6.2 Billion U.S. Dollars Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Fraud costs South Africa 40
billion rand (about 6.2 billion U.S. dollars) every year, the
Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The amount equals the household income of more than 100,000
South African middle-class families every year.
</P>
<P>
The chamber Monday joined forces with Tip-Offs Anonymous, which
was launched last June and is now providing a 24-hour fraud and
crime reporting subscriber service where subscribers can report
workplace dishonesty in a bid to reduce the prevalence of fraud.
</P>
<P>
The eradication of fraud is expected to boost profits of
business by at least 20 percent and greater profits will encourage
the private sector to invest elsewhere such as in education and
training, the chamber said.
</P>
<P>
A reduction in fraud can also lead to reductions in rates and
taxes and the lowering of service charges for water and
electricity.

<HEADLINE> NATO Agrees to Protect Macedonia's Border With Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- NATO has promised to pay special
attention to the security situation on Macedonia's border with the
troubled Yugoslav province of Kosovo, and to guarantee the normal
operation of crossings along the border, it was reported here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
British Air Marshal Toni Stabels, the new commander of the NATO
peacekeeping force in Macedonia, made the promise to Macedonian
Prime Minister Ljupco Georgievski during a meeting in Macedonia's
capital Skopje on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Stabels' promise was a response to Macedonia's earlier requests
for the United States and the NATO-led KFOR peacekeeping force in
Kosovo to strengthen petrol on its border with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Stabels-led NATO contingent in the former Yugoslav republic
is part of the KFOR, which uses Macedonia as a vital logistical
base for its operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been mounting on the Macedonia-Kosovo border
following the abduction of four Macedonian soldiers on the border
early this month by a group of armed men believed to be Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian extremists. The four were later freed.
</P>
<P>
The incident prompted the Macedonian authorities to call on the
United States and NATO to beef up military strength in border
areas. Last Friday, Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski repeated
the request in a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
During the conversation, Trajkovski expressed grave concern
over tensions on the border, and asked Washington to deliver a
warning to various political forces in Kosovo against any
encroachment upon Macedonia's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
He also asked Washington and the KFOR to step up patrol and
control along the border, where security is responsibility of the
U.S. contingent of the KFOR.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia has a large ethnic Albanian minority and fears that
the separatist violence that erupted last year in Kosovo could
spill over its border.
</P>
<P>
Stabels also discussed with Georgievski KFOR's relations with
Macedonia, which were tainted last Tuesday when some 30 allegedly
drunken U.S. troops were detained for involvement in a street
fight with Macedonian civilians in Skopje.

<HEADLINE> EU Places Importance on Asia-Europe Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Tuesday that the third Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) will be of
special importance in setting a path for the development of
political, economic and cultural relations between the two regions
in the first decade of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Releasing a document addressing future perspectives and
priorities in the ASEM process, the executive body of the European
Union (EU) said its proposal for priorities in ASEM includes an
enhanced dialogue between Asia and the EU on regional and global
security issues, a stronger results-orientated cooperation on
trade and economic issues, and a dialogue on social policy issues.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also covers intensified educational exchanges,
cooperation in the field of consumer protection, and a possible
enlargement of participation in the ASEM process.
</P>
<P>
"The summit comes at a time when Asia is well on the way to
recovery from the crisis of 1997-98, and when the region's
economic and political importance for the EU has never been
greater," Chris Patten, EU Commissioner for external relations,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"In the EU, we are preparing for enlargement and taking on new
responsibilities in the field of foreign policy and security based
on an increasingly strong economy and the successful establishment
of the euro and an open single market. And more than ever before,
Asia and Europe have a common interest in working together as
equal partners to meet the common challenges we face in an
increasingly inter-dependent world," Patten said.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive's working document confirms that ASEM's
advantage lies in its informal character, its multi-dimensionality
and its foundation of equal partnership between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
The third ASEM summit will be held in Seoul, South Korea, on
October 20-21, with the participation of European Commission
President Romano Prodi, heads of the 15 EU member states, and 10
Asian countries -- Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The first ASEM summit was held in Bangkok in 1996 and a second
in London in April 1998.

<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Li Zibin, mayor of Shenzhen,
China's first special economic zone bordering Hong Kong, said that
hi-tech sector has become the city's first economic growth area.
</P>
<P>
He told the three-day China Business Summit here today that

Rapid development of hi-tech has helped Shenzhen restructure
its economy, and greatly improve its economic performance and
market competitiveness, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The city has been focusing on electronic information, bio-
engineering, and new materials. It has established cooperation in
research and development with more than 130 universities and
research institutes across China.

downloading tender documents, receiving and responding to
inquiries, submission of tender offers and contract award notices,
Shipman said.
</P>
<P>
Shipman, who is also president of the IPPA, said that the
system facilitated GSD to procure the best products and services
in a cost-effective and timely manner for all Government
departments.
</P>
<P>
Because the system is web-based, there are no restrictions of
geography or time zone, he said, adding that as a result, GSD
tenders are accessible on a round-the-clock basis, making it far
easier for suppliers worldwide to participate in Hong Kong's
procurement process.
</P>
<P>
The 10th IPPA Conference has attracted some 70 delegates from
29 countries and three international organizations.

<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Attempts to politicize the human
rights issue and use it against China have been proved unpopular
again, said a leading official of the China Society for the Study
of Human Rights here today.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remark during an interview following the
U.N. Human Rights Commission rejected today an anti-China motion
submitted by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. motion was foiled by a majority of votes at the
Commission, and once again the U.S. attempts to use the human
rights issue to interfere in China's internal affairs was defeated.
</P>
<P>
This was the ninth time the United States and some other
countries proposed an anti-China motion at the Commission, and
also the ninth time they failed, the leader said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the past 10 years, during which the United States
and some other countries continuously proposed anti-China motions,
have been a decade in which Chinese human rights conditions saw
their most notable advancements.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that the United States does not really care about
human rights in China," he said, "but rather intends to reach its
ulterior political goals under the pretext of human rights." (

<P>
But, he pointed out, these differences should not be taken as
an excuse for confrontation, pressure, and intervention on the
part of one country toward another. Rather, it should be the basis
for countries to learn from one another to make up deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
All countries should, in the spirit of seeking common ground
while reserving differences, and on the basis of equality and
mutual respect, conduct dialogues and exchanges on the human
rights issue with the aim of increasing mutual understanding,
reducing differences, and achieving common development, he added.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the U.S. anti-China resolution once again shows
that dialogue and cooperation are the general trend worldwide, and
therefore favored by the majority of people.
</P>
<P>
"Using the human rights issue as an excuse for confrontation is
unpopular, and will lead nowhere," the Chinese official concluded.

He said that the promotion and protection of human rights is
the common task of every country in the world.
</P>
<P>
Human rights conditions in every country are in a dynamic
process of development, and no country may brag that its human
rights situation is perfect, nor can any country act as the "world
human rights judge," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The United States, for example, has many human rights problems.
It has the highest violent crime rate in the world, and tops every
other country in the proportion of its population behind bars; its
deep-rooted discrimination on the basis of race, gender, and
wealth is well known everywhere, he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the human rights of the weak, including minorities,
the poor, and women and children, are violated repeatedly in the
United States; the country is mired in and marked by scandals of
repeated violations of human rights in other countries by the use
of force, heedless of the generally acknowledged principles of
international laws, he said.

The official said that the United States and some other Western
countries are extremely reluctant to see China adhering to the
socialist road, and extremely reluctant to see China that abides
by an independent foreign policy of peace continuing to develop
and becoming even stronger.
</P>
<P>
This attitude is based on their political need to promote the
Western social system and hegemonism following the drastic changes
in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
The sole reason the United States, in collusion with a few
other Western countries, repeatedly brought forward anti-China
motions at the U.N. Human Rights Commission was to disfigure China
's image, change China's social system, undermine China's
stability, and contain China's development by making use of the
human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
Such practice of utilizing the human rights issue as a
political tool to create ideological confrontation and exercise
hegemonism is a typical illustration of politicizing the human
rights issue, the official said.
</P>
<P>
It is absolutely against the purpose and principles of the U.N.
Charter, and runs counter to the wishes of the international
community, which calls for dialog and cooperation, and, therefore,
was naturally rejected by a majority of the members of the U.N.
Human Rights Commission, and opposed by the just world opinion, he
said.

should be resolved by that country's government and people, and
the human rights issue around the world should be resolved through

<P>
Each country is obliged to respect and protect the human rights
of its people, and promote the healthy development of
international human rights through dialogue and cooperation in
line with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of different histories, cultural backgrounds, and
development levels, it is normal that different countries may take
different paths and approaches in their promotion and protection
of human rights and have different views of human rights. (

<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A multi-million dollar China-
Canada joint venture on green vegetable production has officially
started business in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Canadian Minister of Agricultural and Agri-food Lyle
Vanclief and Canadian Ambassador to China Howard Balloch attended
the ribbon-cutting ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Shunxin Agricultural Holding Co., the Chinese investor,

problems while zealously condemning other countries at the United

China is a developing country, and the Chinese government and
people are doing their best to improve human rights. Over the past

economic development, and social progress and unity among
different ethnic groups. As a result, human rights are constantly
being improved.

"This is a fact undeniable to anyone without political bias,"
he said, adding that "Any attempt to deny this fact, to use the
human rights issue to block the way of the Chinese people in their

rights will be met with firm resistance and opposition by the
Chinese people."

from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's budget deficit in March hit 340 billion
Lebanon pounds (about 226 million U.S. dollars), accounting for
about 46 percent of the total public spending, up by 103.59 percent
from 167 billion pounds (about 111 million dollars) in March l999.
</P>
<P>
Combined deficit of the budget and the treasury jumped to 56
percent of the total expenditure in the first three months this
year compared with 43 percent during the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
A tax revenue growth is expected in the coming months with a
view that the monthly spending should not surpass the budget.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Forty percent of the works of a gas pipeline for
transferring natural gas from Nabil, about 70 kilometers south of
capital Tunis, to the industrial and residential zones in Tunis
have been completed.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed to supply the capital with natural gas from
an already-agreed-upon 5-percent quota in the Algeria-Italy gas
pipeline which passes by the Tunisian territory in Nabil province.
</P>
<P>
The 45-kilometer pipeline, launched with an investment of 29
million dinars (22.3 million U.S. dollars) in March 2000, is
expected to be completed by 2001.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- Oman's sixth five-year plan (2001-2005) is based
mainly on adopting sustainable financial policies to keep the
balance between earnings and spendings with high and achievable
growth rates in terms of investments and productivity in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
It also involves employing natives, accelerating localization,
stabilizing prices, developing proper monetary and financial
policies to avoid inflationary pressures, encouraging investments
and private sector's role in developing national economy, drafting
a clear and accurate program for natural gas-oriented industries,
promoting tourism, agriculture, fishery and upgrading financial
service.

construction sector over the first quarter of this year, showing a
crisis in real estate since the peace process on the Syrian-Israeli
track hit a snag in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The figures issued by the Lebanese Engineer Syndicate showed
that the land licensed for building during the January-April period
this year dropped by about 55 percent to 613,912 square meters
against 1,360,708 square meters in the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The number of Internet users in Saudi Arabia surged by

RIYADH -- About 7.2 million foreigners are working in Saudi
Arabia, accounting for 47 percent of the total population at
present.
</P>

PHNOM PENH, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of tourists
visiting Angkor Wat, Cambodia's only World Heritage site, has
doubled from about 400 people daily to about 800, the Cambodia
Daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase of tourists is due to the government's 'open
skies' policy which was announced by Prime Minister Hun Sen last
December.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign airlines have already taken the advantage of the
policy and introduced direct flights to Siem Reap where Angkor Wat
is located. Besides Royal Air Cambodge, other airlines serving
Siem Reap include Vietnam Airlines and Bangkok Airways.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Airways operate five daily flights to Siem Reap from
Bangkok, and it also started flights between Pattaya, Phuket and
Siem Reap.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shanghai and Singapore Airlines are also considering
direct flights.
</P>
<P>
Officials expect that daily visitors to Angkor Wat could reach
1,000 once the roads to Siem Reap from Poipet and Phnom Penh are
upgraded.
</P>
<P>
With the booming of the tourism, the hotel business is strong.
The area now offers 1,520 rooms in five hotels and various guest
houses.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Turn Two-Stroke Engine Autorickshaws into CNG-run Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to turn two-stroke engine autorickshaws into CNG (
Compressed Natural Gas)-run vehicles under the Bangladesh
Environment Management Project to reduce air pollution in the
capital city, officials said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They said the initiative would also reduce the risk of sudden
job loss with the banning of the autorickshaws, which were blamed
as the main culprit for air pollution in the city, and help
protect the livelihood of some 250,000 people dependent on the
mode of transport.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the environment-friendly CNG technology will minimize
the recurring and maintenance cost of baby taxis along with
substantial improvement of Dhaka's air quality," an Environment
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
The official said similar initiatives in Pakistan had yielded
encouraging results as gas quality emitted from CNG-run
autorickshaws was far better for public health.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Department undertook the initiatives after a
study by a Canadian expert in Dhaka, which suggested that
transformation of two-stroke engines into CNG-run vehicles was "
feasible from environmental, economic and technological grounds."
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate, the number of autorickshaws currently
in Dhaka are around 50,000.

<HEADLINE> Chronology: Failures of U.S. Anti-China Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Blind to the tremendous progress
China has made in promoting and protecting human rights, the
United States in the past decade has masterminded eight anti-China
resolutions on the so-called "human rights conditions in China" at
the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. However, the U.S.
acts have ended in failure each and every time as they were
opposed by the majority of the commission members. Following is a
chronicle of major events in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
At its 46th session on March 6, 1990, the commission turned
down a resolution proposed by the U.S. and a handful of Western
countries on the so-called "situation in China," with a vote of 17-
15 and 11 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
On March 4, 1992, the commission adopted at its 48th session a
"no-action" motion tabled by Pakistan with a vote of 27-15 with 11
abstentions, deciding not to take action on the so-called "China/
Tibet situation" resolution cooked up by a few Western countries.
</P>
<P>
And at its 49th session on March 10, 1993, the commission
decided not to consider a resolution on the so-called "the human
rights situation in China" put forward by the U.S. and several
other Western countries, by a vote of 22-17 with 12 abstentions,
foiling their attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
On March 9, 1994, the commission at its 50th session adopted a
"no-action" motion forwarded by China and decided not to view a
resolution on the so-called "human rights situation in China"
proposed by a few Western nations, once again foiling their
attempt to put pressure on China under the pretext of human rights.
Twenty countries voted in favor of China's motion, 16 voted
against and 17 abstained.
</P>
<P>
On March 8, 1995, a resolution on the so-called "the human
rights situation in China" tabled by the U.S. and the European
Union was turned down by the commission at its 51st session by a
vote of 21 against, 20 in favor and 12 abstentions.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Use Fund to Stabilize Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government has
decided to use pension and other long-term funds to help stabilize
the stock market when necessary.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a governmental meeting which focused
on discussion of measures to stabilize the stock market.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the government also decided to restrict larger
shareholders of KOSDAQ-listed companies from selling shares over
the short-term.
</P>
<P>
The measures are aimed at helping investment trusts normalize
their management and to push for reform of the stock market system
so that investors can play the market without worry.
</P>
<P>
The government will allow investment and trust companies to run
mutual funds and will take measures to stabilize macroeconomics
variables including foreign exchange and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
South Korean stock markets have suffered record losses over the
past two days in the wake of the crash on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
As losses were equivalent to 43 percent of the South Korean
national budget for this year, President Kim Dae-jung instructed
his cabinet to map out measures to stabilize the faltering markets.
</P>
<P>
Strong measures are needed to protect the markets as eventual
collapse will be detrimental to the overall growth of the South
Korean economy, especially the economic restructuring.

<HEADLINE> China Foils U.S. Anti-China Attempt at U.N. Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China foiled the United States'
anti-China attempt once again on Tuesday as a "no-action motion"
was adopted at the 56th session of the United Nations Commission
on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The 53-member U.N. commission adopted the Chinese motion 22-18,
with 12 abstentions and 1 absent from the voting.
</P>
<P>
It was China's ninth victory over United States-led anti-China
attempts since 1990.
</P>
<P>
"The draft resolution is nothing but an anti-China political
farce directed and played by the United States alone, and a
mockery toward the (U.N.) human rights commission and its members,
" said Chinese Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai when tabling the no-action
motion.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the United States' attack on China's use of the
no-action motion, Qiao said China's act was fully justified by the
existing statute.
</P>
<P>
"The rules of procedure applied in the Human Rights Commission
were established by the Economic and Social Council of the United
Nations through legal procedures and have been in effective use
for many years."
</P>
<P>
No-action motions have been applied on numerous occasions and
have never been called into question, said Qiao, who also heads
the Chinese delegation to the annual six-week meeting of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Washington, as a matter of fact, used no-action motions on
various occasions, including at the UN General Assembly, to block
moves against it, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
Washington's attack on China over the issue is a typical
manifestation of Washington's double standards and hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said Washington put forward the anti-China resolution as
it doesn't like China's mode of development and the path Chinese
people have chosen. "The U.S. wants to take control of China's
destiny," he said.
</P>
<P>
"History has proven, and will continue to prove, that hegemony,
power politics and any attempt to control other people's destiny
can only lead to self-destruction."
</P>
<P>
"The brave strides of the 1.3 billion Chinese people can be
stopped by no one," said Qiao.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attempt was made mainly out of its domestic political
needs, analysts said. With presidential elections drawing near
this year, certain political forces in the United States once
again chose to confront China at the annual U.N. Human Rights
Commission session to score political points at home.
</P>
<P>
The United States has to act alone this year at the UN Human
Rights Commission to table the anti-China resolution as not a
single country would like to second Washington's move. Some
European Union countries, like France, as in 1997 and 1999,
refused to put forward any anti-China resolution this year.
Instead of confrontation, they favor "constructive dialogues" with
China on the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The Americans even resorted to evil cults as its weapons
against China this year, accusing China of disrupting religious
freedom by banning the Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
China argued that it acted on Falun Gong in accordance with the
law of the country precisely for the purpose to protect the
freedom of belief of the more than 100 million Chinese cherishing
various regions.
</P>
<P>
At the session, many delegates from developing countries,
especially those from Asia and Africa, extended warm support for
China's stance. They highly praised China for social and political
stability, great achievements in various fields, and tremendous
progress made to protect and improve human rights in the country.
</P>
<P>
The countries that voted for China's motion are: Bangladesh,
Bhutan, Botswana, Burundi, China, Congo, Cuba, India, Indonesia,
Madagascar, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Qatar,
Russia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Venezuela and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Those who voted against China are: Canada, Colombia, the Czech
Republic, El Salvador, France, Germany, Guatemala, Italy, Japan,
Latvia, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Swaziland,
the United Kingdom and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The countries that abstained from the vote are: Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Liberia, Mauritius, Mexico, Philippines,
Rwanda, South Korea, Senegal and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Romania was absent from the voting procedure.

<HEADLINE> Russia Voices Concern Over U.S. Radar Station in Norway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday reiterated its
concern over the construction of a U.S. radar station in Norway.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Yakovenko said the
installation of such a station outside U.S. territory violates the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty (ABM), Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian side has raised this question with the United
States many times and expressed grave concern to the Norwegian
government over the continuing construction of the radar station
in the immediate vicinity of the Russian border," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
"However, Moscow still has not received any explanations
reducing these apprehensions," Yakovenko said.
</P>
<P>
The situation with the station is developing in such a way that
Norway could become involved in the violation of the ABM treaty. "
Russia would not want the situation to unfold in such a manner,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He refuted U.S. and Norwegian official claims that the radar
station is meant for space monitoring.
</P>
<P>
"In actual fact, and this has been confirmed by foreign
specialists, the station is meant to detect the launch of
ballistic missiles, and before being moved to Norway it was used
in the United States for testing the American strategic missile
defense system," Yakovenko said.
</P>
<P>
"It is evident that the radar station in Norway may also be
used in the interests of the American national missile defense
system banned by the ABM treaty," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Thanks All Countries for Support, FM Spokesman (More Added) ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi said here today that the Chinese government
wishes to express its admiration and thanks to all the countries
which upheld justice for their support of China.
</P>
<P>
Sun made the remark following the report that the U.N.
Commission on Human Right today decided at its 56th Session to
take no action on the U.S.-sponsored draft resolution on the so-
called "Human Rights Situation in China."
</P>
<P>
This is the ninth time since 1990 that the Commission rejected
an anti-China draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the Chinese government has all along attached
importance to human rights and has made unremitting efforts to
promote and protect the human rights of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"Now the human rights situation in China is the best ever in
the country's history," he pointed out, adding that this is
universally recognized by the international community.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the United States, turning a blind eye to all
these facts and driven by the need of its domestic partisan
politics, once again tabled an anti-China draft resolution in an
attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs under the pretext
of the so-called human rights issue and tarnish China's image on
the international stage.
</P>
<P>
Such move contravenes the purposes and principles of the U.N.
Charter and runs against the prevailing trend in the international
human rights field which is for dialogue and against confrontation,
Sun pointed out.

"The move can lead nowhere but self-isolation and self-defeat
of the United States," the spokesman added. Although the U.S.
exerted enormous pressure on the member states of the Commission,
yet no country co-sponsored its draft resolution. The anti-China
farce had few supporters. Facts speak louder than words and
justice will prevail, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Sun Stressed that the anti-China resolutions of this kind have
been foiled for the ninth time once again proved that the attempt
to interfere in other countries' internal affairs and pursue
hegemonism and power politics under the pretext of the so-called
human rights issue is like an arrow at the end of its flight and
is against people's will, and that confrontation approach is
doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the Chinese government has always maintained that
all countries should conduct dialogue and exchanges on the
question of human rights on the basis of equality and mutual
respect, with a view to enhancing mutual understanding, expanding
common ground and reducing difference.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to work with other members of the international
community in a joint effort to promote a sound development of the
international human rights cause in accordance with the purpose
and principles of the U.N. Charter," Sun said.

BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China should not give up its
efforts to prevent nuclear war as it prepares against potential
military conflict, since the specter of nuclear conflict will
continue to loom over mankind in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
So said Dong Qingfu at a just-concluded seminar on military
science, predicting that in the coming century nuclear weapons
will play an indispensable and important role in international
affairs, the People's Liberation Army Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said the struggle centered on the issue of nuclear weapons
may become more complicated and fierce while the shadow of nuclear
war, particularly limited ones, will remain.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, China's nuclear strategy is one that opposes wars
and safeguards peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China has adopted a very prudent and restrained attitude
toward nuclear weapons testing and nuclear arsenal buildups," he
said.
</P>
<P>
China was the first country in the world to announce that it
would not be the first to use nuclear weapons, Dong said.

ZHENGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, has urged to
develop China's market economy, improve democracy and the legal
system in the country.
</P>
<P>
The top lawmaker, who is also a member of the Standing

Central Committee, made the call during his inspection tour of
central Henan Province from April 13-17. He visited Zhengzhou, the
provincial capital, and Luoyang and Kaifeng with provincial
leaders.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Li paid great attention to the work of local
legislatures. Local people's congresses and local laws and
regulations are playing a big role in promoting local development,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the role of local legislators is extremely important,
noting that over 3.2 million local lawmakers are representatives
of people of different trades.
</P>
<P>
Li asked local legislators to increase their contacts with
ordinary people and urged standing committees of local people's
congresses to create good conditions for lawmakers to carry out
their work.
</P>
<P>
On April 17, Li visited the Xiaolangdi Water Control Project on
the Yellow River, 40 km north of Luoyang, to learn about current
developments in the multi-billion yuan project.
</P>

<P>
Sources from Karachi, provincial capital of Sindh, told Xinhua
that a division bench of the high court accepted the appeal after
listening to arguments of the lawyers from both the prosecution
and Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The court also set May 2 for hearing of another appeal filed by
the ousted prime minister against confiscation of his property,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The petition challenging the ATC verdict of awarding life
sentence to Sharif had earlier been filed by a lawyer Azizullah
Sheikh on behalf of the former prime minister, who was deposed on
October 12, last year in a bloodless coup.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh in his appeal pleaded that the verdict is unique as the
evidence of the prosecution about six other accused was not
accepted but the seventh was sentenced.
</P>
<P>
On April 6, Nawaz Sharif was sentenced to life imprisonment on
two courts, fine of 100 million rupees (1.9 million U.S.dollars)
and 200 million rupees (3.9 million dollars) as compensation
besides confiscation of property.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister, along with other six, had been
charged with refusing landing in Karachi of a civil plane which
carried back from abroad some 200 passengers including the now
chief executive General Pervez Musharraf on October 12, 1999.

from the opposite direction, failed to avoid the accident,
derailing two of its wagons, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar took a
dive to a new 18-month low below 59 U.S. cents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The currency dropped around one U.S. cent overnight and reached
its lowest level since October 1998 when it was climbing back
after the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
It closed at 59.37 U.S. cents from 60.31 Monday.
</P>
<P>
At 17:00 Australian East time, the Australian dollar was at 0.
6255 euro from 0.6245.
</P>
<P>
Economists said Tuesday that the Australian dollar was looking
increasingly sick and could fall dramatically further before
finding a platform for a slow recovery. They believed an increase
in the Australia/U.S. interest rate differential is bearish for
the currency because it lures investors from Australian dollar
bonds.

<HEADLINE> Economic Official on Further Opening up of Central and Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Yu Xiaosong, chairman of the
China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, urged
western and central China to further promote opening to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
At the 2000 Henan Economic and Trade Fair, which is being
hosted in this capital of central China's Henan Province, Yu said
he has confidence in the region's development prospects based on
its experience of reform and opening up over the past twenty years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the region should follow the example of the
country's coastal regions, especially Guangdong and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
As part of the implementation of the national strategy of
developing central and western China, the provinces of Sichuan,
Shaanxi, and Henan have hosted a series of economic and trade
exchange activities this year, signing agreements for cooperative
projects with overseas investors valued at billions of US dollars.

<HEADLINE> China's Rural Areas Recognize Importance of IT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Internet, the fastest means for
people to exchange information in today's world, has been warmly
welcomed in China's rural areas now.
</P>
<P>
A poor county named Jingyu in northeast China's Jilin Province
has been able to get useful economic information through the hi-
tech medium.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Changbai Mountains, the county now still has no
highways or railway lines connecting the outside world. It will
take villagers some two hours to arrive in the nearest Baishan
City by bus. And it is almost impossible for local people to read
any intraday newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"Capital, technology, and talents are important for our
economic development, but communication and exchange of
information with the outside world is on the top of these," said
Ji Deping, secretary of the county committee of the Communist
Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Outsiders can also get information about the county's resources,
investment projects and tourism routes through Internet. And some
businessmen from other provinces and from Singapore and Hong Kong
have already shown their interest and willingness to participate
in the local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Internet has also brought opportunities and fortune to the
farmers and livestock breeders in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Bai Yelha, owner of a lamb processing factory in Chen Barag
Banner, has begun to gain profits for the first time in the last
two years by signing a long-term product supply contract online
with a restaurant in northeast China's Heilongjiang province.
</P>
<P>
The factory had been running at loss before this due to lack of
market information. It is Internet that helps him solve the
problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Trade negotiations by going on business trips will cost a lot
of money and time, while Internet chatrooms have made all trade
negotiations economical, convenient and prompt," said Ms. Song, a
managing staff with a local cashmere company.
</P>
<P>
Internet has expanded the business scope as well. The Shiqi
Group, a clothing company based in the region, now make suits and
dresses for foreigners according to the orders they sent through
Internet.
</P>
<P>
More enterprises and livestock breeders in the region are now
realizing the great help of such a hi-tech means, and so far, over
20 companies have opened Internet sales business.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. replaced Japan as
China's largest export destination last year, a Chinese foreign
trade official said here at the ongoing China Export Commodity
Fair.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xinhua, vice minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, said at the U.S. Retail Industry and China
Enterprises Summit held during the fair today, that foreign trade
between America, the most powerful developed country, and China,
the largest developing country, is mutually complementary.
</P>
<P>
Sino-American foreign trade amounted to 61.5 billion US dollars
in 1999, up 12 percent over the previous year, according to
statistics from the General Administration of Customs. Of this
total, China's export to the US increased by 7.5 percent last year
to 42 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that exports to the U.S. are mainly light textile
products and home appliances, comparatively cheap commodities.
China also imports large amounts of high-tech products from
America, such as telecommunications and electronic gadgets and
equipment, making China the third largest importer of US goods.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the agreement reached between China and
the U.S. in November last year on China's accession to the World
Trade Organization was consistent with the interests of people in
both countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China's nuclear industry is
accelerating efforts to shift from military production to civilian
application, and is rapidly becoming a major powerhouse in the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The industry is operating under a new system featuring a
combination of military and civilian production with the
development of nuclear power and a diversified economy, according
a senior expert with the China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC).
</P>
<P>
The sector has established a large number of enterprise groups
in developed coastal areas such as the east China municipality of
Shanghai and the provinces of Guangdong and Zhejiang, as
enterprises in the sector have so far developed over 1,500
products for civilian use.
</P>
<P>
The country's nuclear industry has maintained a high growth
rate for a number of years in succession, and has in turn
contributed to dramatic improvements in the nation's overall
economic strength.
</P>
<P>
Products designed for civilian use account for over 80 percent
of the total industrial output volume of China's nuclear sector.
</P>
<P>
The development of nuclear energy represents a major factor
enabling the industry to introduce strategic adjustments focusing
on civilian application, according to the expert.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Free 13 Lebanese, Keep 2 Eminent Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security cabinet Tuesday
agreed unanimously to respect the Supreme Court ruling regarding
the release of 13 Lebanese detainees now in custody in Israel
</P>
<P>
The inner-circle policy-making panel pledged it will carry out
the ruling by Wednesday afternoon, said a communique issued Tuesday
morning after its special session.
</P>
<P>
The decision finally cleared the way for the transfer of these
detainees to the International Red Cross Organization in south
Lebanon, which is originally set to take place on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, two most prominent detainees Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid
and Mustafa Dirani, will still be held in Israeli prison for at
least a month.
</P>
<P>
The security cabinet communique stated that the government will
make a special effort to guarantee the continued detainment in
Israel of Dirani and Obeid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tel Aviv District Court, which is handling the
urgent appeal by the state to extend the detention of the two,
adjourned hearing on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to the court, the hearing is scheduled to resume on
May 8, so the two will be kept in Israeli custody at least until
that time.
</P>
<P>
All these detainees had been illegally kept for years in Israeli
prison as bargaining chips for the information or return of missing
Israeli soldiers, including Israel Air Force Navigator Ron Arad,
who has been missing in Lebanon since 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The so-called administrative detention without trial faced legal
challenges after the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that eight of
the Lebanese detainees should be released, as they are not posing
security threats to Israel.
</P>
<P>
As the principle of this ruling could arguably be applied to
other seven Lebanese hostages, the prison authority announced later
that five of the remaining prisoners will also be set free, except
Dirani and Obeid.
</P>
<P>
Obeid, a spiritual leader of Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas,was
kidnapped from his home in south Lebanon in 1989, and Dirani,
security chief of the Lebanese resistance militia Amal, was
captured by Israeli agents in a special operation in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It was Dirani who held Arad after the Israeli navigator
parachuted from his hit Phantom fighter on Lebanese soils in
October 1986. Dirani reportedly traded Arad to either Hezbollah or
its supporter Iran later.
</P>
<P>
The government attorney in their cases argued that the two do
pose a threat to Israel's security, a move aimed at seeking a new
pretext to justify their continued incarceration.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruling had prompted some senior members of the
defense and judicial establishment to explore possible legal ways
to circumvent the decision, as the court had rejected a last-minute
appeal against the release of the 13 detainees on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The security cabinet session on Tuesday decided to begin an
immediate legislative process to examine and permit the holding of
enemy fighters in accordance with the concept in international law.
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation, according to the communique, would
shift the decision on detention from the courts to the defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
It would hold these detainees, such as members of Lebanese
Hezbollah guerrillas who are fighting to end Israeli occupation in
south Lebanon, by methods other than administrative detention.
</P>
<P>
The security cabinet said it will bring such a draft bill in
fast track before the Knesset (Parliament), which is due to break
the current recess for the Jewish Passover Holiday and convene in
special session on Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It also promised to continue making maximum efforts to obtain
information regarding Israel's prisoner of wars and servicemen
missing in action, in order to secure their return to Israel.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Experts Urges Revision of Population  Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's national population
policy needs to be revised to curb the rapid growth of population
in the country, experts said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for the Nepali government to revise the
national population policy," said Stephen Chee, representative of
the United Nations Funds for Population Activities, at a 5-day
national population meeting that kicked off Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although the national population policy formulated in 1983
called for family planning, population growth has been so rapid
that it hindered economic development in the country, said Chee.
</P>
<P>
Other experts attending the meeting called for the government
to step up population control programs and effective census.
</P>
<P>
Findings on population development needs to be analyzed and
cross-checked in order to provide information for a better
population policy, they proposed.
</P>
<P>
According to a paper presented at the meeting, the 1991 census
of Nepal prepared by the central Bureau of Statistics is
unreliable.
</P>
<P>
"The data on ethnic/caste groups contain a lot of loopholes and
is often unreliable in divergent socio-economic contexts of Nepal,
" the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Although Nepal started family planning activities in 1959, its
population has seen rapid growth due to slackness in implementing
the national population policy.
</P>
<P>
At the current annual growth rate of 2.1 percent, the present
22 million population is expected to be doubled in the year 2028,
which will be a heavy burden on the country's poor economy and
scarce resources.
</P>
<P>
The meeting are co-organized by UN Family Planning Organization
and Tribhuvan University Population Study Faculty. Attending the
meeting are about 30 population experts from Nepal and
international agencies.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy on Mend: Researcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy is
definitely on the mend, Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (
MIER) Executive Director Mohamed Ariff said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The MIER is sticking to the six percent real gross domestic
product(GDP) growth this year it forecasted last January for the
country, he said at a press briefing held for the release of the
economic think- tank's "Malaysian Economic Outlook: 2000 which
contains its quarterly projection.
</P>
<P>
Growth this year would be private sector-driven with the public
sector taking secondary role, he said, adding the GDP could expand
up to 6.5 percent but beyond that, it would overheat.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economy, which contracted 7.5 percent in 1998, grew
by 5.4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Noting improved consumer confidence, he said consumers tend to
spend more than previously while many household reported higher
wages and employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He said although 70 percent of the 1,250 household surveyed
expected inflationary pressure in the future, consumers were less
concerned about inflation compared with the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The forecasted 3.4 percent inflation this year "is a non issue
but we should not take it for granted," he said.
</P>
<P>
The MIER's survey of some 600 manufacturing companies in the
first quarter of this year showed businesses remained upbeat over
the economy, Ariff said, adding a large number of manufacturers
were getting higher export orders and sales while the number of
those with low production and sales declined.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the next year's GDP growth would be a bit
lower than the 6.0 percent projected for 2000 as some correction
in the U.S.economy were expected.

<HEADLINE> Angola Considers Explosion in Lisbon's Discotheque "Grave and Worrying" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government considered
"very grave and worrying" the incident of gas explosion in a
discotheque located in the downtown Lisbon that killed five
Angolan citizens and two from Spain and Portugal, according to the
spokesman of the Angolan foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
Joao Pedro said that the Angolan government is expecting for
official information from the Portuguese authorities on the bandit
action, which took place at the dawn of last Sunday in the
downtown Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
As the motive of the incident has not been made clear, the
Angolan government can not attribute the responsibility to
anybody, said the official source.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the victims got smashed by the iron bars
located on the entrances or got poisoned by the gas launched when
some 900 youths were rushing to move out from the main entrance as
soon as the gas was launched.
</P>
<P>
The modern 1,100-people capacity disco, named Discotheque
Luanda, is mostly frequented by the Angolans and Cape Verdeans
living in the Portuguese capital Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts noticed that the incident followed the heated
argument last week on the issue of the entry visa, during which 27
Portuguese nationals and 12 Angolans had been barred from enter
Angola and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
According to the Angolan international airport, those
Portuguese visitors wanted to enter Angola for working but without
working permits. In a retaliatory action, the Portuguese airport
said that 12 Angolans lacked some documents for entering Portugal
and repatriated them to Angola.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Reports 4.2 Million HIV-Infected Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- About 4.2 million people in
South Africa had been infected with the Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) by the end of last year, said Health Minister Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The national HIV prevalence rate for 1999 was 22.4 percent,
compared to 22.8 percent for 1998, the health minister said at a
news conference in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
She said although HIV prevalence had increased in five
provinces, there was not a generalized increase in all geographic
areas.
</P>
<P>
"The 1999 findings suggest that South Africa may be seeing a
shift in the epidemiological profile of HIV, in which a small
degree of stabilization may be occurring," she said.
</P>
<P>
That does not necessarily mean that there were fewer cases of
HIV infection or there was a change in HIV incidence, although
that could be a contributing factor, Tshabalala-Msimang said.
</P>
<P>
The figures might have been influenced by factors like higher
mortality rates among HIV-infected people and fewer pregnancies
among HIV-infected women, she said.

GENEVA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China foiled the United States'
anti-China attempt once again Tuesday as a "no-action motion" was
adopted at the 56th session of the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The 53-member U.N. commission adopted the Chinese motion 22-18,
with 12 abstentions and 1 absent.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Zonghuai, Geneva-based ambassador from China, said that it
was China's ninth victory over the United States-led anti-China
attempt since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Despite the tremendous progress China has made in its human
rights conditions, the United States orchestrated another round of
anti-China campaign in 1999. The Americans failed to get anyone to
speak for it and had to come to the fore and act on its own.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attempt was made mainly out of the needs of its
domestic politics. With presidential elections drawing nearer this
year, the United States tried once again to confront China at the
annual U.N. human rights commission meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Americans went so far as to resort to evil cults as its
weapons this year, accusing China of disrupting religious freedom.
The hard fact is that the first to expose the evils of Falun Gong
were exactly those from the Chinese religious circles themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government acted on Falun Gong in accordance with
the law of the country precisely for the purpose to protect the
freedom of belief of the more than 100 million Chinese cherishing
various regions.
</P>

The latest available statistics showed that upwards of 2,300
people fell prey to Falun Gong that either caused death, injury
and disability on its practitioners. The American attempt to heap
attacks upon China via an evil cult naturally would not round
backup from the countries and people who know where to draw the
line between good and evil.

"The draft resolution is nothing but an anti-China political
farce directed and played all by the United States alone, and a
mockery toward the (U.N.) human rights commission and its members,
" said Qiao, who also heads the Chinese delegation to the annual
six-week meeting of the commission.
</P>
<P>
China's motion of "no-action" was fully justified by the
existing statute, Qiao added. "The rules of procedure applied in
the Human Rights Commission were established by the Economic and
Social Council of the United Nations through legal procedures and
have been in effective use for many years."
</P>
<P>
No-action motions have been applied at numerous occasions and
have never been called into question, stressed the Chinese
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
"History has proven, and will continue to prove, that hegemony,
power politics and any attempt to control other people's destiny
can only lead to self-destruction," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
"The brave strides of the 1.3 billion Chinese people can be
stopped by no one," he stressed", added Qiao.

<HEADLINE> Fishing Banned In Central China Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A three-month fishing ban went
into effect today at Dongting Lake, one of the country's largest
freshwater lakes, in central China's Hunan Province..
</P>
<P>
All trawlers and fishing boats will be banned in a 60,000-
hectare area of the lake through June, according to a local
fishery official.
</P>
<P>
The province has decided to strictly supervise the fishing area
and prohibit all fishing activities during this period, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the ban, some 200,000 fishermen will be given training
and help in maintaining their vessels, the official said, adding
that the ban's purpose is to protect marine resources from over-
fishing which in the past ten years has significantly depleted
marine resources and caused a decline in the output of aquatic
products.
</P>
<P>
Dongting Lake has been fished for about 6,000 years, and there
are now 117 kinds of fish living in the lake. Last year, the lake
reported a fishery production value of 4.5 billion yuan.

BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China is considering collecting

<P>
In an interview with Xinhua Tuesday afternoon, Director of
Corruption Affairs at the AGO, Chairul Imam said : "It is not
impossible for us to do so (seize Soeharto's assets)."
</P>
<P>
"We are now still investigating Soeharto's corruption cases,"
Imam said. But, he refused to talk in detail.
</P>
<P>
He also defended the AGO's decision in putting the former
president under city arrest despite protest from Soeharto's family
and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"We have reasons in issuance warrant of travel ban as well as
city arrest to Soeharto," Imam said.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to hammer out the finishing of corruption cases
involving the former president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soeharto's eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti
Indrarukmana insisted here Tuesday that her father will keep
staying at home and denied rumors that the former strong man
planned for leaving the country to avoid the investigation of
corruption charges which is now underway.

Thai and Myanmar authorities have agreed to eradicate drug
problems along the two country's 2,400-kilometer border by the

The project, initiated by Thai king Bhumibol Adulyadej, will

</P>
<P>
Drug problems along the Thai-Myanmar border will be gradually

the general said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany has decided to
cancel the total debt valued at 62.7 million U.S. dollars owed by
Tanzania, the African newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian Minister for Finance Daniel Yona was quoted as
saying on Monday that Germany's decision is in line with the Paris
Club decision last week to cancel Tanzania's 1.88 billion U.S.
dollars debt.
</P>
<P>
The minister commended the German government for its decision
and requested other countries to follow the example.
</P>
<P>
He said the Tanzanian government will make efforts to convince
non-Paris Club countries to cancel their debts, which stood at 864
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yona, who had just arrived from Paris where he attended a Paris
Club meeting, explained that the debts canceled by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and the Paris Club
were for loans acquired before 1986 which are now mature for
payment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the World Bank and the IMF announced to
grant a two billion U.S. dollars debt relief for Tanzania, halving
the African country' s debt servicing bill for 2001-03 and
reducing it by a third in coming years.

<HEADLINE> China Builds Ecological Demonstration Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China, worrying about a
worsening environment, will take effective measures to turn 140 of
its 2,000 counties and prefectures into ecological demonstration
zones over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
These counties and prefectures are to meet the economic, social,
and environmental requirements of China's sustainable development
strategy in 2005.
</P>
<P>
An official with China's State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA) said the move is part of the country's
endeavor to achieve a fast economic growth while maintaining a
sound environment.
</P>
<P>
China began to construct ecological demonstration zones in 1995,
and by the end of last year, 33 counties and prefectures across
the country have been named as ecological demonstration zones by
SEPA.
</P>
<P>
The environmental requirements contain 19 specific development
targets, including the forest coverage rate, the consumption rate
of environment-friendly energy, and reduction in consumption of
farm chemicals and chemical fertilizers, as well as the quality of
air and water and the use of recycled solid waste.

<P>
The Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone, which lies in the northeastern part
of Pudong, covers an area of 10 square meters. It is a
comprehensive free trade zone with bonded warehouses, commodity
exhibition stands, trade fairs and export processing centers.
Intel, Hewlett-Packard and several other big names have
established plants in the area. By the end of last year, 3,975
projects have been approved within the area, involving a total
investment of 4.8 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Zhangjiang High-tech Park is located in the central part of
Pudong covering an area of 25 square kilometers. By the end of
1999, investors from both home and abroad have set up 67 projects,
mostly high-tech, with investment exceeding one billion US dollars.
Since July 1999, a one-square-kilometer area was set aside for
intensive development of new technologies, such as information,
biology, microelectronics and computer software.
</P>
<P>
On top of the four, Pudong also has other functional areas like
Sunqiao Modern Agriculture Development Zone, Huaxia Culture
Tourism Zone, Wangqiao Industrial Zone, and Liuli Modern
Residential Quarters. Establishment of various zones have promoted
Pudong's economy and at the same time spurred the development of
its surrounding areas.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why China's FDI Increased in 1st Quarter (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Overseas direct investment in
China (FDI) increased sharply in the first quarter this year, and
analysts attribute the increase to the economic recovery in Asia,
expanding domestic market demand, and the accelerated pace of
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,316 overseas-invested new ventures were approved
between January and March, up 22.75 percent, according to figures
released by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(MOFTEC). These ventures involve 11.08 billion US dollars of
overseas investment in contractual volume, up 27.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
Materialized investment during the period reached 7.14 billion
US dollars, down 2.72 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In March alone, the number of newly approved overseas-invested
ventures grew by 43.16 percent, contractual overseas investment
grew 50.37 percent, and arrived investment edged up by 10.28
percent.
</P>
<P>
"It is still too early to say that FDI in China has recovered
growth for the entire year, but it did grow monthly in the first
quarter," said analysts here.
</P>
<P>
A better international and domestic environment has made China
more attractive to overseas investors, and the strategy to develop
China's vast western region has provided investors with more
opportunities, according to the analysts.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why China's FDI Increased in 1st Quarter (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the latter half of 1999, most economies in Asia that were
hit hard by the financial crisis have begun to recover. As a
result, they are now more able to invest in China, and Asia is
China's number one source of FDI.
</P>
<P>
Domestically, China has seen a sustained economic growth, with
gross domestic product for the first three months of this year
expected to reach seven percent, as domestic market demand
continues to recover.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country's decision to develop its vast western
region has drawn worldwide attention, and many multinationals have
begun increasing their investment in this region, according to
preliminary reports.
</P>
<P>
The accelerated pace of China's entry into the WTO is another
factor leading to FDI increase, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Following the Sino-U.S. bilateral agreement concerning China's
entry into the WTO last November, China has signed agreements with
a dozen other WTO members, leaving only a few members remaining
without a deal.
</P>
<P>
Many overseas-invested ventures have said that they are in
favor of China's WTO membership, saying this will be good for
their businesses in the country.
</P>
<P>
China has pledged to gradually open up its finance, insurance,
telecommunications, banking, foreign trade, and other sectors to
overseas investors upon entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"If the international and domestic environment continues in its
current situation, and if China joins the WTO very soon, FDI
growth may continue in the coming years," one analyst said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Dialogue based on equality and
mutual respect is the only correct way to resolve differences
among countries on the issue of human rights, while confrontation
leads nowhere, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions at a regular press conference, Sun said
that China hopes the European Union (EU) will continue to adopt
the dialogue approach in this regard, and that dialog between
China and members of the EU is ongoing.

"The fact that the U.S. submitted its anti-China resolution on
human rights in Geneva shows it is bent on confrontation instead
of dialog on the human rights issue, and in that case we will take
it on and fight to the finish," Sun said.

<P>
Commenting on the on-going session on human rights in Geneva,
Sun said that he is confident China's no-motion action will get

BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China treasures friendly

into its internal affairs by any country in the name of ethnic
affairs or religion, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi at a

National separatism "has played a negative role in national and
regional stability," Sun pointed out, saying that the Chinese
government has kept close watch on the situation and has expounded
its position on this matter to relevant countries.

<P>
"We believe that the countries concerned agree with China on

<HEADLINE> Fresh Fighting Kills 16 Rebels in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- At least 16 Tamil Tiger rebels
had been killed in fresh clashes in their separatist war against
Sri Lanka's government troops as the latest round of fighting
entered its fourth week in the country's north, the Ministry of
Defense said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that troops on Monday killed
12 rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in various
clashes in the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The peninsula has been the scene of some fierce fighting in the
past three weeks since the LTTE, fighting for a separate homeland
for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983,
launched a fresh push to capture their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The statement said troops also engaged a rebel bunker with
small arms and rocket propelled grenades at Janakapura in the
northern Welioya region, killing four rebels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the international relief agency Medecins sans
Frontiers (MSF) has urged the Sri Lankan government to allow the
immediate re-supply of urgently needed drugs to the war-torn north
where stocks were running out.
</P>
<P>
MSF, or Doctors Without Borders, said in a statement issued on
Monday that in the past three months drug supplies had run low in
the northern Mullaithivu and Kilinochchi districts and attempts by
humanitarian agencies to renew supplies had been thwarted by
security forces.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing a situation where clinics and hospitals have
closed or are no longer accepting patients because they cannot
provide treatment for these civilians, many of whom are women and
children," Isabel Simpson, head of the Sri Lankan mission of MSF (
Netherlands) said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
A large part of Wanni region, where the Mullaithivu and
Kilinochchi districts are situated, is under LTTE control. Medical
supplies cannot be sent there without defense ministry permission.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Finalize Plan on Fast-Track Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The fast-track approach toward West
African integration took a leap Monday when a regional technical
committee started finalizing an integration blueprint for adoption
by the region's leaders in Ghana's capital Accra.
</P>
<P>
About 200 dignitaries form the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) will attend a mini-summit to adopt the
plan, said Kwamena Ahwoi, Ghana's Minister of Regional Economic
Integration and Cooperation, in Accra on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The mini-summit will be the second of this kind after last one
held on March 27 this year in Abuja, Nigeria's capital.
</P>
<P>
The fast-tracking, which was initiated by Ghana and Nigeria,
covers the creation of a second monetary zone among Ghana, Gambia,
Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Guinea and Liberia, and the free movement
of goods, services and people in these countries.
</P>
<P>
It also covers such regional infrastructure projects as a rail
line between Accra and Lagos and the promotion of private sector
mutual investment.
</P>
<P>
The second monetary zone would later be fused with the African
Financial Community (CFA) Franc to achieve the objective of the
ECOWAS, Ahwoi said.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS has targeted 2004 as the year to achieve a single
convertible regional currency in area with a population of about
250 million.

<HEADLINE> Zambian River Faces Worsening Weed Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kafue River weed problem has
continued to deteriorate despite combined efforts by the Zambian
government and various environment bodies to control the water
hyacinth.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Tuesday quoted Environmental
Council of Zambia (ECZ) as warning that if no tangible measures
are worked out soon, developmental projects including
infrastructure on the banks of the river and living creatures
around it will face extinction in the very near future.
</P>
<P>
Without proper control measures, the hyacinth may adversely
affect some operations of the companies including Zambia
Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO), Zambia Sugar PLC and
Zambia Railways, ECZ said.
</P>
<P>
The major problem ZESCO is facing is the encroachment of the
weed on its turbines from which the power supplied to many parts
of the country and Lusaka in particular, is generated.
</P>
<P>
The spread of the weed will also lower the water level and make
 impassable the Kafue River, one of the three major branches of
the Zambezi River or the fourth longest river in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The weed has also affected activities including fishing, the
lifeline for some communities living on the river banks.
</P>
<P>
Aquatic Weed and algae Eradication Control Services (AWAECS)
has promised to jointly coordinate the prevention of the spread of
the weed with ECZ.
</P>
<P>
AWAECS will help eradicate the weed by chemical control
systems, using a special herbicide, which has been tested and
proved to be safe for both water and human life and has been used
in many countries for over 40 years now, according to AWAECS
project manager Chambika kamupila.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Allianz to Increase Presence in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Allianz, a major
global insurance provider, is considering cooperating with Chinese
insurers in promoting liability insurance in China.
</P>
<P>
Reinhard Schwarz of Allianz's Global Risk Division said here
recently that although China has just initiated liability
insurance, it has great potential in this area as the economy
maintains a high growth.
</P>
<P>
Schwarz predicted that liability insurance will develop most
rapidly in such industries as information technology, food, and
genetic engineering in China because these industries not only
bring about undoubted benefits but also pose huge potential risks.
</P>
<P>
Schwarz said that Allianz is especially willing to provide
liability insurance services to large Chinese manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Allianz began its business in China in 1917 and has had
representative offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
It jointly established the Allianz Dazhong Life Insurance
Company in Shanghai in 1998 with Shanghai's Dazhong Insurance
Company.

<HEADLINE> Regional Civilization History in South China Pushed Earlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A three-year long archeological
excavation in Xiaojin Village in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region has helped bring forward the local civilization
history by more than 44,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Yan Wenming, a professor with the Beijing University, affirmed
that the excavation proves that the Xiaojin Culture is a native
rather than an affiliation moved from other parts of the country
as formerly thought by most Chinese archeologists.
</P>
<P>
The site, some 100 km away from the famous scenic city of
Guilin, is encompassed by mountains. Large amounts of primitive
production instruments and utility devises belonged to the late
Neolithic Age were unearthed since the excavation was carried out
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists announced here that they had to reassess
the origin of the local history, which represents the typical
southern China primitive culture. They now believe that primitive
tribes inhabited in the region as early as 4,000-5,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Stocks of carbonized rice unearthed in the pit suggest the
level of primitive farming. Archeologists can also assessed the
standard of weaving and aesthetic based on the finds of stone
spinning wheels and stone bracelets.
</P>
<P>
Yan said that the archeological team has figured out the
chronic changes from the one meter deep relic layer, which is
rarely distinguishable.
</P>
<P>
They assumed that a primitive community consisted of some 60
members lived here for a pretty long period. They mainly lived on
farming and hunting.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still a mystery whether the tribe was a
matriarchy or a patriarchy, and where it was gone or how it
disappeared, Yan said. Intensive studies are now under way for all
the answers.
</P>
<P>
The South China Culture has been generally considered to have
come into shape much later than that in the north. But research of
some archeological finds in recent years are likely to push
forward the history of the former, which is still little known, as
observed by more Chinese archeologists.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province,
one of the country's economic powerhouses, has decided to take in
more talented peopled from Chinese students studying abroad as
part of its effort to improve the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhongfang, director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department
of Personnel, said that experts and professionals in areas like
finance, education, export-oriented economy, business
administration, machinery, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and
electronics industry are especially welcome.

</P>
<P>
A fair will also be held this year in Zhejiang for Chinese
students studying abroad to display and sell their scientific
research results, Chen added.
</P>
<P>

domestic product, has set the goal of leading the country in
realizing modernization.
</P>
<P>
The province has taken a series of measures to ease the
shortage in talented people since last year, including releasing
preferential policies and establishing industrial parks for
students studying abroad.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Pudong New Area has
four major state-level zones with different development focuses,
namely, Lujiazui, Jinqiao, Waigaoqiao and Zhangjiang.
</P>
<P>
The 28-square-kilometer Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone, along
the Huangpu River, has 83 financial facilities from both home and
abroad, including 42 foreign banks. Twenty-four of the foreign
banks have been licensed to engage in Renminbi business.
</P>
<P>
The zone is home to six state-level markets, approximately 200
skyscrapers, 103 Chinese foreign trade companies, and a sizable
exhibition hall. Lujiazui and the Bund on the western side of the
Huangpu River, are expected to form Shanghai's central business
district (CBD) in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Jinqiao Exports Processing Zone, covering an area of 20 square
kilometers, lies in the central part of Pudong. It is home to the
manufacturing industry, where joint ventures with General Motors,
Bell, Sharp and other multinationals are located. Some 340
projects have been launched there, more than 80 percent of which
are in the high-tech category. The high-tech projects are involved
in four major sectors including automobiles, electronic
information, modern electric household appliances and bio-medicine.

<HEADLINE> China to Complete BSP System This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China's civil aviation sector is
to complete the introduction of the Billing and Settlement Plan (
BSP), a widely-used system initiated by the International Air
Transport Association (IATA), in October.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders said this is one of China's major endeavors
to standardize civil aviation administration.
</P>
<P>
They said that although China's civil aviation sector has
become profitable, there are still loopholes in management in this
area.
</P>
<P>
The BSP system is to simplify selling, reporting, and remitting
procedures for travel agency sales and the settlement of accounts
between carriers and their appointed sales agents.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, sales agents can issue standard tickets for
all the airlines joining in the plan, and all accounting and
settling are done within the system.
</P>
<P>
China decided to adopted the system in 1995 and has since made
significant progress in the effort.
</P>
<P>
IATA has had 150 BSPs around the world since the system was
initiated in 1971.

<P>
NANCHANG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of farmers
in east China's Jiangxi Province are moving to the western part of
China to make earnings.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, farmers would choose to work in economically-
advantaged coastal areas, but the trend has changed as China has
kicked off a national campaign to develop its western part.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 30,000 Jiangxi people went to
western China in March, and 11,000 farmers were from Xingguo
County alone.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 technicians from Dingnan County, known as "China'
s Sweet Pear Town", plan to build pear gardens in Yunnan and
Sichuan provinces in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that more than 200 farmers in Jinxi County
have gone to some west Chinese towns to grow vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The provincial labor departments have offered formal and
regular service for the farmers. One example is that Xingguo
County established special files for the farmers and helped them
to find jobs in western China.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes U.S. Sales of Aegis Destroyer, Radar to Taiwan: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese government demands
that the United States government prohibit all sales of advanced
weapons to Taiwan, including the Aegis-armed destroyer and long-
range radar, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi at a press
conference today.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on the recent U.S.-Taiwan military
consultations in Washington, Sun said that China is consistently
and firmly opposed to any U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and has
repeatedly lodged representations to the U.S. side on this matter.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government demands that the U.S. government
strictly observe principles enshrined in the three Sino-U.S. Joint
Communiques and prohibit all sales of weapons to Taiwan," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has made solemn commitments to the Chinese
side through various documents that it will gradually reduce and
finally terminate all arms sales to Taiwan, the spokesman pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the U.S. side will honor its promises, for
supplying weapons to Taiwan means lending help to the Taiwan-
independence activists and will seriously compromise cross-straits
relations, leading to further tensions across the Taiwan Straits,"
Sun commented.
</P>
<P>
Only when the U.S. side carries out its promises can the Sino-U.
S. relations continue to develop on a sound and stable track, and
the cross-straits situation be eased, Sun emphasized.

YINCHUAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Public Security Department
of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China has
recently issued new regulations to simplify the exit-entry
procedures.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of Ningxia's response to the country's policy

prosperous eastern China and less developed western China.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the regulations, foreign experts and
businessmen holding "L" visas can extend their stay in Ningxia
from previous one month to two months, or even three months under
special circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Besides, all eligible citizens in Ningxia can apply for private
passports only if they have a bank certificate proving that they
have a deposit of 4,000 U.S. dollars. For those who want to travel
overseas on business, they only need to submit an invitation
letter from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The time to go through necessary procedures for applying for
passports has been reduced to no more than 15 days.
</P>
<P>
Landlocked Ningxia is one of the 11 less developed areas in

<HEADLINE> Fatal Australian Encephalitis Cases Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Eight cases of the potentially
fatal mosquito-borne disease Australian encephalitis have been
reported in the last three weeks from the Northern Territory and
Western Australia.
</P>
<P>
A baby is in a critical condition and a 45-year-old Victorian
man in a serious but stable condition, The Communicable Diseases
Network Australia New Zealand said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Above-average wet season rains and flooding across the
mentioned areas has facilitated the breeding of huge numbers of
the mosquito which transmits the disease.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of Australian encephalitis include severe headache,
neck stiffness, high fevers, seizures in young children and
potentially delirium, coma and death.
</P>
<P>
AAP quoted a doctor as saying that "There is no cure and no
vaccine."
</P>
<P>
"The only sure way of preventing this disease is to avoid
mosquito bites altogether," the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
Encephalitis Protect Factbox were released by the Australian
mass media to tell residents how to avoid being stung by
mosquitoes.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Rate of Unemployment Estimated to Exceed 55% till 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment rate in Angola is
estimated to exceed 55 percent in the year of 2001, mainly due to
the poor state of health and the level of the education system,
Angolan Minister of Education and Culture Burity da Silva said
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to da Silva, the unemployment rate next year will
range between 55 percent and 65 percent in the war-torn southwest
African country. The minister predicted that it will have
negative consequences on the local level of production, and
clearly reflects the rate of poverty facing the Angolan people.
</P>
<P>
He said that if appropriate policies are not adopted, the high
unemployment rate might also result in a sick population,
unproductive industry and negative impact on the social-economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the country's current context, the minister said
the efforts made by the experts of education and health are
hindered by the promoters of violence in its extreme form, namely
the armed conflicts. "Our efforts in preserving life are
continuously hindered by those who promote, in gratuitous and
criminal way, the loss of human lives", he said.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Close Mixed in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed mixed in Tokyo
Tuesday, with the benchmark Nikkei index ending below 19,000
despite Monday's sharp rebound on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed below 19,000 for the
first time in 12 weeks, losing 39.12 points, or 0.21 percent from
Monday's close to 18,969.52.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index which covers all
First Section issues, however, rose 43.94 points or 2.83 percent
to 1,596.40.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 749.15 million
shares from Monday's 875.11 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Steel maker NKK was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei hit the day's high of 19,330.40 just after opening

traders said.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei, however, turned downward shortly as investors
heavily sold issues to be deleted from the key index's components
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Helped by the gain on Wall Street and the U.S. dollar's rebound
to the mid-104 yen range, export-oriented high-tech blue chips
were higher, while information and technology issues also regained
upward momentum.

<P>
Brokerages, Monday's worst performers, drew active buying.

percent over the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Most Profitable Businesses In China: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists have predicted
nine most profitable businesses, most of which are related to the
commerce industry, in China in the future.
</P>
<P>
An analysis by local economists on the Beijing Economic Daily
quoted shows that sales of household electrical appliances will
enjoy a continuous boom under the sustained growth of China's
national economy. The returns of the investment in this sector
will reach 10-35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications sector will be one of the largest business
in China because of its great potential market. At present, the
availability of phones to Chinese citizens now stands at a meagre
four percent, much lower than the world average of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
House interior decoration is expected to undergo a faster
development as more and more people are expected to spend more
money in this consumption area. The house interior decoration
expenditure per household is 20,000 yuan (about 2,410 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The real estate sector will be more prosperous as individual
purchase of housing will account for the bulk of the market. Also,
sales agents and consultants are believed to be well-paid.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, with more private cars going into homes of
ordinary citizens, related businesses such as car maintenance and
car washing will also be boosted.
</P>
<P>
Other profitable businesses include tourism, fast-food industry,
and products for the elderly and women.

</P>
<P>
-- Israel's ministerial committee for the economy decided Monday
to build a facility capable of desalination 50 million cubic meters
of saltwater annually, with an option of doubling the figure in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The decision was reached after a discussion on how to deal with
the ongoing water crisis, concluding the committee's long argument
over bringing desalination to Israel. The cost of the facility is
estimated at 150 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The committee also decided to open negotiations with the Turkish
government to receive quotes for a 5-year contract to purchase an
annual quantity of some 45 million cubic meters of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- At the initiative of Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ehud
Barak, the security cabinet is expected Tuesday to discuss and
approve a bill that would empower the defense minister to authorize
holding "enemy fighters in detention for the purpose of "redeeming
prisoners of war."
</P>
<P>
The panel is expected to pass the measure and then refer it to
the Knesset (Parliament), which may convene in special session as
early as Tuesday to put it to a preliminary vote, senior government
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The measure is being introduced after the Supreme Court Monday
rejected a desperate measure by families of those missing in action
to reverse a court ruling last week to free 13 Lebanese detainees
in Israeli prison.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Big-name stocks rallied back Monday surging into the close
amid hopes that Wall Street had hit bottom in last week's punishing
selloff. Most other stocks fell again, however, as bargain hunters
remained leery of smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
In Tel Aviv trading Monday, prices were mixed in tense
anticipation of how the trading would fare on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day, the benchmark Maof index gained a
moderate 1.5 percent, the Tel Aviv 100 index was up 1.3 percent,
and the Teltech went up by 1.8 percent after Sunday's 17 percent
free fall.

The New Zealand move coincides with an open debate on general

degradation to civilian populations, far in excess of the damages
inflicted by armed conflict and war."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Behind Booming Pudong (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overall planning has been another factor contributing to the
success of Pudong, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The development of Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone, for example,
consulted master designers from Britain, France, Japan and Italy,
thus avoiding haphazard construction.
</P>
<P>
At present, Lujiazui's landscape is marked by a glittering
collection of high-rises including Jinmao Tower, China's highest.
According to a blueprint, Lujiazui will serve as an integral part
of Shanghai's central business district, along with the Bund on
the western side of the Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
Jim M. Lee, general manager of the Intel Technology (China) Ltd.
, said that he was impressed by the working efficiency of local
government officials, who are helpful in solving problems, like
handling customs affairs.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qifan, deputy secretary general of Shanghai Municipal
Government, and chairman of Shanghai Economic Commission, believed
that in Pudong, China introduced a new model of opening up and
development.
</P>
<P>
Different from Shenzhen or Hainan special economic zones in
southern China, Pudong was developed in an area bordering a
booming town, the Shanghai proper, while Shenzhen started from a
fishing village and Hainan from an underdeveloped island.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pudong's development has focused on finance, trade
and other service industries.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Chinese government has been encouraging
Pudong to take bold steps in reforms, making it an experimental
field for the opening-up drive. For instance, in 1997, Pudong
became the first place in China where foreign banks were allowed
to handle Renminbi, the local currency.
</P>
<P>
"Pudong is sure to become as active as London, New York, and
Singapore in finance so long as it keeps on moving forward," said
Toru Mitarai, president of the Sanwa Bank Shanghai Branch, whose
business has kept expanding in China.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wang Lengyi, a member of the Shanghai Academy of Social
Sciences, said that Pudong's success has been built on Shanghai's
solid economic basis and promoted by its profound culture.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, officials say Pudong will continue to lead the
country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"Pudong's future advantage lies in becoming a forerunner of
China's deregulation in finance and trade after the country's
entry to the World Trade Organization," said Hu Wei, executive
deputy director of the administrative committee.
</P>
<P>
 Its geographical location, easy access to capital, abundant
talented personnel and speedy delivery of information, will add to
its superiority, Hu said when reviewing Pudong's first decade, and
previewing the next.

ZHENGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China plans to set up a tap
water plant with advanced technology on the banks of the Yellow
River in Zhengzhou, capital of central China's Henan province, in
collaboration with France.
</P>
<P>
Each side will hold 50 percent of the cooperative project, and
Jacques Letondot, managing director of the Suez Lyonnaise Des Eaux
of France, said that they are quite optimistic about the 30-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
Zhengzhou officials said tap water plant, with an investment of
37.8 million U.S. dollars, will not discharge any waste water,
residue, or gas, and will use hi-tech French equipment.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the project is expected to have a positive
influence on pollution control and water and soil erosion along
the Yellow River.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nothing Unusual in Breakup of South Pole Icebergs: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese South Pole expert has
described the recent breakup of three huge icebergs at the South
Pole as nothing unusual.
</P>
<P>
Xie Simei, a member of China's 14th South Pole Expedition Team,
told reporters today that icebergs at the South and North Poles
break up every year, especially in summer when drifting icebergs
are easily seen via satellite images.
</P>
<P>
Icebergs covering a total of 3,000 sq.km. melted last year,
said Xie, who is also head of the Polar Region Forecast Group
under the State Maritime Administration.
</P>
<P>
Reports of the three huge icebergs that broke up and have been
drifting for the past month have caused concern over their effect
on the global climate, as one of the icebergs is about 10 times
the size of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Xie said the breakup was not the result of global warming as
many people believe, arguing that gravitation, warm weather, and
tidal activity are the causes of the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The Antarctic is covered by ice and snow as thick as 2,000
meters, and icecaps on the brim of the continent can easily break
up piece by piece and slip into the sea due to the temperature and
tidal effects, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The continent loses some icebergs, but gains in snowfall each
year to maintain the balance, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Should Improve Chip Designing Capability: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China should expand the
application of integrated circuitry as a first step in the
development of the chip designing industry, a seminar was told in
Shanghai Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hui Yongzheng, vice-minister of Science and Technology, told a
seminar on development of the micro-electronics industry in China
that the country must become able to develop chips on its own for
application in national defense, national security, and key
economic sectors, according to Monday's Shanghai-based Wenhui
Daily.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, at least 40 percent of the chips for these
sectors should be locally produced, while 30 percent of the chips
for integrated circuits, consumer goods, and telecommunications
should be locally designed and produced, the vice-minister said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was sponsored by the Ministry of Science and

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Yet to Benefit From Transit Accord With Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Lack of concrete measures to
improve rail and road infrastructure is depriving Bangladesh of a
huge amount of foreign exchange earning from transit facilities
for Nepalese commodities, the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said Bangladesh could also develop its trucking
industry and create employment opportunity for a large number of
people in the service sector just by providing access to Mongla
Port, 200 km south of Dhaka, for a major portion of the over one
million tons of goods the land-locked Himalayan Kingdom exports
and imports every year.
</P>
<P>
Although Dhaka and Kathmandu had signed a transit agreement
more than two and a half years ago on September 1, 1997, the route
is still to be operational in the true sense through removal of a
number of impediments and the immediate signing of a comprehensive
motor vehicle agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The opportunity of handling almost the entire bulk of the
Nepalese cargo is now lost to Bangladesh as the cargo is routed
through India's Calcutta Port.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Nepalese businessmen are very much
interested in using Mongla Port for transshipment of their goods,
but they are unable to use the port properly due to poor road
communication between the transit point and the port.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the country believed that in the long run, nearly
100 million U.S. dollars would have to be invested for improvement
of road communication between the country's northern districts and
Mongla Port to make Bangladesh-Nepal transit route operational.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh could expect to get a quick return from the
investment as Nepal would be able to transship over one million
tons of cargo through Mongla Port instead of Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
The experts also noted that the Nepalese economy and the
businessmen would also immensely benefit from shipment through
Mongla Port as transportation through Bangladesh would be cheaper
and faster.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Chief Meets U.N. Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesia Military (TNI) and
the United Nations Peacekeeping Force (UNPKF) in East Timor are
both committed to jointly solving any problem arising on the
border between East Timor and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Through cooperation based on mutual understanding between the
two sides, we hope all problems in the field can be properly
solved," TNI Commander Admiral Widodo A.S. said after a meeting
with UNPKF Commander Maj. Gen. de Los Santos at Laktutus village
near the East Timor-East Nusa Tenggara province border on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Widodo said he had met Santos several times before but Monday's
meeting at the foot of a hill was of special significance "as we
are both strongly committed to forge relations of mutual
cooperation to settle any border problem that may arise."
</P>
<P>
On April 11, the TNI and the UNPKF have signed a new agreement
on coordination of the maintenance of security in the border
regions between East Nusa Tenggara and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Laktutus in Rasifeto Barat sub-district, about 45 kilometers
south of Atambua, was one of two villages where Widodo inspected
TNI border posts. The other village he visited was Builal in
Lamaknen sub-district.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on his tour of the border regions, Widodo said he
wanted to personally observe conditions in the field.
</P>
<P>
"I am visiting the border with the three service chiefs (army,
navy and air force) and several other military officials to see
conditions in the field," he was quoted by the Antara News Agency
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Widodo said the stationing of the soldiers at the border was an
important part of the government's effort to maintain a real
capability to act swiftly to settle border problems.
</P>
<P>
On the question of East Timor refugees who were still staying
in East Nusa Tenggara, Widodo said the Indonesian government fully
supported their repatriation.
</P>
<P>
He said 155,000 out of an initial 280,000 refugees had already
been repatriated.
</P>
<P>
"We always support those who wish to return to East Timor and
try to seek resettlement for those who wish to stay," he said.

<HEADLINE> hke041817 --Philippines Urged to Improve Technology, Productivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines needs to upgrade
its capacity to improve technology and productivity if it wants to
be at par with its neighboring countries in terms of industrial
development, an academic report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper, entitled "Designing S &AMP; T Policy for the new
Millennium," is an outcome of the joint effort of the Institute of
Developing Economies and the University of the Philippines School
of Economics.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines lags behind its Asian neighbors in
productivity and technological development. This does not deny
that some domestic firms, particularly the conglomerates, operate
at the frontiers which allow them to compete in the global market,
but there are only a few of them," the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the constrained capacity of the economy to absorb and
adopt innovations has only caused its gap with technological
leaders to widen over the years," the paper added.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the problem has long been diagnosed and
very few Filipinos are skilled in science and technology labor.
</P>
<P>
The recent count of research and development personnel in the
country, the paper said, is placed at 155 scientists and engineers
per million population, far below the standard of 380 scientist
and engineers per million population, which was set by the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

<HEADLINE> ADB Lends 5 Billion Dollars in 1999 (Embargoed Till 16:00 GMT, Tuesday, April 18) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Tuesday that it approved 66 loans totaling about 5 billion U.
S. dollars in 1999 for 52 projects, of which about 40 percent was
focused on poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the ADB approved a poverty reduction strategy
that elevates poverty reduction as the overarching goal of its
operations, the Manila-based bank said in its 1999 Annual Report
released here.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, ADB continued to extend financial assistance to
countries hit by the financial crisis, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It provided nearly 100 million dollars in grants from its newly
created Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility in the form of
technical assistance and interest payment assistance to the
countries worst hit by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Of the total lending in 1999, concessional loans from the Asian
Development Fund (ADF) to countries with low per capita gross
national product and limited debt repayment capacity rose 8
percent to over 1 billion dollars, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said China received the largest share of lending (
eight loans totaling 1.2 billion dollars for six projects) and
technical assistance (28 grants for nearly 20 million dollars) in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Other top borrowers in 1999 include Indonesia (1 billion
dollars), India (625 million dollars), Pakistan (402 million
dollars), Thailand (363 million dollars), Bangladesh (332 million
dollars), Vietnam (195 million dollars) and Sri Lanka (183 million
dollars), it sad.
</P>
<P>
"Loans from ADF made up 22 percent of total lending while the
rest came from ADB's ordinary capital resources (OCR)," it said.
</P>
<P>
Since ADB started operation in 1966, its cumulative lending as
of 1999 has amounted to 82 billion dollars in public and private
sector loans involving 1,550 projects in 38 developing members.
Nearly 2 billion dollars have been provided in technical
assistance grants and 600 million has gone to equity investments
and underwritings.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Water Situation A "Human Tragedy": ADB  (Embargoed Till 16:00 GMT Tuesday, April 18) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Tuesday described as "a major human Tragedy" Asia's water
situation and urged Asian governments to take the improvement of
the situation as one of their highest priorities.
</P>
<P>
In its 1999 Annual Report released here, the Manila-based bank
said that some 830 million people in developing Asia and the
Pacific do not have safe drinking water, and more than 2 billion
people lack sanitation facilities.
</P>
<P>
"In ADB's DMCs (developing member countries), an estimated 737
million people in rural areas and 93 million in urban areas still
have no access to safe drinking water," it said in the report's
theme chapter "Water in the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
The bank said that access to sanitation is denied to 1.74
billion people in rural areas and 298 million in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major human tragedy; provision of such services to
all people should be one of the highest priorities of all
governments," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that while water pollution is the region's most
serious environmental problem, water scarcity will soon affect
food security in some parts of the region, which could lead to a
heightening tension between countries sharing the water resources
of international rivers.
</P>
<P>
Many Asian cities, where 56 percent of the population will live
by 2025, are ill equipped to provide their growing population the
safe water and sanitation they need, and up to one in four in the
region lacks formal sanitation, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said the poor are most prone to disease caused by unsafe
drinking water and inadequate sanitation.
</P>
<P>
"Almost 250 million cases of water-borne disease -- and 10
million deaths -- are reported worldwide each year," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said its water projects promote integrated water
resource management and it also encourage private sector water
initiatives through direct financial support.
</P>
<P>
At the policy level, the ADB said, it helps governments develop
master plans for the management of critical resources.

<P>
SEOUL, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Seoul Tuesday proposed to Pyongyang
that preparatory meetings be held at the truce village of
Panmunjom Saturday for the agreed inter-Korean summit on June 12-
14.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was conveyed through inter-Korean Red Cross
liaison officers at Panmunjom on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the South Korean government, (South) Korean
National Red Cross President Chung Won-shik asked Jang Jae-on of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Red Cross to
convey the proposal to the DPRK government.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A drought has hit South Korea over
the past two months, the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The KMA forecast that the drought will continue for some time
and affect negatively the growth of onions, garlic and other
spring crops.
</P>
<P>
Rains will set in on Wednesday and Friday across the nation but
they are not enough to quell the drought, said the administration.
</P>
<P>
Dry weather was registered for Seoul and Kyonggi and Kangwon
provinces for the past 59 days, the longest spell of drought
recorded in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Seoul has received just 95 millimeters of rain since March 1,
the least since 1907 when the country began to keep record on
precipitation.
</P>
<P>
The country's four major dams -- Hapchon, Imha, Chungju and
Juam -- had a total of 5.9 billion tons of water as of Monday,
down 1 billion tons from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
A strong high atmospheric pressure continues to reside in the
Korean Peninsula, preventing a low atmospheric pressure from
approaching.
</P>
<P>
Some rains that fell in the southern part of the country
recently did not help stop the spring drought, said the
administration.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Declines to Include Mia Audina on Olympic Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) has declined to include Mia Audina on its Olympic
team, according to PBSI Chairman Subagyo Hadisiswoyo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on PBSI's action to the International Badminton
Federation (IBF) letter asking Indonesia to field Mia, world
ranked 11, in the Olympics, Subagyo said Mia had moved to the
Netherlands and plays for her new country.
</P>
<P>
"I allowed her to follow her husband to the Netherlands and
play for the new country. It's her business with the Badminton
Association of the Netherlands. It has nothing to do with us
anymore," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Mia, former Indonesian badminton star, left for
the Netherlands in July last year to reside with her Dutch-
Surinamese husband.
</P>
<P>
The IBF's letter asked Indonesia to include Mia on the national
team if the International Olympic Committee (IOC) turned down the
request of the Netherlands to allow her to represent the country
in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"She has not sent us a personal letter asking us to include her
in our team," Subagyo added.
</P>
<P>
PBSI Secretary General Leo Chandra Wiranata said the IBF and
IOC rules state that a player could perform for his or her new
country after staying in that country for two and three years
respectively.

BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists announced
Monday they are close to finishing their quota to sequence
chromosome 3, about 30 million base-pairs of the human chromosomes,
the Beijing Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chen Runsheng with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (

to decipher chromosome 3, which accounts for 1 percent of human
genomes to be deciphered.
</P>

Chinese scientists joined last September a nine-year old
international project aimed at deciphering human genomes by 2003,
which determine the health and longevity of human beings.
</P>
<P>
China was the only developing nation to participate in the
project, which also involves the United States, Japan, Germany,
France and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say sequencing all of the human genomes lays a
foundation to decipher the genetic codes of humans, and may also
help develop genetics-based therapies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Parents Told to Avoid Traditional Errors in Family Education (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The China Comment, a leading
periodical on current political affairs in the country, published
recently an essay entitled "Four Major Errors in Family Education",
urging Chinese parents to give up traditional and wrong practices
in family education.
</P>
<P>
The article, by Wang Xiaochun, a researcher from the Beijing
Basic Education Institute, describes the practices as "Greenhouse",
"censor", "sequencing" and "great expectation".
</P>
<P>
In the first category, the parents, forgetting the fact that
the family is only the starting-point for the education of a child,
turn the family into a "greenhouse" where the child is coddled and
becomes weak physically and psychologically and could not stand
the winds and rains outside of the "greenhouse".
</P>
<P>
The article warns that the "family greenhouse" should not keep
too much higher a temperature than school and society. If it does,
the child may feel too much colder, psychologically, when leaving
home. The "family greenhouse" should gradually lower its "
temperature" as the child grows up, otherwise, the child could
never grow up, the article says.
</P>
<P>
In a family where the parents are very censorious and critical
toward the child, the child generally lacks self-confidence. The
parents base their practice on a wrong theory which says that a
good child could only be made through criticism, the parents are
authorized to correct the child, and a good child means a child
without any fault.
</P>
<P>
But as education experts have put it, children need to be
praised for their merits, a good child is made by praise, and to
develop a child's strong points is the best way to overcome his
weak points.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Parents Told to Avoid Traditional Errors in Family Education (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For parents who like to "sequence" their child among his
classmates or schoolmates in academic level, they would turn the
child into someone who only cares about his academic scores but
not creativity, and lacks team spirit and real competitiveness,
the article says.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it says, sequencing the examination scores is not a
scientific way to find out the overall capabilities of a child.
Good parents should dilute their sense of "sequencing" and,
instead, they should help their child increase the sense of
competitiveness and creativity, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
The development of a nation does not rely on academic titles
but creativity and competitiveness, it says.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese tradition, all parents pin high hopes on
their child. Parents have the rights to hope that their child
become a "dragon" in future but they can not force their child to
become a "dragon", the article says. It advises that the parents
should not try to plan for the child's whole life in accordance
with their "great strategy".
</P>
<P>
The child is independent and should choose his own way of life,
the article says. What the parents should do is to create various
conditions for the child to develop his or her talents.

<P>
JAKARTA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- About 30 percent of the 3.5
million babies born in the last two years in Indonesia had serious
malnutrition, according to State Minister of Women's Empowerment
Khofifah Indah Parawansa.
</P>
<P>
"Many of these babies were born weighing less than two
kilograms because of their mothers' poor health," Khofifah was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition has been prevalent among newborns and infants in
rural and urban areas since the economic crisis that hit the
country in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Many babies were born underweight because their mothers,
especially those from young families, suffered malnutrition," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Their growth would be retarded, both physically and mentally,
she said, adding that unless help came quickly, they would become
"the lost generation."
</P>
<P>
"These children will likely face a dark future and they will
become a serious social problem for the nation," she said.
</P>
<P>
Khofifah, who also heads the National Family Planning Board,
called for a nationwide campaign to address the problem of
malnutrition and its impacts on women and children.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Sweden attaches importance to
developing relations with China and hails the progress China has
made during the past few decades, the Swedish Foreign Ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Sweden has devoted much attention to contacts and cooperation
with China, the world's most populous country, since they
established diplomatic ties on May 9, 1950 and particularly during
the past 20 years when China's role in international politics and
economy has become "more and more evident," the ministry said in
an information sheet.
</P>
<P>
The information sheet was released recently to commemorate the
50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China occupies "an important place" in the Swedish government's
Asian strategy which the parliament adopted last year, and
developing relations with China has become "a central element" in
its foreign policy, according to the information sheet.
</P>
<P>
It's beneficial to both countries to enhance exchanges in as
many fields as possible, it said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of trade, the ministry said China has become Sweden's
second largest trading partner in Asia, and that the country's
export to and import from China has increased rapidly during the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
It welcomes China's entry into the World Trade Organization,
believing that it can help Swedish enterprises to expand their
operations in China.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will organize a series of activities to
celebrate the anniversary, including a visit to China of a Swedish
delegation in May this year to be led by Deputy Prime Minister
Lena Hjelm-wallen, the information sheet said.

BUDAPEST, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Hungary has achieved a balanced
budget with a sharp reduction in state deficit for the first
quater of this year, said the Central Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figure released by the bureau,
Hungary's budget deficit for the first quater this year dropped by
49.3 percent to 153.4 billion forint (572.4 million U.S. dollars),
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The country's budget deficit for 1999 was 441 billion forint (1.
66 billion dollars), 0.7 percentage point down from 1998's level
and 17 billion forint (63.4 million dollars) less than the planned
figure.
</P>
<P>
This year the deficit is estimated at 435.8 billion forint (1.
63 billion dollars), accounting for 3.5 percent of gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
However, experts warned that expenditures on agriculture in the
first three months have reached 137 billion forint (511.2 million
dollars), or 41.5 percent of the whole year's level, which is
likely to leave a negative impact on the implementation of this
year's budget plan.

were held against the background of strong recovery of the world
economy following the financial crisis in Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The Development Committee, the policy-setting group of the
World Bank, stressed in the communique issued Monday the
importance of international trade and poverty reduction for global
progress, equity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The committee urged the world's rich nations to do more to open
their markets to the world's poorest countries. And it also
pledged to work with the IMF to overhaul internal operations to
make both institutions more effective in fighting future global
financial crises.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of poverty reduction strategies, the committee
called on the IMF and the World Bank to allocate adequate
resources to support the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
process.
</P>
<P>
The committee also encouraged the governments of the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) to continue to work closely with
the World Bank and the IMF as well as other partners in pursuing
sound policies and delivering effective reform programs so that
the delivery of HIPC debt relief and the related poverty reduction
strategies can move forward as swiftly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Another communique issued Sunday by the International Monetary
and Financial Committee, the policy-making body of the IMF, said
the agency will continue to work toward making it more effective,
transparent and accountable so it can better prevent financial
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
The committee stressed it will seek greater debt relief for the
poorest countries and reiterated the critical importance of open
and competitive markets as a key component of efforts to sustain
growth and stability in the global economy and to reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the IMF-World Bank meetings, ministers of the
Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four (G-24) on International
Monetary Affairs also held the 63rd meeting. The participants
complained the current trade policy stance of industrial nations
constitutes a major barrier to their growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
The ministers emphasized in a communique the need for a well-
sequenced and balanced approach toward the further integration of
developing countries, particularly the poorest, into the global
trading system.
</P>
<P>
The G-24 consists of an important cross section of countries in
Asia, Africa and Latin America. Since its establishment in 1972,
the organization becomes the primary institutional mechanism for
the coordination of developing country positions on monetary
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The IMF-World Bank meetings were overshadowed by thousands of
anti-globalization protesters who failed in efforts to shut down
the sessions but succeeded in putting a spotlight on complaints
that both institutions have failed in their job of alleviating
global poverty.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators had complained during a week of escalating
protests that World Bank policies made poor countries even poorer
and that the bank and the IMF were not doing enough to aid debtor
states.
</P>
<P>
World Bank and IMF officials, for their part, declared a
victory because they were able to avoid the violent confrontations
that occurred last year in Seattle where police used tear gas and
rubber bullets to control the streets and a small number of
demonstrators looted and vandalized downtown buildings.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi province in northwest China
has decided to give special support to 20 selected high-tech
projects, local government officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The 20 projects for commercialization of research findings will
enjoy more preferential treatment than projects that involve
conventional technologies.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at fostering in three years 10 successful
high-tech enterprises each with annual sales exceeding 1 billion
yuan (120 million U.S. dollars), they added.
</P>
<P>
The selected high-tech projects have stronger competitive edge
and huge market potential, and they involve information technology,
home electric appliances, environmental protection, software
development, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
Despite its strong strength of science and technology, Shaanxi
has been slow in commercializing many high-tech findings, thus
hindering local economic development, the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
The local government has invited 20 high-tech firms to
undertake the projects, they said.

HOHHOT, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Efforts made by China's natural
conservation staff are turning Dalai Lake near China's north
border into a better home for birds.
</P>
<P>
A latest survey conducted by a group of scientists showed that
nearly 100 species of birds are now inhabiting around the lake
which has been set as one of China's some 1,000 nature reserves.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Mining Firms Delay Exploration Activities in Indonesia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Due to the security uncertainty
or financial problems, at least 16 foreign mining companies have
delayed their activities in Indonesia, a senior government
official was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 16 companies, which obtained their contracts of work
between 1996 and 1998 to explore and produce mineral resources
other than coal, were mostly in the exploration stage.
</P>
<P>
Some companies, which are mostly from Canada and Australia,
temporarily stopped their exploration due to security reasons
while others quit mining operations due to financial difficulties
encountered by their parent companies.
</P>
<P>
"With Indonesia's current uncertain social and economic
situation, it's understandable if people hesitate to invest here,"
said Simon Sembiring, director of mining development at the
Ministry of Mines and Energy.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia's newly founded democracy had resulted in
outbursts of regional discontent over mining and timber operations,
which many said have so far only benefited the central government.
The dissatisfaction has often led to conflicts between the local
community and mining companies.
</P>
<P>
The delay in the 16 companies' projects would result in a sharp
decline in investment spending in the country's mining sector
because each company generally spends about 5 million to 10
million U.S. dollars a year on exploration activities.
</P>
<P>
"There is no particular loss for Indonesia," Simon said. But he
added that the delay directly affected local workers who were
forced to leave their jobs.

<P>
YANGON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's domestic production of
edible oil is not meeting its demand and the country still has to
import a large amount of such oil from abroad, according to the
latest figures released by the country's Central Statistical
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar imported a total of 89.5 million U.S. dollars worth of
edible oil in 1999, a 26.63 percent drop compared with 1998.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar annually cultivates over 650,000 hectares of oil crops,
of which over 450,000 hectares are covered by groundnut, while
over 200,000 hectares by sunflower.
</P>
<P>
To gradually reduce the import of edible oil, Myanmar has
leased out large plots of vacant and virgin lands to private
entrepreneurs and provided the oil crop growers with agricultural
loans and advance payment for the purchase of the crops.

spends large sums of foreign exchange importing cement annually

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A majority of American
investors remain bullish about the stock market and the economy
generally, despite recent stock market declines, according to
results from a weekend poll released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Those who have sold or bought shares last year are even more
bullish than the general population, said the poll.
</P>
<P>
The results are from a survey of nearly 900 adults conducted by
the Angus Reid Group, one of North American's premier market
research and public opinion polling firms, over the weekend in the
wake of one of the biggest single day drops in U.S. stock market
history last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"So far," said the firm, on analyzing the results, "the recent
market upheaval has not eroded consumer confidence and most
Americans feel the economy remains strong."
</P>
<P>
Of the adults surveyed, 68 percent agree with the statement
that "the recent declines in the stock market are part of a normal
adjustment and the underlying American economy is as strong as
ever." Twenty-seven percent feel that "the recent declines point
to fundamental weaknesses in the American economy."
</P>
<P>
Over half of them say that they would advise their friends and
family to continue to invest in the stock market.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Internet Users Going Wireless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At presently, one-third of the U.S. population uses cell phones
for business purposes. Of this group, only 11 percent are
currently using them for data applications, said the report on the
research conducted by Cap Gemini America, an information
technology consulting service leader. In the research, based on a
survey of 1,000 Internet users in the United States, wireless data
applications entail using a cell phone to send and receive e-mail
or business/personal information.
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven percent of the future users explained that the
primary reason for using wireless data applications is that
someone else (i.e., the employer) pays for it. This was by far the
most important reason, according to the research, and consequently,
market growth will initially be driven by corporate initiatives
rather than consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier study by U.S. market research firm
International Data Corporation (IDC), more than 40 million U.S.
households are online, but there are more than 75 million cellular/
wireless services subscribers and more than 40 million paging
subscribers. By the end of 2002, there will be more wireless
subscribers capable of Internet access than wired Internet users
in the United States. When this happens, IDC said, there will be a
fundamental shift in the thinking of the Web community and the
information technology industry as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Steps Up Refuse Treatment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- With completion of the Datansha
Garbage Incineration Plant by 2001, this provincial capital of
Guangdong in south China will greatly expand its refuse treatment.
</P>
<P>
The plant built with a government funding of some 700 million
yuan will have an annual capacity of 126 million kilowatt hours of
electricity. It will consume 900 tons of garbage a day.
</P>
<P>
The city's households generate 4,300 tons of garbage a day or 1.
56 million tons a year. The figure will rise to 2.15 million tons
in ten years.
</P>
<P>
The municipal environmental protection department expected that
the fledgling commercial garbage treatment industry will be able
to consume 70 percent of the garbage then.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Datansha, the city government has also invested
in a number of high-tech garbage treatment plants. Guangzhou has
set up a household garbage classification center, where refuse is
sorted for separate treatment.
</P>
<P>
A landfill ground that costs 370 million yuan of investment was
launched early this year and will be completed by 2002. It is
designed to take in 2,500 tons of garbage a day, to be in
operation for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Also under construction are the Sanxin Biological Fertilizer
Plant, which will use biochemical technology to decompose kitchen
refuse into organic fertilizer, and turn waste plastics into
gasoline and diesel oil. The plant is expected to consume 450,000
tons of garbage a year, turning out 50,000 tons of fertilizer and
10,000 tons of gasoline and diesel.
</P>
<P>
The municipal environmental protection department is
negotiating with several companies from Japan and the U.S. for
joint ventures to generate electricity by burning refuse.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Expands Cotton Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Cotton has become the number one
export commodity in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, replacing garments and accessories.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the local Customs, the region
exported 40,000 tons of cotton at more than 42 million U.S.
dollars in January and February, an increase of 15 times year-on-
year and accounting for one third of the region's total exports in
the period.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is the largest cotton producer in China. Last year,
the region produced 135,000 tons of cotton, about one third of the
country's total cotton output.
</P>
<P>
Local trade officials attributed the rise in cotton exports to
a reform in the cotton distribution system, adjusted pricing in
line with international markets, and improvements in cotton
quality.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months, Xinjiang exported to Indonesia 12,600
tons of cotton worth of over 13 million dollars, to the Republic
of Korea 11,200 tons worth of some 12 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Malaysia were also big importers of Xinjiang
cotton.
</P>
<P>
The rise in cotton exports not only greatly reduced cotton
inventories, but also increased the income of local farmers, gave
a boost to Xinjiang's economy and helped the restructuring of
local textile industry, local trade officials said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Xinjiang exported its cotton mainly to Southeast
Asian nations, but it is also trying to tap new markets in Latin
America and Africa.

The House also raises over 100 yaks, grows several vegetable
gardens and rents out some apartments.
</P>
<P>
"Our 14-member staff are working very hard to look after the 59
old people, especially those who are bed-ridden," said Pasang.
</P>
<P>
According to Tibet's department of civil affairs, Tibet now has
eight welfare houses in urban areas accommodating 241 widows,
widowers, orphans and the handicapped. Thirteen urban welfare
projects are under construction across the region with an
investment of 73 million yuan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Foreigners-oriented Garments Market Loses Glamour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Yabaolu garments market,
which used to attract flocks of foreign business people and
tourists, has lost its glamour now.
</P>
<P>
The market, originally located along the four-hundred-meter
long Yabaolu Street, came into being in the year 1988. Over 4,000
Chinese traders sold clothing and toys with Chinese
characteristics, and tens of thousands of foreigners, among them
many Russians, would go there everyday for silk clothes, T-shirts
with Beijing Opera mask designs, and cheong-sams (Qipao) in the
over 2,000 boutiques.
</P>
<P>
Garment exports to Russia hit 800 million U.S. dollars in its
climax, accounting for a large proportion of the city's total
exports business.
</P>
<P>
A 30,000 sq m trade building was set up in 1998, wishing to
attract more foreigners. However, customers have decreased rapidly
due to the sluggish economy in Russia and the construction of
other shopping centers nearby.
</P>
<P>
Now one quarter of the trading hall is occupied by stalls
selling fresh vegetables, meat and fruits.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The government of
the Netherlands promised to China Monday that it will continue to
uphold the One-China policy and actively support China's bid to
join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
In her meeting here with visiting Chinese Vice Premier Li
Lanqing, Vice Prime Minister Annemarie Jorritsma-Lebbink, who
doubles as the Minister for Economic Affairs, said the Dutch
government attaches great importance to developing ties with China.
</P>
<P>
She noted that in recent years, with the joint efforts of the
two governments, economic and trade relations between the two
countries developed rapidly, featuring many successful projects.
Meantime, cooperation between the two countries in the field of
science and technology was strengthened, she added.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch vice premier said that the current official visit to
the Netherlands by the Chinese Vice Premier will help push forward
the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Li Lanqing, who arrived here Sunday on a three-day official

<HEADLINE> Construction on China's First Solely Foreign-Funded Hydropower Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Construction on China's first
solely foreign-funded hydropower station on the Yellow River will
begin soon, said an official from northwest China's Qinghai
Provincial Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Zhiganglaka Hydropower Station on the upper reaches of the
Yellow River is solely financed by the U.S.-based Aes TB Power
Company Limited jointly funded by the Aes Orient Inc and the Hong
Kong-based Truf Busy Group Limited.
</P>
<P>
The station, to be constructed at the juncture of Jianzha and
Hualong counties in Qinghai, will be the first medium-sized
station solely funded by a foreign investor and also the largest
foreign-funded project of Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
The station will cost about 1.3 billion yuan and have an
installed generating capacity of 192,000 kilowatts. The whole
project will be completed in three and a half years.
</P>
<P>
The station, only seven kilometers away from the Lijiaxia
Hydropower Station, is expected to generate 762 million kw of
electricity a year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Prefer Planned Consumption: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey by the China
Youth Daily shows that most young people are spending money
according to their family budget, but they are not saving as much.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted on more than 8,000 people from 31
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities across the
country. Among them, 64.3 percent are men, and 83.6 percent are
below 31 years old. More than 95 percent of people have a high
school or higher education.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 72.7 percent of the surveyed said that
spending in accordance with their family budget is the most ideal
way of consumption.
</P>
<P>
Experts said there are two kinds of family budget. One is to
spend money according to the amount of money they earn, and the
other is trying to earn as much money as the family budget needs.
</P>
<P>
Only 5.5 percent thought that to spend all the money they earn
is an ideal way of consumption, but as many as 13.9 percent of
people surveyed are actually spending all their income.
</P>
<P>
About 10.9 percent said they will try bank loans or credits to
buy houses or invest in other projects.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two percent said that their parents like to save as much
money as possible and 33.6 percent said they make plans and then
spend the money accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that very few people from the older
generation (about 1.4 percent) would agree to use bank loans or
credit to purchase consumer goods.

Gray's victory was even more remarkable as he had to fight back
from 5-1 down after O'Sullivan registered century breaks in three

In another match which started in the evening session, Welshman
Matthew Stevens established a commanding 7-2 lead over Malta's
Tony Drago.

<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- British police have advised
Galatasaray supporters to stay away from Leeds as the Turkish club
announced they would be travelling with 11 members of an anti-
terrorist squad.
</P>
<P>
Galatasaray fear reprisals following the stabbings of Leeds
fans Kevin Speight and Chris Loftus before the first leg in
Istanbul nearly two weeks ago - four Turks have formally been
charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Interior Minister Sadettin Tantan confirmed the special
force would travel after a request from Galatasaray.
</P>
<P>
West Yorkshire Assistant Chief Constable Paul Garvin said: "Our
advice to Turkish fans is not to attend the match. We hope people
will heed our advice.
</P>
<P>
"Turkish supporters have no ability to buy legitimate tickets,
so they have no reason to go to the ground other than for
potential trouble and to risk injury to themselves. We would
encourage Galatasaray fans not to travel," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Can Join EU Without Solution of Political Issue: EU Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus can join the European Union
(EU) without a prior solution of its political issue, European
Parliament member Mechtild Rhote said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rhote and Cypriot legislator Tassos Papadopoulos, co-
chairpersons of the 17th meeting of the Joint EU-Cyprus
Parliamentary Committee opening here Monday, told reporters that
Turkey cannot begin EU accession talks unless it withdraws its
troops from northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The EU Helsinki summit last December dispersed any ideas that
Turkey could obstruct Cyprus' EU accession, Rhote said.
</P>
<P>
She ruled out the possibility of separate negotiations with the
Turkish Cypriot side, whose breakaway regime in northern Cyprus was
recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
She expressed regret at the Turkish Cypriots' refusal to join
the Cyprus team by nominating their representatives in the
negotiations for Cyprus' EU entry.
</P>
<P>
"We want something concrete in the Cyprus question," Rhote said,
expressing the view that the situation as far as the Cyprus issue
is concerned has improved somewhat after the December EU summit in
Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
"It is in Turkey's interest to join the EU but Ankara must put
an end to its occupation of Cyprus' northern part as negotiations
cannot start until the troops withdraw and human rights in Turkey
are respected," Rhote said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when Turkey invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in reaction to a pro-
Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990 and started substantive
accession negotiations with the EU in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side has so far turned down an invitation by
President Glafcos Clerides to nominate representatives in the
official team negotiating the republic's EU accession.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Papadopoulos called on Turkey to comply with the
provisions of the Helsinki decisions, if it wants to start EU
accession negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Joint EU-Cyprus Parliamentary Committee meeting takes place
every six months to review Cyprus' ties with the EU. The two-day
17th joint meeting started Monday. The next meeting will be held in
Brussels in October.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
on Tuesday with Romanian Minister of State and Foreign Minister
Petre Roman and the two discussed the bilateral economic relations
and regional issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Roman told reporters after the meeting that Mubarak fully
supports the efforts to develop the ties of cooperation between
Romania and Egypt, especially in the economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
He termed the Romanian-Egyptian relations as very good, saying
that there are vast horizons for the economic cooperation within
the framework of the existing joint ventures and the projects under
assessment, including one for assembling tractors.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian official said he and Mubarak also discussed ways of
expanding trade, the volume of which now stands at about 300
million U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have agreed to make joint efforts to increase
the trade volume to 1 billion dollars in the coming few years, said
Roman, who arrived in Cairo on Monday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the main issues tackled during the meeting
was the Middle East peace process and its recent developments,
stressing that all parties realize the importance of Egypt's role
in helping push forward the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Romania intends to organize a ministerial meeting between the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe and its partners
in the Mediterranean basin, including Egypt, to enhance the
relationship between the two sides, he added.
</P>
<P>
Romania can play a role in promoting Egypt's interests in East
and Central Europe in view of Romania's unique location in the
region, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Erupt Among Palestinian Students in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- About 35 people including six
policemen were injured in bloody confrontations between two groups
of students from the Islamic University and Azhar University in
Gaza on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The confrontations started in the Hamas-dominated Islamic
University when supporters of Hamas tried to prevent some of
followers of Fatah, the mainstay of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, from sticking photos of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Fatah leader Khalil al-Wazir, according to Palestinian
sources.
</P>
<P>
The situation worsened when some students from the Fatah-
dominated Azhar University got involved in the clashes. The two
groups of students threw stones at each other and some of them
sustained injuries as a result.
</P>
<P>
All of the injured were hospitalized and some of them left the
hospital after being treated, Director of the Palestinian Police
General Ghazi al-Jibali said.
</P>
<P>
After the clashes broke out, the two universities' boards asked
the police to get into the two university campuses to restore
security and tranquility, according to Jibali.
</P>
<P>
Around 350 policemen riding in 50 vehicles rushed to the scene
to disperse the students.
</P>
<P>
The two universities have been sealed off to facilitate the
investigation into the bloody incident.
</P>
<P>
It was alleged that the clashes erupted partly due to the Hamas
students' anger over their defeat in the latest student elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Jibali said the Hamas students won the election of the
Islamic University with a 75 percent majority. The election of
Azhar University will be held next week, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Renew Support for Lebanon's Right to Resist Occupation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Tuesday
reiterated support for Lebanon's legitimate right to resist
occupation of part of its territory by Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued to mark the fourth anniversary of the Qana
carnage, the league called on the world community, especially the
United Nations, the United States and Russia, co-sponsors of the
Middle East peace process, to adopt all necessary measures to halt
Israeli continued attacks on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On April 18, 1996, Israeli armed forces killed a number of
Lebanese civilians, mostly children and women, in a refugee camp
while launching air strikes on southern Lebanon. Israel has been
launching incessant attacks on southern Lebanon since then.
</P>
<P>
The statement underlined the need for Israel to implement the U.
N. Security Council resolution 425 to immediately and
unconditionally pull out from all Lebanese lands to the
internationally recognized borders.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 to drive Palestinian fighters out
of the country. Following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the U.N.
Security Council passed resolutions 425 and 426, calling for
immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But Israel at that time refused to abide by the resolutions,
instead, it carved up a border strip in 1985 as a security zone to
allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
However, in a bid to pull out of the mire, Israel decided in
early March that it will withdraw its troops from south Lebanon by
July under the two U.N. resolutions, even without agreements with
Lebanon and Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League also urged Israel to release all Lebanese
captives and detainees held in its prisons and detention camps.

<HEADLINE> Italian Prime Minister to Address Senate over His Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
D'Alema offered his resignation to President Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi Monday evening, after his center-left coalition lost the
key vote on Sunday, but Ciampi told him to return to parliament to
resolve his crisis.
</P>
<P>
A debate is expected to follow D'Alema's appearance in the
Senate and should conclude the same day, Italian news agency Ansa
reported.
</P>
<P>
The consensus among observers is that D'Alema does not intend
to remain in office nor does he want to see parliament dissolved,
which would meet the Opposition's demand for snap elections.
</P>
<P>
Among the alternatives to elections is a new center-left
government headed by someone else in the coalition, in which case
Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato appears the most likely candidate,
or an"institutional" executive headed by Senate speaker Nicola
Mancino which would run government at least through next month's
referendum vote and perhaps into the Autumn, at most, the end of
the legislature next spring.
</P>
<P>
The center-left on Sunday saw its previous 9-6 advantage in the
regions reversed to a 7-8 disadvantage, a loss of three including
the key central region of Lazio and the northeast region of
Liguria, which gave the Freedom Front, allied with the Northern
league, total control of the wealthy and industrial north.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate of national voting, the Freedom Front
with North League got 50.7 percent of the vote while the center-
left plus  the hard-left Communist Re-foundation party got 45.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian former premier, the European Commission
President Romano Prodi Tuesday ruled out the possibility of
returning to Italy to replace Massimo D'Alema as head of a new
center-left government.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's spokesman Jonathan Faull told the press in Brussels
that it is unthinkable that the president would return to Italy.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UN Sanctions on Rebels Crucial for Angolan Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Angolan foreign minister Joao
Miranda will urge the U.N Security Council to reinforce sanctions
against the Angolan rebels in his address on Tuesday to the
Council session on the implementation of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the full implementation of the sanctions
will be vital to end the 26-year bloody war in the southwest
African country.
</P>
<P>
With abundant natural resources of oil and diamonds, Angola has
 great potential for economic development. But until today, its
still in a dream of the Angolans.
</P>
<P>
Decades-long civil conflicts has killed hundreds of thousands
Angolans and hindered the economic development in the country. And
the conflict is believed to be fueled by the failure of the
implementation of the UN sanctions on the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The UN has imposed sanctions on the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels led by Jonas Savimbi
since September 1993, including arms and diamond embargo, a ban on
travelling abroad for UNITA officials and their relatives, closure
of the organization's offices out of the countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the sanctions failed to prevent the rebels from
purchasing weapons with diamond trade from the black markets, and
the rebels have got much more revenue than the government from the
diamond mines, which supported their war machine.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the UN Sanction Committee on Angola, Robert Fowler,
made a report after a 30-country tour and a field investigation,
recommending punishment for the violators of the UN sanctions and
the creation of mechanisms of control.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Luanda for New York, Angolan Foreign Minister
Miranda said that he would urge the member countries of the
Security Council to agree on the recommendations in the report
issued in March, which identified several countries that violated
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Once the UN sanctions are effectively enforced, the rebels will
lose logistic support, and be forced to negotiate with the
government for a political solution.
</P>
<P>
At that moment, the Angolan government can spend more time and
money for the national reconstruction and the economic
development.

<HEADLINE> EU Decides to Start WTO Case with Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
executive body Tuesday decided to start World Trade Organization (
WTO) dispute settlement procedures against Chile over a swordfish
row.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said in a statement that the decision
will challenge Chile's unilateral ban on vessels of the EU
countries unloading swordfish catches in Chilean ports, which has
existed since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The decision to request consultations with Chile has been taken
after an investigation under the Trade Barriers Regulation (TBR)
revealed that the Chilean measures contravene WTO rules, the EU
executive said, adding it has taken this step with a view to
securing free and fair access to Chilean ports for EU vessels.
</P>
<P>
The Commission estimates that the injury suffered by the
fishermen from EU member states could be evaluated at around seven
million euros (about 6.7 million U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the Chilean measures render impossible the
importation of the affected catches into Chile and prevent access
to certain important markets, like the United States, which import
a considerable quantity of fresh swordfish from Chile," the
Commission said.
</P>
<P>
Since the first stage of WTO dispute settlement proceedings
consists in a consultation period, the Commission said it is
hopeful that an amicable solution can be reached with the Chilean
side without the need to proceed to a panel.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Tighten Monitoring UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angola has been engulfed in civil war almost continuously since
1975. Beginning in 1993, the Security Council imposed a series of
sanctions against UNITA as a means to pressure it to implement its
peace obligations.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include oil and arms embargo, restrictions on the
travel of senior UNITA officials, freezing of UNITA funds and
prohibition of flights of aircraft by or for UNITA.
</P>
<P>
But there have been reports of UNITA violation of sanctions,
resulting in deteriorating situation in the African country,
featured by refugee influx along border areas with Namibia and
Zambia. The number of war-affected Angolans has grown to 3.7
million out of a total of 12.6 million, U.N. figures show.
</P>
<P>
The resolution requests U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
set up a monitoring mechanism for further investigation into the
alleged violations with a view to improving the implementation of
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The resolution asks U.N. member states to consider the proposal
to convene one or more conferences of representatives of arms
manufacturing and exporting countries to stem the illicit flow of
arms into Angola.
</P>
<P>
It encourages the convening of a conference of experts to
devise a regime for curbing the illegal supply of petroleum
products into UNITA-controlled areas.

<HEADLINE> Study: One in Three American E-Commerce Firms Profitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to a general
conception that there are no profitable e-commerce companies, a
new study has found that some of them are making money.
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than a third of Internet retailers in The United
States are making a profit, according to the study results
released Tuesday by Shop.org, the trade association for U.S.
online retailers. A total of 412 leading Web retailers were
surveyed.
</P>
<P>
The study found that 38 percent of Internet-only companies, 72
percent of catalog companies and 50 percent of brick-and-mortar
stores with Web sites are profitable.
</P>
<P>
Even before last week's Nasdaq stock declines, several major U.
S. Net retailing companies already had suffered from sinking stock
prices and dwindling cash balances. Investors have been losing
interest in the sector, partly because of concern about
profitability and company stability.
</P>
<P>
But according to the study, total 1999 American online business-
to-consumer revenues across all categories grew 120 percent to 33.
1 billion U.S. dollars, representing 1.4 percent of all retail
sales in the country. An additional 13.1 billion dollars was spent
by businesses at retail Web sites in such categories as travel,
office supplies and computer software.
</P>
<P>
Internet shopping is expected to grow 85 percent this year to
reach 61.1 billion dollars, according to the study. The continued
growth is a result of the boom in the online population, an
increasing number of off-line retailers establishing a strong
presence online, and the emergence of new nontraditional retail
business models.
</P>
<P>
But, Net retailers face the same challenges as traditional
retail stores, including how to sustain customer loyalty, improve
order fulfilment and delivery capabilities and provide a "positive
shopping experience," according to the study.

<HEADLINE> British Playwriter Slams U.S. for Hypocritical Civilized Values </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- British playwriter Harold Pinter
Tuesday criticized the U.S. for its hypocritical civilized values.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an audience at the Aristotelion University in the
northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, where he was awarded an
honorary doctorate of Philosophy, Pinter said that the term "
civilized values"in the U.S. sounded like a joke.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Bill Clinton proclaims that the U.S. gave freedom to the
world. The U.S., in what values of our civilization do they
believe in? In a country with two million people in prison, in a
country where in prisons for juveniles children are incarcerated,
where guns are used, where torture is committed by remote control,
in a country where in 38 of its states the death penalty is still
in effect", he stated.
</P>
<P>
As for the danger of nuclear disaster, the renowned playwriter
said that the danger of nuclear disaster would not arise from the
"dangerous states" as the U.S. claims, but from the U.S. itself.
</P>
<P>
Pinter stressed that the U.S. proclaimed unabashedly that they
protected their interests through the use of military forces,
whenever and wherever was needed and the government of Britain
followed with an eagerness that deserves their disgust.
</P>
<P>
He also denounced NATO's military involvement in Yugoslavia
and criticized the British government for its policy.
</P>
<P>
"I feel ashamed of my country. Other countries also
participate in NATO but only the British government bent over and
kissed Clinton's feet," he said.
