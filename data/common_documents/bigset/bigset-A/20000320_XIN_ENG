<HEADLINE> Clinton Asked to Meet Kashmiris in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Governmental head of Pakistan-
administered Kashmir Sultan Mehmood Chaudhry Sunday urged U.S.
President Bill Clinton to hold a meeting with Kashmiris during his
upcoming visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"I invite President Clinton either to visit Muzzafarabad, the
capital of Azad Kashmir (free Kashmir) or spare time for a meeting
with Kashmiri leadership in Islamabad," the leader of Azad Kashmir
told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said he has written a letter to Clinton and extended him a
formal invitation for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Kashmiris are the real party to the long-running Kashmir
conflict and we are hopeful that President Clinton will listen to
All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC)," Sultan said. The APHC is
the leading Kashmiri group in the struggle against Indian rule
over the southern part of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is scheduled to have a brief stay in
Islamabad on March 25 and his agenda in Pakistan is not yet
available. However, he is expected to try to persuade India and
Pakistan to resume bilateral dialogue for the peaceful resolution
of the Kashmir dispute.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Visit Could Help Dialogue on Kashmir: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit to South Asia could prove helpful in resumption of dialogue
on the long-standing issue of Kashmir, a prominent journalist said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a Radio Pakistan program which discussed different aspects
of the visit, Arif Nizami stressed that the visit would prove
fruitful if the U.S. president pursues a result-oriented agenda.
</P>
<P>
He said the visit could help resolve the core issue of Kashmir
between Pakistan and India besides defusing tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's mere arrival will be advantageous for Pakistan, he
said, adding that India has failed to discourage Clinton from
including Pakistan in his itinerary.
</P>
<P>
Chances of an immediate resumption of dialogue on Kashmir are
not much bright, but Clinton can lay down the ground work for
progress on the issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton Arrived in India on Sunday to begin his week-long South
Asian tour, of which Pakistan is the last leg after Bangladesh and
India.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
flew in on Sunday evening, beginning his week-long South Asian
tour which will also take him to Bangladesh and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, the first U.S. president to visit India in 22 years,
was accorded a red carpet welcome at the Delhi Airport and met by
Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh and Foreign
Secretary Lalit Mansingh.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, National Security
Advisor Sandy Burger, Commerce Secretary William Daley and other
senior U.S. officials were among Clinton's entourage. Clinton was
also being accompanied by his daughter Chelsea and mother-in-law
Dorothy Rodham.
</P>
<P>
Delivering no arrival statement, Clinton got into his limousine
immediately after walking down the ramp and was driven to the
Maurya Sheraton Hotel in downtown Delhi, where he will stay on the
16th floor presidential suite.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will leave here on Monday morning on a single-day state
visit to Dhaka and will return to New Delhi by late night. His
formal state visit to India starts on Tuesday and will last until
March 25. He will also make a brief stopover in Pakistan on his
way back home.
</P>
<P>
Before he left Washington, Clinton expressed the hope that his
South Asian tour would help rekindle the relations between the U.S.
and India, ease tension in the subcontinent and achieve progress
on the nuclear non-proliferation issue. He also said he wanted to
support the "restoration of democratic rule" in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Just hours before Clinton's arrival, Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee said here on Sunday that the U.S. president's
visit would help further improve bilateral ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Indo-U.S. relations should be based on "
equal terms" and India would not take any decision "under pressure.
"
</P>
<P>
He also urged the United States to lift sanctions against India
imposed after the latter's nuclear tests in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, activists of Left-wing and other
organizations staged protest meetings and burnt effigies of
Clinton in several parts of the Indian capital. Similar activities
were reported from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and
Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh of north India.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Clinton Visit to Rekindle Ties With India By Xiong Changyi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
arrived here Sunday, beginning his seven-day South Asian trip,
including one day in Bangladesh, five days in India and a brief
stopover in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The trip is the first by a U.S. president to India in 22 years
and to Pakistan in 30 years and is the first ever to Bangladesh.
It is also a first trip by a U.S. president to South Asia after
the end of the cold war.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was given a red-carpet welcome at the airport and met
by Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh and other senior
Indian officials.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for South Asia, Clinton told reporters
that he would use this trip to rekindle the relationship with
India and to reduce tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about India, He said: "We have a lot of things we can
do together. Obviously, what I hope to do first is to rekindle the
relationship between the U.S. and India."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who earlier described the sub-continent and the Line
of Control in Jammu and Kashmir as the most dangerous place in the
world, said: "I want to do what I can to reduce tensions in the
Indian sub-continent, to reduce the likelihood of weapons,
proliferation and the likelihood of conflicts."
</P>
<P>
He also said he would make clear the U.S. view that a nuclear
future was dangerous for India, Pakistan and the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, newspapers here regarded his trip as a "watershed in
Indo-U.S. ties," saying his visit to India is expected to "usher
in a new dimension to Indo-U.S. relations."
</P>
<P>
As a big market, India became an attractive destination for U.S.
and other foreign investors. The U.S. remains the largest investor
in India while bilateral trade reached a level of 13 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999, with India beginning to have a modest surplus.
</P>
<P>
A positive outcome of Clinton's trip will be mainly in the
arena of economic relations covering trade, technology and
investments and the two countries could further enhance their
economic ties in the future.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sunday expressed
confidence that Clinton's visit will help further improve
bilateral relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he added: "Our relations should be based on equal
terms. We will not take any decision under pressure as far as our
security is concerned. Decisions will be ours."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee Saturday ruled out the signing of the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) during Clinton's visit, saying there was no
connection between the two.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to sign the CTBT during Mr. Clinton's visit,
but the issue will be discussed," he said.
</P>
<P>
India has also repeatedly opposed any third party mediation in
the issue of Kashmir, saying the issue can only be resolved by
India and Pakistan bilaterally.
</P>
<P>
India's leading newspaper Hindu said the assessment in both
Washington and New Delhi is that the more intensive Indo-U.S.
engagement to be initiated by Clinton will be far more important
than the various agreements that will be signed during the visit.
</P>
<P>
In that sense, it said, the "process" of Clinton's visit may
indeed be the most valuable "product" for Indo-U.S. relations.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Pledges to Fully Deploy 11,000 Troops in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A high ranking United Nations
Official Sunday pledged to carry out the organization's peace
mission in Sierra Leone, the largest of its kind currently in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Miyet, U.N. under-secretary general for peacekeeping,
said during a trip in Sierra Leone that the U.N. was determined
to deploy a full force of some 11,100 troops, as approved by its
Security Council last year.
</P>
<P>
There are already 6,000 U.N. troops in the West African country
 supervising a sluggish disarmament program designated by the Lome
peace accord signed last July between the rebels and government,
reports reaching here from Freetown said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are working very hard to get the remaining peacekeepers
quickly into Sierra Leone, so I think we are committed for the new
battalion of 5,000 from different countries and within three to
four months we will have them in Sierra Leone," Miyet said at a
press conference after arriving in Freetown Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Full deployment would make it the biggest U.N. force in the
field.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said that the head of U.N. peacekeeping
operations' arrival in the country's capital coincided with
Indian peacekeepers' final move into the town of Kailahun in the
east, a rebel stronghold for almost nine years.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force commander in Sierra Leone, Indian Major General
Vijay Jetley, said that troops loyal to former rebel leader Foday
Sankoh had obstructed the deployment of the U.N. force in
Kailahun district.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 civilians among the West African country's 4.
5 million people were killed and even more maimed in a civil war
started in 1991 and lasted nine years, between the government and
Sankoh led United Revolutionary Front guerrillas and some
disaffected soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Last year's Lome accord ended the war and gave former rebels a
full amnesty plus some cabinet posts. But due to long-time
misbelief and some other reasons, the dismobilization process of
the rebels was moving very slow.
</P>
<P>
Miyet is due to talk to President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and Sankoh
in separate meetings on Monday, before leaving on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Pope John Paul II Praises Jordan's Efforts for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Pope John Paul II praised Jordan on
Monday for its efforts to safeguard peace in the region after
touching down at the international airport of Amman for the first
papal visit to the kingdom in 36 years.
</P>
<P>
The pope was greeted by King Abdullah Bin Hussein, Crown Prince
Hamzah Bin Hussein and other royal family members at the airport 40
kilometers south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
In a welcoming speech, King Abdullah expressed his hope that the
landmark visit by the pope since 1964 would further promote
friendly coexistence between Christians and Muslims in the desert
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Paul II, in his reply speech, praised Jordan and King Abdullah's
efforts to realize peace, and to strengthen stability and security
in the Middle East, without which he said would be no authentic
development in the region, no better life for its people and no
better future for its children.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom has been an active peace broker between Israel and
its Arab neighbors after a peace treaty was signed between Jordan
and the Jewish state in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the first leg of a week-long tour by the pope to the
Middle East, which will also take him to Israel and Palestinian
territories in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving in Amman, the pontiff had said that his tour
would be purely religious in nature, but the visit was taken by
parties concerned as an impetus to the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit to Jordan, Paul II will visit holy
sites, meet religious leaders and chair religious ceremonies in the
kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM, Russian Envoy Discuss Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Rauf
Rawabdeh on Monday received Peter Stevni, personal envoy of Russian
Acting President Vladimir Putin, to discuss bilateral ties and
developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reviewed bilateral relations, especially in
economic fields, and ways of strengthening the role by Russia as a
major sponsor in the Mideast peace process, Jordan's official news
agency Petra reported without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting was Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel
Ilah Khatib.
</P>
<P>
The visit to Amman by the envoy was apparently part of Moscow's
efforts to keep alive its role in the Middle East peace process as
its influence is steadily decreasing in the region due to its
chronic economic difficulties at home.
</P>
<P>
For his part during the meeting, the Russian envoy conveyed to
Rawabdeh and Khatib Russia's willingness to develop ties between
the two countries in all fields, and to exchange views on various
issues of common concern in the region, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
The envoy also praised Jordan's key role of promoting peace in
the region after it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, the
second Arab country after Egypt to strike a peace treaty with the
Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Iran Arrests Assassins of Prominent Reformist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday arrested six people
for being involved in the assassination attempt on reformist
politician Saeed Hajjarian, head of Tehran Province Courts Abbasali
Alizadeh announced.
</P>
<P>
The person who shot at Hajjarian and his complice who drove the
shooter on a motorcycle were among the arrested, Alizadeh was
quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Alizadeh said four others embroiled in the killing attempt have
also been arrested, adding that the culprits are now in the hands
of the Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Terming the arrest a valuable gift at the beginning of the
Iranian new year started on Monday, the official said the arrest
has been done through cooperation of the people and efforts made by
security forces, Tehran's judiciary branch and the Interior
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, deputy chairman of the Tehran Municipal Council and
head of reformist daily Sobh-e Emrouz (This Morning), was gravely
wounded on March 12 in a shooting attack by two gunmen. A bullet
entered through his left cheek and was lodged at the back of his
neck.
</P>
<P>
Alizadeh said that the Intelligence Ministry is also in
possession of the motorcycle used in the assassination attempt as
well as a letter presented to Hajjarian on the scene of the
assassination in a bid to stop him from walking into the council
building.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the secretariat of Iran's National Security Council
said that the main culprit has confessed the murder attempt, IRNA
said.
</P>
<P>
Also a close adviser to President Mohammed Khatami, Hajjarian
played an important role in reformers' landslide victory in
parliament elections last month, a result which humiliated the
powerful conservatives.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, Venezuela Coordinate Positions on OPEC Market Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and Venezuela, two
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), on Monday coordinated positions on possible OPEC oil output
policy ahead of the cartel's upcoming ministerial meeting due in
Vienna on March 27.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser
Al-Sabah, visiting Venezuelan Energy Minister Ali Rodriguez said
the talks were in the framework of consultations with other OPEC
members.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the situation in the oil market to coordinate
positions on possible directions for the forthcoming ministerial
meeting," said Rodriguez, who arrived here earlier in the day on a
two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
But he said he didn't discuss any hike in future output or
targeted prices, noting that "it is for the ministers to decide on
the 'output and price' issue."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports quoted Rodriguez as saying in Baghdad, the
second stop of his current five-nation tour which also includes
Iran, Algeria and Libya, that he was satisfied with the current oil
price, although he called for efforts to make prices more stable.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Sheikh Saud made similar comments on his meeting
with Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
As there is only one week left before the OPEC bi-annual
meeting, its member states appear to be still at loggerhead over a
unified output and price strategy after the expiration of OPEC's
one-year production curb agreement by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Some OPEC states, including Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, have hinted
their support for an increase of production to bring down the high
oil prices on the world market, which recently reached a nine-year
high of over 31 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
But they are at odds with other fellow members over the timing
and amount of the discussed supply increase.
</P>
<P>
The five countries Rodriguez is visiting have shown less
enthusiasm for a hasty ease of the output limitation.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Determined to Buy U.S. Howitzers: Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti government said on
Monday that it was determined to buy the U.S.-made Paladin
howitzers, in spite of possible opposition from some parliament
members.
</P>
<P>
"The Defense Ministry is still wishing and insisting on
purchasing the American gun because the (Kuwaiti) Army needs it,"
Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah
told Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The government is backing the plan of the defense ministry,
but "we cannot press ahead with the purchase without the
parliament's approval," Sheikh Salem said.
</P>
<P>
The Public Fund Protection Committee at the National Assembly
(parliament) has been studying, since last December, the purchase
of the controversial Paladin howitzers in a deal estimated at some
400 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The committee is to report to the parliament about the deal
later this month.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait planned to equip three battalions with howitzers and has
received offers from several big powers including the United
States, which offered its M109 A6 Paladin howitzers.
</P>
<P>
In his previous remarks, Sheikh Salem had stressed the Kuwaiti
Army "is in dire need of the U.S.-made Paladin to fill the shortage
suffered by the land forces."
</P>
<P>
But the purchase sparked controversy in Kuwait's last
parliament, with some lawmakers strongly criticizing the government
plan on the grounds that the U.S-made Paladin is outmoded and not
compatible with the Kuwait armament system.
</P>
<P>
Defending the government decision to buy the U.S. guns, the
Kuwaiti defense chief once said the competing guns lacked several
technical details offered by the U.S., including the "possibility
to modify it according to our needs."

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Assumes Full Control of Chechen Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Federal forces hoisted a Russian
flag over Komsomolskoye Monday evening, signaling their full
control of the Chechen village that has witnessed fiercest
fighting in the past two weeks, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The village is located just four kilometers west of the
strategically important Argun gorge, where federal servicemen
encountered a big rebel group led by field commander Ruslan
Gelayev.
</P>
<P>
During the day, Russian troops mopping up the village ran into"
separate hotbeds of resistance," Interfax reported, citing a
source with the Interior Troops in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The streets were "strewn with the dead bodies of bandits,"
Interfax quoted a witness report as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether Gelayev had been captured. He was
earlier said to be hiding in an apartment cellar.
</P>
<P>
As many as 76 rebels have surrendered so far on Monday,Interfax
said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Russia's Acting President Vladimir
Putin visited the breakaway republic earlier Monday and vowed to
pursue the military campaign against rebels to the end.
</P>
<P>
Putin, flown in aboard a Su-27 jet fighter, also took part in a
ceremony seeing off a group of paratroopers.
</P>
<P>
"We have the choice of either finishing off the bandits here,
where everything has started, or to leave and to wait for them on
other Russian territory," Putin said. "We'd better do it here."
</P>
<P>
From Chechnya, Putin flew to Krasnodar, again aboard a fighter
jet. Many see the image of Putin aboard a military plane as a move
that would further boost his popularity, but his spokesman, Alexei
Gromov, said it was "primarily for reasons of security."
</P>
<P>
Putin also promised to rebuild Grozny, the Chechen capital, but
that will happen "after the city becomes a safer place to live in.
"
</P>
<P>
"The military have not yet removed all mines from Grozny, and
shooting can be still heard sometimes. Given this, we shall not
hurry, But the decision has been taken," he said.

<HEADLINE> Some 900 NATO Troops Pass Through Northern Greece for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 900 NATO troops, along with
60 military vehicles, early Monday passed through northern Greece
on their way to Kosovo for the participation in a scheduled
military exercise, codenamed the Dynamic Response 2000.
</P>
<P>
The NATO force disembarked at the northern Greek port of
Thessaloniki and marched in two groups towards the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the second NATO contingent to use the Thessaloniki
port for their way to Kovoso via Macedonia. Early Sunday, about 2,
000 U.S.-led NATO troops and some 50 amphibious vehicles left for
Kosovo after their landing at the ports of Thessaloniki Litohoro.
</P>
<P>
Describing the NATO troops transit as "a provocation for the
Greek people," the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) had organized a
protest against the NATO force moves.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which also has a strong battalion of 1,200 soldiers
participating in the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo, has
been concerned over the escalating violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Greece has made it clear that it will not take part in the
NATO exercise, which is expected to begin this month and last
until April 10.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou, who is in Moscow for
a visit, stressed Monday the need for all the inhabitants of
Kosovo to be able to live in a multinational society and for the
human rights of all the minorities in region to be respected.
</P>
<P>
Both Papandreou and his Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov urged
the international community to take strong action for the strict
implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolution 1244 to
ease the deteriorating situation in the province.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accidents No.1 Killer of EU Youngsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents are the
biggest killer of youngsters in the European Union (EU) countries,
the European Commission said in a report published Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report on the health of young people between 15 and 24
years throughout the EU shows that suicides come in the second
place as a cause of death. In both cases the death rates for males
are much higher than for girls: about 10,000 young males die in
traffic accidents each year, as opposed to 2,000 females. And
suicides account for one in 10 premature deaths.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the majority of young people in the EU
enjoy good health, and trends from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s
suggest further improvement. But certain chronic conditions, such
as asthma, allergies, diabetes, and obesity are increasing.
Moreover,inequalities in young people's health due to economic,
social and cultural differences within and between EU countries
are increasing.
</P>
<P>
The report of the 15-nation bloc's executive body also shows
that 50 to 80 percent of 15 year olds have tried smoking. In 1998,
one-fifth of all 15-year olds were daily cigarette smokers, and
the number of regular smokers increases among the older teenagers.
Because of the addictive properties of nicotine, most young daily
smokers continue to smoke regularly into middle age, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
One of the more disturbing trends is that regular alcohol
consumption begins at a younger age than it used to in the EU
countries, and that drinking to inebriation has become
increasingly common among young people, according to the report.
Boys still drink more heavily and more frequently than girls, but
the gender gap is narrowing in most EU member states.

<HEADLINE> International Energy Agency Says China Becomes Big Oil Buyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a report entitled ``China's Worldwide Quest for Energy
Security,'' the IEA said that from now to 2020, the volume of
China's oil import will increase by 26 percent to reach 400
million tons a year or 8 million barrels a day, more than the
projected net imports by Japan, South Korea, Australia and New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
``China's rapid growth since market reforms began 20 years ago
has sparked a surging demand for energy to serve an expanding
industrial and commercial structure as well as households with
rapidly rising living standards,'' said the IEA report.
</P>
<P>
It said that while in 1990 China still exported almost five
times as much crude oil and products as it imported, its imports
has swelled to twice the size of its exports in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that ``China still stresses the need
for an independent energy supply in the short run, accompanied by
an ambitious and costly energy development plan which covers oil
and natural gas, coal, eight new nuclear plants, ten or a dozen
new hydroelectric facilities and over 30 thermal power plants.''
</P>
<P>
``At the same time, China has aggressive trade and investment
strategies to position China for energy security in a longer-term
scenario in which much energy is imported,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that China adopted in 1997 a policy to
participate in the exploration and development of international
oil and gas resources.
</P>
<P>
``China is creating energy relationships all across the Middle
East, Southeast Asia, Russia, Central Asia and Africa,'' said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Two of China's biggest state-owned oil corporations, the China
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and the China National
Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC), are making investment in exploration
and production in at least 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC also plans to build a 4,200-kilometer long oil and gas
pipeline which will go from Russia and Kazakhstan through China's
western Xinjiang region up to its eastern coast.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 20 (Xinhua) The Netherlands has announced the
farm termination scheme for livestock farmers, the Dutch
government said Monday.

In addition, livestock farmers in areas where intensive stock
farming is concentrated will be able to apply for compensation for
the demolition of disused buildings following discontinuation of
their operations.
</P>
<P>
The cost for central government could reach a total of 304
million euros (298 million U.S. dollars), the Dutch government
said in a new release.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, DRC Hold Talks to Ease Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have taken effective
measures to ease tension between the two sides, South African
foreign minister Nkosazana Dlamini- Zuma said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini-Zuma, accompanied by Defence Minister Mosiuoa Lekota
and Safety and Security Minister Steve Tshwete, returned to South
Africa after meeting DRC President Laurent Kabila in southeastern
city of Lubumbashi, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini-Zuma said she believed the two countries had created an
 opportunity for an open dialog between the two sides but she did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The past few weeks had seen an escalation of hostile rhetoric
by Kabila toward South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kabila alleged that South Africa was taking sides in his
country's ongoing conflict with rebel forces. He also accused
South Africa of supplying rebel allies Rwanda and Uganda with
weapons. South Africa has refuted the allegations.
</P>
<P>
"This visit acted as an ice-breaker to clear the air,"
Dlamini-Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
She reiterated to Kabila that South Africa had not sold weapons
to any of the parties involved in the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
She also restated that South Africa would continue acting as an
honest broker in an effort to end the war.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa will continue to talk with all the parties
involved without taking any sides," said the foreign minister.

<HEADLINE> PAC Head Calls for Land Reform in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Pan Africanist Congress
(PAC) president Stanley Mogoba on Monday urged the South African
government to proceed with a land reform so as to avoid a land
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He warned that unless South Africa acted quickly to redress the
problem of landlessness, the country could soon face a crisis
similar to the one in Zimbabwe, where independence war veterans
have invaded hundreds of white- owned farms to demand land
redistribution.
</P>
<P>
Mogoba said in Cape Town that South Africa had for a long time
been sitting on the same problem.
</P>
<P>
"Six years down the line after attaining political power, we
still have 87 percent of the land owned by the minority. We cannot
be simplistic about what is happening in Zimbabwe, but must act
now or decide whether we want that crisis to happen here as well,"
Mogaba was quoted as saying by South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Mogoba said the government should consider organizing a
national conference on land.
</P>
<P>
Urging Zimbabweans to sit down and explore a peaceful solution
to the issue, Mogoba said the PAC was against land invasion.
</P>
<P>
The PAC's views were echoed by the opposition Democratic Party,
which called on the government to redistribute 25 million hectares
of unused state land among "landless farmers".

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Take New Measures Against Nomadic Cattle Rustlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government had
decided to take new measures to strengthen security in districts
neighboring Karamoja in northeastern Uganda where nomadic cattle
rustlers reside.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the President's Office Monday said
that President Yoweri Museveni has ordered the Karimojong with
guns in neighboring districts to remove them with immediate
effect.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public rally at Matany in Moroto District Monday
afternoon, Museveni directed that the Karimojong with guns must
either go back to Karamoja or immediately surrender their arms to
the army.
</P>
<P>
The army presence in the districts neighboring Karamoja is
going to be increased and the army will be given lethal capacity
to confront Karimojong cattle rustlers, he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government would also embark on building an
all-weather road along the border from the northern side of
Mountain Moroto up to Kotido to ensure easy monitoring of the
border and guarantee security along that stretch.
</P>
<P>
Karimojong cattle rustlers recently went to neighboring
districts to wreak havoc, causing a lot of trouble to local
residents. Several districts have urged the government to take
actions against the increasing insecurity.

acres of land around the country.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- Hotels in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have recently

<HEADLINE> Alleged Belgian Paedophile on Trial Finally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Marc Dutroux, Belgium's most
notorious alleged child abuser and killer, appeared in court on
Monday for the first time since he was arrested in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux, described locally as the number one enemy of the
kingdom, appeared in the Neufchateau correctional tribunal for his
attempted escape that got him out free for three and a half hours
on April 23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of breaking loose from gendarmerie and stealing
a gun from police guards and a car to run away. If proven guilty,
Dutroux would be sentenced to jail for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The attempted escape led the Belgian justice and interior
ministers to resign after some 5,000 policemen and women from
Belgium, Luxembourg and France chased him down before he was
stopped by a forest police.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux had been sentenced to 13 years in jail in 1989 for
raping five little girls but was released earlier than the jail
term. He was arrested again in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
Two little girls were found to be still alive from the dungeon
of his cellar at the time of his arrest while two others were
found dead. The bodies of two more girls were discovered on the
premises of one of Dutroux's associates.
</P>
<P>
The exposure of Dutroux' crimes against little girls created a
furor in Belgium. Some 350,000 people hit the street of the
capital of Brussels in October 1996 to protest against the
inefficiency of the country's police and justice system.
</P>
<P>
Monday's hearing lasted just half an hour, with the next
hearing scheduled for May 22.

<HEADLINE> Environment Canada Warns of Even Lower Lake Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Globe and Mail newspaper Monday quoted Environment Canada's
water-level information office as saying that the declining water
level is currently caused by an inadequate snow supply around
Lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron.
</P>
<P>
Superior, where snowfall accounts for 30 to 40 percent of water
supply, was 23 centimeters below its long-term average in February.
Lakes Michigan and Huron were 45.7 centimeters below average,
while Erie and Ontario was respectively 23 centimeters and 12.7
centimeters lower than the average level.
</P>
<P>
If there's no heavy rainfall this spring and summer, Lake Huron
's water level, for instance, could be 10 to 30 centimeters lower
than what it was last summer, when it reached 176.4 meters, the
lowest of the past 35 years, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
"But even with very wet conditions, we expect they will likely
be no higher and probably lower," said Ralph Moulton, manager of
the water-level information office.
</P>
<P>
Businesses have been affected by the dry weather as well, since
low water levels mean fewer boats are in the water and fewer
recreational boaters are spending money, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> German CDU Recommends Merkel Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 20 (Xinhua)--Germany's opposite Christian
Democrats (CDU) Monday nominated its general secretary Angela
Merkel as new leader to succeed Wolfgang Schaeuble.
</P>
<P>
Merkel, 45, came from a rural pastor's family in Brandenburg
state. The former physics teacher in east Germany is popular among
CDU's young members and regional divisions. She is due be the
first woman to give the conservative CDU "a new begin" out of the
crisis triggered by its former leader Helmut Kohl's slush funds
scandal.
</P>
<P>
Merkel's candidacy won "unanimous backing" of a CDU presidium
meeting Monday, acting party chairman Schaeuble said. Schaeuble
decided to step down last month in the wake of funding scandals of
Kohl and himself.
</P>
<P>
"After a series of regional conferences, it seems that the
grass-rooted party divisions want Merkel as the future leader,"
said Schaeuble.
</P>
<P>
The CDU presidium will recommend Merkel to the party congress
scheduled for April 9 to 11, and her candidacy is expected to win
overwhelming votes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Political Analysts call Merkel "a centrist," "representing a
new generation," and "an appropriate person" to steer the CDU, 90
per cent members of which come from west Germany.
</P>
<P>
Merkel expressed her "clear willingness" to run for the party
leadership at a press conference after CDU presidium meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the question whether a woman is qualified to lead a
conservative party with a majority of men, she said, "it shows
equality, women are people, too."

<HEADLINE> Northwest to Open New Flight Between Detroit and Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Northwest Airlines is to open
a new flight from Detroit to Shanghai on April 6, starting
biweekly nonstop services between the cities.
</P>
<P>
The new Detroit nonstop service, exclusively on 747-400
aircraft, features convenient connections from points throughout
the midwestern, eastern and southeastern sections of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
It also cuts traveling time by up to six hours, compared to a
competitor's connecting flight from the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
The new service follows an expansion last year of the airline's
existing one-stop service to Shanghai and the inauguration of
cargo flights to the city, China's largest commercial center.
</P>
<P>
Northwest, the first and leading U.S. carrier in Asia, is well-
positioned in the market through its own growing service and
through its strong alliance with Air China.
</P>
<P>
Northwest has served Asia for more than 50 years and serves 15
major destinations in the Asia-Pacific region. It inaugurated
service to China in July, 1947.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo War Has Significant Ramification for World Politics (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The unilateral NATO air
strike has touched off a heated debate in the international
community on ties between state sovereignty and humanitarian
intervention, as well as great fears in developing countries that
their state sovereignty might be violated on humanitarian grounds
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Against such a backdrop, the United Nations University (UNU)
is expected to release the study, entitled "Kosovo and the
Challenge of Humanitarian Intervention," Tuesday at the United
Nations Headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
The study examines the crisis and its aftermath from several
expert perspectives and also comes on the eve of the NATO military
action against Yugoslavia, which began March 24 last year.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua here Monday, Dr. Ramesh
Thakur, Vice Rector at UNU and co-editor of the study, said that
the Kosovo conflict has, in the long term, significant
ramification for the United Nations, major powers, regional
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons behind our embarking on this study was in
fact a feeling that the NATO countries and therefore the people
immediate in the Western countries had not fully grasped the
extent of unease that was felt in many parts of the world," he
said, referring the worries in the developing world on relations
between the state sovereignty on the one hand and humanitarian
intervention on the other.
</P>
<P>
"Kosovo confronted us with an abiding challenge of
humanitarian intervention: namely, it is morally just, legally
permissible and militarily feasible?" Thakur said.
</P>
<P>
 "Air strikes did not prevent widespread atrocities against
civilians on the ground in Kosovo nor the mass exodus of refugees
into neighboring countries," said the study's conclusion by
contributors. "Since the war, there has been a persistent threat
of ethnic cleansing of Serbs by the Albanians."
</P>
<P>
"Zero-casualty air war shifted the burden of risk to life and
limb completely to the other side, including civilians," the study
concluded. "By fighting and defeating Serbia, NATO became the tool
for the KLA (the Kosovo Liberation Army) policy of inciting Serb
reprisals through terrorist attacks in order to provoke NATO
intervention."
</P>
<P>
"Expanding the list of bombing targets, such as water and
electricity infrastructure and broadcasting stations, reversed
progressive trends in the laws of war over the course of the 20th
century," the study said.
</P>
<P>
Since the deployment in June last year under relevant Security
Council resolution, the U.N. Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and
international peace-keeping force (KFOR) have been accused of the
failure to protect Serbs and other non-Albanians, who, as Belgrade
put it, are victims of genocide and terrorist activities
undertaken by Albanian separatists and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
"We began the project shortly after the war in Kosovo began,"
he said. "We started identifying project contributors and
participants from all around the world. We were very careful not
to ask them ahead of time whether they supported or opposed the
war because the United Nations University has commitment to
diversity and then encouraging the diversity of opinions."
</P>
<P>
The project has attracted experts from different countries and
varying regions, he said. "Of the 30 or so people who have been
approached, only one or two has been unable in the end to come to
the project."
</P>
<P>
The respondents also included experts in Belgrade who are
supporting the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We though it important to bring together people from leading
experts, from the academic world, ... who would learn about each
other's concerns," he said. "No one has given, even the United
Nations, the right to intervene in the domestic affairs" of a
sovereign country because "this is specifically prohibited in the
U.N. Charter."
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, the balance between the state sovereignty
and human rights has changed quite significantly for the 55 years
since the Charter was signed," he said.  "The real attention is
who decides, under what rules, and on what evidence that massive
human rights violations and atrocities have occurred, and
something has to be done, so what has to be done?"
</P>
<P>
The study offers interpretation of the Kosovo crisis from
numerous perspectives: the conflict-parties, NATO allies, the
immediate region surrounding the conflict, and further afield.
</P>
<P>
Country perspectives are followed by scholarly analysis of the
longer-term normative, operational, and structural consequences of
the Kosovo crisis for world politics.
</P>
<P>
Without the authorization of the U.N. Security Council, NATO
waged a war against Yugoslavia, a sovereign member of the U.N.
family, thus severely violating the U.N. Charter and the
international law. Under the U.N. Charter, the Security Council
has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of world peace
and security.
</P>
<P>
This regional security alliance has undertaken military action
with the Security Council sanction, "that has created many
problems," Albrecht Schnabel, co-editor of the study and Peace and
Governance Program Official in NUN, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1973 and based in Tokyo, Japan, UNU's mission
is "to contribute, through research and capacity building, to
efforts to restore pressing global problems that are the concern
of the United Nations, its Member States and their Peoples."

<HEADLINE> EU to Set Up Network for Consumer Disputes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
published a working paper Monday to provide a framework for
national initiatives to set up a Eueopean Union (EU)'s Extra-
Judicial Network for settling consumer disputes out of court.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commissioner for health and consumer protection, David
Byrne, said this is an important initiative towards creating an
effective and practical environment to boost consumer confidence
in cross-border transactions and trade.
</P>
<P>
The development of electronic commerce and new distance selling
methods are likely to lead to a higher risk of disputes across the
EU borders, he said. "If things going wrong, resorting to
traditional litigation is neither practical nor cost effective for
consumers and business alike."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore we want to have efficient alternate dispute
solutions without heavy regulatory procedures. I am counting on
the active cooperation of member states to bring this initiative
forward and realize its potential," the EU executive Commissioner
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the extra-juridical network would
reduce costs, formality, time and obstacles such as language
problems in cross-border disputes by offering consumers easy
access to redress through an out-of-court system.
</P>
<P>
Disputes over deliveries, defective products, or products or
services that do not fit their description should be dealt with by
a single, one-stop national contact point, or "clearing house", in
each EU member state.
</P>
<P>
This kind of clearing house will help the dissatisfied consumer
with information and support in making a claim to the out-of-court
dispute resolution system in the country where the business from
which the products or services were acquired is located.
</P>
<P>
The network of clearing house should be set up and running by
the second half of this year, ready to deal with consumer
complaints.
</P>
<P>
Currently, national out-of-court systems to deal with consumer
complaints EU-wide are highly diverse, and the outcome can vary
from one country to another. Some for example result in binding
decisions, whilst others do not. The EU executive Commission's
proposal would be based on the voluntary collaboration between the
clearing houses in each EU country.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Farmers Encouraged to Prepare Rainy Season Cultivation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian agriculture
authorities are mobilizing farmers in the country to prepare
farmlands for sowing on the eve of rainy season.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Ministry officials said Monday that more than
100,000 tons of fertilizer are to be distributed soon to farmers
in Amharic State, one of major grain producing regions in
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Amhara State Council will also allocate 170 million birr
(about 20 million U.S. dollars) for purchase of fertilizers for
use by the farmers during the next production year that begins in
September.
</P>
<P>
In addition to fertilizer, high-yield seeds are being
popularized in many farms, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The regular rainfall season in the Horn of Africa country
usually come as of late March and conclude in late September.
</P>
<P>
However, the coming "small rainy season", which occurs between
March and May, is normally erratic and uneven.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, with some eight million victims of famine, has been
suffering from drought since late last year.

<HEADLINE> More Flooding Expected in Southern Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Limpopo River in Mozambique's
southern province of Gaza, is rising again, and the Southern
Regional Water Board (ARA-Sul) has issued another "maximum alert"
for the Limpopo Valley.
</P>
<P>
ARA-Sul technician Olinda Sousa told Radio Mozambique on Monday
that there had been a major increase in the flow of the Limpopo at
Beit Bridge, in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Massingir dam on the Elephants River, the main
 tributary of the Limpopo in Mozambique, had been forced to
increase its discharges.
</P>
<P>
The result was certain to be another flood on the Limpopo.
Sousa warned that the town of Chokwe would soon be inundated
again.
</P>
<P>
Chokwe was devastated by the massive Limpopo flood of late
February, but over the past fortnight the waters have been
subsiding and some Chokwe residents have tried to return to their
home.
</P>
<P>
ARA-Sul advised against this, and said that people should keep
away from the river banks while the current rainy season lasts.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Group to Join Burundi Peace Talks: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- One of Burundi's major rebel
groups -- the Forces for the Defence of Democracy (FDD) -- would
join future negotiations aimed at achieving peace in the country,
former South African president Nelson Mandela said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told reporters following a meeting with FDD leader
Jean-Bosco Ndayikengurukiye that peace talks aimed at resolving
the crisis in Burundi would continue on May 27 and 28.
</P>
<P>
However the FDD had asked for more time so as to allow them
time to consider the draft proposals set down during the previous
round of talks in Arusha, Tanzania, in January, according sources
close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said Ndayikengurukiye had expressed concern that large
segments of the Hutu population were living in refugee camps and
that some of the political prisoners in Burundi have been
"languishing" in prison for more than three years.
</P>
<P>
Mandela praised the FDD leader, especially his keenness "for
peace at the earliest possible convenience".
</P>
<P>
Thanking Mandela and speaking through an interpreter,
Ndayikengurukiye said his group would support his efforts to
establish peace in war-torn central African nation.
</P>
<P>
He said the movement was formed spontaneously when the
country's previous president was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
The FDD had also drawn up its own proposals for peace in
Burundi and would present them to negotiators at a later date,
said Ndayikengurukiye.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident (former) president Mandela will do his best
to find a solution as soon as possible in our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela described Monday's announcement as the "most
encouraging" move yet to solve the stalemate in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The FDD boycotted multi-party negotiations in Arusha --
Mandela's first as mediator -- and their absence was seen as a
major stumbling block to peace.

<HEADLINE> Cape Verde's Opposition Party Leader to Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Pedro Pires, chairman of African
Party for the Independence of Cape Verde, the leading opposition
party of the country, has decided to quit his post to prepare for
the presidential election early next year.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the party said that the party will choose a
younger leader at the special party congress in July, according to
a report reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pires' decision indicated that after winning a local election
victory last month, the party is ready to seize back government
power lost ten years ago, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Movement for Democracy has suffered the biggest
defeat in February 20 local election since it took power in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Many people believed that the leading opposition party would
certainly win the parliamentary election at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Under Cape Verde's law, the leader of the majority party in the
 parliament assumes the office of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Pires in his 60s is one of the veteran statesmen in Cape Verde,
the Atlantic archipelago made up of 18 islands located 500
kilometers west of Senegal.

<HEADLINE> Wild Fire in Bale Region, Ethiopia Under Control: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The bush fire that erupted in
the Bale region, Oromia State of Ethiopia, is almost under
control, the Ministry of Agriculture announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tamiru Habte, a senior official responsible for forest and wild
animals protection, attributed the positive result to the aerial
fire fighting operation launched in the region 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
The integrated efforts exerted to contain the spread of the
conflagration to other parts of the region had achieved the
intended goals, Tamiru said.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said that the fire in the Borena region,
which is far south of the Bale region bordering with Kenya, is
still raging.
</P>
<P>
Aerial fire fighting operations would be intensified in the
Borena region in the coming days, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Ethiopians, including soldiers, farmers
and university students, were mobilized to put out the wild fires
that have engulfed at least 70,000 hectares of forest and coffee
plantation since mid February.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of South African professional fire fighters have also
involved in the aerial fire fighting operation.

<HEADLINE> 330 Ugandan Cult Members Die in Church: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of Internal
Affairs Edward Rugumayo said here Monday evening that the police
had counted 330 people who burnt themselves to death in Kanungu in
the southwestern district of Rukungiri last Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the ministry meeting room, Rugumayo,
who just returned from the scene of the incident, said that there
were altogether 78 children burnt in the inferno.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the bodies were burnt beyond recognition. The cult is
a very well organized sect and their act was very secretive. Most
of the cult members are common people from the rural areas. This
time, women and children are the majority of those burnt," he
said.
</P>
<P>
To check cult activities, he said that his ministry would be
very strict in registering non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
because the cult, named Movement for Restoration of the Ten
Commandments of God, was a registered NGO.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the government would try to interview the living
members of the cult and to arrest possible surviving leaders of
the cult.
</P>
<P>
The doomsday cult, created in 1989, has branches in several
districts in Uganda and has hundreds of followers. They sold their
possessions and paid their graduated taxes before setting
themselves on fire, he added.
</P>
<P>
This is the second biggest cult killing in the world, after the
November 18, 1978 death of 912 members of the People's Temple
sect in the jungle of Guyana in a ceremony of collective suicide
and murder.

SINGAPORE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Share prices fell on Singapore
Stock Market Monday amid mounting concerns about nose-diving

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Insurance Industry Rebounds in 1999:  Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's insurance
industry, hit by the Asia economic crisis, rebounded in 1999 with
a growth of 7.1 percent in total combined premium income,
according to the 1999 Insurance Annual Report released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The combined premium income amounted to 13.945 billion ringgit
(3.669 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The insurance fund assets also grew by an impressive 15.6
percent to 45.454 billion ringgit (11.961 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In 1999, new premiums rose by 27.3 percent to 1.831 billion
ringgit (481.841 million U.S. dollars) while new sums insured and
new policies increased by 21.3 percent and 18.5 percent to 106.099
billion ringgit (17.92 billion U.S. dollars) and 1,331,732
policies respectively, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Total income of the life insurance industry rose by 10.9
percent to 9.344 billion ringgit (2.458 billion U.S. dollars),
supported mainly by an increase of 12.5 percent in premium income
which stood at 6.994 billion ringgit (1.84 billion U.S. dollars),
it said.
</P>
<P>
Total assets of life insurance funds expanded by 19.7 percent
to 31.509 billion ringgit (8.291 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999,
with investments in corporate and debt securities forming the
single largest portfolio of assets at 39.4 percent of total assets,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The contraction in written premiums was moderate by 0.9 percent
to 5.374 billion ringgit (1.414 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999 and
the industry's net retention ratio continued to reach 87.2 percent,
it said.
</P>
<P>
With the positive signals of economic recovery during the year
under review, Bank Negara (State Bank) Malaysia considered it
timely to restore the original solvency and capital requirements
which were deferred since the onset of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the consolidation of the industry, the minimum
absolute margin of solvency for insurers was increased from 30
million ringgit (7.894 million U.S. dollars) to 40 million ringgit
(10.526 million U.S. dollars) with effect from January 1, 2000 and
50 million ringgit (13.157 million U.S. dollars) with effect from
January 1, 2001, it said.
</P>
<P>
The minimum required paid-up share capital to be maintained by
an insurer underwriting direct insurance business was similarly
increased from 35 million ringgit (9.21 million U.S. dollars) to
40 million (10.526 million U.S. dollars) and 50 million ringgit (
13.157 million U.S. dollars) by the end of 1999 and 2000
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The reinstatement of these requirements was crucial to boost
the financial strength of insurers and to accelerate the pace of
industry consolidation, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that despite the promising outlook,
there is still room for further development in the insurance
industry, in particular, the industry needs to strive towards
greater resilience and reduce its vulnerability to external shocks.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution Demands Death Penalty for Pak Ex-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The prosecution Monday demanded
the death sentence for deposed Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif and six co-accused involved in an alleged plane hijacking
case.
</P>
<P>
The Advocate General of Pakistan, Raja Qureshi, who represents
the current government in the hijacking case, told the Anti-
Terrorism Court in Karachi that the court should award the "
maximum punishment" to all the accused in accordance with certain
laws, Karachi sources told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Sharif and six others was accused of hatching the conspiracy to
deny landing of a Pakistan International Airlines flight, thus
threatening lives of 198 passengers, including that of General
Pervaz Musharraf, the current Chief Executive of Pakistan, who was
on the way back from an abroad visit on October 12 last year.
</P>
<P>
In a ensuing bloodless coup, the army dismissed the Sharif
government and General Musharraf assumed the power of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the prosecutor read out excerpts from
the testimony of several witnesses to argue that Sharif and his co-
accused had taken control of the commercial aircraft and
endangered the lives of those on board.
</P>
<P>
Sharif and the co-accused have maintained their innocence and
said the evidence against them is fabricated. They have pleaded
not guilty in the court.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has two more days to present its argument. The
court then will hear the defense, which will also have three days
for its closing argument.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Announces Fragmented List of Senators-Elect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Election Commission of
Thailand Monday afternoon officially announced a name list of
candidates who have been unanimously endorsed to win the country's
first senatorial poll earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The list includes 92 senators-elect, out of the overall 200
elected nationwide in the historic election, according to
television news reports.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came one day before the incumbent senate's
term expires.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that it will announce later whether the
rest of 108 suspended senators-elect, alleged of involving in
frauds or vote-buying, would be eligible for a by-election.
</P>
<P>
The date for the by-election will be announced within 30 days,
the commission said.
</P>
<P>
Those who are proved guilty of fraud will not be allowed to run
the by-election, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai was earlier reported as
saying that the government would not call an extraordinary
parliamentary session until all the 200 elected senators took
office.
</P>
<P>
Thailand held its first senate election on March 4 since the
country adopted constitutional rule 68 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Because the new senate will be entitled with power to screen
legislation proposed by the government, question leaders and other
officials and remove corrupt office-holders, including the prime
minister, the contest among 1,521 candidates for 200 senate seats
were quite fierce.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, during the polling day the election
commission and independent monitors received thousands of calls
complaining about vote-buying, fraud and other irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Several hundreds voters turned up at polls only to find their
ballots had already been filled out.

Canadian soldiers in Bosnia will be the first to get the new
uniforms, while others will continue with the drab green uniform --

<HEADLINE> Procedure of Russian Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Russians will go to the polls next
Sunday to elect a new president to succeed Boris Yeltsin who
resigned on December 31, 1999. The following is a brief
introduction to the procedure of the presidential election
according to a new electoral law signed into force by Yeltsin in
December:
</P>
<P>
-- The Russian president is elected by Russian citizens who
are 18 years of age or older through secret voting in the
framework of the Russian Constitution and relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
-- The president can be elected only out of Russian citizens,
who must be 35 years or older and who have lived in the country
for no less than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
-- The whole country is regarded as a united constituency, in
which all legal voters abroad are also absorbed.
</P>
<P>
-- The Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian
parliament, decides on the date of the elections. If the president
steps down ahead of schedule, as Yeltsin did, a new president must
be elected on the last Sunday of the third month after the former
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
-- To be registered with the Central Electoral Commission (CEC)
, candidates must be nominated by a sponsor group of no fewer than
100 people or by a political party or group registered with the
Justice Ministry no earlier than one year before the vote.
</P>
<P>
-- Candidates must collect one million signatures. For an
early election, the minimum number of signatures is half a million.
</P>
<P>
-- Polling starts at 8:00 a.m. and ends at 20:00 p.m. local
time (Russia covers 11 time zones from the far east regions of
Chukot and Kamchatka to the west region of Kalinin). Poll results
should not be made public until the end of voting in the latest
time zone.
</P>
<P>
-- The preliminary results of the election are expected to be
known within two days after the voting, and the final outcome must
be officially published within 10 days after the polls.
</P>
<P>
-- A candidate must win more than 50 percent of the votes to
be declared the winner in the first round.
</P>
<P>
-- A run-off will be held on the 21st day after the voting day
of the first round if none of the candidates wins more than 50
percent in the first round. The two leading candidates in the
first round will enter the run-off.
</P>
<P>
-- A candidate whose violations of laws cause the first round
invalid will not be allowed to participate in the run-off.
</P>
<P>
-- If one of the two rivals in the second round drops out, the
candidate who ranks the third in the first round of the voting
will enter the run-off, and so on and so forth.
</P>
<P>
-- In the run-off, a candidate will win the presidential race
if he gets more votes than the other does and than the number of
votes against both candidates.
</P>
<P>
-- The election will be declared invalid and a new election
will be held if the voter turnout is less than 50 percent of the
registered voters, or the number of voters who choose "none of the
above" on the list of candidates surpasses the number of voters
who vote for the number one candidate, or the number of federal
administration regions where the results of the polls are
announced invalid due to law violations reaches 25 percent of all
the administration regions, or both candidates retreat from the
race in the second round of the voting, or neither of them wins in
the run-off.
</P>
<P>
-- A new election should be conducted within four months after
the previous voting day, or within three months after the day when
the first round is declared invalid.
</P>
<P>
-- As a rule, the new president will be sworn in on the day
when his predecessor's mandate expires. However, after an early
election, the new head of state should be inaugurated on the 30th
day after the CEC officially announces the outcome of the election.

<HEADLINE> Data: EU Agricultural Income Falls in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The euro zone agricultural income also decreased by three
percent. One of the main factors is the fact that the price of
agricultural output declined markedly by five percent.
</P>
<P>
Estimates suggested that agricultural income was lower than the
levels of 1998 in 11 EU member states -- Belgium, Denmark, Germany,
Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland,
and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The highest rate of decline was recorded in Ireland with -12
percent, Denmark with -11 percent, Belgium with -9 percent and the
Netherlands with -6 percent. The agricultural income was unchanged
in Greece.
</P>
<P>
The EU member states to register increases in agricultural
income were Luxembourg with two percent, Sweden with six percent
and Portugal with 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the real value of the agricultural industry declined
strongly across the 15 EU countries by -6 percent compared to that
of 1998, due to a clear 5 percent decline in the real price of
agricultural products and a two percent decrease in real terms in
the level of subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the volume of agricultural labor fell by three
percent, and as a result, income from agricultural activity fell
by an average three percent in real terms in 1999.

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Road Safety Priority Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Monday it has drawn up a set of road safety priority measures to
be carried out in the next two years in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s executive arm said it proposes
several types of action to encourage EU member states to improve
road safety.
</P>
<P>
With a view to ensuring that the downward trend in the annual
number of road accident victims continued, the EU's second action
program for 1997-2001 adopted a series of measures to make
vehicles safer, to increase the percentage of road users wearing
seat belts, to reduce speed and raise drivers' awareness of the
need to assess and improve their ability to drive safely for their
own sake and for the sake of their passengers and other road users.
</P>
<P>
However, recent road safety statistics suggest that the
progress of recent years has slowed down and therefore more
effective action is required. In 1998, for instance, there were 42,
553 road accident deaths and 1.7 million people were injured in
the EU countries, according to the Commission.
</P>
<P>
The new EU road safety measures are: continue to work with and
develop the European New Car Assessment Program; legislation on
speed limiters for light commercial vehicles; public awareness
campaigns and legislation to promote seat belts use and child
restraints; legislation on safer car fronts for vulnerable road
users such as pedestrians and cyclists; recommendation to the
member states on maximum blood and alcohol levels; and develop
guidelines for "blackspot" management and the design of "forgiving
" roadsides.

<HEADLINE> Western China Encouraged to Attend Beijing High-Tech Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Business delegations from western
China will be given four privileges if they attend the China
Beijing International High-Tech Industrial Week, which is slated
for May 8-12.
</P>
<P>
This was learned at a press conference here this afternoon
sponsored by the organizing committee for the event, the third of
its kind.
</P>
<P>
The four privileges are: Missions from western China will be
given free services if they hold economic and trade talks; for
press conferences, they will be given three free-of-charge
business booths and enjoy a 40 percent discount for renting more
business booths if they participate in the exhibitions; and they
will get a 40 percent discount for all charged activities
organized by the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee will send four delegations to
different parts of the country to promote the high-tech week. The
first delegation, led by Duan Bingren, vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, set
off today for western China, according to today's press conference.
</P>
<P>
Three other delegations -- bound respectively for northeastern,
eastern and southern China -- will leave soon.

<HEADLINE> ICBC Transfers 100 Bln Yuan to AMC in Debt-Equity Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC), one of the nation's four state banks, said
today that it has transferred 100 billion yuan in loan to the
Asset Management Company (AMC) in a debt-equity swap.
</P>
<P>
In a deal with the Huarong Asset Management Corp., the ICBC
sold the company all its financial claim to the indebted
enterprises involved in the swap earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Huarong, after converting some of these debts to equities of
the enterprises, will emerge as their shareholder. It will then
adopt various kinds of financial practices such as clearing and
securitizing assets to revive the debt-laden companies.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's cabinet, has made this a key method
for getting loss-making state enterprises out of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) has listed 601
enterprises for debt-equity swaps, and ICBC extended loans to more
than two-thirds of them.
</P>
<P>
Handing the loans to the asset management company will help
ICBC improve its credit standing and bank assets by reducing the
amount of non-performing loans, the bank said, adding that the
debt-laden firms will operate much better after being relieved of
their heavy burden.
</P>
<P>
One major problem for money-losing state enterprises is that
their daily operations depend on bank loans, which push their
asset-liability ratio extremely high.
</P>
<P>
The reduced asset-liability ratio after the swap will cut their
financing costs, thus enabling some loss-making firms to yield
profits, economists said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of angry protesters in
Taiwan are demonstrating for the third consecutive day today,
demanding the immediate resignation of Lee Teng-hui as chairman of
the ruling Kuomintang, following the party's election defeat on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to TV reports from Taiwan, police in Taipei, capital
of the island province, attempted earlier today to disperse the
demonstrators outside the Kuomintang headquarters who were calling
for Lee to step down as chairman of the party, but failed, and the
protest is still going tonight.
</P>
<P>
According to reports by the Taiwanese media, protests also
took place in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The protests against Lee first erupted Saturday night as
thousands of Taiwan residents gathered outside the Kuomintang
headquarters in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Lee was forced to promise to resign in September
this year, at a provisional party meeting at the headquarters,
while demonstrators protested outside.
</P>
<P>
Lee's move failed to quell the outrage of the demonstrators
who protested throughout the night calling for his immediate
resignation.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Privatize Part of Health Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Health Ministry said
on Monday that it will move towards privatizing part of its
services including nursing, laboratory and X-rays to meet
international standards.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Mohammad Ahmad Al-Jarallah said that two public
bids were offered to private companies to recruit 300 nurses for
government hospitals, the official news agency Kuna reported.
</P>
<P>
"This experience will be generalized on all public hospitals and
clinics when it proves successful," Al-Jarallah said.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry is also studying proposals from the private
sector to establish and equip a laboratory and an X-ray department
in a government hospital in the southern Ahmadi Governorate.
</P>
<P>
But the official emphasized that any private company that wins
the bid should abide by the rules and regulations of the ministry
concerning high quality services and better performance in the
administrative technical and medical sectors.
</P>
<P>
Al-Jarallah's remarks marked another step forward in reforming
Kuwait's public health sector with the aim to improve health
services and increase government revenues.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, a oil-rich Gulf state which provides its citizens
cradle-to-grave welfare, began last August a process of gradually
rescinding its free health service policy by collecting visit fees
on expatriates in public clinics and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
A health insurance scheme targeted on foreigners will also come
into effect next month. Under the plan, each expatriate is obliged
to pay an annual premium of 20-50 Kuwaiti dinars (66-165 U.S.
dollars) before he or she is granted a residence permit or gets a
residence extension at the immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
Imposing symbolic charges on Kuwaitis admitted in public
hospitals or receiving special medical services are also under
discussion.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment to Vietnam's Industrial Parks Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Year-on-year foreign investment in
Vietnam's industrial parks was up 89 percent in the first two
months of 2000, with 14 new projects registered worth 36.5 million
U.S.dollars, local English daily Vietnam News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Ministry of Planning and Investment of the
country as saying that "the foreign investment slump is over."
</P>
<P>
Businesses operating in the parks continue to surpass all other
sectors, with production up 61 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
In order to attract investors by offering good infrastructure
and concessionary policies, the government has so far built 67
industrial parks, with a total of 930 projects capitalized at more
than 7.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Industrial parks now account for more than 25 percent of the
country's total industrial production value and contribute 16
percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to further simulate investment, the Vietnamese
government is currently adjusting foreign investors' electricity
and water prices to ensure they are the same as those for domestic
firms.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Expands by 25 Pct in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade
reached 31.77 billion Singapore dollars (18.57 billion U.S.
dollars) in February 2000, up 25 percent compared with the same
month of 1999,following the 24.6 percent expansion in the
preceding month, Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said
Monday in its monthly bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) rose by 17.3 percent boosted by
exports of integrated circuits and telecommunications equipment
and contributed by exports of non-electronics as well.
</P>
<P>
In February 2000, the country's non-oil re-exports expanded by
28.5 percent, which was spread across products and markets, while
non-oil imports grew by 22.7 percent in the month contributed
mainly by imports of integrated circuits, scientific instruments,
capacitors and cellular phones and radio sets.
</P>
<P>
The TDB report showed that oil domestic exports surged up 51.9
percent in February on the back of escalated oil price as compared
to a year ago.
</P>
<P>
It was noteworthy that domestic exports of electronics products
moderated to 13.8 percent in February 2000 from 15.9 percent
expansion in January and were offset by continued sagging disk
drives exports which fell 19.3 percent during the month.
</P>
<P>
Exports of non-electronics products picked up 25.2 percent
during the month largely due to strong exports of disc media
products (packed software) to Japan as well as electrical circuit
apparatus and petrochemicals to EU and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Among Singapore's five top NODX markets, the Japan market led
the rise with a 47.7 percent expansion and Hong Kong market was
the next registering a growth of 46.8 percent in February 2000.
The Malaysia and U.S. markets expanded by 36.0 percent and 9.2
percent, respectively, in the month while the EU market registered
a decline of 10.9 percent.

JAKARTA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to boost the country's
judicial reform process, Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid on
Monday inaugurated the National Ombudsman Commission to help
create and develop a conducive situation to curb corruption,
collusion and nepotistic practices.
</P>
<P>
The commission is led by former Deputy Attorney General for
Special Crime Antonius Sujata and has six members.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to protect the people's rights to public services.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, it will take steps to follow up reports or
information on irregularities involving state officials in
performing their duties and in providing public services," Antara
news agency quoted a press release issued by the Bureau Press and
Media of the Presidential Office as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post daily said Monday that there are two
priorities on judicial reform that deserve further discussion,
namely, the"one roof" policy of court administration and the
judicial independence and accountability.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of court administration from the executive to the
Supreme Court is obviously an urgent reform imperative. And
according to Law No. 35 of 1999, this has to be done in five years,
the daily said.
</P>
<P>
"The executive's involvement in judicial governance became a
channel of the government's intervention in the judiciary under
the New Order," the daily said, referring to the regime headed by
former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the new management of the Supreme Court
should be able to carry out its regular tasks and be prepared to
take on additional burdens, the daily said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that it has deployed 2,000 troops in the southern Lanao del
Norte province to run after some 400 fleeing Moro separatists who
suffered 116 casualties as heavy fighting entered its sixth day.
</P>
<P>
"The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) are on the run and we
will continue to pursue them and see to it that they will not give
any more problem in that part o Mindanao," Armed Forces spokesman
Rafael Romero said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
As this developed, Romero said the military sustained 10
casualties, including Dohn Alfonso Javier, a godson of Philippine
President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Romero said government troopers were thrown in battle after 400
to 500 MILF guerrillas launched simultaneous assaults on six Army
detachments in Kauswagan town in Lanao del Norte and occupied the
town hall last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers have retaken the Kauswagan town hall last Saturday, he
said, adding that the MILF hastily withdrew when government forces,
backed by planes and helicopters and armored vehicles, blazed
their way in.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado and Armed Forces Chief of
Staff Angelo Reyes visited Kauswagan Sunday to see the prevailing
peace and order condition in the area.
</P>
<P>
Romero said the military is prepared to rush more troops if the
situation demands, but for the moment, "we are on top of the
situation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government reiterated its commitment to pursue
the peace process with the MILF despite isolated incidents of
fighting between military troops and the Islamic rebels.
</P>
<P>
Pres Secretary Rodolfo Reyes said Monday that the negotiating
panels of the government and the MILF have agreed to resume formal
peace talks in Cotabato City on May 2.
</P>
<P>
But Reyes also made it clear that the government is ready to
assert its authority should the MILF or some of its members engage
in terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has been fighting for an independent state in Mindanao
during the past two decades. The government estimates that there
are about 15,000 MILF fighters in Mindanao island.

<HEADLINE> EU to Give More Aid to Flood-Hit Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The foreign ministers from the EU's 15 member states agreed in
Brussels to make a positive contribution to the donor conference
to be held in Rome at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said in a statement that the leading role in
relief coordination lies with the Mozambique government's
Department of Disaster Management in Liaison with the United
Nations agencies.
</P>
<P>
The EU Council of Ministers has placed great emphasis on the
need to ensure effective coordination both internally and with the
EU "so that there is no duplication of effort and that the aid
provided has maximum impact", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also expressed their endorsement for
Mozambique government's two-track approach aiming at meeting the
immediate needs for relief while working to rehabilitate affected
areas and to ensure both macro-economic stability and the
maintenance of on-going programs of development assistance.
</P>
<P>
According to the EU, several of its member states and its
executive commission have already announced a total of 66.5
million euro in aid for rehabilitation and budgetary support and a
further 156 million euro in debt relief. In addition to these
supports, the EU also had provided Mozambique with aid worth 100
million euro under its cooperation program in 1999.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the foreign ministers expressed their "
solidarity with the people and government of Mozambique and the
other countries of the region as they grapple with the devastating
consequences of the flooding".
</P>
<P>
The ministers also showed their sympathy for the southern
African countries as "they set about rebuilding their shattered
lives" after the floods.

<HEADLINE> Senegal's Opposition Leader Wins Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAKAR, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade
beat President Abdou Diouf in Senegal's presidential election on
Sunday, and the latter conceded defeat on Monday, an independent
radio station reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
An interior ministry source was quoted as saying Wade had taken
close to 65 percent of the votes when results were in from 700
polling stations seen as key indicators.
</P>
<P>
President Diouf was unable to win the support of young voters,
with youth unemployment now affecting about half of the country's
nine million people, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
The election was Senegal's first presidential runoff since
independence from France in 1960. In the first round of voting in
February, neither of the two candidates gained the required 50
percent of votes to declare a victory.
</P>
<P>
Senegal has long been considered the most stable country in
West Africa and one of the few nations on the continent that has
never experienced a military coup.

<HEADLINE> Putin in Chechnya, Vows to Destroy Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Acting President
Vladimir Putin arrived in Chechnya Monday aboard a Su-27 fighter
jet as a co-pilot, vowing to crush the rebels, Russian media
reported.
</P>
<P>
Attending a departure ceremony for paratroopers at the
Khankala military base, Putin said the military operation against
Chechen rebels will continue to the end.
</P>
<P>
"We have the choice of either finishing off the bandits here,
where everything has started, or to leave and to wait for them on
other Russian territory," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"We'd better do it here," he added.
</P>
<P>
He flew in from the Black Sea resort city of Sochi aboard the
Su-27 training jet and even piloted the aircraft for some time.
</P>
<P>
The flight, which occurred just six days ahead of Sunday's
presidential election, is expected to further boost Putin's chance
of victory.
</P>
<P>
Recent opinion polls showed that he would collect 60 percent
of votes, much higher than the 50 percent needed to win in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
The military campaign, launched last September following a
spate of terrorist bombings that claimed over 300 people, is seen
as a major factor that contributed to Putin's mounting popularity.
</P>
<P>
Much of the breakaway republic is now under federal control
but the remaining pockets of rebels continued to stage fierce
resistance.
</P>
<P>
Early voting started in Chechnya last Friday among federal
servicemen there. The Chechen civilians will vote on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Veshnyakov, chairman of the Central Election
Commission, left for Chechnya earlier Monday to oversee
preparations for the vote in the region.

<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scientists are
drawing up a strategic plan to conduct further research into the
weather in space, which may interfere with power supplies,
telecommunications, navigation and global positioning systems on
earth, and cause satellites to malfunction.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei Fengsi, a research fellow with the Space
Research Center under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the ongoing
"China Space Weather Strategy" will enable Chinese scientists to
make more precise space weather forecasts and more effectively
monitor changes in space.
</P>
<P>
"The 15-year plan, if it goes smoothly, will greatly help to
provide a better guarantee for the development of the nation's
manned spaceflight, satellite, defense and other related high-
technology fields," said Wei, one of the leading sponsors of the
plan.
</P>
<P>
The scientists will focus on research into basic physical
processes of major space weather events, build a forecast model
for space weather changes and establish a relevant information
database, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
"At a time when mankind deeply relies on the operation of high-
technology products, research into weather in space is just as
important as that on earth," he said, adding that as much as 40
percent of satellite problems worldwide are due to space weather
reasons.

It is expected that China's spaceflight, telecommunication and

for space weather forecasts in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guiqing, a researcher with the Beijing Observatory, said
that weather conditions in the space are dominated by conditions
on the sun.
</P>
<P>
According to her, phenomena appearing on the sun led to a
sudden halt of power supply for nine million people in Canada and
made 45 million beepers in the United States malfunction.

the Coca-Cola Corporation, one of the world's top 500 business
giants, started production today in this capital of southwest
China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
According to the company,the Coca-Cola Kunming New Plant, with
300 employees and involving an investment of 22 million US dollars,
mainly produces soft drinks, which will be sold throughout Yunnan
via nine marketing outlets.
</P>
<P>
The executive of the company said that the Kunming plant is the
fifth Coca-Cola bottling plant set up in western China following
those in Xi'an, Chengdu, Nanning and Taiyuan.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola has invested 1.1 billion US dollars in China since
1979, just after China had launched its reform and opening-up
drive nationwide, and has set up a total of 24 bottling factories
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our businesses in China have harvested good economic returns,"
according to the executive, citing the example of the Coca-Cola
plant in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province. The
Wuhan plant, which was founded in 1995, has been producing profits
since 1998.
</P>
<P>
The executive vowed that the company would make more
investments in other areas of western China as preferential
policies and low-cost labor are available there.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Calls for Ban on Porn Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
called for an immediate ban on pornographic services commonly
available at entertainment venues, warning that society "could be
imperiled by these filthy phenomena".
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun, vice-chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislative body,
said the government should pay greater attention to the fact that
lots of entertainment locales, barber shops, sauna centers and
massage parlors have prostitution services.
</P>
<P>
"Rampant pornographic activities have led to official
corruption, rapid growth of HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted
diseases and drug-related cases, as well as damage to women's
rights," Peng, who also chairs the All-China Women's Federation,
was quoted as saying by today's "China Women's News".
</P>
<P>
Excessive development and cut-throat competition in China's
entertainment industry have turned some of the venues into sex
businesses, Culture Minister Sun Jiazheng acknowledged recently.
</P>
<P>
Proprietors often lure customers with escorts or, as they are
commonly called in Chinese, "three accompanying ladies", because
they accompany clients while singing, dancing and drinking.
</P>
<P>
The issue has also aroused concern among other lawmakers, who
accused some local officials of conniving with the sex businesses
for various purposes, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"Some officials wrongly believe that such businesses can help
attract investment, and some are even involved in such operations,
" it said, adding that the government should crack down on all
kinds of porn activities.

<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese leader Li Lanqing
said here today that efforts should be made to enable Chinese
scientists and researchers to make more creative and innovative
achievements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a discussion with members of the Fourth Council of
the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSF), Li
Lanqing, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Vice
Premier of China, stressed the importance of creation and
innovation in basic research.
</P>
<P>
He said efforts should be made to create an open, free and
competitive academic environment, and provide timely and
sufficient funding to facilitate creative and innovative research.
</P>
<P>
He also called for support for the development of new and
emerging and interdisciplinary sciences, and removal of obstacles
to branches of learning in basic research.
</P>
<P>
The state-funded NNSF was set up in 1986 with the approval of
the Chinese government, in a bid to fund basic research and some
applied research programs.
</P>
<P>
The foundation has funded about 40,000 research programs in the
past 14 years, involving several hundred million US dollars, which
have greatly contributed to basic research in China and the
training of middle-aged and young researchers.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jia'er, chairman of the NNSF, and Zhu Lilan, minister of
science and technology, were among those present at the discussion.

HARBIN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The China Xinda Assets Management
Cooperation today signed contracts to convert debts into shares
with three coal companies which are running at a loss.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Hegang Bureau of Mines, Qitaihe Coal

has nine coal companies which have converted debts into shares.
The measure was launched by the Chinese government to relieve
large state-run companies of the burden of heavy debt.

The China Xinda Assets Management Cooperation, the first
company of its kind in China, is responsible for the acceptance,
management and handling of debts and other bad assets which have

The three coal companies have turned a total of 5.78 billion
yuan (about 696 million U.S. dollars) of debts into shares, which
are now held by the Xinda Cooperation. Meanwhile, the corporation
will launch a series of reforms in the three companies to help

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Takes Initiatives to Harness Force of Globalization (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang Monday called for attention to the range of initiatives the
government is taking to harness the forces of globalization by
improving competitiveness in the financial services sector and
providing better services to business and international investors.
</P>
<P>
The initiatives include the development of a multi-currency
capital market and clearing system, starting with a U.S. dollar
denominated market, which hopefully will be fully operational by
the end of the year, Tsang said at a Hong Kong business community
luncheon to speak to a gathering of 27 chambers.
</P>
<P>
"We are making greater efforts to expand the regional debt
market, continuing with our reforms of the banking sector and
introducing new securities and futures legislation to strengthen
and enhance Hong Kong's regulatory regime," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are also revamping the government's trade,
industry and investment structure to advance our initiatives for
promoting innovation and technology, attracting external direct
investment and improving services to industry and commerce by
making them even more business-friendly."
</P>
<P>
While not forgetting the lessons of the Asian financial turmoil,
Tsang said, "we are pursuing the twin goals of market reform and
technological transformation."
</P>
<P>
As prosperity returns it is not a question of "business as
usual", and the post-recession Hong Kong is a very different place
from the world of 1996, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Even by the traditional standards of resilience and risk-taking
of our business executives, the speed with which they are moving
into the information age and forging new relations with the
leading technology and internet multinationals is astonishing,
Tsang said.

Market forces will continue to drive the economy, he said,
adding that central planning by the backdoor, or any other door
for that matter, is not in the government's lexicon.
</P>
<P>
"We now realize that while the increased sophistication and
globalization of Hong Kong have generated new wealth, they have
also increased the volatility of our economy," Tsang said. "They
have also brought into sharp focus the overwhelming priority that
must be given to our ability to compete."
</P>
<P>
"The recession has forced us to search for new standards of
productivity from the work force, and competition is the firmest
assurance that a community will obtain the best value for the
money it spends," he said.
</P>
<P>
The market's crucial role in promoting economic success has
been demonstrated more dramatically over the past couple of years
than ever before, Tsang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Allowing the economy to be led by market forces rather than
directed by bureaucrats is not a recipe for conservatism, or an
argument for leaving things as they are, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are a government that passionately espouses maximum support
and minimum intervention," Tsang said, adding that it's an
extension of our role as a facilitator.
</P>
<P>
He said he was sure both the task force and the committee will
look forward to receiving the considered views of Hong Kong's
chambers of commerce, and other organizations on the way forward.

<HEADLINE> Barak Calls for National Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak called
on Monday for national reconciliation and urged the leaders of all
political parties to work for the national interests.
</P>
<P>
Israel can expect fateful decisions in the coming months over
the future of the country on both the peace process and social
issues and "it is vital to unite the various sectors of the Israeli
society," Barak said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The leadership of all parties bear the responsibility of making
supreme efforts, despite differences of opinion, to reach
understanding and national reconciliation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Barak issued the statement in response to Shas spiritual leader
Rabbi Ovadia Yosef's verbal attacks against Meretz Party leader and
Education Minister Yossi Sarid, which has caused a new political
crisis within his coalition and a political storm in Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly Torah lecture in Jerusalem Saturday night, Yosef
pointed his finger at Sarid, saying Sarid should be "uprooted" from
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Yosef even went further, saying "Sarid is the 'dark side'...may
his name and memory be erased. How long do we have to suffer this
wicked man? God will extirpate him..."
</P>
<P>
Yosef's remarks drew the attention of Attorney-General Elyakim
Rubinstein. Rubinstein called an urgent meeting of his top advisors
Sunday afternoon to discuss the matter. The participants viewed
Yosef's speech and reached the consensus that criminal
investigations should be initiated against the rabbi because the
remarks appeared to contain a clear element of incitement to
violence against Sarid.
</P>
<P>
The situation has forced Barak to take urgent measures to look
for ways to defuse the crisis and avoid indicting Yosef. While
calling Yosef to openly apologize to Sarid over the remarks, Barak
met Saturday night with Sarid, then later with his key One Israel
ministers, and then four Shas cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Shas ministers appeared to be attempting to use this crisis to
better their party's position in the coalition. One Israel
officials said the Shas ministers asked Barak in the meeting to
reopen the coalition agreements and bring forward the plans for a
cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Facing criticism from other political parties over the remarks,
Yosef wrote a statement Saturday night in which he tried to clarify
his position, but which fell short of Meretz's demands for a full
apology. Yosef said in the statement that he has no intention of
violence toward Sarid.
</P>
<P>
Yosef's outburst was not his first against Sarid and Meretz.
This time, his criticism against Sarid centered on what Shas
perceives as Sarid's rejection to provide enough funds from the
Education Ministry to cover Shas's financial deficit in its
schools.
</P>
<P>
Shas issued a statement on Monday, saying Yosef does not want to
apologize to Sarid.
</P>
<P>
The statement also threatened that Shas will pull out from the
government if Rubinstein orders a police investigation into the
remarks.
</P>
<P>
"If there is an investigation, there will be no government," the
statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Barak is scheduled to hold another round of meetings with the
coalition partners later Monday, first with ministers of the Meretz
party.

Barak's Office said in a statement, without elaborating on what the
preconditions are.
</P>
<P>
The statement was Israel's first official response to Clinton's
announcement in the Bangladesh capital of Dhaka earlier Monday that
he would meet the Syrian president in Geneva, Switzerland on March
26.
</P>
<P>
To prove the announcement was no surprise for Israel, the
statement pointed out that Barak is in constant touch with Clinton
and is closely monitoring the American moves to get the Israeli-
Syrian talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
It added that if there are direct talks between Israel and
Syria, Israel will work towards concluding a peace agreement which
will assure its vital interests and safeguard its security.
</P>
<P>
White House officials revealed that the Clinton-Assad Summit
would be held in Geneva, where the two leaders met last time in
1994, after Clinton ends his ongoing six-day visit to Bangladesh,
India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have predicted the resumption of the Israeli-
Syrian talks will be announced after the Geneva summit, which will
end the stalemate on the Syrian peace track.
</P>
<P>
Their peace talks, which resumed last December after a 45-month
break, hit a snag again after two rounds due to differences over
Israeli troop withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Israel captured
the plateau from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syria is demanding a prior Israeli commitment to a full
withdrawal to the June 4, 1967 borders. But Israel insisted on
discussing security arrangements and normalization of bilateral
ties first.

<HEADLINE> Israel Should Hand over all West Bank: Erekat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat said on Monday that Israel should transfer the remaining
land of the West Bank to the Palestinian sovereignty in the last
phase of redeployment.
</P>
<P>
This issue will be discussed at the talks due to start Tuesday
in Washington between the two sides, Erekat said before departure
together with the Palestinian delegation for the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
His delegation also comprises chief negotiator of the final
status, Yasser Abed Rabbo, chief of Palestinian security agency in
Gaza strip, Mohamed Dahlan, and a number of experts and
specialists.
</P>
<P>
Erekat stated the talks, at an air base near Washington, will be
held in the context of the two tracks where the Palestinian and
Israeli sides will discuss issues of the transitional stage and the
final status.
</P>
<P>
Under Sharm el Sheikh memorandum, the Israeli troops will begin
further pullout from the West Bank after completing three stages of
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israel has already completed the first and second phases of
troops redeployment and is expected to start on Tuesday the third
phase of redeployment that includes 6,1 percent of the West Bank,
thus leading to the handover of 42,9 percent of the territories in
the West Bank to the full or partial control of the Palestinian
Authority.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss other issues related to the
interim stage, such as the operation of the northern safe passage,
release of more Palestinian prisoners and the financial cooperation
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The eight-day talks in Washington, to be attended by the U.S
peace coordinator, Dennis Ross, will also deal with issues of the
final status, including Jerusalem, borders, refugees, settlements
and water.
</P>
<P>
The two sides hope to reach a frame agreement for these issues
to pave the way for a lasting peaceful treaty by next September.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Barak Faces New Political Storm (By Qi Deliang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Having survived one crisis after
another since its formation last July, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's ailing coalition was rocked by a recent political storm
triggered by incitative remarks made by Shas party spiritual
leader. In a weekly Torah lecture in Jerusalem Saturday night,
spiritual leader of the powerful ultra-Orthodox Shas party Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef pointed his finger at Education Minister Yossi Sarid,
saying Sarid should be "uprooted" from the seed of Israel.
</P>
<P>
He even went further, saying "Sarid is the 'dark side'...may his
name and memory be erased. How long do we have to suffer this
wicked man? God will extirpate him..."
</P>
<P>
Yosef's harsh words against Sarid not only received thunderous
applause among Shas followers, but also touched off another
political crisis in Israel which, if not resolved properly, may
threaten the stability of the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Yosef's remarks also drew the attention of Attorney-General
Elyakim Rubinstein who called an urgent meeting of his top advisors
Sunday afternoon to discuss the matter. They reached a consensus
that criminal investigations should be initiated against the Rabbi
because his remarks appeared to contain a clear element of
incitement to violence against Sarid.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein decided to postpone making a decision on whether to
order a police investigation against Yosef, so as to leave more
time for considering which articles of the law the Rabbi had
violated.
</P>
<P>
But political observers here believe that if Shas, one of the
important coalition partners, were to bolt over such a probe, or
even worse, an incitement that Yosef created, early elections would
be inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if Shas were saved from this dilemma and Meretz party
which Sarid comes from were forced to accept Yosef's remarks, then
Meretz, which is Barak's faithful supporter, will be forced to
leave the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The current situation has forced Barak to take urgent measures
to look for ways to defuse the crisis and avoid indicting Yosef.
While calling Yosef to openly apologize to Sarid over the remarks,
Barak met Saturday night with Sarid, then later with his key One
Israel ministers, and then four Shas cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Shas ministers appeared to be attempting to use this crisis to
better their party's position in the coalition. One Israel
officials said the Shas ministers asked Barak in the meeting to
reopen the coalition agreements and bring forward the plans for a
cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Facing criticism from other political parties over the remarks,
Yosef wrote a statement Saturday night in which he tried to clarify
his position, but fell short of Meretz's demands for a full
apology. Yosef said in the statement that he has no intention of
violence toward Sarid.
</P>
<P>
Yosef's outburst was not his first against Sarid and Meretz.
This time, his criticism against Sarid centered on what Shas
perceives as Sarid's rejection to allocate enough funds from the
Education Ministry to cover Shas's financial deficit in its
schools.
</P>
<P>
How would Barak settle the crisis is concerned to all at this
critical and sensitive moment while the stalled Middle East process
is reviving.

<HEADLINE> Israel Refuses to Offer Asylum for SLA: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel has refused to take in the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) after the Israeli
occupation forces withdrew from south Lebanon, which is slated for
July, the local Daily Star reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim
Sneh as saying on Sunday,"Turning the militiamen into refugees is
not a solution to their fate.
</P>
<P>
Sneh described the SLA as "Lebanese patriots" who have been
fighting for their lives and said that they should stay in their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978. It set up
a "security zone" in 1985 in south Lebanon with a self-claimed aim
of protecting its northern territories from cross-border guerrilla
attacks. The SLA, funded and controlled by Israel, helps the Jewish
state patrol the 15-kilometer-deep zone.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah, an Iranian- and Syrian-backed Muslim
guerrilla group, has been spearheading a war of attrition to oust
the SLA and Israeli forces from south Lebanon. Hezbollah has
repeatedly announced it will not forgive the SLA after the Israeli
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Jerusalem, Sneh stressed the
Israeli commitment to the SLA security but he didn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some 2,300 SLA men are asking for asylum,
and the figure may rise to 10,000 if their families are included.
</P>
<P>
Sneh also reiterated Israel's vow to withdraw from south Lebanon
by July.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet has approved Prime Minister Ehud Barak's plan to
withdraw its troops from south Lebanon by July, with or without an
agreement with Lebanon and Syria.

<HEADLINE> New Rwandan Cabinet to Be Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has formed a long awaited
new government with considerable changes made in the cabinet,
Rwanda News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the President's Office,
President Pasteur Bizimungu has reshuffled the cabinet and the new
government will be sworn in Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The new government is composed of 18 ministers and five state
ministers, the release said, adding that four new ministers and
two new ministers of state had been appointed.
</P>
<P>
The new government has been announced after a long delay due to
 disagreement between the president and other concerned parties,
according to General Secretary of the ruling Rwandan Patriotic
Front Charles Muligande.
</P>
<P>
"In order to cope with the problems in the country, the new
government is composed of people who are ready to systematically
deal with each and every problem," Muligande said.
</P>
<P>
He said "the modalities which had to be followed in appointing
the new cabinet included good political reputation, integrity and
broad bases."
</P>
<P>
The new government will avail information to people to do away
with dependency on rumors, which is a source of disorder that
arises from misinterpretation of events, he said.
</P>
<P>
To create a good image of the government, the Constitutional
Committee is soon to be formed and will determine the modalities
to regulate the succession and acquisition of political powers in
government, Muligande said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Visits Chechnya Ahead of Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President Vladimir
Putin arrived Monday in Grozny, capital of the breakaway Chechnya,
just six days ahead of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Putin flew in from the Black Sea resort of Sochi aboard a
fighter jet, the independent NTV television reported.
</P>
<P>
He will meet military commanders and chair a conference on
social and economic problems with government officials there,
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
A military campaign against Chechen rebels, launched last
September, is at the final stage with most of Chechnya now under
federal control.
</P>
<P>
Putin, 47, is the runaway favorite among the 12 candidates in
the balloting scheduled next Sunday. Most observers believe he
will collect some 60 percent of the votes, well above the 50
percent needed to win in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Early voting started in Chechnya last Friday among federal
servicemen there. The Chechen civilians will vote on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Veshnyakov, chairman of the Central Election
Commission, left for Chechnya earlier Monday to oversee
preparations for the vote in the region.

<HEADLINE> Russian Federal Assaults Continue on Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces continued
their efforts Monday to destroy remaining Chechen rebels as
fighting rages on in Komsomolskoye, where 46 rebels were killed
overnight.
</P>
<P>
The fighters, led by Chechen warlord Ruslan Gelayev, have been
trying in vain to break out of the southern Chechen village for
about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
One of the 46 killed rebels was an aide to the so-called
Chechen foreign minister, said Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, the
commander of Russian Interior Ministry troops.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, a Russian pilot, held by Chechen rebels after
his Su-25 attack plane was shot down last October, was rescued by
the Interior Ministry troops.
</P>
<P>
The pilot, identified as Alexander Zhukov, "is alive and well,
" Tikhomirov said.
</P>
<P>
Federal aircraft and helicopters flew 71 sorties on Sunday
against rebel positions in the Argun and Vedeno gorges and near
the village of Alkhazurovo. They reportedly destroyed 11 rebel
strongholds, seven vehicles, one high-caliber machine gun, two
mortars and a communications center, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Central Election Commission Chairman Alexander
Veshnyakov flew to Chechnya Monday to oversee preparations for the
Sunday presidential election in the republic, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He will inspect several polling stations, some of them located
with army units. Early voting by the servicemen started last
Friday, but local civilians will cast their votes on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A group of international observers, led by Director of the
OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights Gerard
Stoudmann, also accompanied Veshnyakov, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Russia, officials are warning Russians of Chechen
rebel threats to sabotage the Sunday voting.
</P>
<P>
"Bandits may turn up in (neighboring) Daghestan or Stavropol
territory or Ingushetia," said Colonel General Gennady Troshev,
acting commander of the federal forces.
</P>
<P>
As much of Chechnya is now under federal control, some Russian
troops have started pulling out of the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
The Russian army's 331st air-borne division will leave
Chechnya for its home base in Kostroma on Monday, air-borne forces
commander Colonel General Geogy Shpak said.
</P>
<P>
However, 4,000 paratroops will remain in Chechnya even after
the withdrawal, Shpak said.

<HEADLINE> Incentives Sought for Filipino Olympic Gold Medalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine congressman Ernesto
Herrera said Monday that he has filed a bill in the House of
Representatives, seeking to grant big incentives to each Filipino
athlete who wins the elusive Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement that the proposed incentives include a
lifetime monthly gratuity of 5,000 pesos (125 U.S. dollars) plus
the privilege to secure a 1-million-peso (25,000 U.S. dollars)
collateral-free loan from any governmet bank.
</P>
<P>
Under House Bill 3124, each Filipino Olympic gold medalist, his
or her spouse and children, shall also be entitled to preferential
treatment in public employment, the acquisiton of public lands,
the lease of pasture lands and the exploitation of natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
The bill also exempts each gold medalist and his or her family
members from payment of tuition and matriculation fees in all
public and private schools, including those providing post-
graduate education.
</P>
<P>
"It is only befitting, if not imperative, for the State to
recognize and honor Filipino men and women who achieve the supreme
distinction of winning the most coveted Olympic gold medal,"
Herrera said.
</P>
<P>
"A Filipino athlete who wins the elusive Olympic gold medal
should rightfully be hailed and treated as a national hero and
treasure," Herrera added.
</P>
<P>
Herrera expressed confidence that once HB 3124 is enacted, "our
athletes would be encouraged to achieve greater excellence in the
field of sports, thereby bringing glory to the country."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Calls for National Unity, Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Seyyed Ali Khamenei on Monday called on all Iranians to work for
national unity and national security in the Iranian new year.
</P>
<P>
National unity and national security should be "two fundamental
slogans for us," the leader said in his new year address, the
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian new year started at 1106 a.m. on Monday at the
Spring Equinox, according to a Zoroastrian tradition which is still
observed by the Iranians, though most of them are Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Terming national unity as the backbone of all national efforts,
Khamenei said it concerns the entirety of the people, especially
policy makers and those active on the scene of politics.
</P>
<P>
"There are some people who try to harm the unity, and surely
they are not friends of the Iranian nation," the leader said,
without naming anybody.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people to pay as much as attention to national
security, in absence of which there would be "no economy, no effort
for construction and honor." He stressed that insecurity is the
biggest danger threatening a nation.
</P>
<P>
The leader expressed hope that all Iranian people would observe
the two slogans of "national security" and "national unity" and
would take action for them.
</P>
<P>
Looking back on the past year, Khamenei said that there were
both "sweet and bitter events" which should serve as lessons for
the nation, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of voters' massive turnout in the 6th
parliamentary elections on February 18, which he said had brought
honor for the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
The polling, participated by about 27 million voters, resulted
in a landslide victory of reformers, who defeated their
conservative opponents by winning more than 75 percent of the total
290 seats.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei did not mention specific examples of bitter events, but
said there were conspiracies and plots of enemies who tried to
undermine the national security.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Iranian people faced big troubles concerning
their economic issues and every day life, noting that efforts made
in this respect did not go far enough to meet people's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Mohammed Khatami also congratulated the
Iranian people on the occasion of the new year, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
The president slammed the assassination attempt on prominent
reformist figure Saeed Hajjarian, saying the terrorist action "will
not leave any effect on the will of this nation on the road to
prosperity and progress."
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, a close adviser to Khatami and head of the reformist
daily Sobh-e Emrouz (This Morning), has been in a coma in hospital
since he was shot by yet unidentified gunmen on March 12.
</P>
<P>
But doctors treating him said he had opened his eyes several
times and expressed hope that he may finally survive.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the new year is the first year of the country's
third five-year economic development plan (2000-2005), which aims
at improving economic situation and social administrative
structure.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Leading Dailies Condemn Cult Mass Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

By Feng Jian
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's leading dailies, the New
Vision and the Monitor, have strongly condemned the mass suicide
of hundreds of cult members in the country's southwestern district
of Rukungiri on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In their editorials published on Monday, both dailies described
the mass suicide as a shame of Uganda and urged the authorities,
especially the security organizations, to curb cult activities in
order to prevent similar tragedies from happening again.
</P>
<P>
"It is a big challenge, especially in a country that cherishes
freedom of worship as enshrined in the Constitution," the New
Vision read. "There can be a fine line between genuine religious
worship and the eccentricities that characterize cults."
</P>
<P>
The Monitor newspaper, on its part, said that the whole nation
should on its guard to leave least room for such cults.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics showed that over 500 people of the cult
named Movement for Restoration of Ten Commandments of God,
including many women and their children, had been burnt to death
in the mass suicide.
</P>
<P>
Police are still investigating the incident and would in due
time publish an extensive list of the victims.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni Sunday condemned the incident in
strongest terms, saying the government would try all possible
means to check cult activities which endanger people's lives.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's National Electric Power
Authority (NEPA) had been debilitated by a 30 billion naira (300
million U.S. dollars ) debt before its management was sacked by
the presidency last week, reported the Guardian, a leading
Nigerian newspaper, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The authority was indebted, partly due to improper management
and corruption, to no fewer than 37 contractors, the report said,
adding that the tight fiscal policy of the current administration
also contributed to the collapse of the wholly government-owned
company.
</P>
<P>
The government sacked the company's general manager and other
high- ranking officials last week and put it under his direct
supervision of President Olusegun Obasanjo via a nine-man
technical board.
</P>
<P>
In a news brief in the presidential villa in Abuja last
Tuesday, Obasanjo made an unreserved apology to all Nigerians who
were badly disappointed by NEPA's awful performance.
</P>
<P>
He gave the year 2001 as the deadline for the end of the
epileptic power supply in the most populous African country, and
ordered immediate restructuring of NEPA for future privatization.

Protests by passengers, according to him, led to the arrest of
10 more Nigerians for what the authorities referred to as
"disturbing the peace and preventing (in terrorist fashion) the

The suspects, he said were given temporary discharge and were

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Ruling Party Disciplines Officials Over Sharia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian ruling People's Democratic
Party (PDP) is discouraging public officials, especially governors
elected on its platform, from introducing the controversial
Islamic legal system Sharia, the News Agency of Nigeria reported
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The party is determined to ensure that its officials stick to
its original goals and refrain from championing
sectionally-related interests like confederation, the report
quoted Deputy Publicity Secretary of the party Gbenga Olawepo as
saying in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
"One of the principal reasons why the action or inaction of
some governors and elective post holders in the country have been
precipitating crisis is because of their non-adherence to the
constitution of the party," he said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the pursuits of these officials have regrettably no
place in PDP' s manifesto, Olawepo said, stressing that it is very
clear that the party believes in genuine federalism.
</P>
<P>
It will amount to a breach of contract with the electorate for
officials to seek to implement programs outside their campaign
promises, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clashes over the introduction of Sharia between Christians and
Moslems in some states of the West African country killed some
1,000 people last month.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets up Six HIV Screening Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has set up
six screening centers for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
related diseases in the country.
</P>
<P>
The centers will be put into full operation in the states of
Kogi, Nasarawa, Ekiti, Taraba, Jigawa and Bauchi before the end of
this year, the News Agency of Nigeria Monday quoted Minister of
State for Health Aminat Ndalolo as saying in Patigi, capital of
the country's Kwara State.
</P>
<P>
She said that the move is in line with the present
administration's determination to provide good health services,
especially to control Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
to ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
On media reports of alleged cure of AIDS via traditional
method, the minister said that she can't take any certain
findings as the solution to such a destructive disease.
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at it with all the medical ethics," she said.
"In fact, some of the traditional people that have discovered some
cure to it have been given some money, with some patients sent to
them."
</P>
<P>
"These traditional healers are being introduced to
international bodies so that their findings can be reprocessed to
get a final claim," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, we also have many of the HIV victims coming out by
themselves now and the ministry is helping them in the area of
treatment as well as medication," she added.
</P>
<P>
Disclosing that her ministry is ready to take care of orphans
whose parents are victims of HIV/AIDS, Ndalolo said that
international agencies like the World Health Organization and
United Nations Children's Fund have come up with laudable
proposals that would cater for the orphans.
</P>
<P>
A recent government report indicated that Nigeria has now an
estimated adult population of 2.6 million living with HIV, second
only to Ethiopia in sub-Sahara African continent.
</P>
<P>
The country's HIV carrying population may hit some 4.9 million
by 2003 at the current growth rate, the report said.

Amsterdam bourse has a reputation for financial derivatives while
the Brussels bourse has been mainly dealing with small and medium-
sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Le Soir quoted Belgian Finance Minister Didier
Reynders as saying that the merged Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels
bourse is likely to take in the bourses of Luxembourg, Madrid and
Milan to grow even bigger.

LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A 10-month-old baby girl and her
mother were injured Monday in a petrol bomb attack on their home
at Glernarm, west of the Northern Ireland capital Belfast.
</P>
<P>
They both suffered burns when the device was thrown through the

</P>
<P>
The mother fled with her baby from the burning house at
Glenview Cottages at about 0115 GMT and both were treated in
hospital for burn injuries.
</P>
<P>
Their injuries were not believed to be serious. A man who was
also in the house during the attack escaped unscathed.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said no motive had been established for the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's peace process is in crisis following last

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Crack Down on Internet Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will take measures soon
to curb widespread online gambling, including blocking access to
cyber casinos and bringing criminal charges against operators and
online bettors, said the Ministry of Information and Communication
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The danger of Internet gambling is encroaching into all levels
of society by the unrestrained accessibility of the Internet. It
is the time to stop it before it grows into a bigger threat to the
public, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
A special task force will be established by the ministry to
track down cyber casinos together with government agencies and
internet service providers. Some 600 cyber casinos are operating
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will enhance cooperation with police and the tax
office to monitor Web gambling and check the outflow of foreign
currencies through the sites.
</P>
<P>
Under a revised legal stipulation, violators may face fines of
up to 200 million won (some 280,000 U.S dollars) and three years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
Public facilities, such as schools, libraries, PC rooms and
government buildings, will be required to install software to
block gambling in their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will require commercial internet service providers
to take measures to prevent South Korean users from accessing
offshore sites.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also is working on a law revision designed to
punish operators and habitual users of Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
Although illegal, online gambling has been on the rise in South
Korea through web sites running on a secret membership basis and
toll-free telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
Police have recently cracked down on two Web site operators for
accepting bets and wagers over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Many South Korean gamblers log on to offshore sites whose
servers are based in regions such as Bermuda and Gibraltar, where
online gambling is legal.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 sites operated by foreign companies have been found to
offer services in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Access to overseas sites is virtually unrestrained to South
Korean Internet users and they are very difficult to track.
Gambling on such sites is on a sharp increase, causing huge
amounts of foreign currency to flow out of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The number of online casinos is mushrooming worldwide from some
15 in 1996 to more than 600 today, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Revenues for some 200 companies that operate those sites are
estimated to reach nearly 1.5 billion U.S. dollars this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Britain Block Railroad Contracts: Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and Britain have blocked
37 railroad contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries under the
U.N. oil-for-food program, said Iraqi Minister of Transport and
Communications Ahmad Murtadha Ahmad Khalil on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency (INA), the
minister said that Iraq signed a total of 42 railroad contracts
with foreign countries, but only five got approved by the U.N.
Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
The minister accused the U.S. and British delegates at the U.N.
Sanctions Committee of deliberately putting the other contracts on
hold.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long condemned the U.S. and Britain for impeding the
implementation of the U.N. oil-for-food deal by blocking the
approval of its contracts for purchasing humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Under the program now in its seventh phase, Iraq is allowed to
sell a certain amount of oil and use part of the revenue, under the
U.N. supervision, to buy humanitarian goods for its people, who
have been under stringent sanctions since Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by Iraq's health ministry, as many
as 1.27 million people, mostly children and the elderly, have died
as a direct result of malnutrition and medical shortages caused by
the decade-long sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior Israeli officials on Sunday sharply criticized the
United States' more positive attitude toward Iran, saying it will
succeed only in encouraging a government opposed to the peace
process and keeping a real democratic revolution in Iran at bay.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
announced a series of policy steps, including lifting the ban on
the import of certain luxury items, aimed at bettering relations
between Washington and Teheran, and called on Iran to open a new
page in its relations with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
While formally Jerusalem would not criticize the U.S., and top
officials in the Foreign Ministry actually welcomed the move to
rapprochement, several top government officials privately expressed
disappointment at the new stance, saying it is a mistake to award
the "untested" new government in Teheran.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein is expected to
instruct the police to open an investigation against the
ultraorthodox Shas party's mentor Rabbi Ovadia Yosef this week
following the rabbi's inflammatory remarks against Education
Minister Yossi Sarid.
</P>
<P>
Yosef drew an analogy between Haman, the villain in this week's
upcoming Jewish Purim holiday, and Sarid in his weekly Saturday
night address carried by local radio. He also stated that Sarid's
name should be wiped out of the world forever because of Sarid's
constant attacks on the Orthodox way of life.
</P>
<P>
According to one judicial source, the possible charges against
Yosef include incitement to violence, insulting public official and
issuing threats.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- White House officials traveling with U.S. President Bill
Clinton in India said Sunday that there is a possibility Clinton
will stop in Geneva on his way home from Asia to meet Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad on March 26.
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff John Podesta refused to comment.
Israel Radio quoted American sources as saying the Syrians have
agreed in principle to such a meeting, which would deal with the
possibility of resuming talks with Israel, but that neither a site
or a date has been set.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's cabinet Sunday approved revised maps for the long-
delayed withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank. The decision
paves the way for a handover on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Once the transfer is complete, the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) will be in full control of 18 percent of the West
Bank and in partial control of 21.7 percent. They will also have
full or partial control of 98 percent of the Palestinian
population.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PNA officials said they are skeptical about whether
the week-long round of talks in Washington set to begin Tuesday
will lead to a breakthrough on final status and interim issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- An Asia-Pacific ministerial
seminar on building capacities for fighting transnational
organized crime opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar is jointly organized by the Center for
International Crime Prevention of the United Nations Office for
Drug Control and Crime Prevention (ODCCP) and the Thai government.
</P>
<P>
The seminar aims to mobilize political support and regional
cooperation for the successful elaboration of the Convention
against Transnational Organized Crime and its protocols as well as
their implementation, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Invited to attend the seminar were ministers responsible for
dealing with transnational organized crime issues and high level
experts from 21 countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will provide a forum for political leadership of
the countries and senior government officials to address and
exchange views on the issues of particular concern to the region,
they said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, it will help to identify the technical
cooperation needs and modalities for addressing them.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan were present at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization has been one of the major forces shaping our
societies over the past decade. Unfortunately, globalization has
also led to changes in the way criminal elements within our
societies are operating," Chuan said in his opening address.
</P>
<P>
He urged to adopt new legislation, build up cooperative
endeavors at both the regional and global levels and come up with
more innovative techniques to combat the international organized
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Organized criminal groups increasingly threaten law and order
of modern world. Their activities are becoming ever more
transnational and wide-ranging, affecting social, economic and
political institutions.
</P>
<P>
Money-laundering, trafficking in human beings, arms and drugs
sales and corruption are only some of the activities carried out
by organized crime groups.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of ODCCP, profits from such criminal
activities are estimated at 1.5 trillion U.S. dollars a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel freed 10 Palestinian
security prisoners on Monday, bringing the number of those Israel
has released during the past two days to 15.
</P>
<P>
All the 10 Palestinians released on Monday were convicted of
attempted murder and killing of Israelis and so-called
collaborators and their release was a goodwill gesture to the
Palestinians on the occasion of the Feast of Sacrifice, Israel
Prison Authority said.
</P>
<P>
Among the 10, three were freed early Monday morning at the
Messilut Junction outside the West Bank city of Tulkarm and the
remaining seven will be set free at noon at Nahaloz, from where
they will travel to Gaza.
</P>
<P>
As approved by the Israeli cabinet, 30 Palestinian prisoners
will be freed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Israel freed five Palestinian security prisoners. All
of them are East Jerusalem residents and belong to the main
Palestinian political faction of Fatah led by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been discussing the
release of more Palestinians from Israeli jails, but no final
agreement has been reached so far. The two sides agreed to discuss
the matter again in Washington on Tuesday, when the two sides
reopen their talks there.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed last September,
Israel has freed 383 Palestinians in total by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side said that around 1,600 Palestinians are
still being held in Israeli jails, waiting for release.

their probe into the incident, the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, vice chairman of Tehran Municipal Council and
publisher of the reformist daily Sobh-e Emruz (This Morning), was
shot and badly wounded on March 12 by two yet unidentified gunmen
in front of the municipal council building.
</P>
<P>
He has been in a coma since then and a team of skilled
physicians, including experts from the U.S., has been trying to
save his life. Doctors said his conditions are improving.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, the former deputy intelligence minister, was believed
to have played an important role in the landslide victory of the
reformists, main supporters of President Khatami, in the key
parliamentary elections on February 18.
</P>
<P>
There are speculations that the assassination was carried out by
hard-line elements in the conservative camp of the Islamic
republic.
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid that the (Hajjarian's) case would create some
ambiguities and rumors in the country, like the serial political
killings," in which several Iranian opposition leaders and
dissident writers were killed later 1998, Khamenei said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Iranian authorities should not allow the cases to
be the pretext to raise "baseless" accusations against some "
reliable" organizations such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps and the Basij (mobilization forces) and bring them under
question.
</P>
<P>
After receiving Khamenei's letter, President Khatami asked
intelligence and interior ministers and the National Security
Council to accelerate their probe into the assassination attempt on
Hajjarian, IRNA said.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Hospitalized in Jordan Due to Food Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 people, including 28
children, were hospitalized in the northern Baqa'a district of
Jordan in the past two days for alleged food poisoning, official
sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Around 120 people from a Palestinian refugee camp in the Baqa'a
district, 40 kilometers north of the capital Amman, sought
treatment in hospitals on Saturday and Sunday after suffering from
dizziness, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pains.
</P>
<P>
All the victims, between four and 70 years of age, had been
released from hospital after receiving treatment and none of them
was in serious conditions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Mosleh Tarawneh was quoted by the semi-official
daily Jordan Times as saying on Monday that laboratory tests were
being conducted to define the cause of the poisoning, and the
results would be known in two days.
</P>
<P>
Most of the patients claimed they fell ill after eating hummus
(pastes made of oil, butter and vegetables) and foul (broad beans),
used in traditional dishes and eaten with bread.
</P>
<P>
Three restaurants and a bakery in the Baqa'a district had been
closed down for allegedly serving the contaminated food, and their
food samples had been submitted to a state lab for chemical and
germ tests.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh has ruled out the possibility that contaminated water
had been the cause of the poisoning, saying the case would have
been much more serious if the water was polluted in the area.
</P>
<P>
Water samples from the district are being tested.
</P>
<P>
Some of the victims claimed they had not eaten hummus or foul,
and blamed the poor waster system and unsanitary water in their
area as the cause of the food poisoning.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Expects 4.4 Mln Tourist Arrivals by 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of
Tourism (DOT) said Monday that it expects 4.4 million tourist
arrivals by 2004, a two-fold increase over the 1999 figure of 2.2
million.
</P>
<P>
DOT Secretary Gemma Cruz Araneta expressed confidence of
attaining this target in the light of her 520-million-peso (13
million U.S. dollars) "rediscovery" program, which aims to
maximize visitor arrivals through varied means.
</P>
<P>
Araneta declared in a statement that the "rediscovery" program
is being pursued through exploration and adventure, spurring
domestic tourism, highlighting the country's treasures, and
encouraging overseas Filipinos to explore their roots in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In addition to tourism arrivals, Araneta envisions 10.5 percent
contribution to the country's Gross Development Project (GDP) by
2002, from 8.7 percent in 1997, and 10.5 percent of the country's
workforce in the industry by 2002, up from 8.7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Araneta said the DOT has positioned the country's three main
regions of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao into three main tourism
clusters.
</P>
<P>
She said the Luzon cluster will be positioned as a multi-
faceted destination with a full range of markets and products.
</P>
<P>
The Visayas cluster will be a resort center thanks to its high-
quality beaches and island sights.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Mindanao region is an exotic wilderness
and a colorful cultural destination, said the DOT secretary.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Speed up Administrative Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government recently
announced new measures to speed up its administrative reform.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai has appointed his deputy Nguyen
Tan Dung as deputy head of the Government Steering Board for
Administrative Reform to speed up administrative reform of the
country, according to Vietnam News Agency (VNA) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Other key members of the steering board were also appointed by
Khai during his working session with the board early this month in
Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aimed at reviewing accomplishments and shortcomings
of the board in recent months as well as defining its tasks in the
first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Khai identified several important tasks of this year, which
include reviewing, readjusting and supplementing functions, tasks
and administrative power of administrative agencies.
</P>
<P>
Those tasks must be completed at key ministries in the first
half of the year, said Khai, adding that his government will study
initial administrative reform results of key ministries to issue
official decisions on the re-organization of agencies under the
control of the government and give inter-ministerial instructions.
</P>
<P>
Localities including Ho Chi Minh City, Hai Phong, Da Nang, Nghe
An,Quang Ninh and Ba Ria-Vung Tau have exerted great efforts in
working out new administrative reform ways to improve management
operations in conformity with the new economic mechanism, the VNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
However, it said there remain a number of shortcomings and
weaknesses in administrative reform activities that fail to meet
the requirements of the National Assembly and the government.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Build Software Park in Subic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Presidential Palace said in statement that the plan of the
Subic Bay Industrial Park to establish a software program
manufacturing center in Subic has been approved by President
Joseph Estrada over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority Chairman Felicito Payumo, who
discussed the plan with Estrada in a meeting over the weekend,
said the planned software center will tap thousands of Filipino
information technology workers.
</P>
<P>
According to Payumo, this software industry park commands less
resource requirements such as power but will create more jobs and
has a "high-value added" component.
</P>
<P>
He said the software development park will have an initial 3,
000 English-proficient skilled programmers, which will eventually
go up to 5,000. It targets about 5 billion U.S. dollars worth of
software exports per year.
</P>
<P>
Payumo noted that the 5-billion-dollar production of 5,000
workers has a value-added of 100,000 dollars per worker, unlike
the low-end manufacturing industry, whose value-added per worker
is only 10 to 15 U.S. cents for every dollar.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Developed Countries to Help Eradicate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua on Sunday, the prime
minister warned that with the fast development of technology in
developed countries, the gap between the rich nations and the poor
ones might grow very fast and that is very dangerous to the
well-being of everybody.
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a need now for the whole world to come
together and see they can assist the poor countries because
otherwise if they don't, the crisis that might develop in these
poor countries will obviously affect the economies and even the
stability and peace in the developed countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said "the attempt of reducing debt to the Highly Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) is a positive theme toward that direction."
</P>
<P>
"We would really want to see those efforts increased so that
the poor countries can also catch up with the rich nations," he
said. "I think everybody now has to see this problem quite
seriously and critically."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sumaye expressed his confidence over Tanzania's
domestic economic situation.
</P>
<P>
"We are quite confident that we are doing fine in economic
fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The micro economic parameters are very much under control," he
said, adding that "a lot of state companies and parastatals have
been privatized" and the "privatization is still going on."
</P>
<P>
According to Sumaye, the country's inflation has come down
quite stably. "We are now at about 6.6 percent, the lowest in 30
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister admitted that agricultural
production is still a headache to the government.
</P>
<P>
"During the past four years, the weather has not been very
favorable to us," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the complete miss of short rains at the end of last
year is a blow to the food situation in Tanzania because the
country normally gets about one-third of its food requirements
from the short rains.
</P>
<P>
"We have not so far requested for international food
assistance," he said, noting that "since last year, we tried to
refrain from asking for food every now and then."
</P>
<P>
"We will ask when things are really out of control, but if the
current rains continue, we think we can manage," he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets DPRK FM (More Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
said he believed that still greater growth will be made in
traditional Sino-DPRK relations in the new century in accordance
with the wishes of the people of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks during his meeting with visiting Paek Nam
Sun, foreign minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK), and his party at Zhongnanhai, site of the central
government, here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he was glad that the talks held between Chinese
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and Paek last Saturday had a full
exchange of views on the further expansion of bilateral friendly
relations and other issues of common concern, and reached a lot of
important consensus.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu asked Paek to convey to Kim Jong Il, general
secretary of the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee, cordial
regards from Chinese President Jiang Zemin and National People's
Congress (NPC) Standing Committee Chairman Li Peng and his own,
and also convey his personal greetings to DPRK Premier Hong Song
Nam.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the traditional friendship between China and the
DPRK was initiated and nurtured by the older generation of leaders
of the two countries, describing such friendship as "common
valuable assets" of the people of China and the DPRK. Thanks to
the concerted efforts of both sides, Zhu added, such friendly
relations have won new progress in recent years. "The Communist
Party of China and the Chinese government attached great
importance to the Sino-DPRK friendship and have made our active
and sincere efforts for the consolidation and further growth of
our relationship," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Paek forwarded cordial regards General Secretary Kim Jong Il to
Jiang, Li and Zhu, as well as cordial regards from Premier Hong to

<HEADLINE> Philippine Agriculture Expected to Grow by 3.3 Pct in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that the country's agricultural sector is expected to grow
by 3 to 3.3 percent in 2000, higher than the averaged 2 percent
growth rate in the past 14 years.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Benjamin Diokno of the Department of Budget and
Management (DBM) said this is because the government will continue
to implement in full blast its programs to raise farm productivity
and ensure food security.
</P>
<P>
Diokno said in a radio interview that while the agriculture
sector posted a higher growth rate of 6.49 percent last year, its
expansion was a takeoff from the negative growth rate it
experienced in 1998.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, this year's projected growth rate of 3.3
percent is a takeoff from the 1999 figure, Diokno added.
</P>
<P>
For this year, Diokno said, the DBM will release over 40
billion pesos (1 billion U.S. dollars) for the administration's
programs and projects in the agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
Most of the amount, he said, would go to integrated
agricultural development projects in Mindanao, which Philippine
President Joseph Estrada has vowed to transform into the country's
food basket.
</P>
<P>
Mindanao's vast fertile land consists of 102,000 square
kilometers or 34 percent of the country's total. The island's
value added contribution to the country's agriculture and fishery
sector averaged 34 percent over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"One-third of the agriculture budget will go to Mindanao
because the president wants to make it the country's food basket.
Mindanao has great potential because it has the land and climate
for it," Diokno said.
</P>
<P>
Food security is one of the Philippine government's five
centerpiece programs, alongside mass housing, peace and order, the
fight against graft and corruption, and electoral reforms.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Deports U.S. Embassy Bombing Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has deported an
Egyptian suspected to have taken part in the 1998 U.S. Embassy
bombing in Dar es Salaam after charges against him were dropped,
Tanzanian media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mustapha Mahmoud Said Ahmed, 44, was acquitted last Thursday by
Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court following a nolle prosequi
notice from the Director of Public Prosecutions asking the court
to set him free, said Director of Criminal Investigations of
Tanzania Adadi Rajabu in a statement issued at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed was repatriated to Egypt early Sunday in accordance with
Tanzanian immigration laws, Rajabu said.
</P>
<P>
He said Ahmed, along with Rashid Saleh Hemed, a Tanzanian from
Zanzibar, had faced 11 counts of murder that occurred at the U.S.
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
But Hemed would continue to face the charges, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed and Hemed have been languishing in remand prison for the
last 18 months since their arrest after the car-bomb blast at the
U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam on August 7, 1998, killing 11 people
and injuring 76 others.
</P>
<P>
The trial against the two suspects had made little progress
with the prosecution asking for numerous adjournments on the
ground that there had been no complete investigation since
September 21, 1998 when they first appeared in court.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Five people died on the

overturned in Tanzania's eastern Morogoro Region Sunday afternoon,
the Guardian newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>

The vehicle, which had overturned less than two weeks ago in
the same region and injured several passengers, veered off the
slippery road as it sped through the rain, eyewitnesses were
quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Plans First Census After Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has started preparing for
its first population census since the 1994 genocide, the East
African weekly newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A census commission had been established two months ago to
begin working on the structure, said Director Maurece Buchaju of
the Rwanda National Population Office.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, scheduled to take place in July this year, is
expected to cost seven million U.S. dollars to be defrayed by the
European Union, the U. N. Fund for Population Activities and the
Dutch government, he said.
</P>
<P>
The last census in the African nation was carried out in 1991
with a population of 7.4 million. Although about half a million
people died in the 1994 genocide, Rwanda's current population is
estimated at eight million.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the National Population Office show that in
1991 the country had a population growth rate of 3.1 percent and
the present rate is put around three percent.
</P>
<P>
At the present rate, the country's population would have shot
up to 16 million by 2023 and this is too high, Buchaju said.
</P>
<P>
He said the census is aimed at determining the exact number of
people to enable the government to plan and distribute available
resources appropriately.
</P>
<P>
It is also aimed to establish the main focus groups, such as
women and youth, who are considered the most vulnerable, he said.

KUALA LUMPUR -- Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
Monday called on Asia not to depend solely on outside help to
develop but instead to rely on "Asian Values" as a source of
strength.
</P>
<P>
Although there seems to be some skepticism about the virtue of
Asian values, Asia could capitalize on it in its effort to develop
and revitalize the region the "Asian way," he said while opening
an international conference on Sustainable Urban Development in
the New Millennium here. He elaborated Asian values are "an
absence of extreme individualism, a sense of responsibility for
the community, belief in strong family, reverence for education,
frugality, hard work, national teamwork, a social contract between
the people and the state, moral wholesomeness, a free but
responsible press, a belief in citizens as stake holders, and last
but not least respect for the environment." (Malaysia-Asian

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches 2nd National Nutrition Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka Monday launched an
islandwide National Nutrition Week for the second consecutive year
with a special focus on iron deficiency anaemia.
</P>
<P>
"More than half of Sri Lankan children and women and one-third
of the adolescent population suffer from iron deficiency anaemia,"
said Collin Glennie, representative of United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF), in a message to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
This year's theme of "Give Iron a Chance for Health and
Strength" was determined to highlight the importance of dealing
with iron deficiency anaemia in the country, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
During the week, much publicity will be given to the iron
deficiency anaemia and its consequences such as low birth weight,
poor physical growth and poor mental concentration, vulnerability
for diseases, lethargy, idleness and tiredness.
</P>
<P>
"Nutritional anaemia needs to be corrected to improve
productivity of the labor force, thereby enhancing economic
development," said Nimal Siripala de Silva, Sri Lankan minister of
health, in a message to mark the event.
</P>
<P>
The major objectives of the week include the review of existing
programs, new policy formulation to improve nutritional care,
recognition of public health staff in contributing to reduction of
malnutrition and increasing public awareness.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka launched its first National Nutrition Week in March,
1999 to create an awareness among the public on the need to uplift
nutrition levels of the student population.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Meets Foreign Investment Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's attractive
investment climate has enabled the country to meet a target of
securing 8.8 billion ringgit (about 2.315 billion U.S. dollars) in
foreign investment a year, Deputy International Trade and Industry
Minister Kerk Choo Ting said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Statistics show that each year the government approves foreign
investments exceeding 10 billion ringgit (about 2.631 billion
dollars). This shows Malaysia still has an environment preferred
by foreign investors," he told Parliament here during question
time.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign investment in the manufacturing sector totaled
12.3 billion ringgit (about 3.236 billion dollars) last year
against 13.1 billion ringgit (about 3.447 billion dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy minister, foreign investments in 1998
were mainly for chemical industries, petroleum, electronics and
electrical industries as well as basic metals, with the four
industries accounting for more than 72 percent of total foreign
investments for that year.
</P>
<P>
But foreign investments in 1999 concentrated on electronics and
electrical industries, petroleum and on paper production and
printing, with the three industries accounting for 82.1 percent of
the total foreign investments for that year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry organized eight trade and investment
missions abroad last year.

FUZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The police in east China's Fujian
Province solved 9,921 cases of economic crimes from 1997 to 1999,

trade companies as the victims. Another case was the embezzlement
of 130 million yuan in public funds, and yet another involved 85
million US dollars.

During the past two years, the local police launched a anti-
smuggling campaign across the province and investigated 161
smuggling cases, arresting 138 suspects and confiscating smuggled
goods valued at 99.35 million yuan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> "Dead" Woman Recovers in Coffin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A woman aged 88, who had been
pronounced dead, came back to life after having been placed in a
coffin preparatory to her funeral in Anshan City, in northeast
China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
She was soon sent to a local hospital, where she was found to
be in satisfactory condition, with only a minor respiratory
problem.
</P>
<P>
She had suffered from tracheitis for some time, and suddenly
stopped breathing. A local doctor pronounced her clinically dead.
</P>
<P>
Her family members called the city's funeral home and moved the
woman to a mortuary room, where she was dressed in a shroud and
put in a glass coffin.
</P>
<P>
However, one of her family members suddenly detected vapor on
the interior of the glass, and the "dead" woman's eyelid movements.
So she was immediately rescued, but it had been two hours after
she was declared dead.
</P>
<P>
The woman has now been hospitalized for further examination.
Doctors at the hospital said that the woman had stopped breathing
as a lack of oxygen in the brain. They pointed out that death can
only be declared half an hour after a monitoring period starts
after no pulse or breathing can be sensed by an electrocardiograph.

<HEADLINE> Queen to Remain Affectionate to Australia Regardless of Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Queen Elizabeth II of the United
Kingdom said Monday that her affection for Australia would remain
regardless of what the future might bring in terms of the republic
debate.
</P>
<P>
She said she respected the outcome of Australia's last November
referendum, in which the electorate refused to establish the
country as a republic, and would continue to faithfully serve as
Queen of Australia.
</P>
<P>
"I have always made it clear that the future of the monarchy in
Australia is an issue for you the Australian people and you alone
to decide by democratic and constitutional means," she told a
state luncheon in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
During the state luncheon hosted by Australian Prime Minister
John Howard and New South Wales state Premier Bob Carr, the Queen
said it was her privilege and pleasure to serve as "Queen of
Australia."
</P>
<P>
"But we must look forward as well as back," she said. "
Australia has always been a country on the move and will go on
being so."
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the future may bring my lasting respect and deep
affection for Australia and Australians everywhere will remain as
strong as ever," she said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Cancels F16 Fighter Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
officially canceled the lease-to-buy contract for 28 F16 fighter
planes Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deal was made in December 1998 between the previous New
Zealand government with the National Party as its ruling party and
the United States government.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, leasing the F16s is estimated to cost New
Zealand 362 million NZ dollars (180 million U.S. dollars) in the
next 10 years, rising to about 700 million NZ dollars (346 million
U.S.dollars) if New Zealand takes up an option to buy them.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark indicated before the
general election in last November that if the Labor Party with her
as its leader won the election, her party would cancel the deal.
She views the deal "too expensive to justify."
</P>
<P>
The second main reason for the cancellation is that Helen Clark
holds the view that it is not the top priority of the New Zealand
defense policy to upgrade its airforce's offensive capacity.
</P>
<P>
The official decision on the cancellation of the deal was taken
by the New Zealand Cabinet at its regular meeting Monday. Before
the meeting, Helen Clark had telephoned U.S. Ambassador to New
Zealand Carole Moseley-Braun to ensure the New Zealand's
cancellation of the lease-to-buy contract for 28 F16 fighter
planes came as "no surprise to the United States."
</P>
<P>
According to a press release, the New Zealand government
announced Monday afternoon that it would not proceed with the
arrangements to lease and purchase the 28 F16 fighter aircraft
entered into by the previous government.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the cancellation of the deal
would cost New Zealand 10 million to 12 million NZ dollars (4.95
million to 5.94 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
WELLINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister for Trade
Negotiations Jim Sutton is to visit China and the Republic of
Korea after concluding his visit to Australia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Monday by the New Zealand government,
Sutton said his visit to China and the Republic of Korea reflects
the importance New Zealand places on its relationship with North
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"China's reforms are opening up great new potential for New
Zealand exporters and its pending accession to the World Trade
Organization will do much to turn that potential into reality," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"However, right now there are outstanding issues which require
ministerial intervention to ensure a fair deal for our traders.
The wool quota is one such issue and I will be taking the
opportunity to discuss our access problems with Chinese ministers,
" Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
He added his visit also provides an opportunity to build a
relationship with trade and agriculture counterparts in Beijing,
and with business and local leaders in Shanghai, which is an
increasingly important market and investment destination for New
Zealand firms.
</P>
<P>
Sutton's visit to the Republic of Korea will follow his trip to
Beijing and Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Asia Urged to Rely on Asian Values for Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Monday called on Asia not to depend solely on
outside help to develop but instead to rely on "Asian Values" as a
source of strength.
</P>
<P>
Although there seems to be some skepticism about the virtue of
Asian values, Asia could capitalize on it in its effort to develop
and revitalize the region the "Asian way," he said while opening
an international conference on Sustainable Urban Development in
the New Millennium here.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated Asian values are "an absence of extreme
individualism, a sense of responsibility for the community, belief
in strong family, reverence for education, frugality, hard work,
national teamwork, a social contract between the people and the
state, moral wholesomeness, a free but responsible press, a belief
in citizens as stake holders, and last but not least respect for
the environment."
</P>
<P>
He said most of the initiatives would have to come from within
the region using its own ingenuity, wisdom, available resources,
regional cooperation and a lot of hard work.
</P>
<P>
Much knowledge, know-how and capacity for improved decision-
making are now available in Asia, Mahathir said, stressing however
that there was a great need for mechanisms that can transform what
an individual, group or nation knows into something that others
can use.
</P>
<P>
He said it was imperative for Asia that growth must be revived
as this was where the links between economic growth, the
alleviation of poverty and environmental conditions were essential.
</P>
<P>
"Unless developed countries choose less resource-intensive
lifestyles and develop less polluting technologies, it will be
impossible to make the transition to a sustainable world economy,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
About 60 international experts will talk on various urban
development topics at the three-day conference.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Assists 2 Million Poor Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
spent 32 billion rupees (440 million U.S. dollars) during the last
four years to uplift about 2 million families, the official Daily
News reported on Monday.

<P>
Under the Samurdhi Program (poverty alleviation project), the

<P>
The government established the Samurdhi Authority in 1995 to
implement projects to uplift the quality of life of the under
privileged.
</P>
<P>
According to data obtained from 235 divisional secretariats,
the Samurdhi projects have made a significant contribution towards
improving the income levels of the beneficiary families.
</P>
<P>
Around four percent of the beneficiaries had ceased receiving
poor relief entitlement consequent to an increase in the levels of
their income, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It added that the government's efforts to alleviate poverty has
changed from a simple income transfer to a more comprehensive
program encompassing banking, insurance, savings, job-oriented
training, infrastructure development and self-employment.

</P>
<P>
Three ships can berth at the wharf simultaneously, the report

world, handling all of its imports and over 90 percent of its
exports.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Host Int'l Business, Technology Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- This commercial metropolis in
Eastern China will hold an international conference on business
incubation and technology innovation from April 18 to 19, which is
aimed at inspiring the country's young service providers for high-
tech developers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Science and
Technology, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation,
the Ministry of Education and the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
will be chaired by Shanghai's Mayor Xu Kuangdi and State Science
and Technology Minister Zhu Lilan.
</P>
<P>
The term "business incubation" was coined in the US in the
1950s, when some companies and organizations were set up to offer
package services to venture firms, which include providing
production and communications facilities as well as policy,
financial and legal consultation.
</P>
<P>
Such services are important for cutting production costs and
abridging the transformation period from research findings to
products during the global technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
The organizers expect the conference to introduce the practical
experiences of foreign enterprises.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998 there were over 3,300 business incubation
companies around the world, mainly based in the US and Europe.
The business emerged in China a dozen years ago, and there are now
over 100 companies of this type. They have successfully helped
shape some 1,300 high-tech companies employing over 140,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be held at the International Conference
Center in the city's Pudong District, where the 1999 Fortune
Global Forum was held.

<HEADLINE> Hitzfeld Demands No Total Commercialism in Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Bayern Munich head coach Ottmar
Hitzfeld warned on Sunday that commercialism was blooming in the
modern football at the expense of the game.
</P>
<P>
"Money is more and more at the center of football. I believe we
have already crossed a bordes. We must start thinking less about
commerce but about sporting quality. It is not negative to be
modest," Hitzfeld told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag.
</P>
<P>
Hitzfeld criticized especially Spanish giants Real Madrid, who
invested so much money to the transfer market as hiring French
player Nicolas Anelka for more than 30 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"It's irresponsible. It undermines the credibility of football.
If people only has an eye to profit and not to humanity I think we
are on the wrong way," said the 51-year-old coach.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hitzfeld stressed that he had no illusions on the
issue because "there is no solidarity." He said that in Bayern
Munich people will not follow the fashion or drift with the stream.
</P>
<P>
Hitzfeld makes a strong claim for the second league title in a
row for Bayern, which is also seeking victories in the Champions
League and German Cup.
</P>
<P>
He led Borussia Dortmund to the championship of the Bundesliga
in seasons 1994-94 and 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Hitzfeld stresses the human's value, the mutual respect between
people, trust and honesty. "For me the mutual respect and honesty
are paramount," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Airways Seeks Partnership to Operate Direct Flights to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's state airways is actively
 discussing with five major European airlines for a partnership to
jointly operate direct flights to the United States, the News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Nigerian Airways, the government owned
aviation company, was hoping to seal a joint venture arrangement
with any one of a major European operator such as Germany's
Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France, Swiss Air or the Royal
Dutch KLM to operate the lucrative Nigeria- American air route.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's aviation authorities said last week direct flights
from the country to the U.S. would resume in June.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. last December lifted a six-year ban on direct air
links with the west African country after reporting security
improvements at Lagos airport.
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed upon Nigeria by a nominal reason of the
chaotic management of Lagos airport. But some argued that the ban
was then imposed actually as a means to punish the then military
government.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Warns West African Countries Against Cross-Border Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings Sunday urged the western African countries to guard
against the cross- border crimes, saying that the menace of the
crimes should be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings was quoted by Ghana News Agency as saying that the
efforts West African countries are making to integrate their
economies would be undermined seriously if criminals, who operate
across the borders, are not dealt with.
</P>
<P>
''Our moves to integrate our economies should move alongside
efforts at tackling cross-border crimes,'' said the president.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings made the statement at a meeting with an envoy from
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo who delivered a special
message to him in Ghana' s capital city of Accra.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Obasanjo invited Rawlings to attend a
mini-ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) summit to
be held in the Nigerian capital Abuja on March 27 to discuss the
economic integration of West Africa, which Ghana and Nigeria are
spearheading.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings reaffirmed his country's commitment to the economic
integration of West Africa and pledged the government's desire to
work with other countries to realize the ideals of ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
He said Nigeria has a greater role to play in sub-regional
integration, because of its size, abundant resources and its
population, which is the largest in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian envoy Baiye said since Obasanjo came into power
last year, it has been his desire to push the economic integration
of West Africa, eventually creating a ''borderless West Africa for
its people to move freely''.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Cabinet Endorses State Budget for Next Fiscal Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian cabinet on Monday
endorsed the draft state budget for the fiscal year of 2000-2001
beginning on July 1, the country's information minister said.
</P>
<P>
The public expenditure is expected to amount to 111.7 billion
Egyptian pounds (32.38 billion U.S. dollars), compared to 100.3
billion pounds (29.1 billion dollars) in the previous fiscal year,
increasing by 10.2 percent, Safwat Sherif said after a cabinet
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The revenues are estimated at 108.23 billion pounds (31.37
billion dollars), leaving a deficit of 3.68 billion pounds (1.07
billion dollars), Egypt's official Middle East News Agency quoted
Sherif as saying.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget was based on several principles, including
transparency and emphasis on the social dimension, Sherif said,
adding that according to the principles, the budget will allocate
2.5 billion pounds (724.64 million dollars) to the social welfare
pension for the low-income brackets.
</P>
<P>
An additional 1 million pounds (about 300,000 dollars) will be
spent to initiate a program to assist poor university students, and
300 million pounds (86.96 million dollars) will be devoted to the
health sector, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Other principles on which the budget are based are controlling
public debts and expenditure, reforming the government's financial
structures and applying a thorough tax system, Sherif added.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Meets Qatari Emir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad
held official talks with visiting Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin-
Khalifa Al-Thani Monday evening on the bilateral ties and other
Arab issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Hamad arrived here Monday afternoon on a two-day state visit to
Syria, the first since he took the throne in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The visit is aimed at improving Syrian-Qatari ties that have
been marred recently by Qatar's permission for Israel to open a
trade representation office and Qatar's participation in the
multilateral talks that involved Israel.
</P>
<P>
The ties started to improve following Qatari Foreign Minister
Sheikh Hamad Bin-Jassim Bin-Jabir Al-Thani's visit to Damascus last
year, said diplomatic sources here.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks after the Arab League Foreign Ministers meeting
in Beirut on March 11, the Qatari minister said his country would
not establish any kind of relations with Israel unless the Jewish
state withdraws to the border lines of June 4, 1967, under a peace
treaty with Syria.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Wounded by Gunfire in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Two Israelis were seriously
wounded Monday evening in a drive-by shooting near Tarkumiya close
to the West Bank town of Hebron, military sources said.
</P>
<P>
The victims, identified by Israeli security sources as Jewish
settlers, have been taken by ambulance and then by helicopter to
hospital in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The army has put up road blocks and started to search for the
attackers.
</P>
<P>
Four-fifths of Hebron is under Palestinian control, but Israel
has kept control of the remaining 20 percent of the city, where
some 400 Jewish settlers live among the city's 120,000 Arab
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
In an initial response, the army blamed the Palestinian Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) for the attack.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are due to resume in
Washington after a suspension of more than a month.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian militants opposed to peace moves have in the past
mounted attacks just ahead of new negotiating rounds.
</P>
<P>
Last October, gunmen wounded five Israelis in an ambush on a bus
near Tarkumiya, the West Bank terminus of a newly opened "safe
passage" enabling Palestinian travel between self-ruled areas of
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Expects to See New Push for Its EU Accession Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus expects to see a push in
its efforts to join the European Union (EU) during a visit to the
island by Gunter Verheugen, the top EU official responsible for
enlargement affairs, Cyprus government spokesman Michalis
Papapetrou said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Verheugen will come here Thursday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said Cyprus also expects there will be a fresh
attempt to persuade the Turkish Cypriot side to accept President
Glafcos Clerides' proposal to nominate their representatives to the
Cypriot negotiating team for EU accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish forces invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island after a brief Greek Cypriot coup orchestrated by the
military junta then ruling in Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side has been demanding separate talks with
the EU in a bid to gain some kind of recognition of their breakaway
state in northern Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
They have refused to accept Clerides' proposal, which was
submitted in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The EU recognizes the Republic of Cyprus and it will negotiate
with Cyprus only once. Verheugen has made this clear," Papapetrou
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that matters of this kind will be discussed and
clarified once more during Verheugen's visit.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990 and started substantive
accession talks with the EU in November 1998. It hopes to be
admitted as an EU member by January 2003.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou also said the EU engagement in Cyprus' peace effort
has become more specific. He expected "to see practical results of
this engagement in the next few months."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) opened its 25th Regional Conference
for the Near East in Beirut on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf and agriculture ministers of
29 Asian and African countries are participating in the four-day
conference.
</P>
<P>
The biennial conference is set to tackle issues relating to food
security, review FAO's activities in the region and make
recommendation for the organization's general conference to be held
in Rome in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The conference aims to formulate a strategic framework for
sustainable agricultural development in the Near East.
</P>
<P>
It is also to explore ways to improve household nutrition
security and education, review progress made in the multinational
trade negotiations of the World Trade Organization on agriculture
and the need for a regional animal health forum for the Near East.
</P>
<P>
The FAO, founded in 1945 in Quebec, Canada, is the largest
specialized agency in the United Nations system and the leading
agency for agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and rural development.
It has 179 member countries and one member organization -- the
European Union.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police: 190 Killed in Eid Al-Adha Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police announced Monday
that a total of 190 people were killed and 295 injured in 134
traffic accidents across Turkey during Eid Al-Adha, or the Muslim
Feast of the Sacrifice holiday, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures almost doubled those mentioned by the agency
in its Sunday report, which said that 100 people were killed and
200 injured over the nine-day holiday period.
</P>
<P>
Eid Al-Adha, one of the two major Muslim holidays, is marked
with four days off work. When combined with weekends, it is usually
added up to at least a week of time-off. This year's Eid Al-Adha
gave the Turkish population a big nine-day break.
</P>
<P>
Twenty accidents occurred on March 17, the second day of Eid Al-
Adha, alone, killing 30 people and injuring 32.
</P>
<P>
The heavy casualties were largely due to the restriction-free
movement of heavy vehicles, which were involved in 25 accidents in
which 38 people died.
</P>
<P>
The miserable stormy and snowy weather that hit most parts of
the country over the weekend is also partly blamed for the
accidents.

<HEADLINE> Bush Spends 13 Million Dollars in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W. Bush
spent 13 million dollars on his campaign for presidential
nomination in February, the U.S. Federal Election Commission
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than half of Bush's spending last month went for
television commercials in such key states as South Carolina,
California and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
Bush's victory in Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses on March
7 forced rival Arizona Senator John McCain to withdraw from the
Republican presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Bush's spending in February brought his record-setting total to
63.3 million dollars for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
He raised 3.2 million dollars in February, bringing his total
to 73.9 million dollars, another record in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
The Texas governor has been spending at a rate of more than 3
million dollars a week since last fall. About one-third of Bush's
money, 21 million dollars, has been spent on television and radio
advertisements, reports said.
</P>
<P>
He has spent more than 11 million dollars on fund raising, 7
million dollars on travel, and more than 7.5 million dollars on
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. elections in 2000 are expected to be the most
expensive in U.S. history with an estimated spending of 3 billion
dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- France and Morocco welcomed on
Monday the resumption of peace talks between Israel and
Palestinians which are due to start on Tuesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
During their talks at the Elysee presidential palace, French
President Jacques Chirac and visiting Moroccan King Mohammed VI
said that the resumption of the talks are a ``positive element.''
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that the perspective of a resumption of
the talks between Israel and Syrian still remains greatly
uncertain, said presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
``But they also consider it important that, apart from this
single resumption of talks, the hopes for peace which came with
the arrival of the new Israeli government should not be turned
down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state said that the peace talks between Syria
and Israel should also move forward in a concrete way, the
spokeswoman added.
</P>
<P>
Chirac again reaffirmed France's commitment to the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon and said that
France is ready to help Lebanon guarantee these ``on the spot''
once it signs a peace agreement with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Rocket With Dummy Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Monday launched a Soyuz-
U rocket with dummy satellites from the Baikonur cosmodrome in
Kazakhstan, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The take-off took place at 21:28:30 Moscow time (18:28:30 GMT),
Interfax said, citing a source with a company that produced one of
the engines attached to the rocket.
</P>
<P>
The engine, known as Fregat, was first tested on February 9. It
put a 100-kilogram dummy satellite into orbit and later made five
circuits and started to slow down.
</P>
<P>
Then the spacecraft divided and landed on Earth. The dummy
satellite was found but not the engine. A search for the lost
engine will resume in the spring, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's flight, the Fregat had to put into a high
elliptical orbit a heavier 2,270-kilogram payload, a dummy of two
Closter II satellites of the European Space Agency (ESA).
</P>
<P>
The Fregat will now test the automatic program of the switching-
off of cruise engines, and if the test turns out to be successful,
Fregat engines will be used to put in the high orbits four real
satellites of the ESA.
</P>
<P>
The test has major commercial significance as the Fregat can be
used not only with the Soyuz rockets but also Zenit, Proton and
Angara rockets.

RIO DE JANEIRO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- American automobile giant
General Motors (GM) will invest this year 400 million U.S. dollars
in the Southern Common Market (Mercosur), increasing by 15 percent
over 1999.
</P>
<P>
Brazil will obtain nearly 90 percent of General Motors capital
money in the South American bloc, said GM President in this
country Frederick Henderson Monday.
</P>
<P>
From April, San Jose dos Campos plant, in Sao Paulo state,
will begin production of a new car category, Picape Silvarado,
made until 1999 only in GM factory in Cordoba, Argentina, he added.
</P>
<P>
GM has programmed for July the inauguration of a factory in
Gravati, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, with a total investment
of 600 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new plant, that will make a model of a popular car, is to
produce 120,000 units in two years.
</P>
<P>
According to the management, exports of GM in Brazil will
attain this year 650 million dollars, an increase of 24 percent
over last year.
</P>
<P>
Henderson specified the stagnation of negotiations tending to a
common car regime in Mercosur is affecting subsidiary settings,
which must be clear for their operation in this subregional bloc.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur is composed of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay with Bolivia and Chile as associate members.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team Continues Talks with Cambodia on Khmer Rouge Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. team headed by
Legal Counsel Hans Corell continued talks with the Cambodian
delegation on the trial of the former leaders of Khmer Rouge over
the weekend, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said "common ground had been established on a number
of points, but difficulties remained."
</P>
<P>
The team intended to meet with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sun on Wednesday morning and leave for New York later that day,the
spokesman said
</P>
<P>
"However, if talks warrant prolonging the team's stay, the team
will remain in Cambodia," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 7-member team arrived in Cambodia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Corell, the delegation include: Ralph Zacklin,
assistant-Secretary-General and the deputy of the team; Lakhan
Mehrotra, head of the Jakarta office of the U.N. Transitional
Administration in East Timor; Shashi Tharoor, a director in Annan'
s office; John Renninger, who heads the Asia and pacific division
of the U.N. Department of Political Affairs; Daphna Shraga, a
senior officer in the U.N.office of Legal Affairs; and Mark
Quarterman, an officer in the Department of Political Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and Cambodia have been at odds over who would
be in control of a tribunal to try former Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
U.N. legal experts are concerned that Cambodia's legal system
is too weak to guarantee justice on its own.
</P>
<P>
This will be the final round of negotiations and an agreement
with the Cambodia's Government is expected to be reached to ensure
a credible trial that meets minimum international standard.

<HEADLINE> China Opens Its First Trade Promotion Center in East Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The first Chinese trade
promotion center in East Africa region opened here on Monday to
strengthen economic cooperation with Tanzania and other east
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inauguration ceremony of the Chinese Center for
the Promotion of Investment, Development and Trade in Tanzania,
the charge d' affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Dar es Salaam Liu
Youfa said the opening of the center is a symbol of the cordial
and cooperative relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, a memorandum of understanding to establish
such a center was reached in May 1997 when the then Chinese
Premier Li Peng visited Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The center, which is a non-profit-making organization based in
Dar es Salaam, will promote business between China and Tanzania,
introduce Tanzania investment incentives and opportunities to
Chinese entrepreneurs and encourage Chinese enterprises to take
part in local economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is China's largest aid-recipient country in Africa.
Since 1964, China has assisted in building such projects like the
Tanzania-Zambia railway line, the Friendship Textile Mill, the
Mubarali Rice Farm, the Kiwira Coal Mine and the Mahonda Sugar
Cane Factory.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are eight Sino-Tanzanian joint ventures in
Tanzania. According to the figures from the Chinese embassy, by
the end of 1999, China had invested over 57 million U.S. dollars
in 14 projects in Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Steps Up Measures Against Rampant Cult Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Three days after the world's
second biggest cult killing which brought Uganda into the focus of
world attention,
</P>
<P>
the Ugandan government has come up with a series of effective
measures to contain and eventually uproot increasingly rampant
cult activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, over 330 members of a doomsday cult named Movement
for the Restoration of Ten Commandments of God, including 78
children, set themselves ablaze in a simple church in Uganda's
southwestern district of Rukungiri. This incident shocked all
Ugandans and hit both local and international newspaper headlines.
</P>
<P>
The cult believers, mostly women and children, sold their
properties and paid their graduated taxes before hand. They
reportedly sang and danced for hours before dousing themselves in
petrol and paraffin and nailing all the possible exits and
sparking off the fire. The cult was registered as a non-
governmental organization in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan police sealed off the area soon after the incident
occurred and a team of experts including forensic doctors are
still investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni condemned the
practice in the strongest terms possible, describing it as a
"horrific, senseless and tragic act."
</P>
<P>
He criticized leaders of some religious cults which are
increasingly luring unsuspecting people, taking advantage of their
properties and misleading them into beliefs that endanger their
lives.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government would do all it could to protect
the lives of its people and to ensure that Ugandans are not at the
mercy of some dangerous and opportunistic individuals who parade
themselves as religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Minister of Internal Affairs Edward Rugumayo and
Inspector- General of Police John Kisembo flew to the scene to
assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the meeting room of the Ministry of
Internal Affairs Monday evening, Rugumayo said that his ministry
would scrutinize the details of institutions applying to be
registered as non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, security organs in the country would try to
arrest, if any, surviving leaders of the cult and interview other
members of the same cult to prevent recurrence of such tragedies.
</P>
<P>
John Kisembo said that the police would treat the case as
involving both murder and suicide. The children were obviously
brought to the church by their parents who were the cult
believers. "This is murder," he said. No parents should have the
right of life or death over their children.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has recently discovered and destroyed two cults, both of
them close to the capital city Kampala. In September 1999, police
destroyed a similar doomsday cult named World Message Last Warning
in Luweero District, rescuing most of the believers.
</P>
<P>
Central Region Police Commander Chris Bakesiima told Xinhua
Monday that the operation had protected a total of 1,000
believers, 900 being women and children.
</P>
<P>
"Without timely intervention by the police, a tragedy similar
to this Rukungiri event could have happened," he said. "We went
there in time and dispersed a large cult gathering."
</P>
<P>
Self-styled prophet Wilson Bushara, who was the leader of the
Luweero cult, was later accused of rape, defilement, abductions
and unlawful confinement.
</P>
<P>
Not long after that, a similar cult surfaced in Ntuusi,
Ssembabule District. A combined operation by police and army
destroyed the cult and self-styled prophetess Gwajwa Nabaasa was
arrested.
</P>
<P>
The cult in Rukungiri acted most secretively. They did not
cause any suspicion among local residents although they had been
living in the church for a relatively long period. Cult leaders
told their followers that the year 2000 is the end of the world
and that they should sell or destroy their earthly belongings
before going to heaven on Friday.
</P>
<P>
As Rugumayo said at the press conference, the Rukungiri event
sounded a timely warning to both the government and ordinary
people. President Museveni would hold cabinet meetings to address
the issue so that less and less room would be left for cult
activities in this east African country.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Prosecute Sanction Busters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa could indict
five citizens for violating the United Nations sanctions against
the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) if there is enough evidence, Foreign Minister Nkosazana
Dlamini-Zuma said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are now looking to investigate whether we have concrete
information that will be admissible in court," she was quoted by
South African Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If there is enough evidence to charge them, we will charge
them," she pledged.
</P>
<P>
The five South Africans were among those identified by the U.N.
 sanctions committee on Angola last week as violators of the
U.N.'s fuel, arms, travel and diamond trade embargo against UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini-Zuma also promised that South Africa will continue to
beef up measures to prevent UNITA-controlled diamonds from flowing
into South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Cocaine Production Reaches 464 Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A total of 464 tons of cocaine
Colombia produces a year can generate 3.574 billion dollars, said
the National Association of Financial Institutions (ANIF) Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to this institution, such amount is equal to what the
country gets through petroleum exports, and goes three times over
the value of coffee sales abroad, and 41 percent over the total of
agricultural exports.
</P>
<P>
According to data of the United States' State Department, the
ANIF made sure Colombia's exports of cocaine multiplied by eight
in the last ten years.
</P>
<P>
This association added that Colombia's exports of illicit
products represent 85 percent of the world offer of cocaine and 35.
7 percent of marihuana that Americans still import.
</P>
<P>
Illegal cultivation nowadays occupies 135,000 hectares, while
at the beginning of the nineties the area was 41,600 hectares
which, according to this institution, is equivalent to an increase
of over three times.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed With Nasdaq Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Monday with the technology heavy Nasdaq composite falling as
investors moved money out of the biotech and Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
At the close of the session, the Nasdaq index fell 188.13 at 4,
610.00. The composite rose 80.74 points in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 85.01 at 10,680.24 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 7.84 at 1,456.63.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite fell as investors drew money out of the
biotech and Internet companies. The Amex Biotechnology, Biogen and
Amgen all plunged while Amazon.com and eToys fell as well.
</P>
<P>
Investors were still nervous about biotech stocks after the
United States and Britain agreed last week to make some genetic
research data openly available, rather than bought and sold by
biotech companies. A report on cash troubles for dozens of
prominent Internet companies also worried investors.
</P>
<P>
While the Nasdaq index was falling, the investors poured money
into the Dow's components, including old technology companies such
as Hewlett-Packard, Intel and the International Business Machine.
The divergence led the Dow index higher.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 1.84 at 631.14 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 4.73 at 1,006.27. The Russell 2000 index of

GAZA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli sides signed
in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Monday the maps for the
Israeli withdrawal from 6.1 percent more of the West Bank, which
made the pullout process into effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
The maps were signed by Ismail Jaber, head of the Palestinian
police in the West Bank, and Major General Moshe Yaalon, head of
the Central Command of the Israel Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal that should have been taken place on January 20
under a September interim deal signed in Egypt is expected to start
on Tuesday or in the coming few days.
</P>
<P>
The maps have been approved by the Israeli cabinet and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
In the expected withdrawal, 5.1 percent of the West Bank will be
turned to full Palestinian control from the current joint rule and
1 percent will be handed over to full Palestinian control from the
current total Israeli jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal will bring 40 percent of the West Bank land under
full or partial Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
According to the maps, the targeted areas are mostly near the
southern West Bank towns of Hebron and Bethlehem. No areas close to
Jerusalem were included in the coming stage.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Says Iraqi Cooperation Helps Achieve Lifting of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
stressed Monday that Iraqi cooperation with the United Nations
Security Council on arms inspections would help achieve the
lifting of the sanctions against the country.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the Security Council, in its
latest resolution on Iraq, modified the sanctions regime by
lifting the ceiling on oil production and took steps to speed up
the delivery of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question by a reporter that former U.N.
Humanitarian Coordinator Denis Halliday's recent comments on what
he said was U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's silence on Iraq,
Eckhard said, "Frankly, I don't see how he could say that the
secretary-general has been silent on the sanctions issue."
</P>
<P>
He noted the U.N. chief had discussed the impact of sanctions
on innocent members of the civilian population even before he
appointed Halliday as humanitarian coordinator in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Von Sponeck, the current U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq,
has tendered his resignation to protest the failure of the U.N.
efforts to ease the humanitarian crisis in Iraq caused by the
stringent U.N. sanctions which have been in place since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck told the United Nation late last month that the oil-for-
food program, which began to be implemented in late 1996, had
failed to meet even the minimum necessities of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to resume U.N. arms inspections in Iraq, the
Security Council last December established the United Nations
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) for
Iraq last December to replace the now defunct United Nations
Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Annan has named the executive chairman and commissioners of the
UNMOVIC and the arms inspectors are expected to be announced next
month.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has refused to accept the U.N. move so far. It reiterated
that lifting sanctions was the precondition for the U.N. arms
inspectors to return.

<HEADLINE> Murder Suspect Fires More Shots at Hostage Scene in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A round gunfire erupted Monday afternoon from the house where
the suspect,Joseph Palczynski, allegedly was holding the hostages
in Baltimore County of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted police as saying that they had been
negotiating with Palczynski throughout Sunday night but had not
heard from him since Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, police using armored cars began escorting people out
of the blue-collar neighborhood after shots were fired from the
home.
</P>
<P>
Palczynski had been on the run since March 7, when he kidnapped
his girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead, and killed the couple she was
staying with and a neighbor. A fourth person was killed and a boy
was wounded when Palczynski allegedly carjacked a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Whitehead escaped unharmed and Palczynski later fled to
Virginia, where he stole guns and forced a man to drive him back
to Baltimore County.
</P>
<P>
Palczynski fired five bursts of gunfire Sunday morning, which
were the first signs of activity since he took Whitehead's mother
and two others hostage Friday night.
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported and police did not return his fire.
</P>
<P>
Palczynski stopped talking with negotiators for about an hour
and a half Sunday morning, and police moved in with an armored
vehicle and a bullhorn to urge him to resume communications.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old unemployed electrician also has a history of
convictions for assault and battery. Days before the killings, he
was charged with assaulting Whitehead but was released on 7,500 U.
S. dollars bail.

<HEADLINE> Annan proposes to withdraw U.N. Mission in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Monday that the U.N. Mission of Observer in
Tajikistan (UNMOT) has fulfilled tasks well and will be withdrawn
when its mandate expires on May 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, Annan noted that
the Tajik parties managed to overcome their differences, and held
the country's first multi-party parliament last month.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations has played an important part in this
success", the Secretary-General said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that he and the Tajik Government are
currently in consultations about a possible future U.N. role, in
which a small office can work on post-conflict peace-building
activities.
</P>
<P>
UNMOT was established in 1994 to monitor the ceasefire
agreement between the Government of Tajikistan and the United
Tajik Opposition. Following the signing by the parties of the 1997
general peace agreement, UNMOT 's mandate was expanded to help
monitor its implementation.

<HEADLINE> Missing Panama Plane in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Panama's aviation
authorities said Monday the twin-engined plane which disappeared
last Friday had been kidnapped and taken to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Panama's government requested Colombian authorities to find the
site of the occupants, said Executive Secretary of the Council of
Security and National Defense Pablo Quintero.
</P>
<P>
Panama's government wishes for contact with the kidnappers in
order to know whereabouts of the plane's passengers and demands
their freedom, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Quintero, Panamanian authorities are dealing with
reports that this light aircraft entered Colombia through a place
named Valle de Payita and landed at El Llano in Colombian
territory.
</P>
<P>
This is an extremely mountainous place, therefore radar failed
to get the plane's signals, explained this official.
</P>
<P>
The 20-seat Aeroperlas plane left Panama City's Albrook airport
Friday on a domestic flight to the Caribbean town of Puerto
Obaldia, close to the Colombian border, with eight passengers on
board, including two Colombian nationals and four children.

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Community Condemns Guatemala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico City, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Caribbean Community and
Market (CARICOM) Monday condemned Guatemala for the presumed
action of Guatemalan forces on Belizean land on February 24.
</P>
<P>
The condemnation was contained in a CARICOM communique which
Belize's government sent out via the Internet and the Guatemalan
daily "21st Century" carried Monday, according to reports reaching
here from Guatemala's capital.
</P>
<P>
The Congress of CARICOM heads of state reproved the actions of
the Armed Forces of Guatemala, which invaded Belize and kidnapped
four members of a Belizean patrol, said the document.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala's army said the three soldiers and a policeman of
Belize were detained because they moved inside Guatemalan
territory.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala and Belize are involved in a land dispute
characterized by intermittent disorders and diplomatic friction.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala is demanding Belize's return 12,000 square kilometers
-- almost half of its territory -- and a solution to this
controversy at an international tribunal, which is rejected by
Belize's government.
</P>
<P>
This and dispute between the two neighboring countries began
by a delimitation accord signed in 1859 between Guatemalan
authorities and the United Kingdom.
