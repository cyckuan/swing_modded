DAMASCUS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa Saturday held talks with visiting former U.S. Secretary
of State James Addison Baker III on the developments of the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Baker told reporters after the meeting that his talks with
al-Sharaa focused on peace prospects between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the door is still open for peace in the
region which requires the participation of all parties to reach
consensus.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian diplomatic source said Baker is in Damascus to discuss
with Syrian officials ways of resuming peace negotiations on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Baker is also here to review the relevant parties' opinions
before the planned visit to Washington by Israeli Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak after forming the new cabinet, said the
source.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration is currently working through diplomatic
channels to formulate an initiative to revitalize peace talks
after concluding an agreement on the Jewish settlement principles,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
Syria expressed anew its willingness to continue the talks with
Israel which have been stalled since 1996 on the bases that
Barak's government should recognize Syria's sovereignty over the
Golan Heights and withdraw its troops from South Lebanon and the
Golan on equal and balanced security terms.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Deal Likely by Late 1999: Nyerere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The mediator of the Burundi
peace talks, former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, has said
various conflicting parties in the war-torn country may reach a
peace agreement this year.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that the agreement is likely to be reached
before the end of this year, probably in September or October this
year," a statement quoted Nyerere as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord is aimed at bringing to the end the ethnic
strife which has already claimed more than 150,000 lives in the
tiny central African nation since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere told envoys of donor countries and organizations at his
 residence in Dar es Salaam Friday that he is encouraged by
efforts made by the 18 Burundian political parties in their peace
talks in north Tanzania's town Arusha, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued here by Nyerere's spokesman Brigadier
General Hashim Mbita, said the parties have formed into three
major groups in a move to facilitate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the three major groups have shown great
 cooperation on different issues under consideration.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere also informed the envoys about his meeting with
Burundian President Pierre Buyoya in Pretoria, South Africa, last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said another meeting between him and Speaker of the
Burundian National Assembly Leonce Ngendakumana is expected to
take place in Dar es Salaam in the last week of this month.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere will have a one-day meeting with the leadership of the
FRODEBU, Burundi's main opposition party, it revealed.

TEHRAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Interior Minister Mousavi
Lari announced on Saturday that the three Italians abducted last
Sunday would be freed soon.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of the abduction of three Italian citizens has been
resolved and that they are expected to be freed in one or two
days time," he told reporters in Kerman, central Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the issue has been resolved with the help and
cooperation of security councils in the provinces of Kerman and
Sistan-Baluchertan, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister gave no details about the issue or any
possible deal with the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
The three Italians, Giuseppe Zizza, Ricardo Pasinato and
Lorenzo Termite from an Italian company were abducted by unknown
persons when they were on a trip to see historical sites in Bam,
180 kilometers south of Kerman city.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the kidnapping, relevant Iranian security and police
personnel launched extensive operations to hunt down the
perpetrators and ensure the release of the Italian nationals,
an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Tuesday.

RIYADH, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Saturday evening
held talks with visiting Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa
al-Thani on bilateral ties and issues of mutual concern, the Saudi
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting was Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed
al-Nahyan, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) who accompanyed Sheikh Hamad on the tour.
</P>
<P>
Details of the talks were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad arrived here Saturday evening after winding up his
visit to the UAE to continue his mediation efforts to defuse a row
between the UAE and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said the UAE accused Saudi Arabia of warming up
relations with Iran, with whom the UAE has a dispute over the Gulf
islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia dismissed the accusation, saying that
rapprochement with Iran was good for the stability of the whole
region.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has repeatedly called for dialog with Iran or
resorting to international arbitration over the islands, which
have been occupied by Iran since Britain retreated from the Gulf
in 1971.
</P>
<P>
But Iran says the islands are part of its territory and there
is no ambiguity about their legal status.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
said Saturday the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks was vital to achieve a just, durable and comprehensive
peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during his meeting with visiting European
Middle East envoy Miguel Moratinos on ways of revitalizing the
Mideast peace process, Jordan`s official news agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos expressed appreciation for Jordan`s role under the
leadership of King Abdullah to realize a just and comprehensive
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also paid tribute to the European role in backing
efforts to bring the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
The king affirmed the importance of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks, without which, he said, a just and comprehensive
peace would not be realized in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel`s peace talks with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon
remained virtually deadlocked since 1996, and Jordan has called
on the Jewish state to resume its peace talks on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, one of the key allies of the Palestinians, has used all
possible occasions to express its support for the rights of the
Palestinians, including the right to establish an independent
state in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos Saturday also met with Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul Raouf Rawabdeh to discuss the Middle East peace process,
Petra said.

<P>
CAIRO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian man who set up a
journalists' union without government permission was sentenced on
Saturday to three and a half years' imprisonment with hard labor.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that Hussein al-Mataani must also pay 501
Egyptian pounds (150 U.S. dollars) in damages to Makram Mohamed
Ahmed, head of the government-recognized Journalists Syndicate,
the country's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mataani was convicted of fraud, impersonating a journalist
and establishing a union without state authorization, the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mataani said he would appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Journalists Syndicate had filed complaints
against al-Mataani, accusing him of being a swindler trying to
split journalists' ranks. Local newspapers dubbed him the "phony
union president."
</P>
<P>
Al-Mataani has been charged in a separate case with publishing
without a license eight issues of a weekly newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Agrees to Open Embassy in Slovenia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has agreed to open an embassy
in Slovenian capital Ljubljana, Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed
Gowaili said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at Slovenia's request, Gowaili said after
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri met with his Slovenian
counterpart Janez Drnovsek. Gowaili participated in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Opening an embassy in Ljubljana is to facilitate trade exchange
between the two countries and issuing of certificates of origin,
which are completed in the Egyptian embassy in Vienna, Austria,
Gowaili said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides called for participation of the private sector in
joint investment projects for manufacturing buses and ready-made
clothes, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Drnovsek's visit and the meetings held by 15 Slovenian
businessmen accompanying him with their Egyptian counterparts
mirror Slovenia's desire to boost bilateral relations in various
fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili disclosed that a number of cooperation agreements will
be signed on Sunday at the end of the Slovenian prime minister's
Egyptian trip.
</P>
<P>
Terming his talks with El-Ganzouri as "fruitful and
constructive," Drnovsek said the talks dwelt on ways of increasing
trade volume between the two countries and encouraging the
Slovenian and Egyptian private sector to set up joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia will contribute to a number of Egyptian enterprises
for environmental protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also explored Slovenian businessmen's possible
contribution to Egypt's national projects including Toshka by
providing agricultural equipment.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is carrying out an ambitious project in the south to
create a new valley by reclaiming land from desert by channeling
Nile water to the western Desert, aimed at luring people to leave
the overcrowded Nile valley.
</P>
<P>
Drnovsek arrived here on Friday for a three-day visit to seek
opportunities for economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed two agreements last year respectively
on protecting reciprocal investments and enhancing cooperation in
the fields of industry, science and technology. They are
considering setting up a joint ministerial committee aimed at
seeking ways of boosting cooperation.

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Renew Pledges to OAU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 19 (Xinhua) --United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata urged African
governments and the public to renew their pledges to the
30-year-old Organization of African Unity (OAU) Refugee
Convention.
</P>
<P>
In her statement to mark African Refugee Day on June 20
tomorrow, Ogata said the OAU Refugee Convention "was an important
document for the new and emerging African nations, and it
demonstrated unparalleled generosity toward refugees."
</P>
<P>
"For 30 years, the OAU Refugee Convention has served as a model
of international refugee law" and "it has been a corner-stone of
UNHCR's efforts in Africa since it came into effect on this date
in 1974," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Through war and natural disasters, African nations have
struggled to welcome and help huge numbers of refugees," she
added.
</P>
<P>
However, Ogata mentioned the "enormous burden on countries
which border long-running conflicts, and the strain caused by
waves of destitute people."
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 34 OAU member states signed the convention
in Addis Ababa in 1969 which has features of an extended refugee
definition, principle of voluntary repatriation, and the concept
of burden sharing, whereby a nation experiencing difficulties in
offering asylum to refugees can appeal to other member states for
help.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR has now 110 offices in 42 African countries and over
2,000 UNHCR staff are working in Africa, said the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
There were 6.5 million people of concern to UNHCR in Africa as
of January 1999, out of an estimated 21.1 million worldwide.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, Germany, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Group of
Seven industrial countries are trying to improve ties with Russia
on Saturday at the second-day session of their annual summit here
in Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Among a series talks between Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin and the western leaders, Russia's debt issues are on top
of their agenda.
</P>
<P>
Russia currently has some 150 billion dollars of foreign debt.
In this year alone Russia is supposed to pay back 17.5 billion
dollars, of which 4.6 billion is owed to the International
Monetary Fund (IFM).
</P>
<P>
"The debts must be paid and we will do it," Stepashin told
reporters earlier. Stepashin is representing Russia until the
arrival of President Boris Yeltsin on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The seven leaders, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, French
President Jacques Chirac, British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, US President Bill Clinton,
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi, is due to meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Sunday, the final day of the three-day summit.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which is hosting the annual Group of Eight (G-8)
summit, has cautioned that Moscow should not expect any major debt
relief package to emerge from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said Russian debt also dominated talks Saturday
between Schroeder and Stepashin at the meeting of G-8, which is
G-7 countries plus Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
made a surprise visit Saturday to the King Hussein bridge between
Jordan and the West Bank in a goodwill gesture to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king instructed Jordanian troops manning the
bridge, named after his father late King Hussein, to improve
services for both Jordanian and Palestinian passengers crossing
the bridge.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want this crossing to form a barrier that
separates brothers and families but rather the point that bring
people together," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah was apparently using his visit to the bridge to show
solidarity between Jordan and the Palestinians, and to prop up
his own image among the predominantly Palestinian population of
the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of the 4.6 million Jordanian population are of
Palestinian origin.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has said on many occasions that his country supports
all rights of Palestinians, including their right of establishing
an independent state on the West Bank and Gaza strip.
</P>
<P>
However, the Jordanian authorities have rejected suggestions
made by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to form a confederation
between Jordan and the Palestinians.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Georgia on Saturday requested the
transfer to its ownership of 44 Russian army facilities on its
territory, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The request was contained in a letter from Georgian Defense
Minister David Tevzadze to his Russian counterpart, Igor Sergeyev,
Tass reported in a dispatch from Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.
</P>
<P>
Georgian Deputy Defense Minister Grigol Katamadze expressed the
hope that Russia will take the request with understanding.
</P>
<P>
He said the facilities are of no strategic importance now for
Russian troops in the Transcaucasia and have not been used for a
long time, but that they are important for the Georgian Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, Katamadze told a press conference that four
Russian MiG-29 fighters violated Georgia's air space on Friday,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Katamadze said the MiGs were flying over for nearly 40 minutes,
totally ignoring the Georgian air-controllers commands.
</P>
<P>
He said it was not the first time that Russian war planes
violated Georgia's air space in disregard of not only
international norms but Georgia's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Katamadze said that the Georgian Foreign Ministry will lodge a
note of protest with its Russian counterpart over the incident.

<HEADLINE> 17 Million People Sign for Debt Clearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, Germany, June 19 (Xinhua) -- About 17 million people
all over the world, by signing their names, are calling on the
Group of Seven richest countries to write off debt of billions of
dollars in poor nations.
</P>
<P>
They are represented by some 70,000 people, including
development activists, religious leaders and other celebrities,
who formed a human chain on Saturday around the center of Cologne
to demand clearance of all poor countries' debt.
</P>
<P>
In the German city here, Honduran Archbishop Oscar Andres
Rodrigues handed German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder a huge white
bag with the 17 million signatures.
</P>
<P>
The archbishop told Schroeder that Germany is best placed to
understand that debt relief is a fundamental element in the
economic development of a society.
</P>
<P>
"These 17 million signatures are an expression of the hope that
our countries can also be free of this (debt) burden," he added.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration in Cologne was organized by Jubilee 2000, a
coalition of non-governmental organizations from industrial and
developing countries demanding for a total debt relief in the
third world.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Asian powerhouse China had to
dig deep into their repertoire of skills to edge Hong Kong Segal
80-77, winning the title of the four-team Hong Kong leg with three
straight wins at the Asia Basketball Superleague (ABSL) here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the victory, China's head coach Jiang Xingquan appeared
unsatisfied with his team's performance, saying, "They are lacking
fighting spirit in the court."
</P>
<P>
He added that his team must strengthen in the aspects of
defense, rebounds and movement.
</P>
<P>
The Segal got a good start to lead 5-0, 11-5 in the first
quarter with sound defense and accurate shots. But they could not
keep the rhythm and they conceded the lead 18-17 in the final
seconds.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, the Chinese, who were crowned in the
Bangkok Asian Games, began to find their form by finishing the
first half at 43-35.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, the Segal, with great efforts from American
Wayman Strikland and Song Xi from South China's Guangdong Province,
caught up with the Chinese team at 77-75 with 17 seconds left in
the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
But it was too late as China's Sun Jun, who scored 20 points
for his team, sealed the match with two penalty shots.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, China was titled with three wins in the
second leg of the tournament after they triumphed in the first leg
held in Guangdong, China.
</P>
<P>
Japan beat South Korea 76-68 in another match on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Segal ranked second again with two wins and one loss,
followed by Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The third leg of the tournament is scheduled to be held next
week in Tokyo.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania President Benjamin
Mkapa Saturday appealed to the World Bank to assist Tanzania to
attain debt relief within a shorter time frame under the Highly
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made the remarks at the State House when meeting with
visiting World Bank Managing Director and Corporation Secretary
Zhang Shengman.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa asked the World Bank to consider Tanzania's request
following its successful implementation of a three-year economic
reform program put forward by the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
"It would be very difficult for us, not only for political
support but also in terms of economics to continue tightening our
belts for three more years in order to qualify for debt relief
under the HIPC initiative," Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
He complained about the current adverse effect on social
services due to debt servicing, saying Tanzania continues to
experience famine although it has a large territory.
</P>
<P>
"There is plenty of room for large-scale farming and concerted
efforts are being made to encourage foreign investors to invest in
this sector," Mkapa concluded.
</P>
<P>
Zhang commended Tanzania for its impressive performance with
regard to economic reform program, promising to cooperate with
Tanzania in marketing its agricultural potential.
</P>
<P>
He also hailed Tanzania's political stability and described it
as an essential incentive for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Zhang arrived here Thursday on a four-day official visit during
which he will tour various projects funded by the Bank, including
the Tanzania Breweries Limited, and the Kihansi Hydroelectric
Project.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by the World Bank Representative to Tanzania and
Uganda, James Adams, Zhang will also meet Tanzania's Prime
Minister, the Minister for Finance and other senior officials
before leaving for Kenya Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has actively supported Tanzania's economic
development efforts by financing more than 130 projects since the
1960s.

KHARTOUM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi
called on the Arab and African world to be cautious against NATO's

</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, who is here on a three-day official visit, issued the
warning Saturday at a mass meeting held in southern Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
The terrorism policies adopted by the U.S. would not diminish
the will of peoples, said Gaddafi, citing the Sudanese people's
defiance against what he called the U.S. and Israeli schemes.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the Sudanese government and its opposition to
meet at a national conference in a bid to resolve their
differences and to drop violence which he said would only benefit
the imperialist powers' scheme to disintegrate the unity of the
Sudanese territories.
</P>
<P>
Africa as a whole does not accept any change in Sudan's
inherited geographical map, said Gaddafi.

<HEADLINE> Italy Says No Russian Troops in Italian Sector of Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops won't be patrolling in
the western sector of Kosovo, which is under Italian control,
Italian Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio confirmed on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists in the Sicilian town of Taormina,
Scognamiglio said that the agreement reached between NATO and
Russia Friday evening on the role of Russian forces in the
war-devastated province did not "provide for the presence of a
Russian contingent in the Italian sector."
</P>
<P>
But the minister did not exclude the possibility at a later
date that "for rotation purposes or some other such need, Russians
might be allowed to operate in the Italian sector."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Russia came to an agreement last night whereby
Russian troops would be allowed to operate in the U.S., German and
French sectors and keep their access to the airport of Pristina,
the Kosovo capital.
</P>
<P>
Russian forces will be under the control of Moscow but will be
expected to coordinate their operations with the commanders of
each sector.
</P>
<P>
Scognamiglio repeated NATO's insistence that the Russians could
not have a sector of their own because "this could lead to the
partition of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
He also said that Italy is to increase the number of Italian
troops deployed in Kosovo to 6,000, because the original target of
5,000 troops wasn't enough to control the area properly.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, 2,500 Italian troops are serving in the western
sector of Kosovo, which borders on Montenegro and Albania.
</P>
<P>
A further 2,000 will arrive by the end of June, followed by
another contingent of 1,500 men by mid-July.

<P>
COLOGNE, Germany, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Eight (G-8)
will at its summit in Cologne call on an international food
security agency to be set up, French diplomats said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was raised by French President Jacques Chirac, and
has won the support of European Union members and the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
In the final communique to be passed on Sunday, G-8 leaders are
expected to urge the creation of a working group to study Chirac's
initiative.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, European countries were hit by a wave of food
scares, including the dioxin scandal in Belgium and the
contaminated coca-cola in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg and
France.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told his partners at the G-8 summit that European
consumers were increasingly worried at the quality of their food,
according to the French diplomats close to the summit.
</P>
<P>
The French President also said the World Trade Organization
(WTO) must pay more attention to food safety issues.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly demanded food products not be sold when there is
doubts about their safety.

COLOGNE, Germany, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister
Sergei Stepashin and U.S. President Bill Clinton Agreed here
Saturday that it was time to move relations of the two countries
beyond the Kosovo crisis and get back to bilateral issues
important for both sides.
</P>
<P>
"The larger thrust is to move forward," U.S. National Security
Advisor Sandy Berger said at a press conference during the Group
of Eight (G-8) summit in Cologne, the fourth largest German city.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin told Clinton both countries needed to get back to
business and Clinton firmly agreed, Berger said. "They talked
about the importance of moving beyond Kosovo in our relationship,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Berger admitted that there were still differences
between Russia and the West on how to treat Yugoslavia within the
planned Balkan reconstruction program.
</P>
<P>
Russia would not back a G-8 summit declaration which barred
Yugoslavia from taking part in Balkan reconstruction, he said,
adding the U.S. would not take part in any rebuilding of
Yugoslavia as long as President Slobodan Milosevic is in charge.
</P>
<P>
Berger also said that Washington would make a distinction
between rebuilding and humanitarian aid. The U.S. would, if
necessary, take part in food and medicine programs for the people
of Yugoslavia through organizations like the International Red
Cross, the senior U.S. official said.

<HEADLINE> French Interior Minister Visits Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement began on Saturday a four-day official visit to
Algeria, the first by a French government minister in almost one
year.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that Chevenement is expected to discuss
with Algerian Interior Minister Abdelmalek Sellal the easing of
control by France on visa issuing to Algerians, security issues of
bilateral concern, and a possible resumption of flights by Air
France to Algiers as has been demanded by the Algerian government.
</P>
<P>
Air France suspended indefinitely its flights to Algiers after
the Algerian terrorist group, Armed Islamic Group (GIA), took
hostage the passengers of an Airbus of the company at the Algiers
airport in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The hostage-taking ended by a bloody storming of the airplane
by French commando troops.
</P>
<P>
As the bilateral relations are improving and the security
situation in Algeria is improving, France is considering reopening
its consulate in the Algerian cities of Oran and Annaba, closed in
the mid-1990s when French nationals were easy targets of attacks
by GIA.
</P>
<P>
Chevenement, who has good personal relations with Algerian
leaders, is also the first French government minister to visit
Algiers since Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika was elected
on April 15.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine went to Algeria in July
1997 to attend a regional conference of Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
Chevenement is due to attend a conference of interior ministers
of western Mediterranean countries on June 21-22.

coxless fours and two second places. But that was enough to keep
it in the overall World Cup lead after a win in the opening
regatta of the series in Belgium three weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> G-8 Leaders Concern Over Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of world's seven leading
industrial nations and Russia (G-8) Sunday expressed their concern
over a possible outbreak of the "millennium bug" in chip-
controlled machines and devices when the year changes from 1999 to
2000.
</P>
<P>
The communique issued at the end of G-8 summit in Cologne said
"we will maintain vigorous programs of action to ensure our own
Year 2000 readiness and to minimize the potential impact on our
countries and on the world as a whole."
</P>
<P>
In these efforts, top priority should be given to key
infrastructure sectors including energy, telecommunications,
transport, financial and health services, as well as to systems of
defense, environment and public security, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
It is important to prepare emergency plans for possible system
crashes when the year changes, and the G-8 leaders have promised
to hold a special conference focused on contingency planning later
this year.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain were filed in the Communique as
countries that had achieved "great progress" in making preparation
for the millennium bug, a software blunder that might cause
crashes of computer systems and chip-controlled devices at the
1999-2000 year change.

<HEADLINE> Japan, Russia to Sign Peace Treaty Until 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 20 (Xinhua)--Tokyo will sign a peace treaty with
Russia until year 2000, said Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
on Sunday after his talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
following the Group of Eight (G-8) summit.
</P>
<P>
There is a relationship of "personal trust" between him and
Yeltsin, said Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also said it was his "historic task" to solve the
disputes with Japan over the four northern islands, and to sign a
peace treaty as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the end of World War II, then Soviet Union
occupied the four islands, including Etorofu, Shikotan, Habomai
and Kunashiri.
</P>
<P>
Japan has long demanded the returning of the four islands.
</P>
<P>
Japan will better support Russia to destroy its old nuclear
weapons, including the treatment of radio-active wastes said
Obuchi. The country has paid 70 million U.S. dollars to Russia
for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said the G-8 summit was an "achievement" and expressed
his respect to German host of the summit, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, who holds this year's G-8 chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Japan stressed its readiness to fund the Kosovo stability
process as an active role in G-8. Tokyo has promised to contribute
200 million dollars financial aid to the reconstruction of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also demanded a fair burden for Japan under the debt
relief package for world's 36 poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
As the greatest creditor among the G-8, Japan was willing to
provide the poor countries with more helps.
</P>
<P>
"We will effectively employ our economic strength to help those
countries" said Obuchi.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Listed Companies Doing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 20 (Xinhua)-- Sitting in any restaurant in this
capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, one can always hear people
asking for Lhasa Beer.
</P>
<P>
But few people know that the stock-holding system is
responsible for turning a small brewery into a medium-sized one
with an annual capacity of 50,000 tons within a mere two years.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Lhasa Beer even sells well in other parts of the
country, but at an unbelievably high price: At 50 yuan per bottle
it is 20 times more expensive than other Chinese brands.
</P>
<P>
Like the beer producer, all five listed companies in the Tibet
Autonomous Region are operating well and generating quite big
profits, according to local officials from the regional securities
supervisory committee.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the regional government has made special
efforts to help money-losing state-owned enterprises in various
ways, including listing on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the five firms had floated shares and
raised a total of 647 million yuan for investment projects.
</P>
<P>
The state is the main stake-holder in all the five listed
Tibetan companies. Meanwhile, the regional supervisory board has
tightened its control in order to protect the interests of
investors, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
So far, there have been no reports of falsified records in
their annual reports, and the authorities have not uncovered any
malpractices or other illegal activities conducted by these firms.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the five listed firms handed over 30 million yuan in
profits to the State Administration of Taxation, up 30 percent
over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Background: Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, Residence of Panchen Lamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIGAZE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Erdeni Losang Qamba Lhunzhub
Qoigyijabu, the 11th Panchen Lama, returned today to the Zhaxi
Lhunbo Lamasery here, after winding up religious activities in
Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, covering a floor space of 300,000 sq
m, has been the residence of all previous Panchen Lamas.
</P>
<P>
Built in 1447, the lamasery is one of the six major monasteries
of Tibetan Buddhism and a major place for Tibetan Buddhist
believers to perform their religious activities.
</P>
<P>
The lamasery houses the world's largest bronze image of Buddha,
which is 26.7 meters tall. The hands of the statue are 3.2 m long
and the shoulders are 11.5 m wide.
</P>
<P>
The lamasery once housed the mummified bodies of five Panchen
Lamas, covered in gold or silver, but they were destroyed during
the "cultural revolution" (1966 to 1976).
</P>
<P>
The central government spent over 4.6 million yuan (about 550,
000 U.S. dollars) and bestowed large amounts of silver and gold to
build a tomb for the 10th Panchen Lama and a memorial hall after
he passed away.
</P>
<P>
The lamasery also has many scripture halls and shrines of
Buddha.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen Lama is one of the two leaders of Tibetan Buddhism.
The previous Panchen Lamas were patriotic and made important
contributions to maintaining the unification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Panchen Lama was selected as the reincarnation of the
10th Panchen Lama during a lot-drawing ceremony held in front of a
statue of the Buddha Sakyamuni on November 29, 1995 and the State
Council, China's highest governing body, approved the selection.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Attributes "Ozone Hole" to Solar Wind (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist has
attributed the so-called "hole in the ozone layer" at the South
Pole to a solar wind (or current of high-energy particles),
refuting the popular theory that it is due to people's use of
freon.
</P>
<P>
Yang Xuexiang, a professor of geological sciences at Changchun
University of Technology, published his hypothesis in the May
issue of the Chinese edition of Scientific American.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who is engaged in research into the evolution of the
earth and the changes in the global climate, a National Natural
Science Fund-aided program, postulates three factors involved in
the formation of the "ozone hole" at the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
Yang believes that the first factor is the solar wind, a kind
of high-energy particle current, which has made the atmosphere at
the South Pole thinner.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the eruption of volcanoes in the southern hemisphere
released large amounts of harmful gas, which damaged the ozone
layer there.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the solar high-energy particle currents consume ozone
both at the South Pole and the North Pole when they enter the
earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
British scientists discovered a huge "ozone hole" above the
South Pole in 1985, and most scientists worldwide believe that it
is the use of freon by man that has sharply reduced the ozone
volume.
</P>
<P>
Yang pointed out that the freon theory is not reasonable. He
said that the northern hemisphere is where the use of freon is
concentrated, and so if the freon theory is correct, the "ozone
hole' should have appeared above the North Pole instead of the
South Pole.

<TEXT>
<P>
Yang insists that the solar wind is the major cause of the "
ozone hole" at the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
He said, most planets, including the earth, may lose part of
their mass when they move toward the sun. This lays the foundation
for the evolution of atmospheres on planets.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, planets near the sun, such as Mercury,
have very thin atmospheres, while planets far from the sun have
much thicker atmospheres.
</P>
<P>
As the earth's atmosphere is protected by the geomagnetic layer,
only a small amount of the solar high-energy particles can
penetrate it and reach the south and north poles along the lines
of magnetic force.
</P>
<P>
So the ozone layers at the two poles were the first to be
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the halogen produced by volcanic eruptions is
much more than the amount of man-produced freon, adding that the
eruption of a volcano in the Tianshan Mountains 6,000 years ago
released as much halogen as the total amount of freon produced by
mankind in 170 years.
</P>
<P>
According to his calculations, the solar particles entering the
South Pole are 6.6 percent more than those reaching the North Pole
annually, giving rise to the gradual enlargement of the "ozone
hole" there.
</P>
<P>
The solar high-energy particles entering the atmosphere may
consume 10 percent of the ozone volume of the earth each year, and
the "ozone hole" is moving from the South Pole to the North Pole,
and should reach there in about 10,000 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that this major change should attract worldwide
attention.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that it is important for all the countries in the
world to curb environmental pollution, which reduces the capacity
of nature to produce new ozone.
</P>
<P>
Yang has published more than 50 papers on his discoveries.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Sunday accused the
Qatar-based Al-Jazeera satellite television channel of defaming
Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the cabinet weekly session, Minister of Information
Yousef Al-Sumait said that following a broadcast that insulted
the emir, Al-Jazeera was in a violation of all professional and
ethical values and norms that govern "the brotherly relations
between the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states."
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said Sunday that the station had broadcast
a comment by an Iraqi named Said Al-Zubaibi from Norway who
through satellite telephone link insulted the Kuwaiti paramount
leader. But the reports failed to mention the content of the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sumait Saturday ordered the closure of the Al-Jazeera
office in Kuwait and banned it from conducting any media activity
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The presenter at the program, entitled Al-Sharia W'Al-Hayah',
did not even try to stop or ask the caller to abide by the art of
dialog or apologize for such bad interposition," Al-Sumait
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Al-Jazeera should "hold the direct responsibility
of this unacceptable encroachment against the symbol of Kuwait
and the commander of its march."

In a Statement on Regional Issues at the end of a three-day
summit held in Cologne, Germany, the G-8 noted that such
negotiations should take full consideration of relevant
U.N. resolutions and treaties on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 said that "the Cyprus problem has gone unresolved for
too long" and that "resolution of this problem would not only
benefit all the people of Cyprus, but would also have a positive
impact on peace and stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 said both parties "have legitimate concerns that can and
must be addressed," adding that "members of the G-8 are convinced
that only comprehensive negotiations covering all relevant issues
can do this."
</P>
<P>
The talks should be conducted on such principles as "no
preconditions, all issues on the table, commitment in good faith
to continue to negotiate until a settlement is reached," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 groups the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Agree on Resuming Nuclear Disarmament Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE June 20 (Xinhua)--The United States President Bill
Clinton and his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin on Sunday agreed
to resume their talks for the third stage treaty of restricting
atom weaponry ( Start III).
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed to hold further talks over the
change to Anti Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty to confine the
anti-missile defensive system. The talks seemed more necessary
after the U.S. planned to develop its new anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued after the bilateral meeting between
Clinton and Yeltsin said the disarmament talks should open "later
this summer". Yeltsin and Clinton declared "to do at their best to
achieve the ratification of the Start II treaty".
</P>
<P>
After achieving the Helsinki deal on Kosovo peacekeeping
arrangement, Yeltsin and Clinton expressed their readiness to
rehabilitate the bilateral relationship between the two countries,
said Sandy Berger, Clinton's security advisor.
</P>
<P>
The nearly-one-hour meeting in the hotel hosting the Russian
delegation was "a meeting of innovation", said Berger, adding, "it
was one of the best of the 17 meetings in recent seven and a half
years."
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held soon after the three-day summit of world's
seven industrial countries and Russia (G-8) in the same city.
</P>
<P>
According to Berger, Clinton and Yeltsin also discussed
situation in Kosovo and the role of the Russian presence in the
international peace keeping force (KFOR).
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, after arriving in Cologne Sunday morning for the last
session of G-8 summit, had earlier met with his German host,
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
The two discussed more global initiatives amid the 21st
century, said Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov who took part
in the talks.

<HEADLINE> China Stepping Up Support For Small, Medium-Sized Businesses (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is doing this by creating a favorable business environment
for them, and encouraging them to engage in reforms and
technological upgrading.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Wei Dong, director of the Small and Medium-
sized Enterprise Department of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, at a two-day international forum on promoting the
development of these enterprises which ended here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1998, China has been paying close
attention to the development of small and medium-sized enterprises,
in response to the changing economic situations both at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China now has more than 10 million such
enterprises, accounting for 90 percent of the country's total.
They contribute 60 percent of the nation's industrial output value
and 40 percent of its pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
In addition, of China's approximately 150 billion U.S. dollars-
worth of exports each year, small and medium-sized enterprises
account for about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The speedy development of small and medium-sized enterprises is
regarded as a result of strategic restructuring of the economy,
which aims at cutting the number of large enterprises while
rejuvenating small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, has urged all
commercial banks to set up credit departments specially to serve
small and medium-sized enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Newspaper Commentary Calls for Elimination of Superstition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, will carry a commentary in its Monday edition,
urging all Communist Party members to take the lead in advocating
science while doing away with superstition.
</P>
<P>
The commentary points out that the Communist Party of China (
CPC) has, since its founding in 1921, unceasingly applied the
scientific world outlook of Marxism to help the Chinese people
free themselves from old ideas and superstitious thoughts.
</P>
<P>
However, efforts to improve scientific research levels and the
people's understanding of science have always run up against
ignorant and superstitious activities.
</P>
<P>
Superstition has gained ground in some parts of the country in
recent years, having a negative impact on the people's work, it
says.
</P>
<P>
"More seriously, some Party members and officials who pursue
personal gain have been deeply involved in worshipping Buddha, and
practicing astrology, divination, geomancy and physiognomy. They
have fallen captive to idealism," it says.
</P>
<P>
The commentary points out that the phenomenon of superstition
winning over science, idealism winning over materialism and theism
winning over secularism goes against not only the development of
humanity, but also the historical responsibilities of Communist
Party members.
</P>
<P>
The commentary urges Party members and officials to take the
lead in advocating science while toppling superstition by
acquiring a scientific world outlook.
</P>
<P>
"We should be highly vigilant against superstition, for it may
confuse our thinking, undermine our fighting will, shake our
beliefs and destroy our cohesiveness," it says.
</P>
<P>
"In order to win in the present atmosphere of fierce
international competition and overcome all difficulties and evil
forces, science must be respected, and the banner of Marxist
materialism and antitheism has to be upheld," it adds.

BELGRADE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 40,000 Serb forces have
nearly completed their pullout from Kosovo by Sunday midday, about
12 hours ahead the deadline of midnight that day, stipulated in
last week's Helsinki agreement, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
A NATO spokesman confirmed the withdrawal process had
approached ending, saying that the last contingents of Serb troops
had already crossed the border, and all have left was "the odd
straggler".
</P>
<P>
British General Michael Jackson, the commander of the NATO
peacekeeping forces in Kosovo, will make a formal decision on
whether all Serb forces have in fact left Kosovo and then report
the U.N. on the whole withdrawal process.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the Serb pullout, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton will meet in Cologne,

<HEADLINE> China Stepping Up Support for Small &AMP; Medium-Sized Businesses (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A drafting team for a new law on the promotion of small and
medium-sized enterprises has been set up under a National People's
Congress subcommittee, as a measure to ensure the healthy and
speedy development of these businesses.
</P>
<P>
Among detailed measures taken to improve the performance of
small and medium-sized businesses, China will increase its efforts
to standardize the reform among the enterprises, in an attempt to
turn them into legal entities with strong market competitiveness
and able to assume sole responsibility for their profits and
losses. The enterprises are encouraged to restructure by means of
merger, leasing and contracting.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-sized enterprises are also encouraged to
specialize, and turn out name-brand and high-quality products.
They are also urged to pursue technological improvement to make
value-added, customized and economical products.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-sized enterprises have been playing an
increasingly important role in resolving the unemployment problem
of the country, which partly results from the reform of the
country's state-run enterprises. Jobless people and those laid-off
from state-owned enterprises are encouraged to set up small and
medium-sized enterprises, as a way to promote the country's smooth
economic restructuring and sustained development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, official figures indicate that these enterprises
have employed the majority of the more than 200 million surplus
workers resulting from the reform of the agricultural sector over
the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
To create a better business environment for these enterprises,
priority will be given to improving financial policy, setting up
credit guarantees, seeking channels to raise money, setting up
risk funds, and improving social security and service systems.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of the activities of such enterprises is regarded
as a worldwide topic of attention in both developed and developing
countries, because they comprise an important component of any
economy, according to experts at the seminar, whose sponsors
included the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the
Chinese Manufacturers Association of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Indo-Pakistan Conflict Unlikely to Become Nuclear War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The on-going conflict in Kashmir
between India and Pakistan was unlikely to escalate into a nuclear
war, which could kill millions of people, Indian experts said here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Since there was no risk of even a full-fledged war between
India and Pakistan, a nuclear war remained a far-fetched
possibility, argued Air Commodore Jasjit Singh, director of the
Institute of Defense Studies and Analyses (IDSA).
</P>
<P>
The two countries have not extended their fighting, which has
going on for over a month, to anywhere beyond the present conflict
area.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made to ensure that the hostilities are
confined to the present conflict area, according to P. R. Chari,
director of the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies.
</P>
<P>
Indian Home Minister L. K. Advani asserted Sunday that the
conflict in the Kargil sector of Kashmir would remain a "limited
war" as "the invasion from Pakistan had already been contained."
</P>
<P>
"I call it a limited war as a full-scale war has to be declared
by both countries," Advani said during his day-long visit to areas
along the so-called line of control in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), Advani claimed
that India had made "conscious efforts" to ensure a limited
confrontation in Kargil and not allow it to escalate.
</P>
<P>
However, PTI quoted Chari as saying the two countries were not
mature nuclear states, adding, "The most dangerous period is in
the beginning (after nuclear tests)."
</P>
<P>
Chari called for dialogue between New Delhi and Islamabad at
this stage, saying, "It is imperative."
</P>
<P>
If there was no dialogue between the two countries aimed at
building mutual confidence and, consequently, no understanding of
what was in the other's mind, he went on, there could be trouble.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, India declared Sunday evening that its troops had
captured a strategic point in Kashmir after a fierce battle.
</P>
<P>
Indian troops "fully cleared Pakistan army and intruders"
Saturday night from Point 5140, which overlooks the strategic
Srinagar-Leh national highway, military sources said here.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand Legal Services Hotline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Justice plans to
make its legal hotline service available nationwide within two
years, in a bid to provide wider legal aid services, the country's
top justice official disclosed today at a meeting held in Heze, in
east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Gao Changli said that by dialing "148"
ordinary people can consult local justice authorities.
</P>
<P>
By the middle of June, the hotline had already become
functional in nearly 40 percent of the cities and nearly two-
thirds of the counties in the country's 31 provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Congratulates National Education Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, will carry an editorial in its Monday edition
congratulating the Third National Education Work Conference since
China's opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that the conference, which has just
ended here, is vital to implementing the strategy of invigorating
China through science and education, deepening educational reform,
implementing quality-oriented education and nurturing specialized
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory and the Party's basic line,
China has made historic achievements in reforming and developing
education over the past 20 years, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
However, a tendency to be obsessed with examination results in
teaching and learning has hindered students' all-round development,
and is in discord with the urgent demands of socialist
modernization, it points out.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that deepening educational reform and
promoting quality-oriented education have a vital bearing on the
success of socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"Quality education refers to implementing the party's education
line, and training builders of and successors to the socialist
cause with lofty ideals, moral integrity, a better education and a
high sense of discipline", it continues.
</P>
<P>
Today's students are tomorrow's major force for China's
modernization, and so it is important to improve their overall
quality, it notes.
</P>
<P>
In enforcing quality-oriented education, measures should be
taken to create a favorable environment and conditions for
fostering people who dare to create and advance, it says.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to enforce the nine-year compulsory
education and eradicate illiteracy among young people, and
governments at all levels should work out relevant regulations to
accelerate secondary and higher education, and encourage non-
government organizations to run schools, it added.
</P>
<P>
Quality should be stressed through education in various forms
and at all levels, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It is also important to train highly qualified teachers, the
editorial says, adding that governments at all levels should also
join in the efforts to promote the quality-oriented education.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped Italians Freed in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Interior Ministry
announced on Sunday that the three Italians kidnapped in Iran were
freed on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ministry Spokesman Bahaoddin Sheikholeslami said that the
Italians are under the protection of Iranian security forces and
are in good health, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that they were released after a group of information
and security personnel entered into negotiations with the
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
But he gave no details about the negotiation and any possible
deal with the abductors.
</P>
<P>
IRNA reported Saturday that the Iranian security forces freed
the Italians Saturday night and arrested the abductors near Bam,
Kerman province after they found the hiding place of the abductors.
</P>
<P>
Contacted by Xinhua, an official from the Iranian Interior
Ministry rejected IRNA's previous reports and said that the
Italians were freed on Sunday afternoon, not Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Sheikholeslami said that after the incident ocurred last
Sunday, a special group followed upon various tips and traced the
kidnappers to Sistan-Baluchestan province, which borders
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
But he did not reveal the identities of the abductors and if
they had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
The three Italians, Giuseppe Zizza, Ricardo Pasinato and
Lorenzo Termite from an Italian company were abducted last Sunday
by unknown persons when they were on a trip to see historical
sites in Bam, 180 kilometers south of Kerman city.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari said on
Saturday that "the issue of the abduction of three Italian
citizens has been resolved and they are expected to be freed in
one or two days time."
</P>
<P>
He said that the issue has been resolved with the help and
cooperation of security councils in the provinces of Kerman and
Sistan-Baluchestan.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the Iranian authorities have
made a deal with the abductors, who were widely believed to
be drug smugglers or armed bandits.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria To Return Bodies of Dissidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President Olusegun
Obasanjo promised to release the remains of renowned writer and
environmentalist, Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others hanged by the
former military regime to their families in a bid to ease the
tensions between the federal government and the oil-producing
region.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express, a leading Nigerian daily, put this Sunday as
an outcome of a meeting between Obasanjo and a four-man Ogoni
delegation led by Owens Wiwa, Ken's younger brother, held in Abuja
last Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the presidency got in touch with Owens
last Sunday, two days after he returned from exile in Canada
following the infamous hanging on November 10, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The mood at the meeting was cordial with Obasanjo acceding to
the request of the Ogoni delegation, which also included Ken
Saro-Wiwa (Jnr) , the late writer's first son to repossess the
remains of the Ogoni 9.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the president has directed the Governor of Rivers
State, Peter Odili, to facilitate access to the cemetery where the
Ogoni 9 were interred after they were hanged at the Port Harcourt
Prisons.
</P>
<P>
Owens was scheduled to meet with Odili at the weekend to fine
tune the processes for the exhumation of the bodies.
</P>
<P>
Sources within the late prominent Ogoni activist's family who
were elated by the development said the family would meet soon to
fix a date for the traditional burial.
</P>
<P>
Owens said last Wednesday said that the assistance of foreign
pathologists would be sought to identify the remains of Ken and
the Ogoni 8.
</P>
<P>
Owens, 42, and a medical doctor with specialty in public health
said the thought of according the late Ken, a proper traditional
burial occurred to him minutes after laying to rest his immediate
elder brother, Jim Gote Wiwa, who died last March in London.
</P>
<P>
"Buring Ken and the others is a task that must be done. It's
something we've been wanting to do. We believe he does deserve a
befitting burial. I think it is the right thing to do," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ken and eight of his Ogoni kinsmen were sentenced to death by
hanging by the Miscellaneous and Special Offenses Tribunal headed
by Justice Ibrahim Auta for their supposed roles in the murder of
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Acid was later sprinkled on the remains of the Ogoni 9 to
accelerate the process of decomposition.
</P>
<P>
The hanging saw the expulsion of Nigeria from the Commonwealth
and also attracted the ire of some western nations like U.S.,
Britain, Canada, Germany which imposed wide ranging sanctions.
</P>
<P>
It was not clean at the weekend whether the government's latest
move, which is in consonance with, recommendation of the United
Nations Fact Finding Mission to Ogoni, also covered the review of
the judgment of the Justice Auta tribunal with the aim of
absolving the Ogoni 9.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, who met with warring communities in Warri and Port
Harcourt last week as part of his trouble shooting mission in the
troubled Niger Delta had promised in his inaugural speech to
resolve the raging crisis in the region.

</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Yemen's external debts have dropped from 9 billion
dollars in 1995 to 3.7 billion dollars this year as a result of a
schedule worked out by donor countries at the Paris Club meeting
in 1996, to encourage the economic reform program undertaken by
the Yemeni government to avert escalation of state budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Egyptian daily "Alam Al Yom", Yemen's

- expanding the tax-payers' base and modernizing the taxation
system,
</P>
<P>
- a privatisation process that helps encourage investments.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian caretaker Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee returned here Sunday afternoon following his
two-day official visit to Bangladesh which he described as
"successful."
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Vajpayee discussed with his counterpart,
Sheikh Hasina, "many issues" including trade and commerce between
the two countries and the insurgency in Northeast India.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee told reporters here that India and Bangladesh had
signed some agreements to boost economic cooperation and India had
decided to give 2 billion rupees (approximately 47 million U.S.
dollars) credit to Bangladesh which would be paid back in three
years.
</P>
<P>
On the current imbalanced trade between the two neighbors, the
Indian leader said New Delhi had asked Dhaka to "enlarge the
basket of goods and services between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Dhaka Saturday, Vajpayee asserted that the
visit was totally different from the bus trip he made to Pakistan
with much fanfare last February.

Unlike his trip to Lahore when he took a bus to Wagah on the
Indian-Pakistan border, Vajpayee took a plane to Dhaka this time
and, along with Hasina, received the a bus from Calcutta, the
biggest city in East India.
</P>
<P>
On the on-going conflict in Kashmir with Pakistan, Vajpayee
claimed that Bangladesh favored resolving the issue bilaterally
between New Delhi and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka has clearly indicated that it would maintain a neutral
stand on the conflict between India and Pakistan while urging the
two countries to take measures to defuse tension along the
so-called line of control.
</P>
<P>
Just before Vajpayee's visit, Bangladesh had offered to play
some sort of a mediatory role to find a peaceful solution to the
conflict in the Kargil sector of Kashmir. But India has maintained
that Pakistan had committed an aggression and the onus was on
Islamabad to vacate the occupied areas.

<HEADLINE> China's Education Must Make Big Strides: Premier (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China's education must make big
strides in its development, said Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji at the
closing session of the National Conference on Education here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party,
said that China's economic development has created unprecedentedly
favorable conditions and a historical opportunity for the
development of education.
</P>
<P>
The premier called for further emancipation of thinking,
accelerating educational reforms and development, comprehensive
application of education in qualities, promotion of the strategy
of rejuvenating China through science and education, and
cultivation of highly-skilled workers and specialized
professionals with an eye to the demands of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conference, which was held from June 15 to 18,
made important arrangements for educational reforms and
development in the new century, adding that this is of far-
reaching significance.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, a member of the Standing Committee of
the CPC Central Committee's Political Bureau, presided over the
closing session of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu said that to speed up China's modernization drive,
to enhance China's over-all national strength and to seize the
opportunity and meet the challenges of the new century, education
must be given strategic importance and top priority for
development.
</P>
<P>
It is now urgent for China to accelerate the development of
education, as the demands from both urban and rural residents on
education are growing apace, he said.
</P>
<P>
Accelerating educational development will relieve the pressure
on the entrance to higher education, create a sound environment
for enhancing quality education, and satisfy the demands of both
the students and their parents, he said.

<P>
The development of education can help to promote domestic
demand and consumption, as well as sustained economic growth, Zhu
said. He added that it can also reduce unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"Now that both urban and rural residents are willing to spend
more on education, and their bank savings deposits are growing,
there are more financial resources for education," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"There is still great potential to be tapped for educational
resources, and room for more initiative from society at large in
educational endeavors," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for readjusting the existing structure of the
educational system, expanding the size of senior high school
education and higher education, promoting vocational and technical
education at various levels and widening the path for the
fostering of talent.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the development of education depends on reform,
the key to which lies in further emancipating the people's minds.
</P>
<P>
While giving full play to the role of state-run schools,
governments at all levels should encourage and support other
sectors of society to run different types of educational
establishments. He stated, "Any form of running schools so long as
it is in line with the relevant laws and regulations, can be done
on an experimental basis."
</P>
<P>
He said that non-government schools are expected to make
further progress, as China has no other choice but to run multiple
forms of schools.
</P>
<P>
He urged the country to readjust its policies and make them
more flexible in the field of education. For newly built schools
and school extension projects, land-use fees can be exempted, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The premier called for effective measures to be taken to
increase the annual investment in education. He also discussed
loans to poor students, and improvements in the living conditions
and remuneration of teachers.

enormous role" in solving the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Russia will enjoy a full membership in G-8 after the Cologne

</P>
<P>
Also, Schroeder filed the G-7 heads' agreement on the reform

as other achievements at the summit.
</P>
<P>
The Debt Initiative, a 70 billion-dollar debt-relief package
for world's 36 poorest nations, is set to help the developing
countries and their people, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
And the Cologne Charter, focused on educational issues, will
help make the education system more encouraging. It is helpful to
develop the personality of the youth, and to enhance the social
stability, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 20 (Xinhua)--The Group of Eight (G-8) confined
the international financial aid for Serbia strictly to
humanitarian helps but not any reconstruction funds, said German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We do not think about providing Serbia with reconstruction aid
and helping its integration to Europe", but "we can not punish the
people, we will provide them with humanitarian aid when they are
hungry and cold", Schroeder told a press conference following the
summit.
</P>
<P>
When asked about why the European Union had listed Montenegro,
part of Yugoslavia, as a recipient region in its Southeastern
Europe Stability Pact, Schroder stressed that it did not mean to
acknowledge Montenegro as an independent state, but to show the
benefit of cooperation with the West.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction aid will be organized by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank with contributions from the
Europe, the United States, and Japan, added Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 leaders ended their three-day Cologne summit on Sunday

<HEADLINE> Fight Occurs on Final Day of Olympic Football Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Five Malaysian players were
injured in a serious fight between Nepal's fans and the Malaysian
team here on Sunday on the final day of the five-team Asian Group
Six qualification football tournament for the 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The match was stopped two minutes before the final whistle and
it was announced abandoned half an hour later by the organizing
committee considering the safety of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
One of the Malaysian players, Tengku Hazman Bin Raja Hassasn,
was seriously hurt and was sent to a nearby hospital, according to
an official of the Hong Kong Football Association.
</P>
<P>
"The final result of the unfinished match is up to the Asian
Football Confederation, " added the anonymous official.
</P>
<P>
The score of the match was at one-all before the brawl happened.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes before the final whistle, many of Nepal's excited
fans rushed onto the field from the stands, celebrating the
equalizer headed home by Subba Anil and one of them seized the
ball.
</P>
<P>
Then four Malaysian players were tackling the football from the
Nepal fan and pushed him, angering hundreds of Nepal fans, who
began attacking the Malaysian players.
</P>
<P>
The fight was silenced by police and officials from both sides.
</P>
<P>
After a fruitless first half, the Malaysians opened the scoring
when substitute Mohd Rashid shot home in the 73rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, China, beat the Philippines 4-1 in another match of
the day.
</P>
<P>
Seeded Japan toped the group with 12 points by scoring four
straight wins while Hong Kong, China, four points (1-1-2) and the
Philippines suffered four straight losses.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the unfinished match Sunday, Nepal ranked second
with six points (2-0-1), Malaysia four points (1-1-1).

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- In this capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region you can buy woolen shirts, seafood, cosmetics,
household electrical appliances and French perfume.
</P>
<P>
But what is much more eye-catching to outsiders is that there
are bookstores everywhere. On the shelves are books of all kinds,
ranging from textbooks, novels and dictionaries to guides to
computers and the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Pictures of political leaders like Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping,
as well as pictures of Tibetan Buddhists, are also sold in the
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
"The best sellers here are school textbooks and those on
Tibetan issues," said Basang, who works at the Tibet Autonomous
Region Children's Bookstore.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of novels, travel notes and academic books in the
Chinese and English languages sell well in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
Ma Lihua, author of "Walking Across Tibet", said that she could
not find a publisher for her book a dozen years ago. But since the
book was published in 1994, more than 100,000 copies have been
sold.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, there are over 100 bookstores in
this regional capital with a population of 130,000.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Teachers to Call off Three-month Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT)
will meet next Tuesday in Lokoja of Kogi State to review the
unfolding developments on the teachers' strike and may call off
the three-month nationwide strike.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government last week responded favorably to the
teachers' strike by releasing 4.5 billion Naira (about 45 million
U.S. Dollars) for the immediate payment of the primary school
teachers' salaries, The Guardian newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The union Secretary General Gabriel Falade said on Saturday
that the decision on calling off the three-month strike would be
taken at the emergency meeting of the NUT National Executive
Council to be held in Lokoja, central Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, the teachers will hold a meeting on
Monday in capital Abuja with the education committee of the House
of Representatives, which is a follow-up to a similar one held in
Lagos last Monday.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers and the NUT National Executive Council met on
last Monday but failed to reach any consensus. However, the
lawmakers promised to put pressure on the government and the
Finance Ministry to expedite action on the teachers' salaries.
</P>
<P>
Falade said that "we (the union) are happy with the steps taken
so far by President OLusegun Obasanjo. We appreciate his efforts,
and we are happy he is interested in the country's education."
</P>
<P>
The teachers' demands include the payment of the 3,500 Naira
(about 35 Dollars) minimum wage, a new teachers salary structure
and the establishment of a pension board for both primary and
secondary school teachers.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to draw public sympathy to their strike, the teachers
stormed the National Assembly Complex in Abuja last week with
placards demanding a meeting with the Speaker of the House of
Representatives, Salisu Ibrahim Buhari, who assured them that
everything possible would be done to address their grievances.
</P>
<P>
The decision to implement the new minimum wage for primary
school teachers throughout the country may cost the Nigerian
government about 48 billion Naira (about 480 million Dollars)
annually.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people were
killed and more than 30 others injured in yet another tragedy in
the Indian capital and, this time, by the collapse of a building
under construction.
</P>
<P>
The four-storied building collapsed in North Delhi Saturday
night, burying all the laborers who were still working or cooking
inside the ill-fated building.
</P>
<P>
A senior police official said on Sunday that at least three
more people were still feared trapped in the debris which rescue
workers are busy removing.
</P>
<P>
Residents said one of the newly-construed pillars of the
building cracked under its weight Saturday night, triggering the
collapse of the entire structure.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said a large number of laborers were working
inside the building or cooking in the basement when the tragedy
occurred as the contractor was in a hurry building the fourth
floor.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Vajpayee Visits Bangladesh Only to Open Bus Service? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee ended his two-day visit to Bangladesh on Sunday, after
talks with his Bangladeshi counterpart, Sheikh Hasina, and jointly
inaugurating the cross-border bus service between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the visit was the ceremonial inauguration of
the Dhaka-Calcutta bus service on Saturday afternoon, which was
described by Bangladeshi Foreign Secretary Shafi Sami as the prime
objective of the Vajpayee trip.
</P>
<P>
While the inauguration of the bus service topped the agenda of
Vajpayee's visit, economic issues however were the focus of the
talks between the two prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, which has suffered a huge trade deficit with India,
has been repeatedly complaining of tariff and non-tariff barriers
for its goods into India and demanding a higher level of exports
and zero-tariff access of goods into the Indian market. In the
1997-88 fiscal year, Bangladesh had a trade deficit of 870.28
million U.S. dollars with India.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before departure for New Delhi, Vajpayee
said he had discussed with Hasina multi-faceted relations between
the two countries. India had accepted in principle Bangladesh's
"request for duty-free access on a non-reciprocal basis" to
selected export items and advised Dhaka to augment its limited
export basket by including "goods and services that are of
interest to India," he added.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee was apparently referring to "transit facilities" in
Bangladesh for personnel and goods movement between the
northeastern and eastern parts of India and importing natural gas
from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
India has been requesting "transit facilities" from Bangladesh
for long, but both the ruling and opposition parties in Bangladesh
have been opposed to exporting gas before "meeting domestic
demand."
</P>
<P>
At a time when India and Pakistan were engaged in a border
conflict and the general elections in India were drawing near,
Vajpayee's visit to Bangladesh, the third largest nation in the
region, should not be regarded as a visit merely for opening the
bus service, said analysts. Vajpayee was also aiming at something
else, they said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has shown interest in mediating between its two big
neighbors. Dhaka would take the initiative toward mediation to
resolve the conflict in Kashmir "if both the countries voluntarily
propose third-party mediation," Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad
said.
</P>
<P>
And Vajpayee, by saying that the issue of Jammu and Kashmir was
a bilateral one and India would like to solve it bilaterally,
indirectly dissuaded Dhaka from any attempt to mediate in his
country's border clashes with Pakistan, according to the analysts.
</P>
<P>
India would hold its next general elections later this year and
the Indian caretaker prime minister was trying, by his Bangladesh
visit, to woo votes from the Muslim and Bengali-speaking
communities in his country, they said.

CAIRO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
on Sunday with Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek to discuss
bilateral ties and regional issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on ways of boosting economic cooperation
between Egypt and Slovenia, the Middle East peace process and
other regional and international issues, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Drnovsek termed his
visit to Egypt as a key step on the way to forge fruitful
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenian prime minister arrived in Cairo on Friday for a
three-day visit to seek opportunities for closer economic and
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Slovenia signed last year two agreements respectively
on preventing dual taxation and protecting reciprocal
investments. The two countries are considering setting up a
ministerial committee aimed at further bolstering cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting between Drnovsek and his Egyptian counterpart
Kamal El-Ganzouri on Saturday, El-Ganzouri expressed Egypt's
readiness to open an embassy in Slovenia to facilitate trade
exchange and movement of personnel between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili, who took
part in the meeting between Mubarak and Drnovsek, told reporters
that a number of agreements were signed in the day between Egypt
and Slovenia to launch joint industrial projects. But Gowaili did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He said the private sector of the two countries have signed a
number of accords on new joint projects and to pump vigor into
the agreements signed previously in trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Discussions are under way to regulate links between the two
countries' banks and ports, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that during the talks, Drnovsek extended an
invitation to Mubarak to visit Slovenia.

<P>
Cologne, Germany, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Group of
Eight (G8) countries on Sunday call for the immediate end of
Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"We deeply concerned about the continuing military
confrontation in Kashmir" following the infiltration of armed
intruders which violated the Line of Control," they said in a
statement issued here in Cologne after they concluded their three-
day annual summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
The G8 leaders said that they regarded any military action to
change the status as an irresponsible manner. "We therefore call
for the immediate end of these actions," said the leaders from
Russia, the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Canada
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
They also called for restoration of the Line of Control and "
for the parties to work for an immediate cessation of the fighting,
full respect in the future for the Line of Control and the
resumption of the dialogue between India and Pakistan in the
spirit of the Lahore Declaration."

<HEADLINE> Afghan Envoy Rules Out Multipartite Ruling Setup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Taliban diplomat Sunday
ruled out any role for other Afghan factions in the ruling setup
of the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the News Network International of
Pakistan, the Taliban's chief representative in Pakistan Maulvi
Saeed-ur-Rahman Haqqani said there will be no role for other
Afghan groups after the establishment of a government under the
Taliban's leadership.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani said the Taliban will ensure Afghanistan's sovereignty
and unity with its own capability.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban were able to adhere to their set rule and
principles, from the very beginning, aimed at restoring peace and
security, law and order and collecting arms from irresponsible
groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
Defending the collection of arms from the people, Haqqani said
these arms were misused for unlawful activities of theft, robbery,
genocide, threat of life and property, rape, smuggling of
narcotics and many other violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The basic rights and liberties of each individual are secured
based on Islamic regulations and traditional rules of the Afghan
society, added the envoy.
</P>
<P>
He admitted however that great economic problems exist in his
country as a result of 20 years' continued war and they need "hard
efforts and enough time and investment" to be resolved.

<HEADLINE> 5 Arrested In Ireland Over Omagh Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Irish police said on Sunday they
had arrested five men in connection with last year's Omagh bombing,
which killed 29 people in the worst atrocity of Northern Ireland's
long sectarian conflict.
</P>
<P>
The men were detained in dawn raids in the town of Dundalk,
close to the border with Northern Ireland, a BBC report quoted a
police spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The five were reported as linked to the Real IRA (Ireland
Republic Army), the dissident republican faction responsible for
the bomb attack in the northern market town of Omagh.
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA, which aimed to derail the British-ruled province'
s fragile peace process with the attack, faced with a security
crackdown and public outrage after the Omagh bombing. The group
called off hostilities soon after the attack.
</P>
<P>
The main republican guerrilla group, the Irish Republican Army,
declared a ceasefire in its war against British rule in July 1997,
paving the way for last year's Good Friday peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Police on both sides of the border have arrested and released
several suspects in connection with the Omagh bombing over the
last few months. Only one man has been charged.
</P>
<P>
Four other people were also arrested in Northern Iraland in
connection with the newest development in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The attack last year in the Co Tyrone town near Omagh also
injured more than 200 people.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Set Up Mine Action Center in North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is planning to establish
a mine action center in the northern Jaffna peninsula, the former
stronghold of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE), officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The center aims to mobilize the mine identification activities
to be launched at the end of this month by the U.N. Development
Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The recruiting and training of personnel to take up duties at
the center will be finalized once UNDP mine expert Jennifer Mason
arrives in Jaffna in early July, officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to UNDP Information Officer Lisa Hiller, the clearing
of landmines will begin by the end of July once the lands with
mines are identified and demarcated.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting the government for an
independent Tamil homeland since 1983 in Sri Lanka's north and
east.
</P>
<P>
The Jaffna peninsula was controlled by the Tamil rebels until
government troops captured it three years ago and both sides have
been responsible for the widespread planting of mines.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that more than 2,000 civilians are
assumed to have been severely injured by landmines since the early
80s in the area.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 10 people every month are injured by
landmines in Jaffna, many of them children, and the number is
expected to rise as more displaced people return home.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations estimates that more than a tenth of the land
in Jaffna is mined. However, officials have said the de-mining
program is not aimed at getting rid of all of the mines but to
certify and clear the least-affected areas.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Accept Nothing Less Than Total Lifting of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has said it will never accept
anything less than the total lifting of the economic sanctions
imposed on the country for nearly nine years.
</P>
<P>
An editorial carried in Sunday's Baghdad Observer newspaper
said the new British draft resolution submitted to the
U.N. Security Council recently does not go far enough to call for
the total lifting of "the inhumane economic sanctions."
</P>
<P>
Instead, the draft resolution calls for the suspension of the
U.N. oil embargo for a limited period at a time when Iraq has only
the limited capacity to export oil, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. clamped sanctions on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, but allowed it to export limited amount of oil
since 1996 to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods for
its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been seeking removal of the devastating sanctions. The
U.N. insisted that the sanctions be removed only after the
U.N. weapons inspectors verify that Baghdad has eliminated all
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
But the weapons inspection has stopped since December last
year due to the dispute between Baghdad and the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM), which oversees the destruction of banned
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The British draft resolution, which enjoys implicit U.S.
support, keeps tight control on all goods imported to Iraq, a
situation which infringes on Iraq's sovereignty and cripples
Iraq's economy, it added.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is bound to reject the new British draft resolution
since it imposes strict conditions and it stipulates that Iraq
should allow an expanded form of inspection on its industrial
installations, a situation Iraq could not accept under all
circumstances," said the article.
</P>
<P>
It said that Iraq has bitter experience with UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
"Events have proved that UNSCOM is a willing tool in the hands
of the U.S. and Britain, and has been used by them to plant their
spies in Iraq, destroy its vital economic industrial installations
on the pretext that these installations can be used for dual
purpose," said the article.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM was also used to create crises with Iraq to give the
U.S. and Britain an excuse to launch aggressions against Iraq, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Last December, UNSCOM said in a report to the U.N. Security
Council that Iraq failed to fully cooperate with U.N. arms
inspectors, which gave a pretext for the U.S. and Britain to
launch four-night airstrikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has vowed not to allow the return of the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. President Bill Clinton said in Paris Thursday
that Washington wants to maintain UNSCOM in Iraq as a strict
control to prevent Iraq from developing weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
France, which differs with the U.S. over the lifting of
sanctions on Iraq, wants the U.N. to replace the commission with a
new U.N. mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi daily said UNSCOM was also responsible for the
prolongation of the suffering of the Iraqi people since it
resorted to delaying tactics in line with the U.S. and British
approach to blackmail Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Agent Behind Political Killings in Iran Commits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A major agent behind the political
killings of Iranian dissidents last year committed suicide in a
prison on Saturday, an Iranian judicial official announced on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Judicial Organization of the Iranian Armed Forces
Mohammad Niazi said that Saeed Emami, one of the four main agents
behind the killings, committed suicide by taking in depilatory
substance while taking a bath, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Emami was immediately rushed to a specialized hospital but
medical treatment failed to save his life, he said, adding that
Emami is one of the key agents in the case.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Iran Nation Party Darius Forouhar and his wife
were stabbed to death at home and at least three dissident writers
were mysteriously killed in Tehran in the last two months of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Intelligence Ministry, controlled by conservatives,
announced in January that some of its own agents were involved in
the political murders.
</P>
<P>
The revelation triggered a sharp political quarrel between the
conservative and moderate factions and forced the then
Intelligence Minister Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi to resign.
</P>
<P>
Niazi also announced the names of three other main agents as
Mostafa Kazemi, Mehrdad Aalikhani and Khosrow barati, adding that
some of those arrested were from the Iranian intelligence forces
while others were businessmen.
</P>
<P>
He said that a total of 23 people have been arrested in
connection with the political killings while 33 others have been
summoned for investigations.
</P>
<P>
In view of the documents available and his confessions, Emami
would have been sentenced to death if he had stood trial with
regard to his charges, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the motive behind the political murders
was to raise problems with the Iranian government led by moderate
President Mohammad Khatami at international and local scenes.
</P>
<P>
Terming the case as "very complicated," Niazi said that the
investigations into the case have been completed and submitted to
the authorities for rule.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Working Out Plan Against Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Five Philippine government agencies
 stepped up their efforts to form a national contingency plan
against the millennium bug, said an official report Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Undertaking the plan are the Presidential Commission on Year
2000 Compliance, Department of Science and Technology (DOST),
National Computer Center (NCC), National Disaster Coordinating
Council (NDCC), and Technology and Livelihood Resource Center
(TLRC), said the report released here by the presidential office.
</P>
<P>
It said that the five agencies expect to submit the contingency
plan soon to the National Security Council (NSC) to make sure that
vital services will continue in spite of the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
With the NSC as lead agency, the report said, the five agencies
would also provide technical and administrative support in
implementing the contingency plan.
</P>
<P>
Government agencies shall likewise submit to the NSC their own
contingency plans outlining steps in case the millennium bug
disrupts public service by 2000, it said.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada signed last June 1 the Y2K Readiness
Act which requires government agencies and private corporations to
disclose their plans for the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
It also holds firms liable if their computer systems, products
or services malfunction starting on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a built-in flaw in older computer systems
that causes them to malfunction due to their inability to read
date beyond December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines formed a Y2K commission in August last year to
prepare for the effects of the millennium bug, especially on key
sectors such as telecommunications, finance, manufacturing,
government services, transportation, utilities, and health care.

<HEADLINE> Small Loan: Effective for Poverty Reduction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Wang Taohua, a widow of Miao
ethnic group in southwest China's Guizhou Province, had cherished
a wish for two years that she could borrow some money to buy
dozens of ducks and other domestic animals to support her family.
</P>
<P>
"It seemed that there was no way for us to borrow 1,000 yuan, a
very large sum for us poor families to pay back," Wang said. "
Nobody would lend the money to me and my children."
</P>
<P>
In early 1998, Wang became lucky. The bank lent her 1,000 yuan
to realize her wish.
</P>
<P>
Every morning, Wang let out ducks to rivers and then she busied
herself in feeding a pig and a cow. Within less than two years,
Wang can support her family with her hands. She even for the first
time opened a bank account to deposit more than 1,000 yuan for the
family.
</P>
<P>
Wang and her family was among millions of poverty-stricken
households who benefited from petty loans to find means of
livelihood in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
In the latter half of 1998 alone, the Agricultural Bank of
China issued about 800 million yuan in the form of small loans to
support 700,000 rural households with 1.3 million people to fight
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Su Guoxia, an official with the poverty relief office under the
State Council, said that with the efforts in the past 10 years and
more, the poverty-stricken population in China has reduced from
more than 200 million in 1985 to 42 million at present.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is determined to find solutions to
helping all the poor people to have enough to eat and wear, she
said.
</P>
<P>
China expects to improve its social relief system to provide
poverty-relief to the poor households which have no laborers and
to resettle farmers living in adverse ecological conditions. The
two parts of the people accounted for half of the impoverished
population in the country.
</P>
<P>
As for the remaining 20 million poor people, China will offer
them small loans to help them to get rid of poverty and become
rich.
</P>
<P>
Du Xiaoshan, a specialist of the Institute of Rural Development
of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that at the
beginning of the 1990s, China adopted the method of issuing petty
loans to the poor which was widely used in Bangladesh and other
Asian and Latin American countries.

<HEADLINE> Bandit Attack Kills 100 in E. Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 persons, including three
policemen, were feared killed at the weekend in Taraba, an
eastern state of Nigeria by armed bandits suspected to be from
neighboring Chad and Niger Republic.
</P>
<P>
Another 200 people are believed to be receiving treatment at
the Taraba State specialist hospital, Jalingo, reported the
Guardian, a leading Nigerian daily Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Taraba State Governor Jolly Nyame, who had earlier Saturday
travelled to Yola for a reception for the vice-president, Alhaji
Abubakar Atiku, had to cut short his trip and rush back to Jalingo
to assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
Nyame, who was shocked over the development, said the incident
was "brutal, callous and inhuman, " adding that the police force
is under- equipped to handle the menace of the bandits.
</P>
<P>
Among the injured are nursing mothers and babies who had
serious knife cuts, and are lying critically ill at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the vice-president has been briefed on the
matter. According to him, Atiku had promised that the issue would
be tabled at the national security council meeting which comes up
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was gathered that the foreign bandits operate mostly in four
local government areas namely, Kareem-Lamido, Ardo-Kola, Gassol
and Bali council areas.
</P>
<P>
To allay the fears that the bandits might attack Jalingo, the
state capital, Taraba police commissioner, Njangor Egbe Njon, had
sent a distress call to the Plateau state police command to send
a detachment of mobile policemen to assist the Taraba state police
command.
</P>
<P>
It was gathered that the bandits have taken over Jos-Kaduna
road with their sophisticated weapons.

<HEADLINE> Small Loan: Effective for Poverty Reduction (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first, China absorbed the international funds mainly from
the United Nations Development Program and International Fund for
Agriculture Development, aiming to help farmers to build water
conservancy projects, to purchase farming tools and cattle, and to
popularize farming technique and skills.
</P>
<P>
Now, the method of the small loans is being popularized in some
provinces and autonomous regions. The sources for the loans have
shifted from international funds to the credit funds provided by
governments and banks in China and the borrowing has been made
easier.
</P>
<P>
The experiment of the loans was welcomed by the local
governments and farmers in Guizhou, Henan, Hebei and Yunnan
provinces. Local officials called the loans as effective and
suitable to help the poor households while Chinese and overseas
specialists engaged in aiding-the-poor projects called it a method
of "sending poverty-relief funds to the hands of the poor."
</P>
<P>
Mo Shiren, deputy governor of Guizhou Province, said that last
year, his province issued more than 200 million yuan in the loan
to about 200,000 households. More than 90 percent of them have
paid back the loan to banks.
</P>
<P>
In his recent investigation tour in China, Muhammad Yunus,
founder of the small loan service in Bangladesh, said that China
has succeeded in the use of small loans and time is ripe for the
country to further popularize the loans in larger areas.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the poverty-relief project, the Chinese
government this year has allocated 6.5 billion yuan to its aiding-
the-poor funds which will amount to 24.8 billion yuan. It is
learned that a quite large sum of the funds will be used as small
loans.
</P>
<P>
The loans will be widely used in the provinces and regions
including Guizhou, Ningxia, Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan,
Gansu and Guangxi. Some provinces will allocate 80 percent of
poverty-relief funds to small loan funds.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou Province lent 230 million yuan in petty loans to 210,
000 poor households in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials in charge of the poverty relief work under
the State Council said that the small loan will become one of
China's strategic measures in reducing the population of the poor
in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee: No Mediation in India-Pakistan Border Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee on Sunday ruled out any possibility of third-party
mediation in settling the border clashes between Indian and
Pakistan over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question at a joint press conference at the end
his two-day Bangladesh visit, Vajpayee said the issue of Jammu and
Kashmir was a bilateral one and India would like to solve it
bilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was going to meet Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif to discuss the issue, Vajpayee said: "There is no
proposal at the moment."
</P>
<P>
The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
had not suffered from the border clashes between Indian and
Pakistan over Kashmir, he said. "I don't think SAARC has suffered
due to the recent border clashes at Kargil between India and
Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
He said SAARC was set up to address economic issues of the
region. "We will continue to talk on economic issues in the
SAARC," he added.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question on how Bangladesh views the border
clashes, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said it was a
bilateral issue and it should be solved bilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh wanted peace and harmony in the sub-continent, she
said. "I hope the two countries will sit together and settle the
problem through discussions and not with arms," she added.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee arrived here on Saturday to inaugurate the direct bus
service between Dhaka and West Bengal, the capital of the Indian
state of West Bengal.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Warns of Water Contamination in Flood-Prone Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government urged
Sunday its people to boil their drinking and cooking water against
water contamination in flood-prone areas.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview here, Health Secretary Alberto Romualdez
Jr. expressed concern over the high risk of water contamination,
saying that could result in serious illness, due to floods and
busted water pipes.
</P>
<P>
"The rains might contaminate our water sources, especially in
the provinces and places in Manila where the water system is
old," said Romualdez.
</P>
<P>
He also urged residents to take precautions against dengue by
not allowing flood waters to stagnate.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez said one safeguard against diseases from these
contaminated sources of water is for residents to "boil their
drinking water and cooking water."
</P>
<P>
He added his office would do its part by intensifying its
health education efforts, in coordination with local government
units.
</P>
<P>
"We have good coordination with local officials, and we will
support them. We have our own health education materials and we
share them with local officials," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Romualdez said residents can strengthen their
defense against dengue during the rainy season by keeping their
surroundings clean.

<HEADLINE> UAE-Saudi Ties Stronger After Crisis: Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The ties between the United Arab
Emitates and Saudi Arabia have got stronger after a crisis over
the latter's warm-up of relations with Iran, local newspapers
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing better among the brothers than concord and
convergence," said the official Al Ittihad daily in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
Dubai-based Al Bayan also underlined that ties between the UAE
and Saudi Arabia have been concreted and will not be affected by
a passing crisis.
</P>
<P>
The paper paid tribute to the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad
Bin Khalifa Al Thani for his effort in restoring relations
between the two countries to normal.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad visited the UAE on Saturday and held talks with
its President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, then flew to
Saudi Arabia, taking with him UAE Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al Nahyan to meet with the Saudi
king and crown prince.
</P>
<P>
"This diplomatic flurry took place in only one day and
managed to return warmth to the bilateral relations," Al Bayan
praised.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and Saudi Arabia had been in a row over the
latter's improvement of ties with Iran, with whom the UAE has
a dispute over three Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
The UAE accused Saudi Arabia of not carrying out collective
obligations to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), through which
the UAE requires all its members to make improving relations
with Iran conditional on the solution of the islands dispute.
Saudi Arabia dismissed the UAE's accusation as childish.
</P>
<P>
The three islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser
Tunbs are claimed by both the UAE and Iran but are being
occupied by Iran since 1971 when Britain retreated from the
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Displeased with Saudi Arabia and other GCC members who are
improving ties with Iran, the UAE even threatened to quit
the organization, which was set up in 1981 and groups the
UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
"The lessons to be learnt from the past few days is that: the
GCC is born to survive and is stronger than passing storms," Al
Bayan said.

<HEADLINE> China's Hainan Seizes Ban Violating Fishing Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The authorities of south China's
Hainan Province earlier this week seized two fishing boats and
fined several fishermen for violating a fishing ban in the South
China Sea.
</P>
<P>
This is the only violation in Hainan of the fishing ban that
was imposed on June 1 and will last through July 31. During the
two-month moratorium, all trawlers, nets and fishing boats are
barred from the waters north of 12 degrees north latitude.
</P>
<P>
A provincial government official said that more than 1,400
fishing boats have stayed berthed as ordered since the ban was
enacted.
</P>
<P>
The South China Sea enjoys a tropical weather and is an ideal
fishing ground. Aquatic resources, however, have shown traces of
depletion owing to overfishing. Official figures show that the
annual harvest from the sea has reached 3.7 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The official said that regular fishing bans will be imposed in
the South China Sea every year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Hails U.S. Decision to Delay Embassy Moving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has welcomed the decision
made by U.S. President President Bill Clinton to delay moving the
U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to avoid
jeopardizing the vulnerable Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried in Jordan Times Sunday, Jordanian
Speaker of the House of Representatives Abdu Hadi Majali termed
Clinton`s decision, made earlier this week, as a "sound and wise
stance," which will have a crucial impact on the entire peace
process from an Arab and Islamic point of view.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said Clinton`s decision reflected that he has
realized the sensitivity of the status of Jerusalem. Israel
has repeatedly claimed the holy city as its undivided and eternal
capital while the Palestinians want it as capital of their future
state.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accord reached between the Palestinians
and Israel, the fate of Jerusalem should be determined in the
final status talks, which should have started by May 1996 but
never happened due to Israel's hardline policies pursued by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyhahu.
</P>
<P>
Majali also called for the revocation of the 1995 U.S. law on
moving the American embassy to Jerusalem because, he said, the law
violates all international charters and United Nations resolutions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Challenge Bird Origin Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese ornithologists have
insisted that the dinosaur was not the lineal father of birds as
has been claimed by other experts.
</P>
<P>
They made their statement in the authoritative scientific
journal Nature which is published Thursday, challenging the
widespread theory of the dinosaur-bird links.
</P>
<P>
Hou Lianhai, a research fellow with the Institute of Vertebrate
Paleontology and Paleoanthropology under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), said that a new species of Confuciusornis, a
fossilized rare bird found in Beipiao County, northeast Liaoning
Province, has a well preserved skeleton with feathers and a horny
beak.
</P>
<P>
"The new specimen has a preserved and complete large
postorbital (bone situated behind the eye socket) that has a broad
contact with the cheek bone," Hou said in his article, co-authored
by Zhou Zhonghe from the same institute, Larry Martin from the
Natural History Museum and the Department of Systematics and
Ecology at University of Kansas, and Alan Feduccia with the
Department of Biology at University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
"These two bones form an arch dividing the upper and lower
temporal fenestrae, characteristic of archosaurian reptiles," Hou
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Hou said that this may confirm previous suggestions of a
postorbital in Archaeopteryx, the earliest bird known in the world.
</P>
<P>
Although being a primitive form of the modern bird,
Archaeopteryx and Confuciusornis, another earliest-known bird
which dates back 140 million years, were greatly different to the
modern bird.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide bird experts have used the only seven fossils of
Archaeopteryx found in Germany for research and lab experiments.
</P>
<P>
"Birds are sisters of dinosaurs rather than direct descendants
of them," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
"In Jurassic period," Hou said, "the ancient bird evolved into
various groups."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, scientists should look for bird's ancestors inside
much older layers.
</P>
<P>
Hou got his fame for his research on the world's first
Confuciusornis fossil and published an influential article in
Nature in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"We have yet to unravel the mystery of bird's origin," Hou said,
"but we provide the new proof for the truth."
</P>
<P>
A British scientist A. D. Walker wrote a letter to Hou and
supported his viewpoint with the similarity analysis between
Confuciusornis and sphenosuchus, a primitive reptile which was
found in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Interested in Opening Talks with Israel: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami is interested in opening secret talks with Israel, the
local daily Haaretz reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz said Khatami has suggested confidence-building steps to
break the current circle of distrust and suspicion between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted senior British government figures as saying
that Khatami has asked them to relay his message to Israel.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with the British representatives, Khatami
suggested the signing of arms control treaties between Iran and
Israel as a first step toward trust-building, Haaretz said.
</P>
<P>
The British sources said they believe the Iranians are acting
in good faith, and urged Israel to adopt a similar attitude, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Israel regards Iran's ability to develop long-range missiles
and non-conventional weapons as a long-term threat to its
security. But the British sources said the Iranian told them that
their arms build-up is not directed against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The sources praised the Iranian record on keeping commitments
to signed treaties, but criticized Israel for its unwillingness
to join the international community's major arms proliferation
treaties.
</P>
<P>
The report came amid tensions between Iran and Israel over
Iran's recent arrest of 13 Iranian Jews on charges of spying
for Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Israel has denied the Jews had spied for it and called for
their immediate release.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Control Drug Abuse in Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Drug Enforcement Commission
 (DEC) has pledged to control drug abuse in schools by the year
2000, Sunday Times of Zambia reported.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse among students and teachers was undermining the
government efforts to provide quality education, the newspaper
quoted DEC Commissioner Raphael Mungole as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mungole said the scourge was reducing the much needed human
resources in students to minimum levels. The pupils were the
future leaders who needed to be projected by all means.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the drug master-plan implementation
project in Kabwe, Central Province, Mungole said :"your major
goal and priority in the commission is to ensure that all schools
are in a drug free environment by the year 2001. DEC and other
government agencies need to be assisted by the community to
eradicate the drug scourge."
</P>
<P>
He warned that the commission would deal sternly with teachers
promoting or getting involved in drug abuse, saying that teachers
should instead help in fighting against abuse in schools.
</P>
<P>
It was sad that the government effort in providing resources to
improve the education standards in Zambia was being undermined by
drug abuse, he said.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse had ghastly reduced academic performance and was a
source of indiscipline in schools and in families. It also gave
rise to sexual harassment and illegal activities, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Central Province education official Barry Masaninga
said the DEC and other government agencies should target community
in awareness campaign because the drugs originated from the
community itself.
</P>
<P>
The fight against drug abuse would be rendered useless if it
only ended in learning institution, he said.

<HEADLINE> India to Provide Duty-free Access for Bangladeshi Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- India has agreed, in principle, to
provide duty-free access on a non-reciprocal basis for selected
export items of Bangladesh, visiting Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference before his departure for
New Delhi, Vajpayee said he had discussed with his Bangladeshi
counterpart Sheikh Hasina multi-faceted relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The commencement of the bus service between Calcutta, West
Bengal of India, and the Bangladeshi capital city of Dhaka on
Saturday "is only a small step symbolizing the closeness of our
people and the willingness to strengthen our friendship," said the
prime minister, who arrived here on Saturday to inaugurate the
first cross-border bus service between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides agreed to jointly work for strengthening
economic cooperation, and have taken several steps to address the
problem of increasing market access for Bangladesh exports to
India, including eliminating quantitative restrictions, deepening
concessions under the South Asian Preferential Trade Arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"We have accepted, in principle, the request for duty-free
access on a non-reciprocal basis to selected items of export
interest to Bangladesh," said Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
"But we need to recognize that the Bangladesh export basket is
limited at present, and needs to be augmented by the inclusion of
goods and services that are of interest to India," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also agreed to restore multi-modal
communication links, to facilitate the free movement of traffic
between India and Bangladesh, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that India has agreed to provide a credit of 2 billion
Rs. (doubt 50 million U.S. dollars) to be extended in three years,
under an agreement signed Sunday morning, "to enable supply of
transport equipment and capital goods which will upgrade the
infrastructure, in keeping with Bangladeshi priorities."
</P>
<P>
In her statement at the press conference, Hasina said, "We
opened our minds to each other and we covered bilateral, regional
and internal issues of interest to us. We are ready to take
further steps to consolidate our economic and commercial
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The bus service "will promote people-to-people contact... we
have agreed to pursue further areas of such cooperation," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, by signing on Sunday morning another
agreement between the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of
Commerce and Industries and the Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce and Industries, have set up the Bangladesh-India Joint
Chamber of Commerce, she added.

<P>
HARARE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Salary negotiations between the
Zimbabwean government and its employees reached a deadlock
Saturday with the government insisting that it can offer a cost of
living adjustment of only up to 10 percent, backdated to January
1999.
</P>
<P>
However, 140,000 civil servants who have been on strike since
Wednesday, had reduced their demand for a 20 percent adjustment to
12 percent, also backdated to January.
</P>
<P>
National Joint Negotiating Committee Chairman Ignatius
Chigwendere told the Zimbabwe News Agency that the two parties did
not want to budge from their positions.
</P>
<P>
That could mean that civil servants might continue with their
strike Monday, the agency reported Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The government workers argued that they had done enough to
reduce their demand from 20 percent to 12 percent, a figure far
from mitigating the 53 percent inflation rate.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Coach Blames Defeat to Bad Luck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAN JOSE, United States, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Swedish coach
Marika Lyfors Domanski said her team could have won the match if not
due to bad luck.
</P>
<P>
"We thought if we could score another before China scored its
second that we could win the match." Lyfors Domanski said.
</P>
<P>
"China is a very good team. To beat them, you need to have a
little bit of luck. We didn't have that today." Lyfors said.
</P>
<P>
Sweden took an early lead at the 2nd minute of the match through
Kristin Bengtsson. They also had several clear chances as Chinese
central defender Wen Lirong was badly off form and made a string of
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Bengtsson's goal marked the first time Sweden has scored against
China since the two teams played to a 1-1 tie at the quarterfinals of
the 1995 World Cup. China won that match through penalty shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish team played more defensively after Bengtsson's goal
and Lyfors argued:"It's natural to fall back and defend when you
score first in a game. We needed to push forward more."
</P>
<P>
The Swedish team next will play Australia at Washington. Lyfors
said:" Every game is a new game, and we'll be fit to fight for a win
in the next match. The next two matches are very important if we
hope to move out of group play. Today's loss will not effect our
strategy heading into the Australia game."
</P>
<P>
Lyfors said she was satisfied with her players' performance:" I
think today's match was important to our young players playing their
first World Cup. We now have to beat Australia."

<P>
SAN JOSE, United States, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese coach Ma
Yuanan was not satisfied with his team after the first match against
Sweden but promised better performance in the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
China fought from 0-1 down to win the match 2-1, their fourth
consecutive victory over Sweden since the 1995 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"It was our first game. In my opinion, my team didn't play very
freely for the World Cup game." said Ma Yuanan, "They didn't show
the spectators their 'all' performance or their 'all' level. I
think my team will play better and better in the future."
</P>
<P>
Ma said:" Our players played rushedly, they didn't keep
themselves very cool though we had many chances. I wish the team
will keep playing better and better."
</P>
<P>
"Every game in the future will be tough for us. We will play
our best," said Ma Yuanan, "Sweden scored the goal because we made a
mistake and we hope that we won't have this kind of mistake again in
the future."
</P>
<P>
China will move to Portland for their match against Ghana on
Monday and then will play their final group match against Australia
on June 24 at New York.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China came from a goal down to
beat Sweden 2-1 in its Group D opener of the Women's World Cup
soccer championship here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With two minutes into the game, Swedish Kristen Bengtsson, 29,
scored a swift goal by intercepting a Chinese pass before kicking
into the upper left corner of the net, which Chinese goalie Gao
Hong got her hand on it but slipped as the ball slid in.
</P>
<P>
This was the second-fastest goal in the Women's World Cup
history as Sweden scored in the first minute in 1991 against Japan.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Chinese quickly gained the momentum and Jin Yan
equalized 15 minutes later with a header from a corner kick off
Liu Ying.
</P>
<P>
After the Chinese squandered several chances, Swedish goalie
Ulrika Karlsson failed to stop Liu Ailing from netting a low, fast
shot into the middle of the net in the 68th minute.
</P>
<P>
In their earlier encounters, Sweden beat China 1-0 in the 1991
World Cup quarterfinals and China outscored Sweden 4-3 on the
penalty kicks in the 1995 World Cup quarterfinals.

NEW JERSEY, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Mia Hamm scored one goal and
assisted on another as the heavyly favored United States beat
Denmark 3-0 in Group A match that kicked off the 1999 Women's
World Cup here today.
</P>
<P>
Hamm, the most recognized player in women's soccer, scored in

Chastain.
</P>
<P>
Hamm Turned Denmark's Mikka Hansen inside the penalty area and
put the ball under the crossbar for her fifth goal in the World
Cup. It was Hamm's 110th career goal in 174 international
competition.
</P>
<P>
"The first half was a little rough," Hamm said. "We had a lot
of jitters. In the second half we started playing our style,
started possessing the ball."
</P>
<P>
The match was played at Giants Stadium in front of a sellout
crowd of 78,972, the largest attendance in women's soccer history.

the edge of the box.

"We just weathered the storm," Lilly said. "We were a bit
disoriented, but playing soccer got us back in track."
</P>
<P>
"We did a lot of good things today," said DiCicco. "When we got
the possession of the ball, we started to play more of our soccer.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Lack Three-Point Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 19 (Xinhua) -- New York Knicks' loss to San
Antonio Spurs mainly due to their poor outside shots and three-
pointers in the previous two NBA Finals games.
</P>
<P>
The best-of-seven series will see its third game here on Monday,
if the Knicks still cann't solve this problem, their fate is
doomed.
</P>
<P>
In the opening minute of Game 2, Larry Johnson hit a 3-point
basket for the Knicks. Encouraged by his success, Johnson tried
six more and didn't connect again.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks' 2-for-14 performance on 3's in Friday night's 80-67
loss to the Spurs followed a 2-for-8 showing in Game 1 of the
series and punctuated a disturbing but simple fact for the
struggling Knicks.
</P>
<P>
They don't have a legitimate long-ranging shooter.
</P>
<P>
Johnson assumed that role during the postseason, launching a
flurry of 3's including the one -- that with an added free throw --
became a 4-point game-winner in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference
finals against Indiana. He also hit consecutive 3's down the
stretch to help clinch New York's win in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
But right now, Johnson is concentrating just on getting up and
down the court on his sprained right knee. And his size is needed
for the heavy work under the basket, something the Knicks
desperately require against the Spurs' twin towers of Tim Duncan
and David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
John Starks was New York's designated 3-point specialist until
he was traded for Latrell Sprewell, returning from last season's
suspension. But Sprewell has not supplied the outside threat for
New York, saying that he has so far been unable to reconstruct
that part of his game following his layoff. He made only 21 of 77
attempts during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks sought to fill the perimeter void at the start of
the season by signing free agent Dennis Scott, one of the best 3-
point shooters in NBA history. But that marriage lasted only 15
games before Scott was cut from the team.
</P>
<P>
New York's best 3-point shooters during the regular season was
Allan Houston (53-for-149). For the season, New York made 208 of
589, a 35.3 percentage.
</P>
<P>
But with Patrick Ewing injured and Johnson Hobbling, Houston
has had to concentrate less on bombs-away basketball and more on
simply providing points with conventional shooting.
</P>
<P>
Warde and Childs were a combined 2-for-7 on 3-point tries in
the first two games of the Finals. By comparison, San Antonio's
Jaren Jackson buried New York with five 3's in the opening game
alone.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks's problem is complicated because points have come so
hard for coach Jeff Van Gundy's team, which has depended for so
long on Ewing to carry the bulk of the attack.
</P>
<P>
Without their franchise center, New York's roster is crowded
with players who have not been consistent scoring threats and aren
't changing right now.
</P>
<P>
In that situation, even the occasional 3-point shot can provide
an instant offense, sometimes a dagger in the heart of the other
team.
</P>
<P>
Right now, though, the weapon is missing for New York, posing
one more problem for the gang that can't seem to shoot sraight.

<HEADLINE> China Beat Sweden 2-1 in World Cup Group D Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAN JOSE, United States, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China overcame an
early scare to beat Sweden 2-1 in thte group d opener at the third
women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Kristin Bengtsson scored with a thundering right-footer only 2
minutes into the match after Chinese defender Wen Lirong made a
unforgivable mistake in the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Wen, one of the best Chinese defenders who was able to play in
the match after FIFA lifted a two-match suspension on her yesterday,
left Bengtsson unmarked in the penalty area and let the latter score
with ease.
</P>
<P>
It was the second quickest goal in the history of the women's
World Cup. The quickest goal was by Lene Videkull, also from
Sweden, in the match against Japan at the 1991 inaugural women's
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
But the early blow didn't beat the Chinese team. With better
technique, they played hard and gradually took control of the match.
Jin Yan hit in the equaliser at the 17th minute with a header while
veteran Liu Ailing scored the winner at the 69th minute.
</P>
<P>
Jin Yan could have scored her first hat-trick in World Cup. But
she squandered several chances, including heading high just two
meters in front of the goal.
</P>
<P>
Liu Ailing, who also took part in the previous two World Cup
tournaments, is much experienced than Jin Yan. She had only one
scoring chance throughout the match and never let it slip away.
</P>
<P>
"I surprised myself. I didn't expect to score the goal," said
Liu Ailing, "Everything was just messing around and the ball was
right next to me so I just kicked it."
</P>
<P>
The shot caught Swedish goal-keeper Ulrika Karlsson totally off
guard. But it was not her fault. Actually, the shot was so sudden
that Liu's teammates also needed a short period of time to realize it.
</P>
<P>
This is China's fourth consecutive victory over Sweden since the
1995 World Cup in which China beat Sweden in the quarterfinals
through penalty shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
The victory also put China on top of group d which also includes
Australia and Ghana.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming Mercosur-EU
summit, to be held here at the end of the month, will open the
doors to a bi-regional agreement, a high-ranking Brazilian
diplomat said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Jose Alfredo Graza Lima, General Undersecretary for
Integration, Economic and Foreign Trade Affairs, said both the
Southern American Common Market (Mercosur) and the European Union
(EU) are willing to concede in their demands to facilitate an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Mercosur countries would like to wait until
the year 2003 to discuss the agriculture issues in the trade talks
with the European bloc if the latter would commit itself to
conclude its negotiations with the Latin American countries in
2005.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators of the two blocs will try hard to hammer out a
concrete commercial accord at the summit of the EU, Latin America
and the Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
Among the barriers facing negotiators, agriculture is a thorn
issue, on which the European group has insisted on beginning talks
in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 15 EU counties agreed to establish the world's
largest free trade area with Latin American countries.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A new 800-meter street in
downtown Shanghai is lined with old-time teahouses, restaurants,
studios, curio shops, banks and shops which rekindle feelings of
the old city in the early years of this century.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest metropolis and industrial center,
opened "Old Shanghai Street " to tourists Friday as part of an
extensive effort to promote the local tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Michael Zargarov, an American tourist, said the street is just
the way he imagined. "It's truly incredible," said Zargarov.
</P>
<P>
Old Shanghai Street, formerly known as Miaoqian St., was a
bustling shopping area, according to Sun Weiguo, director of the
Nanshi District Government.
</P>
<P>
The district allocated 40 million yuan (4.82 million US dollars)
to rebuild the old commercial center.
</P>
<P>
The street is divided into two sections -- the eastern section
which is based on the style of old Shanghai in the early years of
this century and the western section which features architectural
styles characteristic of the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911).

<HEADLINE> Myanmar-Singapore Bilateral Trade Slightly Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar-Singapore bilateral trade
amounted to 109.51 million U.S. dollars in the first two months of
this year, slightly falling by 3.7 percent over the 113.76 million
dollars registered in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures published by the country's
Central Statistical Organization, Myanmar's import from Singapore
during the two-month period stood at 95.29 million dollars, making
not much difference from the 95.71 million dollars recorded in the
corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Myanmar's export to Singapore during the period fell
to 14.22 million dollars from 18.05 million dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that the balance of trade in the period
was considerably in favor of Singapore since Singapore's export to
Myanmar accounted for 87 percent of the total bilateral trade,
while its import from Myanmar represented just a low percentage of
13.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in 1998, Myanmar and
Singapore had a bilateral trade volume of 992.3 million dollars,
in which Singapore's export to Myanmar accounted for 88.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, which had the highest bilateral trade volume with
Myanmar, stood first in Myanmar's foreign trade in the year,
followed by Thailand (441.4 million dollars), Japan (389 million
dollars) and China (381.1 million dollars).

SAN JOSE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China came from a goal down to
beat Sweden 2-0 in its Group D opener of the Women's World Cup
soccer championship here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With two minutes into the game, Swedish Kristen Bengtsson, 29,
scored a swift goal by intercepting a Chinese pass before kicking
into the upper left corner of the net, which Chinese goalie Gao
Hong got her hand on it but slipped as the ball slid in.
</P>
<P>
This was the second-fastest goal in the Women's World Cup
history as Sweden scored in the first minute in 1991 against Japan.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Chinese quickly gained the momentum and Jin Yan
equalized 15 minutes later with a header from a corner kick off
Liu Ying.
</P>
<P>
After the Chinese squandered several chances, Swedish goalie
Ulrika Karlsson failed to stop Liu Ailing from netting a low, fast
shot into the middle of the net in the 68th minute.
</P>
<P>
In their earlier encounters, Sweden beat China 1-0 in the 1991

<HEADLINE> China Restricts Rare Earth Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China encourages foreign
investment to flow into the application and deep processing fields
of rare earth, while restricting the mining and smelting of it,
the Business Weekly reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government suspended the mining of rare earth.
However, Chen Mingqin, an official with the China Rare Earth
Industry Association, said this will not affect the foreign
investment environment nor damage the supply capacity in this
field.
</P>
<P>
The report said official sources indicated that the sliding
prices on the domestic and international markets had made foreign
investors lose interest in the mining and smelting of rare earth.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the current production capacity across the
country could satisfy the demand both on the domestic market and
for exports, Chen said, adding that the growth of production would
surpass that of consumption in China.
</P>
<P>
According to industry statistics, global consumption totaled 65,
000 tons last year while China's output reached 60,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
China exported 44,000 tons of rare earth last year, accounting
for 70 percent of the world's total consumption. The domestic
market consumed about 15,000 tons, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said rare earth, as a material used in many industries and
new high-tech fields especially, had great market potential.

WUHAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, capital of central China's
Hubei Province, recently announced a decision to allocate one
million yuan (120,000 US dollars) in fiscal funding to assist new
Ph.D. holders employed by government institutions and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Related individuals recruited by government agencies or
enterprises will qualify for monthly government stipends of 1,000-
2,000 yuan over a period of three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
A local government official noted that the stipends sound
somewhat low, but will nonetheless serve as a catalyst to attract
more professionals. However, he said the city plans to adopt other
preferential policies in the future.

Wuhan, a major city in central China, is home to more than 30
institutes of higher education and a number of key national

However, when compared to coastal cities, economic limitations

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- German men athletes took the lead
after the first day of the European Cup while the Russian women
dominated their events on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Oliver-Sven Buder won the shot put with a throw of 20.53 meters
while Martin Buss took the high jump by clearing 2.34 meters, both
awarded the maximum eight points for Germany.
</P>
<P>
Their teammates also garnered solid results to give the German
team 52 points, ahead of Italy with 48.5 and Britain with 45.
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise saw the Russian team in seventh place with
34 points, and facing relegation from the European Cup for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
But in the women's event, the Russian team that has won the
last two European Cup events ended the first day in the lead.
</P>
<P>
Natalya Tsyganova and Natalya Sadova led the way, chalking up
eight points each with wins.
</P>
<P>
In the 800-meter event, Tsyganova clocked the fastest time of
one minute 58.18 seconds, beating off a challenge from Helena
Fuchsova of the Czech Republic, and Sadova won the discuss with a
throw of 66.84 meters.
</P>
<P>
European 100-meter record holder, local favorite Christine
Arron cruised to a win in the 100 meters with a time of 10.97
seconds.
</P>
<P>
The European Cup has been in steady decline since it was made
an annual event in 1993, and this year's competition was hit by
the absence of many top athletes.
</P>
<P>
Britain's men fielded a weakened team to defend the title it
won in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Javelin thrower Steve Backley was injured and hurdler Colin
Jackson preferred to attend a friend's wedding than make the trip
to Paris.

WUHAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China and Germany recently announced
plans to carry out a five-year cooperation project designed to
reform and develop small- and medium-sized non-state-owned Chinese
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The project goal is to improve development polices for related

technological information, financial consulting and professional
training.
</P>
<P>
Long Congxuan, an official with the China Small-and Medium-
Sized Firms Association for International Cooperation, said the
five-year project will help to accelerate the development of the
nation's private enterprises and construction of the economic
marketing system.
</P>
<P>
Central China's Hubei Province, east China's Anhui Province and
Beijing, the Chinese capital, will take the lead in implementing
the project.
</P>
<P>

<P>
NEW YORK, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champions United States
overpowered Denmark 3-0 in the Group A opener of the third World
Cup women's soccer championship at the Giant Stadium, New Jersey
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In front of a packed-crowd of 78,970 home fans, Mia Hamm, the
all-time international goal leader, opened the scoring for the
host team in the 17th minute with a left-foot-drive after she
received a pass from Brandi Chastain. It was her 110th goal in 174
international games, a new world record.
</P>
<P>
Janne Rasmussen of Denmark, who left the field due to injury,
got the sole yellow card of the game in the 11th minute.
</P>
<P>
In the 73rd minute, Hamm sent a pass into the penalty box where
Julie Foudi stayed and the striker made it 2-0 for the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
One minute from the time, Kristine Lilly got a pass 10 meters
from the goal and shot in a far left corner ball with her left
foot.
</P>
<P>
The Danish team could hardly organize any threatening attack to
the U.S. goal, however, Lise Sondergaard did had a golden chance
to score in the final minute when she faced American goal keeper
Briana Scurry to beat. But the Dane shot the 3-meter ball right
into Scurry's chest.
</P>
<P>
The Americans looked a bit nervous in the opening 10 minutes
but after then they dominated the game completely. The game saw
the U.S. team outshoot its rival 15 to 8, and led the corner kicks
6 to 2.

forests and promote eco-tourism.

<HEADLINE> G-8 Adopts Charter on Lifelong Learning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, Germany, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Eight (G-8)
countries Saturday in Cologne adopted a charter on lifelong
learning and education, saying those will be key tools in
encouraging worldwide mobility.
</P>
<P>
"The next century will be defined by flexibility and change,
more than ever there will be a demand for mobility," said the
charter.
</P>
<P>
"Today a passport and a ticket allow people to travel anywhere
in the world. In the future, the passport to mobility will be
education and lifelong learning," the G-8 leaders stressed in the
charter.
</P>
<P>
"This passport to mobility must be offered to everyone," they
said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United
States, Canada, Japan and Russia promised a renewed commitment to
investing in education and training at all levels and said efforts
must also be made by the private sector and individuals.
</P>
<P>
"The rewards for investing in people have never been greater
and the need for it has never been pressing," the charter said.
"It is the key to employment, economic growth and the reduction of
social and regional inequality."
</P>
<P>
The G-8 leaders emphasized that promoting the study of foreign
languages was needed to "increase the understanding of different
cultures and enhance mobility in a globalized world".
</P>
<P>
They also identified high-quality primary education, vocational
training and adult skill acquisition as some of the essential
elements of lifelong learning.
