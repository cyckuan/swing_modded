KINGS HOPE GOOD THINGS ARE IN STORR

   LOS ANGELES _ Ten games into the Los Angeles Kings season, Jamie
Storr has played one period.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Andy Murray didn't plan it that way, but goalie Stephane
Fiset has played well and Storr has had to wait his turn.
</P>
<P>
   Storr, who will start tonight against Washington at the Staples
Center, saw his only action in an Oct. 7 victory against Tampa Bay,
when he left with a strained right groin. Doctors later found the
pain was caused by an inflammation in his right hip. He missed 16
games last season with a strained left groin.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty days and many workouts later Storr, is back, anxious to
resume his competition with Fiset as the Kings' No. 1 goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand we need to go with the hot goalie,'' Storr said.
``If I hadn't left that game, I might have played the next six. But
I realize that we are in this together and to win we have to
sacrifice for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   As the rest of the team met for more than an hour Monday at
Iceoplex, Storr worked out with goaltender consultant Don Edwards.
Storr now is pain free, but as the meeting inside dragged on, he
was wondering when he might get a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with not playing is that all you see are practice
shots,'' Edwards said. ``That can create bad habits. My job is to
make sure Jamie maintains good mechanics. He showed them today and
that will help him get back in the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been with the organization since 1994, Storr is
only 23 and was considered a rookie last year when he played in 28
games. Although he was sidelined with the groin problem, he posted
a 2.40 goals-against average, lowest on the Kings since Gary
Edwards in 1974-75.
</P>
<P>
   He had four shutouts and was named to the NHL's All-Rookie team.
</P>
<P>
   After the injury almost three weeks ago, Storr stayed out of
several games as a precaution. He originally was scheduled to play
Sunday against San Jose, but when the Kings played poorly against
Phoenix two days earlier, Murray elected to stay with Fiset as a
confidence boost.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said Monday he doesn't like to announce his goaltenders
too far in advance. He also doesn't like to label one the starter
and the other the backup. He said production will dictate playing
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to Jamie a lot during his time off and explained what
we are trying to do,'' Murray said. ``For a young player, he was
very patient and I appreciate that. Believe me, this is a long
season. There will be plenty of opportunities for everyone to
contribute.''

TURNING 52, MRS. CLINTON FEELS LIKE RAISING A MILLION, AND DOES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With skits, songs and a fair amount of bashing of
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a lineup of Broadway stars celebrated
Hillary Rodham Clinton's 52nd birthday on Monday night with a mix
of politics and entertainment that helped her raise close to $1
million for her expected campaign for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and President Clinton took their 10th-row aisle
seats at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts in Times Square at
7:45 p.m. _ 45 minutes late _ and the curtain immediately rose to
reveal an actress, Christine Pedi, dressed in a blond wig and a
black pantsuit, singing ``I'll Take Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the audience, who had paid up to $1,000 for a seat,
howled with laughter upon realizing that Ms. Pedi was impersonating
Mrs. Clinton plaintively presenting herself as a newfound New
Yorker. And they cheered when a dancing line of cast members from
``Chicago,'' dressed in blue-and-white Yankee jerseys and caps,
joined her in a slightly altered version of the old chestnut of
political events (and Yankee games), ``New York, New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These Washington blues, are melting away,'' the faux Mrs.
Clinton sang. ``If she can make it there, she'll make it
anywhere,'' the chorus line echoed. ``Come on, come through, New
York, New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening act at Monday night's Broadway salute set the tone
for a comical, if clearly, pointed night. The first lady laughed
along with the audience at the obvious parody of her attempt to
portray herself as a Yankee fan by plunking a Yankee cap on her
head at a White House ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell was the host, and from the outset, she made it
clear that if Mrs. Clinton was the honoree of the night, Giuliani,
the first lady's expected Republican opponent, was the target.
``The cast of `Smokey Joe's Cafe' wanted to be here tonight, but
the mayor had them arrested outside for loitering,'' Ms. O'Donnell
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Joel Grey reprised one of the more famous songs from
``Cabaret,'' ``If You Could See Her,'' but with a slight change in
its chilling last line made at the expense of Mrs. Clinton's likely
Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can see her through my eyes,'' Grey sang, dancing again
with an actor in a floppy outsize gorilla suit, ``she wouldn't look
Giuliani at all.'' In the original song, Grey sang, ``she wouldn't
look Jewish at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for most of the night, the stage was reserved for praise
for the first lady, from Ms. O'Donnell to Lauren Bacall to,
finally, the president himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all just relax while I get used to my new role,'' Clinton
said, after the retiring president escorted the aspiring senator
onto the stage. And then, lowering his voice to almost a whisper,
he suggested some regret that his wife had been obligated to delay
her own career in public service in deference to his.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best gift I can give the American people now,'' he said,
``is to do my best to make sure that they know that the person I
love most in the world is without any doubt the ablest, most
passionate, most committed, most visionary public servant I have
ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his wife then embraced for nearly 20 seconds as the
audience rose in sustained applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she said, momentarily speechless, as she finally took
the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about this upcoming campaign,'' she told the
crowd. ``In the weeks and months ahead, I will continue to go
everywhere I can throughout this state. I know I still have a lot
to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's event was notable because it was one of the few
times that Clinton has campaigned with the first lady since she
began her exploratory effort. Although some Democrats have
expressed concern that Clinton might, in the waning days of his
presidency, become a drag on his wife's campaign, aides to the
first lady said they welcomed his help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is an asset,'' said Howard Wolfson, her
spokesman. ``He carried counties in the state that no Democrat has
carried in a generation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The evening started with a reception at the Supper Club and
ended with a private dinner for big donors at the Russian Tea Room.
</P>
<P>
   There were empty seats scattered through the theater on Monday
night, though Mrs. Clinton's aides described the event as sold out.
The audience heard a diverse group of entertainers, including Mia
Farrow, who read from Mrs. Clinton's book, ``It Takes a Village,''
Alec Baldwin, James Naughton, Bebe Neuwirth, Chita Rivera, members
of the cast of ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' and the Gay Men's Chorus.
</P>
<P>
   At thf the night, a curtain raised again, this time to
reveal the assembled cast, who sang ``Happy Birthday'' to the first
lady, and a four-foot-high-birthday cake.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's day of raising campaign funds came as Giuliani
showed signs of spending some of his own on his likely campaign.
His aides began making inquiries about purchasing television time
statewide in late November. That would mark an extraordinarily
early start for advertising in the Senate campaign, though it would
be in keeping with the early pace of this race.

CLINTON SIGNS ONE SPENDING BILL BUT VETOES ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to insert additional Clinton quote as new 10th graf, bgng
``Now the...) (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton signed into law a $268-billion
spending bill for the Pentagon on Monday, avoiding the risk of a
split among Democrats at the very moment that the parties are
speeding toward the end of their budget battle. At the same time,
he vetoed a separate spending bill for some other federal agencies,
assailing Republicans for making ``wrong choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed the Pentagon spending bill in part out of doubt
that Democrats could sustain a veto. The Pentagon bill was popular
and had originally passed the House by an overwhelming vote of
372-55.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, had pledged
to fight vigorously to deliver the 146 Democratic votes needed to
sustain a veto. But other senior Democrats had expressed
reservations about a veto that could make them vulnerable to attack
on national security and were threatening to vote with the
Republicans against a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Signing the bill also allows Clinton and the Democrats to focus
attention on issues they are comfortable with _ such as education,
police and the environment _ rather than getting into a dispute
over national security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Monday said that he could have prevailed on a veto
but that ``it would have been a close call.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes 13 annual spending bills to put the budget in place;
the president and Republicans are now struggling over five of the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Clinton signed the military spending package, his
remarks about the Pentagon bill were decidedly mixed. The president
criticized it for including budgetary gimmicks and pork-barrel
projects. But he said he had concluded that it contained crucial
elements, such as a 4.8 percent pay raise for the military. ``I
cannot allow our national security needs to be held hostage to this
budget battle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has struck a particularly combative tone over plans by
the Republican leaders in Congress to attach an across-the-board
spending cut, of up to 1.4 percent, to the year's final spending
bill. The move is a last effort by Republicans to put in place a
budget that does not touch Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The president contended that the across-the-board cut would lead
to layoffs in the military and harm education and environmental
programs, a charge that Republicans deny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the American people sent us here to make tough choices,
but these are the wrong choices,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not allow Congress to raise its own pay and fund its
pork-barrel projects and still make devastating cuts in everything
from education to child nutrition to the FBI,'' he said, in
announcing that he had signed the Pentagon bill but vetoed a
measure funding the Commerce, State and Justice Departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not sign any budget that puts special interests above
the national interest,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The president's balancing act set the framework for the endgame
of the year's budget struggle, a fight whose outcome both parties
believe is likely to significantly influence the course of the
congressional elections in 2000, particularly in the narrowly
divided House.
</P>
<P>
   The final showdown could come as early as Friday, with the
expiration of legislation that temporarily has kept the government
running through the first weeks of the 2000 federal fiscal year
that began Oct. 1. Clinton said on Monday that he would sign
another stopgap bill to keep government operations running, but he
asked that Republican show good faith in negotiating a final deal.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders praised Clinton and tried to set him
apart from the House Democrats led by Gephardt , whom they accused
of wanting partisan confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has rejected the gridlock strategy of Dick
Gephardt,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip.
Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said he
thought the president's action would make it ``that much easier''
to negotiate a compromise on the budget.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the president's decision to sign the Pentagon bill gave
the Republicans something they had wanted: a fight over a limited
number of bills, which scaled back the possibility that Clinton
could score big wins in negotiations over an omnibus spending
package, as has happened in his past confrontations with the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is a $35 billion bill to pay for the Commerce,
Justice and State Departments, which the president vetoed on
Monday. He faulted the measure because it failed to provide money
for his goal of creating 50,000 new community police officers and
because it did not provide for dues and arrears to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   While the Democrats have traditionally protected Social
Security, the Republicans this year have pledged that they will cut
spending without following the tradition in Congress of using some
of the Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, they have to hold spending on the 13 bills to $592
billion. They say they will meet their goal with the
across-the-board spending cut. Republican leaders had announced
Friday the cut would be 1.4 percent, but key senators want it to be
smaller, and it was still being worked on on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans dismissed Clinton's assertion that the across-the
board reduction would mean cuts in programs and said they were
still increasing spending in some key education areas. ``That's
just demagoguery,'' DeLay said. ``It's about waste. You don't think
we can find enough waste in this place to find one percent?''

NBC'S GRAY DEFENDS TACTICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Gray, whom NBC continues to value as a reporter even though
he has made a career out of doing nothing more than act as an
awkward twit with a microphone, basically did the same thing Monday
that Pete Rose did to him the night before.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't admit he was sorry, because he didn't think he did
anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   How ironic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can all go back and `woulda, coulda, shoulda,' but
basically I think my approach was the way to go and I don't
apologize for it,'' Gray told writers on a conference call set up
by NBC in response to the mostly harsh criticism directed at him
for the live sparring session he had with Rose after the
All-Century team celebration Sunday night in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For those who didn't catch it: Gray, usually assigned by the
network to stand in front of a coach, athlete or injured mascot and
allow him or her to embellish on the emotions of the moment,
decided to try to do a 30-minute interview in a 2{-minute time
frame.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Gray asked Rose five different ways if he wanted to ``make
contrition'' for his alleged gambling on baseball 10 years ago that
led to a lifetime ban. Rose didn't feel like going to confession.
Then repeatedly, and probably to his detriment, he continued to
deny he did anything wrong and began counterprodding Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Rose finally ended it by telling Gray he was ``surprised you're
bombarding me with . . . something that happened 10 years ago'' and
said this was ``a prosecutor's brief, not an interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Given a chance Monday to respond to the interview backlash, Gray
contended that his ego did not get in the way of the moment, nor
was he trying to agitate the all-time hits leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no agenda against Pete Rose,'' said Gray, who admits to
having interviewed him as many as 50 times without incident. ``I
was simply asking questions. Pete was the one who took exception
and started asking me to respond to his questions. And if I let
that go, all of you (writers) would have had me on this call for a
much different reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, probably to thank you. For allowing an old story to rest.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a time and place for that line of questioning,
neither were appropriate Sunday night as the All-Century team was
leaving the field and the second game of the World Series was about
to begin.
</P>
<P>
   This was easy: Just grab Rose for a reaction to the crowd.
Instead, he put on his Roy Firestone costume and started hosting
``Up Close with Jim Gray.'' If Gray expected Rose to suddenly see
the light _ maybe even cry _ he was sorely mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he might have a change of heart,'' Gray said
naively.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Rose obviously wouldn't, why didn't he go in another
direction with the questions?
</P>
<P>
   ``We deal with limited time,'' Gray explained. ``Who knows how
he might have answered that, but I had to use my judgment to get to
some of the heart of the issues. Asking him how he felt to stand
next to Brooks Robinson didn't seem like a useful portion of the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The response from baseball and its fans to the interview has
been strangely mixed. John Dowd, the Washington lawyer hired to
investigate Rose's reported gambling, told the Associated Press
that he thought Gray ``had more guts than any guy I've ever seen,''
while former baseball commissioner Fay Vincent said ``Gray really
knows the story, he knows the evidence is all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, however, hundreds of viewers phoned NBC's
switchboard to complain about Gray's interrogating ways. Monday, a
reporter told Gray that someone had put up an Internet Web site
calling for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who hasn't realized he was used a pawn to spite the L.A.
media about 10 years ago when then-Rams All-Pro Eric Dickerson gave
the no-name dweeb the ``scoop'' that he'd been traded to
Indianapolis, said he doesn't feel used in this case.
</P>
<P>
   After 45 minutes of a conference call with writers in which he
took long pauses before answering questions put to him, Gray said
he just felt strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, look, it's a shame it came out this way, no question
about it,'' said Gray. ``It wasn't a satisfying feeling to walk
away from that. But Pete had the opportunity to at least open the
door further to get reinstated or at least have more dialogue with
the commissioner, and he went about it by saying everything that he
has over the past 10 years, which isn't going to get him close.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intent was to give him the opportunity, and it was provided
on a silver platter three or four times. I think Pete ruined his
own evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably. But it might not have been so bad had Gray just did
his usual mundane job and stop the delusional thinking that he is
journalist.

COLORADO SCOUT JOINS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jeff Schugel, who spent the last seven seasons
with the Colorado Rockies, joined the Los Angeles Dodgers' front
office as special assistant to the general manager, Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Schugel's chief duties will be in professional and amateur
scouting, which will include scouting overseas and conducting
special assignments for Malone. With the Rockies, Schugel was
involved in all aspects of scouting. He served the last two years
as Colorado's director of professional and international scouting.
</P>
<P>
   He takes the place of Jack Zduriencik, who joined the Dodgers
last October. Zduriencik, who was the Dodgers' director of
international scouting, was named director of scouting by the
Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dodgers' continue to keep quiet about the future
of the coaching staff. A report out of Boston said the Dodgers were
interested in Boston Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, who was
Malone's pitching coach when the two were in Montreal. But Kerrigan
said he hasn't spoken with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan's contract expired Oct. 17, but he talked with Red Sox
general manager Dan Duquette recently about returning next season.
Also, Kerrigan is scheduled to meet in New York today with
Cleveland officials regarding the Indians' coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have not announced what will happen with the
coaching staff. So far, there have been reports of Malone wanting
to contact pitching coaches, but Claude Osteen remains the pitching
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Also, bullpen catcher Rick Dempsey interviewed for Baltimore's
vacant managerial spot last week, but sources said he isn't one of
the top candidates. Malone isn't expected to make an announcement
on the coaching staff until after the World Series. &QL;

EDITORIAL: ARGENTINA AFTER MENEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 26:
</P>
<P>
   Argentine voters have clearly wearied of the flamboyant style of
President Carlos Saul Menem, who rode the old populist party of
Juan Domingo Peron to power in 1989 and has held office ever since.
On Sunday they resoundingly elected Fernando de la Rua, the
decidedly uncharismatic, non-Peronist mayor of Buenos Aires, to
succeed Menem after his second term ends in December.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a more positive aspect of Menem's legacy was evident in the
campaign and voting, which were notable for their democratic
ordinariness in a country where presidential transitions have
typically been accompanied by calls to class warfare and rumblings
of military revolt. During his two terms, Menem successfully weaned
the military of its addiction to coups, completed Peronism's
evolution from a demagogic movement to a responsible political
party, and returned Argentina to the mainstream of international
affairs after decades of protectionism and reflexive opposition to
Washington and much of the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Menem's achievements stemmed from his unexpected
decision early in his first term to embrace free trade and monetary
orthodoxy. Until then, Argentine democracy was chronically weakened
by frequent bouts of hyperinflation that sometimes provided the
excuse for military intervention. But the Menem years were also
marred by charges of judicial manipulation and corruption. For many
years, human rights issues stemming from the ``dirty war'' of the
1970s and early 1980s were shoved aside until public opinion forced
the government to re-examine cases of military kidnapping, torture
and murder.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout all this, Menem retained much of his personal
popularity. But the Argentine constitution prevented him from
running this year. The Peronists ran a candidate, Eduardo Duhalde,
who seemed to portend a continuation of the past decade's cronyism
without its reforms. The voters preferred de la Rua, who promised
to halt corruption and end the impunity of the politically well
connected from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   That will be his biggest challenge, and it will not be easy. De
la Rua will have to work with Menem-era judges and a
Peronist-dominated Senate. What he will most likely not have to
worry about is military plotting or an opposition that does not
respect democracy's ground rules. For that, Menem deserves much of
the credit. &QL;

EDITORIAL: DECEPTIVE ATTACKS ON A DRUG BENEFIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 26:
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry is staging a misleading advertising
campaign against President Clinton's new Medicare drug benefit
proposal. Its new ads are trying to raise groundless fears that
government is going to take over everyone's medicine cabinet, which
is far from what the Clinton proposal would actually do.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton plan, unveiled in June as part of a comprehensive
Medicare reform package, would not set government prices or
restrict access to medically needed drugs. It is a very limited
benefit that is completely optional for Medicare beneficiaries.
Those who are satisfied with their current coverage need not change
at all. But at least a third of Medicare beneficiaries now have no
drug coverage and desperately need help to pay those costs.
</P>
<P>
   The industry says it supports the concept of drug benefits for
the elderly through the private sector, but is concerned that any
major governmental move into this area might lead to future price
controls that could cut into profits and reduce investments in
research on new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Clinton proposal, the government would pay half the
cost of prescription drugs for an enrollee, with a maximum benefit
of $1,000 in 2002 rising to $2,500 in 2008. The premium for this
benefit would start at $24 a month, gradually rising to $44. The
government would subsidize the premium charge for low-income
beneficiaries. The tight benefit cap would not be enough to cover
catastrophically high drug costs, but by keeping the premiums
affordable, the plan can attract healthy people into the pool so
they can help share the cost burden of those who are sick.
</P>
<P>
   The plan can also help enrollees get lower drug prices by using
private pharmacy benefit managers to deal with drug manufacturers
on prices. Large private health plans commonly use such managers to
negotiate volume discounts. The Clinton plan would also give
employers who pay for retiree health benefits a partial subsidy for
drug benefits to encourage them to retain those benefits. The plan
falls short of providing complete drug coverage, but it is an
important step toward making access to drugs more affordable for 13
million Medicare beneficiaries who have no drug coverage now.

COMMENTARY: THE STORY OF K  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct spelling of name throughout from Kiaraldeen to
Kiareldeen.)  By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Credit to the commissioner of immigration, Doris
Meissner, for a difficult and important decision. She has ended the
long effort to deport an alien on the basis of secret evidence,
declining to seek further review of court rulings against her
agency, the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The alien is Hany Kiareldeen, a 31-year-old Palestinian who has
lived in the United States since 1990 and is married to a U.S.
citizen. His case has become a symbol of a practice that critics
liken to the treatment of Joseph K. in Franz Kafka's ``The Trial'':
imprisonment without knowing the reasons.
</P>
<P>
   It is bedrock American belief that nothing like that can happen
here. No one can be held in prison for years without knowing
exactly what the accusations are, without having a chance to
confront his accusers.
</P>
<P>
   But it does happen here. The Immigration and Naturalization
Service over the last several years has acted to expel about two
dozen aliens from this country on the basis of evidence that they
were not allowed to see. Many of them were, and are, imprisoned
while trying to fight the phantom of secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen was detained by the INS in March 1998 and has been in
a county jail in New Jersey ever since. The INS accused him of
having connections to terrorists, including one involved in the
1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. But it would not tell him
or his lawyers the basis for that charge.
</P>
<P>
   The INS presented classified material in secret to an
immigration judge, Daniel Meisner. All that Kiareldeen was given
was ``summaries'' identifying no sources. No witnesses were called
to testify, so none could be cross-examined.
</P>
<P>
   Meisner, having read the secret material, concluded that an
evaluation of it ``by a person of ordinary prudence and caution
cannot sustain a finding that [Kiareldeen) has engaged in terrorist
activity.'' When the INS appealed, two separate three-judge panels
of the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the INS lost again. Kiareldeen's lawyers had gone to a
federal court to seek his release on a writ of habeas corpus. Judge
William H. Walls of New Jersey, granting the writ, said it was an
unconstitutional denial of due process of law to use secret
evidence against him _ to make him battle ``anonymous slurs of
unseen and unsworn informers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration Service at first indicated that it would not
give up. It secured stays that kept Kiareldeen in prison at least
temporarily. There was talk that Ms. Meissner would take the
extraordinary step of asking Attorney General Janet Reno to call in
the Board of Immigration Appeals decision for further review.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night Ms. Meissner decided not to refer the case to
the attorney general _ and the Justice Department concurred in her
decision. Aides said Ms. Meissner felt that the case had gone
through a rigorous administrative process and that the INS had thus
met its obligation to national security.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was said, the rebuttal evidence presented by
Kiareldeen's lawyers had overcome the secret material presented by
the INS to the courts. In a way that emphasizes the danger of
secrecy in the legal process. It was only because Kiareldeen's
lawyers were able to get a partial sense of what was involved that
they were able to reply effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate result is that Kiareldeen will be released from
prison. Under the BIA decision he will be eligible now to become a
legal permanent resident of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner's action is a welcome break in a dogged insistence
by the INS on pressing for deportation in secret evidence cases
despite adverse court decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser Ahmed, another person of Arab origin (as almost all those
involved in these cases are), has been in INS detention for three
and a half years. An immigration judge first decided against him on
the basis of secret evidence. Then, when a habeas corpus petition
challenged his detention, the INS gave his lawyers a somewhat
fuller summary of the material, they put on a case, and the judge
changed his mind. The INS appealed, and Ahmed remains in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia compared an accused alien to
Joseph K. in ``The Trial.'' He had to prove that he was not a
terrorist without knowing the evidence against him, Ginsburg said:
``It is difficult to imagine how even someone innocent of all
wrongdoing could meet such a burden.''

SPRINGFIELD ACQUAINTANCES MOURN PAYNE STEWART'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY and OSCAR AVILA  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD _ At the Bill &AMP; Payne Stewart Municipal Golf Course
on Monday, employees were silent.
</P>
<P>
   They let their actions speak for their sense of loss. They
lowered the American flag in front of the clubhouse to half staff
to show their respect to a local legend lost young, a legend whose
name will stay in bright orange and black on the golf course sign.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kuhn, a senior at Southwest Missouri State University, was
on the course Monday afternoon, remembering so well the day he met
Stewart this year.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart had come back to Springfield and was giving a clinic for
not-so-experienced, not-so-good golfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like 100 degrees out here,'' Kuhn said, ``but he was
out hitting whatever shot people called out for him to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Vinson, also of Springfield, couldn't fathom what she had
heard Monday, that Stewart had died in such a mysterious crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't seem believable. He had just reached the top of
his game. It just didn't seem possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Working the cash register of the Texaco service station within
view of the course, Vinson recalled the time she met Stewart there
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She was a high school golfer then, and her Hillcrest High School
girls golf team had made the state tournament for the first time.
She and the other girls saw the course pro in his office talking to
someone. It was a new face, one they didn't recognize at first.
</P>
<P>
   But then they realized it was the hometown hero, Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just in awe,'' Vinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other people in Springfield, Vinson was happy this summer
when Stewart came back to this Ozarks town after his second U.S.
Open victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't get near the course,'' she said. ``There was a
sense of pride that a local got that far.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was a 1975 graduate of Greenwood Laboratory School, a
prestigious institution known more for its academics than
athletics. Stewart was a natural athlete, who excelled in
basketball and football as well as golf.
</P>
<P>
   People at the tight-knit school _ each class contained about 30
students _ were stunned to hear of the famous alumnus's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in disbelief today,'' director Gerald Moseman said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart donated money to build a golf trophy case near the
gymnasium. His honors, naturally, filled much of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a quarter-century removed from high school, Stewart still
stayed connected to Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Bee Payne-Stewart, said Monday her son was looking
forward to coming home for Thanksgiving next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved his golf game, but the family always came first,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's mother said he often called to get updates on how the
leaves were changing colors and how the flowers were blooming.
Living in Florida, he missed the spectacular changes in Missouri's
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said that he lived in Orlando but that Springfield
was his home,'' Stewart's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds mourned Stewart's death at the Missouri Sports Hall of
Fame in Springfield. The hall displays some of Stewart's golf
clubs, bags and distinctive clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was part of the 1993 inaugural induction class with such
legends as George Brett, Len Dawson and Frank White.
</P>
<P>
   Jerald Andrews, the Hall of Fame's president, said Stewart
ranked among the titans of Missouri golf: Horton Smith, Tom Watson
and Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart never failed to support golf in Missouri, including a
Nike tour stop in Springfield. Organizers were looking forward to
him playing in a Senior Tour event in Kansas City when he turned
50.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart cared about more than golf.
</P>
<P>
   When his career slumped in the mid-1990s, friends knew that it
was because the golfer wanted to spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``That spoke well of his priorities in life,'' said Andrews, who
heard of Stewart's death at a Nike Tour meeting near Jacksonville,
Fla. ``He made us realize that there are more important things than
careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was indelibly linked with his father, Bill, a colorful
furniture salesman who was a state amateur and senior champion.
</P>
<P>
   The golf course that bears Payne Stewart's name also bears
Bill's.
</P>
<P>
   In memory of his father, who died of cancer, Stewart donated his
entire $108,000 check from the Bay Hill Classic in 1987 to an
Orlando hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart credited his father for much of his golfing success.
</P>
<P>
   When Stewart was storming to a dramatic comeback victory at this
year's U.S. Open, he told The Kansas City Star that he remembered
some of his dad's tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close your eyes,'' Bill would tell his son, ``and breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Stewart sometimes brought young Payne with him on sales
calls throughout the Midwest. At the time, Stewart was establishing
himself as one of the top amateur golfers in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   When they stopped in Kansas City, the Stewarts often visited the
Italian Gardens restaurant downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The Stewarts were regulars at the Sabanedica table, reserved for
athletes and salesmen eating alone while on the road. Stewart
expressed his love for the table in a Sports Illustrated article.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stewarts were members of an exclusive club of favorite
customers that loved to eat at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Stewart's golf kept him away from Kansas City, he
regularly called restaurant owners to say hello.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne was a sweet person, truly a nice guy. His father was an
absolute gem,'' restaurant President John Bondon said Monday.
``They were like part of the family. This just makes my heart
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Bondon said his family followed Stewart's career. When he
called, they'd tell him how proud they were.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much of Springfield would hold its collective breath
when the flamboyant Stewart would fight for golf titles.
</P>
<P>
   But Springfield's devotion went beyond that, Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll miss him in the sports world. We'll miss seeing him play
golf,'' he said. ``But the hurt that his family is feeling, that
the community is feeling, that is what saddens us tonight.''

TRUCK-FUL OF MEMORIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS BREWSTER  
 c.1999 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Ron Hornaday wants to make one thing clear
about his racing future: Saturday's NAPA 200 at California Speedway
this week will not be his last NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my last points race, but I will run some more truck races
even if I have to do it myself,'' said Hornaday, who once offered
his services free to Dale Earnhardt. ``I love the truck series,
it's awesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing doesn't owe me nothing, but this truck series has done
a lot for my family, my wife, my career, myself.''
</P>
<P>
   To say the least.
</P>
<P>
   In the five-year, 121-race history of the series, Hornaday has
been its dominant driver. His 25 career victories _ at 20 different
venues _ are unmatched, although he's gone 21 races without a win,
the longest drought in his career.
</P>
<P>
   In winning two of the four truck championships (1996 and 1998),
the Palmdale native has gone from regional legend in the NASCAR
Southwest Tour and Winston West to national headliner. His
five-year rivalry with fellow Chevrolet competitor Jack Sprague,
complete with bumps and grinds, certainly elevated the awareness of
the Craftsman Truck Series.
</P>
<P>
   Their fender-rubbin', paint-swappin' and tire-burnin' incidents
are the stuff of lore. While the pair are friendly (most of the
time) off the track, theirs is a rivalry seldom matched in any
major professional sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we upped the ante of the series,'' said the
44-year-old Hornaday of his relationship with Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   But that will end next season. Truck owners Teresa and Dale
Earnhardt are taking Hornaday to the Busch Grand National Series,
at the urging of NAPA, Hornaday's sponsor for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The auto-parts chain has been so taken by Hornaday that it
picked up the sponsorship of the Fontana race as a tribute to the
driver. NAPA will remain his primary sponsor in the Busch series.
</P>
<P>
   But for the week, the focus remains on the truck series. While
it won't be the last race against his rival, it'll be their final
swan song as truck antagonists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard to leave Jack Sprague, I love running
into him,'' said Hornaday, currently seventh in the points race.
``Jack and I both were trying to win, it just seemed like we were
magnets. But there's a new crop of drivers coming up. Guys like
(Greg) Biffle, (Stacy) Compton, (Andy) Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a credit to NASCAR, they've done a great job with the
series.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only will Hornaday miss his battles with Sprague, he'll also
miss the people of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a big family. After the (final practice) or race, we
sit around the motor home and drink pop,'' said Hornaday. ``If you
tangle with somebody, NASCAR will pull you into the hauler and
straighten it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday speaks from experience. He and Sprague have probably
spent more time together in NASCAR's traveling office than the rest
of the competitors combined. It's the residue of hard driving on
tracks ranging in size from three-eighths of a mile to the
superspeedway like Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition is so fierce, you can''t leave anything on the
table,'' said Hornaday.
</P>
<P>
   That is Hornaday's style. It was that approach that attracted
the Earnhardts' attention more than five years ago when Hornaday
was best known for his success while winning the NASCAR Southwest
Tour and Winston West Series titles. In the fall of 1994, Hornaday
put his reputation on the line in Tucson, Ariz., during a
nationally televised series of races. It was an audition for a
future seat in the truck series being created by NASCAR, with
Richard Childress and Earnhardt eyeing the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he invested his bank account in the Winter Heat
series,'' said Owen Kearns Jr., a NASCAR media official. ``If he
hadn't received the call from Earnhardt, he would have gone back to
building cars and racing with his son (Ron III). It's great the way
things turned out. But we are sure going to miss him.''

ZACARIAS SAYS BOARD DIDN`T SET OUT PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES --Superintendent Ruben Zacarias challenged Monday
the Los Angeles school board's plan to evaluate him today behind
closed doors, claiming he has not been shown formal criteria that
the new board will use to judge his performance for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias' protest, communicated in a letter from his lawyer,
heightened tension between the superintendent and the board, whose
members insisted the criteria were discussed with him at least a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The latest dispute comes as the board is scheduled today to
consider removing eight administrators from the chain of command
for their involvement in the construction of the Belmont Learning
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The two highest-ranking employees on the potential hit list,
Chief Administrative Officer David Koch and General Counsel Richard
K. Mason, already have been offered contract buyouts by the school
board.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining six employees, including the director of the Real
Estate Branch and reassigned directors of the Facilities Division
and Environmental Health and Safety Branch, are expected to be put
on paid administrative leave today, according to sources close to
the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions, proposed by the district's new Chief Executive
Officer Howard Miller, would extend through the conclusion of
traditional disciplinary hearings for the employees.
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD chief auditor Don Mullinax blamed the administrators for
allowing the district to build the nation's costliest high school
atop an oil field without adequate environmental assessments.
</P>
<P>
   A $282million public works project, Belmont is slightly more
than half-complete. Despite environmental problems at the site, a
citizens advisory panel voted 4-3 last week to advise the district
to complete the complex. The school board plans to determine a fate
for the high school by early next month.
</P>
<P>
   In a 200-plus-page report last month, Mullinax charged 15 former
and current employees ``failed to exercise proper management,
supervision and/or professional execution of their assigned
responsibilities'' with regard to Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Mullinax advised the board to discipline, if not
fire, nine of the current employees he singled out, separating
Zacarias from the group.
</P>
<P>
   One of the administrators resigned three days after the report
came out.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, board members have said Zacarias' alleged
involvement in the scandal will be incorporated into his job
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The performance review set for today is a quarterly evaluation,
covering the first three months of the current school year. It
marks the first time Zacarias will be critiqued by three recently
elected board members who ran on a reform platform.
</P>
<P>
   District officials would not release the criteria the board
plans to use for the review.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not seen the criteria,'' said Joseph F. Coyne, a
lawyer for Zacarias. ``How can you evaluate someone against
criteria that you have never officially given them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The board was required by the superintendent's contract to set
forth his goals and objectives by July of this year. They have not
done that,'' said Coyne, an attorney at firm of Sheppard, Mullin,
Richter and Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Caprice Young would not discuss the
superintendent's complaints but insisted that the criteria ``will
be nothing that is a surprise to the superintendent or to the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that the superintendent be evaluated at a time
he believes he can be evaluated fairly,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Two board members, who asked not to be named, scoffed at the
idea that Zacarias hadn't been given the criteria. ``He's had it
for more than a week. This annoys me to no end,'' said one board
member.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Several Latino elected officials have protested the board's
treatment of the superintendent since the board hired Miller as CEO
two weeks ago to run the nation's second-largest school district.
The move effectively removed Zacarias from day-to-day control of
all the district's departments.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias supporters claim the management change took place
without proper public notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were elected, the board members vowed to follow a
fair and open process,'' said Bill Mabie, a top aide to state Sen.
Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles. ``That includes not only sharing
the criteria with the superintendent but giving the information to
the public so they will have faith in the process.''

<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS -- Sandpiper Networks went public through a side
door by agreeing to be bought by San Francisco-based Digital Island
in a deal valued at $1 billion by the time the financial markets
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Investors caught on quickly Monday, driving Digital Island's
stock sharply higher to a closing price more than 68 percent above
its opening value.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Garrahan, technology analyst for Lehman Brothers
Securities, said the merger puts Sandpiper in the public arena well
ahead of competitor Akamai, which has an initial public offering
scheduled for later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're effectively going public by being bought,'' Garrahan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sandpiper and Akamai have systems to move Internet content
closer to the user, speeding download time.
</P>
<P>
   If Akamai prices in the middle of its expected range, its market
capitalization after the initial offering would be $1.5 billion,
Garrahan said.
</P>
<P>
   By that comparison, he said Digital Island is getting a bargain
at the price it is paying for Sandpiper.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently agreed, trading in Digital Island's stock
as if it were a fresh new offering. More than 12 million of the
company's shares changed hands Monday after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The stock ended trading at $38.6875, up $15.6875 per share on
the day.
</P>
<P>
   The combined companies will be able to share their abilities for
better service, Garrahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination gives them a fuller end-to-end solution to
their customer,'' he said. ``It allows them to sell more services
to current customers. It lets them both to deploy their services
faster using the strengths each one has.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the merger, which is subject to approval by shareholders
and regulators, Digital Island Chief Executive Officer Ruann Ernst
will become CEO of the combined company. Sandpiper CEO Leo Spiegel
will be president.
</P>
<P>
   Sandpiper shareholders will receive 1.07 shares of Digital
Island stock for each share they own.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 27.4 million shares of Digital Island stock will be
issued in the transaction. At Digital Island's Friday close, the
merger had a value of $630 million.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day Monday, the price tag had climbed to $1.06
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials, who could not be reached Monday, said in a
joint statement the combination will allow Sandpiper and Digital
Island to offer their services as a package to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Island provides Internet hosting and commerce
capability, and Sandpiper offers speedy content delivery to the
mix.
</P>
<P>
   Garrahan said he expects the combined company will have fiscal
2000 revenues of $46 million. The following year, Garrahan is
projecting revenues of $117 million. The company is expected to
begin generating profits some time in fiscal 2002, he said.

DEVELOPERS ANNOUNCE PLAN FOR THEME PARK

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A group of Florida developers announced plans
Monday to build a $2.1 billion, 1,000-acre resort and working
entertainment studio in Santa Clarita in northern Los Angeles
County, surprising local officials and industry executives who had
never heard of the project.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for Studio Park Hollywood is bold, especially
considering its backers have yet to purchase land for the park,
never mind putting it through the approval processes required by
local municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   The resort _ if built as proposed _ would have a theme park,
three hotels overlooking man-made lakes and lagoons, a business
conference center, an 18-hole golf course and a performing arts
pavilion, in addition to the soundstages and other entertainment
production facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Chernack, chief executive of a Burbank-based theme park
design firm and past president of the Themed Entertainment
Association, said he was caught off guard by the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been any buzz about it so far within the
industry,'' he added. ``I was surprised to hear about a development
that would be this large.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first resort proposed by Florida-based Studio
Park Partners Inc., a coalition of five principals who the company
says has decades of combined experience in the themed park and
entertainment industries.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, the group floated a plan before San Francisco
city officials to build a $2 billion theme park on the city's
Treasure Island, anchored by a 13-story hotel resembling a Mayan
pyramid. The project never went beyond the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   Studio Park officials said on Monday a final site for Studio
Park Hollywood hasn't been selected, but an executive summary of
the proposal on the Web site of Studio Park's financier said Studio
Park is located on a 1,000-acre tract 25 minutes north of Hollywood
that is reachable via the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways
in addition to a Metrolink station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're talking to four different land developers in
Southern California, so it's too early to say anything yet. There's
nothing locked down,'' said spokesman Marty Mincer.
</P>
<P>
   Mincer declined comment on whether talks have occurred with
Valencia-based Newhall Land &AMP; Farming Co., the Santa Clarita
Valley's largest landowner. Newhall spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer said
she was unaware of discussions between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   The company has not discussed the project with city of Santa
Clarita officials, Mincer said. Los Angeles County and Santa
Clarita city officials said they were unaware of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Development plans will be effective as soon as successful
financing is complete. Studio Park Hollywood's grand opening is
slated for 2005, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Studio Park Partners is recruiting investors for the park. Its
Web site seeks people willing to invest at least $2 million apiece,
but warns that unless the $2.1 billion is raised and the resort
center built, the partners have ``no liability for repayment.''
</P>
<P>
   The partnership is led by President and Chief Executive Officer
Bob Winford, who the group says was on the opening team of
Universal Studios Florida. A spokesman with Universal Studios
Hollywood could neither confirm nor deny Winford's employment.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman did confirm that Lewy Kodner, Studio Park
Partners' technical operations officer, worked for the Universal
City amusement park's technical systems departments for more than
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Studio Park Hollywood's revenue statement presumes the park will
be able to draw 11 million visitors annually, according to the
executive summary. By contrast, Valencia's other amusement park _
the Six Flags California complex of Magic Mountain and Hurricane
Harbor _ draws approximately 4 million customers per year.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Shaw, film operations director and a partner in Studio Park,
likened the resort's design to those owned by Walt Disney Co. and
Universal Studios in Orlando, Fla., which combine major theme parks
with licensed movie-based attractions, hotels, golf courses and
recreational resorts such as water parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not anticipating anything that would compete with (Six
Flags) Magic Mountain,'' said Shaw. ``We would consider ourselves
as more of a complementary park to Magic Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is being designed to meet demands in the tourism
industry, as well as the film industry, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is the entertainment capital of the world,'' said
Shaw, later adding, ``We know there's a demand for sound stages and
resorts in that area.'
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the production studios to include eight sound
stages, recording studios and a broadcast center, among other
amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment analyst Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research Partners
said the group's concept _ combining elements of entertainment,
dining, retail and theme parks into one site _ is a popular trend,
but getting it built will be extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that getting location-based entertainment off the
ground requires a huge upfront investment,'' he said. ``I
congratulate them for having a compelling vision but getting the
financing is a very tough hurdle.''

DALLENBACH STARTS FINAL ENGINES

<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Wally Dallenbach, who won three of his five
open-wheel races at Ontario Motor Speedway, will close out his
racing career as grand marshal of the Marlboro 500 on Sunday at
California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Dallenbach, currently the chief steward for the
CART FedEx Series, will give the command to start the engines for
the final race of the season. Known for his trademark boots and
cowboy hat, Dallenbach is considered a pioneer in upgrading safety
features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the old days, it didn't pay to be safety conscious,
because it worked against your throttle foot and you had to
overcome fear,'' said Dallenbach, who won the California 500 in
1973. ``If you were concerned with safety, you probably wouldn't
get in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 15-year career, he competed in 180 races, including 13
Indianapolis 500 appearances. In addition to his California 500
victory, he also won two 100-mile races at OMS.
</P>
<P>
   __ Perfect 11: In the first two NASCAR Craftsman Truck races at
California Speedway, 11 drivers completed all 400 miles. That list
will be pared down by at least two after Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Irvan and Rick Carelli are no longer racing, both having
retired after injuries this year. Irvan quit following a crash in
August at Michigan Speedway. Carelli left after a one-truck
incident at Memphis in May.
</P>
<P>
   Of the remaining nine, only Tony Raines is not yet entered in
Saturday's NAPA 200.
</P>
<P>
   __ Runway madness: Smashmouth, one of today's hottest rock
bands, will perform at Runway Madness II, a charity fundraiser for
CARA Charities and the Children's Fund of San Bernardino County.
The event is set for 6 p.m. Friday, in the Lockheed hanger at
Ontario International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the musical, there will be an auction of racing
memorabilia and carnival games. Among the items are pace rides with
actor/driver Paul Newman and former racing champ Rick Mears.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll Shelby has donated a one-year lease on a Shelby 289 FIA
street car, and actor Anthony Edwards is offering a day on the set
of his television series ``ER''.
</P>
<P>
   __ Early favorites:Perhaps it's because they're on his team, but
Bobby Rahal believes Max Papis and Bryan Herta should be favored
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Papis drives Rahal's Miller Lite Ford Reynard, which finished
second two weeks ago in Australia, while Herta is making his final
appearance in the Shell Ford Reynard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our testing was what we expected . . . fast,'' said Rahal,
whose team ran at Fontana almost a month ago. ``Both the cars were
in the 234 (mph) range, and we ran a lot of laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident about our chances. Max has to be the favorite
after Michigan. He won that; we lost it for him. He was as dominant
as I've ever seen there.''
</P>
<P>
   Papis ran out of fuel less than a mile from the finish.

GOV. MEL CARNAHAN APOLOGIZES FOR APPEARING IN BLACKFACE IN A 1960 
</HEADLINE>
 IN BLACKFACE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Gov. Mel Carnahan apologized Monday for
appearing in blackface makeup in a 1960 minstrel show but accused
Republican U.S. Sen. John Ashcroft of orchestrating the disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's office denied the allegation. Carnahan, a Democrat
who is seeking the Republican Ashcroft's Senate post, contends
Ashcroft wants to distract attention from recent accusations that
he was guilty of racism.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's comments came one day after Missouri Republicans
circulated a 39-year-old newspaper photo of Carnahan in blackface
makeup performing in a minstrel show in Rolla, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said that, while minstrel shows were offensive, even
those who backed civil rights early failed to recognize how
offensive the shows were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly regret my participation in this kind of theater
and I sincerely and readily apologize for my insensitivity of 39
years ago,'' he said. Carnahan was 26 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he and his brother Bob were part of a Kiwanis
Club barbershop quartet that performed at fund-raisers. He said
Rolla was ``not very far advanced'' on civil rights in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he participated in the minstrel show, Carnahan said,
``I cannot explain that except to say it was insensitive and I wish
it were not so.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we did stop the practice and I feel like I have grown and
I am proud that I have grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said that he and his brother helped convince the
organization to end the annual minstrel show in 1961 and replace it
with a variety show.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he said, he sponsored legislation in the
Missouri General Assembly that became law that banned
discrimination in public facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also noted that in 1995 he named Ronnie White as
the first African-American member of the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the same Ronnie White whose character and record were
irresponsibly assailed by the senator (Ashcroft) who is now trying
to raise questions about my attitudes on race,'' Carnahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft played a key role in the U.S. Senate's rejection
earlier this month of White's nomination for a federal judgeship.
Ashcroft said White had a weak record on capital punishment and
drug enforcement and was opposed by various law enforcement groups.
</P>
<P>
   Two black members of Congress, including Rep. William Clay of
St. Louis, called Ashcroft racist last week for his role in White's
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said Monday that Ashcroft's Senate campaign and GOP
operatives gave the Carnahan photo to reporters to distract
attention from Ashcroft's role in White's rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the information, they put it out and they are
responsible for it,'' Carnahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Ashcroft is counting on Missourians to be unable to
see any difference between the insensitivity in this photograph
four decades ago and the polarizing acts he committed on the Senate
floor just days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hilton, Ashcroft's spokesman, said Monday the senator's
office did not distribute the photo. He said many Missourians were
aware of its existence and they were angered over charges of racism
leveled at Ashcroft in light of that knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Ashcroft didn't tell Mel Carnahan to perform in
blackface,'' Hilton said. ``We didn't take the photo of a demeaning
minstrel show. Mel Carnahan needs to answer for his own conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan told reporters that while Ashcroft's opposition to
White showed insensitivity he was not accusing him of being racist.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's office, however, cited a weekend news story in which
Carnahan said Ashcroft's opposition to White ``had racial
overtones.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock, executive director of the state GOP, criticized
Carnahan's comments about the photo and denied any role in its
release. He said it was ``leaked to the news media by an anonymous
source.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The original dirty trick was when Mel Carnahan decided to
appear in blackface at a time when he was launching his political
career,'' Hancock said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said he did not think the issue would hurt his standing
with African-American voters in next year's Senate showdown. He
said politicians should be judged on their record and whether they
have grown.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carson Ross, a Blue Springs Republican, criticized Carnahan
on Sunday and compared wearing blackface to hoods worn by the Ku
Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said Monday those comments were an ``overreaction'' and
accused Ross of being the spokesman ``for this dastardly attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross denied that and said, as an African-American who grew up in
Arkansas in the 1950s and 1960s, minstrel shows struck a sensitive
chord.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not innocent when you start mocking a group of people or
degrading a group of people,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Told of Carnahan's apology Monday, Ross said, ``That is all I am
asking.''

MCCAIN LASHES BACK AT HULL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Arizona Sen. John McCain on Monday, Oct. 25th,
accused Gov. Jane Hull and the Bush campaign of conspiring to
attack him just as the polls indicate he is catching up to Bush in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   At an airport news conference in Phoenix designed to announce
his latest endorsement, McCain said that Hull, whose pointed
remarks about the senator's temper appeared in a front-page New
York Times story on Oct. 25, was merely following orders from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty obvious, as we've closed in the polls _
we're up to within 12 points of Governor Bush in New Hampshire _
that the memo came out from the Bush campaign to start attacking
John McCain,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate. I'm sorry, and I hope that the Bush campaign
will realize that, at least here in Arizona, that kind of negative
attacks _ personal attacks on people _ don't resonate.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's charge was made on a day in which he was eager to
announce that he had been endorsed by Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza, a
former supporter of Elizabeth Dole, who dropped out of the race
Oct. 19th. Rimsza said at the time that he probably would not make
an endorsement in the presidential race and might ``sit out'' the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hull, Rimsza has at times clashed with McCain, but the
mayor said he now believes the senator's maverick style will be a
plus in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just hate to see us abandon that (McCain's style) for
kind of a vanilla, out-of-state candidate,'' Rimsza said, referring
to Bush. ``My sense is, Bush is really going forward in a form of
beauty contest for a presidential race.''
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza said that, although he doesn't always agree with McCain,
at least he knows where he stands on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I didn't like where the senator stood, but that's
also the beauty of his candidacy, because I think he's . . . going
to drive Bush to stand up on some issues,'' Rimsza said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Hull denied that her remarks to the New York Times
were part of a strategic strike at McCain. She was quoted as saying
that her relationship with McCain was ``not particularly warm'' and
suggested that McCain had a problem keeping his temper in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, he shouldn't take it as a personal attack,'' Hull
said, adding that Bush did not prompt her to talk about McCain. ``I
certainly don't take direction from the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull said she was particularly perplexed by McCain's assertion
that Bush had issued a memo or directive to his supporters
encouraging them to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John really thinks there is a memo coming out, I want to
see it _ but there isn't,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hull, there have been ``differences of opinion''
between her and McCain, and her staff has sometimes been at odds
with his.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are all little misunderstandings,'' Hull said. ``I
have always been circumspect.'' In his press conference, McCain
took a mild jab at Bush, criticizing the front-runner for refusing
to attend a planned Nov. 21 debate in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that millions of dollars, according to the Bush
campaign, will be spent here,'' McCain said. ``I hope they take the
time to have a debate here. That's what the people of Arizona want.
They're not necessarily as interested in millions of dollars in
paid commercials as they are having an opportunity to see the
candidates, and I regret that Governor Bush turned down an
invitation from our party to attend a debate on November 21.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's comments come as he appears to be making headway in New
Hampshire, which holds the nation's first primary. A poll released
by the Concord Monitor newspaper over the weekend indicated that
McCain had 27 percent support to Bush's 39 percent in that state.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jeff Groscost, speaker of the Arizona House and a paid
consultant to McCain, said Hull's comments were good news _ proof
that ``the Bush campaign is finally taking Senator McCain
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's bad news because now, we're going to have to sustain
a lot of money spent innovatively (by the Bush camp) to try to
bloody John McCain's nose,'' Groscost said.
</P>
<P>
   Although his pace appears to be picking up in New Hampshire,
McCain has had to watch as major endorsements slip away in Arizona.
Last month, Hull endorsed Bush, followed by Rimsza's early decision
to go with Dole. Last week, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio
endorsed Bush as well. In that context, the Rimsza endorsement Oct.
25th became all the more important to the McCain forces.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, trying to explain his loss of the Arpaio nod, riled
Arpaio when he suggested to a Tucson television station over the
weekend that Arpaio's endorsement was based only on his dislike for
Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley. McCain recently endorsed
Romley, and McCain aides claimed after Arpaio's endorsement of Bush
that Arpaio had done it as an act of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio suggested that the flap over Hull's comments, and the
suggestions by McCain that his endorsement was made over a petty
dispute with Romley, are part of an attempt by the McCain campaign
to divert the spotlight from the endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is wrong with that guy?'' Arpaio asked. ``You don't
desert a guy over a little thing like that (Romley). Where is the
big picture here? Can't anybody admit that maybe George Bush is the
guy that Jane and I like for the good of the country?'' &QL;

GOLF CHAMPION PAYNE STEWART KILLED IN PLANE CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. CRONKLETON  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Golf champion Payne Stewart and at least four others died Monday
when their Learjet, its windows coated with a shroud of frost and
its crew and passengers apparently incapacitated, streaked across
the nation's heartland before nosediving into a South Dakota field.
</P>
<P>
   Experts and government officials said the twin-engine jet, which
took off from Orlando, Fla., probably lost cabin pressure,
disabling and eventually killing those on board.
</P>
<P>
   After air traffic controllers lost contact with the jet over
Gainesville, Fla., fighter jets from bases in Florida, Oklahoma and
North Dakota tracked the eerie, uncontrolled flight. The private
jet apparently ran out of fuel over north-central South Dakota and
crashed in a grassy field two miles west of Mina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane had pretty much nosed straight into the ground,''
Lesley Braun, who lives about two miles from the site, told The
Associated Press. ``There's not a lot of debris spread out a long
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were Stewart's agents Robert Fraley and Van Ardan
and the two pilots, identified as Michael Kling, 43, and Stephanie
Bellegarrigue, 27.
</P>
<P>
   Fraley was chief executive officer of Leader Enterprises Inc.,
and Ardan was president of the sports management company. The jet
was operated by Sunjet Aviation Inc. in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus told The AP on Monday that he feared one of his
golf course designers, Bruce Borland, 40, also died in the crash.
Borland's wife, Kate, also said she contacted the private jet
terminal Monday afternoon and spoke to an employee who confirmed
her husband intended to board the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities could not confirm that Borland was aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Two FAA officials and a National Transportation Safety Board
representative were dispatched to the scene of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The plane had been en route to Dallas. Stewart, who lived in
Orlando, had been expected in Houston today for practice rounds in
advance of the Tour Championship, the PGA Tour's final tournament
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Lear 35, built in 1976, took off about 8:20 a.m. CDT. The
last communication came as it was over Gainesville, and the crew
did not respond to repeated inquiries from air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   A government source told The AP that the plane should have
turned at Gainesville on a course for Dallas. It made only a
partial turn before heading in a straight line toward South Dakota.
Set apparently on autopilot, the plane cruised steadily about 1,400
miles up the middle of the country, across half a dozen states.
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force fighter from Tyndall, Fla., was diverted from a
routine training flight to check out the jet. Two fighters from
Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., then took over the chase.
</P>
<P>
   They handed off the monitoring to two F-16 fighters from the
138th Fighter Wing of the Air National Guard, which took over the
chase near the Kansas-Nebraska boarder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They intercepted the Learjet and followed it to the
northwest,'' said Col. Bob Ireton, vice commander of the 138th
Fighter Wing based in Tulsa, Okla. ``Our pilots chased the airplane
for an hour. They did observe the windshield frosted up.''
</P>
<P>
   The coating of frost would tend to reinforce speculation that
the plane lost cabin pressure, needed in the thin air above 12,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Learjet carrying Stewart and the others cruised at 47,000
feet before it crashed, Ireton said.
</P>
<P>
   At that altitude and without oxygen, those on board would
quickly lose the ability to function. ``The time of useful
consciousness, how long you can stay awake and function, depends on
what altitude you are at,'' said Allen Parmet, president of the
American Association of Aerospace Medicine Specialists. He is a
Kansas City doctor who specializes in aviation and occupational
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a rapid decompression, like a window or seal that
blows where you quickly lost pressure, you will have only 30
seconds or so before you are unable to make important decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that is why pilots are taught the first thing to do is
put on oxygen masks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more likely in this case is a slow loss of pressure,''
he said. ``Either the pressurization equipment did not work
properly or they lost it slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that if that was the case, the problem possibly crept up
on the crew members and they drifted off to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would never know what hit them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At 45,000 feet, a person would become nonfunctional within 30
seconds, unconscious in 4 minutes and probably dead in 20 minutes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parmet said the plane took its four-hour flight probably because
the pilots had switched on their autopilot. If they passed out, the
plane would cruise until it ran out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Ireton of the Air National Guard said the unarmed fighters were
participating with six others in a training mission over eastern
Kansas when the FAA asked for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Ireton said two fighters refueled with a tanker aircraft, which
accompanied the fighters in the chase.
</P>
<P>
   The Learjet was flying straight and level at about 47,000 feet
when the fighters intercepted it. The altitude was near the
fighters' operational limit of 50,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots who drew close noticed no structural damage but were
unable to see inside the Learjet because of the frost.
</P>
<P>
   Two unarmed F-16s from the 119th Fighter Wing of the Air
National Guard in Fargo, N.D., joined the chase about a half hour
before the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Military pilots had few options except to shadow the doomed
craft on its final flight.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Lyle Andvik with 119th Fighter Wing said shooting down the
plane to protect a populated area was not a likely option.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is only something you will see when you are watching TV
and the movies,'' he said. ``There are just so many variables that
could happen. First, you don't know where it would end up (if shot
down) or where it will go. At that altitude, it would leave a large
footprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, if you decide to shoot it down too soon, you could kill
people aboard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ireton said the military pilots ``observed the airplane spinning
out of control and descending, but they lost sight of the aircraft
before it hit the ground. They did not see a fireball, which would
support the speculation that the airplane was out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   During the flight, the FAA routed air traffic around the Learjet
and kept planes from flying underneath it in case it crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Air Route Traffic Control Center in Olathe
tracked the plane for much of its flight.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Blankenship, a facility representative for the National
Air Traffic Controllers Association at the Kansas City center, said
he doubted many planes were affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is less traffic at 40,000 feet and above,'' he said. ``A
lot of traffic is in the low to mid-30,000 feet.'' Instances of a
civilian jet losing pressure in flight are extremely rare.

NORBERG NEEDS 20/20 HINDSIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Three and a half years ago, their son was killed by
officers in Joe Ar paio's jail. Now, the story of his death was to
receive national television exposure on the show 20/20 and, yes, Ja
ron and Deena Norberg were thankful and, no, they would not be
watching.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's possible to de scribe how the loss of a
son affects you,'' Deena Norberg said Monday. ``But I know time
doesn't diminish it. All you can do is hope that, in having his
story told again, some good would come.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, 1996, 33-year-old Scott Norberg died after struggling
with guards at a Maricopa County jail.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been brought there late the previ ous night by a Mesa
police officer. A woman had telephoned authorities saying Norberg
was harassing two girls. When the officer arrived, Norberg scuffled
with him and wound up in handcuffs in the back of the car.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Scott Norberg had struggled with drug addiction. He'd
once been a star athlete. He was smart, good looking, the son of a
vice president at Arizona Public Service Co. But, not long after en
rolling at the University of Nebraska on a football scholarship, it
all unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   He was married and had two sons, but drug problems led to
divorce. He went in and out of jobs, in and out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In jail that night, he refused to respond to an officer and was
dragged from a holding cell and placed in a restraining chair. He
was strapped down and a towel was wrapped around his mouth and neck
to keep him from spitting. An autopsy later revealed many scrapes
and bruises. He was shocked with a stun gun as many as 21 times.
Jailers forced his head into his chest, causing what the medical
exam iner called ``positional asphyxia.''
</P>
<P>
   Norberg died, never having been con victed of a crime, never
having appeared in a courtroom. &QL; 
NOTHING SWAYS ARPAIO
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Arpaio defended his officers' behavior.
Nothing swayed him, not even the taped interview one of ficer gave
investigators, in which Nor berg's final moments were described
this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I start, `He's not, he's not breathing.' Um, and
one said, you know, when I told him that he was purple, he just
said, you know, `Who gives a (ex pletive).''
</P>
<P>
   After lawyers for the county agreed to pay the Norberg family
$8.25 million to settle the case out of court, Arpaio told me,
``They (Norberg's family) said it was never about money. So, why do
they agree to settle?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, according to Jaron Nor berg, is Adam and Cody.
</P>
<P>
   They're Scott Norberg's sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was just Deena and I, there would have been no
settlement,'' Jaron said Monday. ``But those boys didn't de serve
to go through the ordeal of a trial.'' &QL; 
NO APOLOGIES
</P>
<P>
   The settlement agreement didn't re quire an apology or an
admission of guilt from Arpaio's office, however. And one has never
been offered.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the television program 20/20 asked the Norbergs if they
would agree to be interviewed for a segment on their son's death,
they agreed. The show aired late Monday, Oct. 25th, night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do it because, in your heart, you want people to know how
wrong this was,'' Jaron said, his voice sinking, as if after all
these years he doesn't hold out much hope. And for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio has remained the most popular politician in the state.
His office's spokes woman, Lisa Allen, told me Monday, ``We're well
aware of the fact it (the 20/20 segment) will be a slam on the of
fice. We knew that going in.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't worry them. Nothing worries them. Not a dead young
father. Not $8.25 million. Not negative TV exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their arrogance is limitless,'' Jaron Norberg said.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, the Norbergs will be on a plane when the show is
broadcast. They're not sure they'll watch it later on tape. For 3{
years, they've waited for ev eryone else to see as clearly as they
do that their son's death was needless and barbaric.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight is supposed to be 20/20. It isn't. &QL;

HERMOSILLO'S DEAL EXTENDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Major League Soccer vice president Ivan
Gazidis said that Los Angeles Galaxy striker Carlos Hermosillo's
MLS contract will be extended until the end of November, allowing
the Mexican striker to finish the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, 34, signed a two-year contract in the middle of the
1998 season, but that contract expires Sunday. In past seasons, the
MLS championship was conducted in October, but the league decided
to push its championship to November this season so it didn't have
to compete against the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The only concern for Hermosillo was the financial terms of the
extension. His current Galaxy salary is significantly less than
what he would have earned with Necaxa, his Mexican club team. But
the MLS took care of the salary gap.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid pulled Hermosillo in the 70th minute of
Sunday's 2-0 series-clinching victory over Colorado. The Galaxy
completed its 2-0 sweep of the Rapids to reach the Western
Conference finals for the third time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, who injured his back late in the season and his left
knee in the series finale against Kansas City, told Schmid at
halftime his hamstring was sore.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican striker was a nonfactor for most of the afternoon,
laboring to chase down passes and finishing without a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy will play either Chicago or Dallas on Sunday at the
Rose Bowl to open the best-of-three series to decide who will play
for the MLS championship. The Burn-Fire series is tied 1-1 and will
be decided Wednesday at the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy trained Monday but will take today off.

LEARJET IN STEWART CRASH WAS IN PRIME CONDITION 
</HEADLINE>
 CRASH-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY and SCOTT CANON  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ad said Learjet involved in Stewart crash was `in premium
condition' Built in Wichita, the 1976 Learjet 35 advertised for
sale last spring on a Florida Web site boasted everything. Gray
leather interior accented in deep reds. Metallic silver and
burgundy racing stripes. A 10-stack compact disc sound system with
wireless infrared control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This aircraft is in premium condition inside and out,'' the ad
stated. ``The maintenance performed has been meticulous....All log
books are complete and up to date. This aircraft is an excellent
buy in today's marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   That plane crashed Monday, killing golfer Payne Stewart and at
least four others, including two of his agents and a pair of
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Sunjet Aviation Inc., in central Florida, had operated the
eight-passenger jet for about a year. Company President James A.
Watkins said in a telephone interview Monday night that his pilots
had flown with Stewart about three or four times in the past.
Watkins said Stewart had no ownership interest in the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership had changed hands at least five times in the last five
years, said Dave Richardson of Aviation Data Services, which tracks
the owners and operators of aircraft. Delaware-based Jet Shares One
Inc. acquired the jet last month from another aircraft broker,
although Sunjet continued to operate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, when an aircraft changes hands, the purchaser does a
thorough prebuy inspection to spot any potential maintenance
problems,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his records did not indicate whether an inspection was
performed when Jet Shares One became the owner in September.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said each new owner inspected the jet thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was constantly inspected and looked at,'' he said. ``Every
time it's on the ground, it's checked.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said the 23-year-old sky limousine sold for about $2.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Learjet manufactured the model 35 at its Wichita plant from 1974
to 1976, and the model 35A from 1976 to 1993. According to Jane's
Aviation, Learjet built 676 35s and 35As over those 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Learjet's parent company, Bombardier Aerospace of Canada, said
the Learjet 35 fleet had accumulated more than 4 million
flight-hours and 3.4 million landings. The jet that crashed had
logged more than 10,000 flying hours in 7,500 flights.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board on Monday released
records pointing to 32 accidents involving the Learjet 35 or 35A
since 1983. Eleven of the accidents were fatalities, killing a
total of 24 persons.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these fatalities were attributed to pilot error or to
poor weather, usually near the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators cited engine failure in a 1985 crash of a
Learjet 35A near College Station, Texas, killing two. In 1994, a
Learjet 35A crashed in Fresno, Calif., after the crew reported an
engine fire. Another Learjet 35A disappeared two years later
approaching a New Hampshire airport. The wreckage has never been
found.
</P>
<P>
   None of the accidents outlined in the safety board records
pointed to problems in maintaining cabin pressure _ a cause
speculated in Monday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   However, the records referred to a nonfatal accident in 1983,
when the passenger door of a Learjet 35 opened during takeoff in
Seattle. Investigators in that case blamed a cargo handler who
``admitted closing the door but said he never latched the door,''
which required a pilot's key.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reliable jet that's part of a reliable class of
business jets,'' said David Ellis, the director of research and
development at the National Institute for Aviation Research at
Wichita State University.
</P>
<P>
   The safety records of the business jet class pioneered by
Learjet in the 1960s rival those of commercial airliners, Ellis and
other experts said. Unlike its smaller general aviation cousins,
Learjets typically have the heft and speed that prevent them being
tossed about in high winds like smaller propeller-powered planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called `wing-loading.' I call it the Cadillac effect of
the weight of the jet,'' said Scott Miller, a professor of
aerospace engineering at Wichita State. ``You feel bumps, but you
don't get thrown around.'' If the jet's autopilot system was turned
on while it was still climbing, and before being tuned into the
plane's navigation equipment, the jet easily could veer hundreds of
miles off course toward South Dakota instead of Texas, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said a loss of cabin pressure is usually ``a violent
event,'' marked by alarms and a blast of wind rushing out a broken
window or other opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designers are required by the (Federal Aviation
Administration) to think about these decompression failures...and
pilots are trained to prepare for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller said early reports indicating the jet Payne and his
associates flew might have suffered a loss of pressurization _ and
oxygen _ from a slow leak. Oxygen levels in the cabin may have
dipped so gradually, Miller speculated, the change could have
passed unnoticed by the pilots and passengers until they lost
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, Sunjet's president, speculated that if sudden
pressurization loss caused Monday's crash, ``all five (occupants
must have fallen) unconscious at the same time'' before they could
use the 10 oxygen masks or radio for help.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of pressure normally would prompt the pilots to pull on
oxygen masks and bring the plane down to an elevation with enough
breathable air to keep them conscious and lucid.
</P>
<P>
   But if an aging window seal or a door that wasn't closed
perfectly allowed the air pressure to slip away gradually, Miller
said, the pilots' thinking might have been too fuzzy by the time
they picked up on the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognizing the onset of hypoxia is not easy. Everybody's
different, and your response can change over time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Loss of cabin pressure is sometimes suspected in the crashes of
military aircraft _ such as when an A-10 Thunderbolt pilot crashed
in a still unsolved accident in Colorado in April 1997 _ but is
rarely cited in civilian mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it happens more often than people realize,'' Miller
said. ``It's also possible that the crew members ate food at the
same restaurant, and they got sick and passed out. There's lots of
opportunities for things to go wrong, but they rarely do.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said: ``All of my employees are shell-shocked. I shook
hands with Captain Mike Kling just before he took off. He was a
fine family man with a wife and a couple of teen-aged kids. He was
active in his church.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said he did not know the reason for the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is about 50 feet long. It usually cruises _ above most
commercial air traffic and severe weather _ at 40,000 feet or more
at about 500 mph. It has a range of about 3,000 miles.

MCCAIN'S HOT TEMPER NOW A CAMPAIGN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   per emerged as a national campaign issue Oct. 25th as the New
York Times raised the question of whether McCain's personality
could become a major drawback for him.
</P>
<P>
   The story said McCain's occasional bursts of rage have put him
on the outs with other politicians in Arizona and played a role in
Arizona Gov. Jane Hull's decision to endorse Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's decision could complicate McCain's effort to win his home
state, where a defeat would be a devastating blow to his ambitions
of winning the GOP presidential nomination, according to the
article by political reporter Richard Berke.
</P>
<P>
   ``(F)ar beyond Arizona, Mrs. Hull's spurning of McCain stands as
a telling example of how, despite his reputation as a war hero who
dares to speak his mind, his personal style rankles many
politicians,'' Berke wrote. ``Several people involved in state
politics said the very attributes that many voters admired _
stubborn to the point of rude, temperamental and cocksure in his
maverick, military way _ worked against him with other
politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, interviewed by the Times, said he is ``good friends''
with Hull. ``I've never had a harsh word with her, to my
knowledge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hull said she has had several intense encounters with
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretending to hold a telephone receiver several inches from
her ear,'' the article stated, ``Mrs. Hull . . . explained how she
reacted to McCain's occasional eruptions at her. `You've got to
hold it out there for a while, and let him calm down,' she said.
`We all have our faults, and it's something that John has to keep
control of.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl, otherwise a firm supporter of McCain, was
also critical of the McCain temper in the article.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any personality there's always a good side and a bad
side,'' Kyl was quoted as saying. ``Obviously, somebody with his
kind of intensity could in certain situations upset people. But to
some extent, as long as he controls that strong-willed personality,
it is a positive factor in terms of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The article did not trace the origin of the tension between Hull
and McCain, but many believe it stems from the era of former Gov.
Fife Symington, whom McCain warmly supported through the governor's
trial and conviction on six counts of fraud in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As secretary of state, Hull succeeded Symington, and by the time
she took over, she had assembled her own staff of largely moderate
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Symington had never run for office before his election to the
Governor's Office, and most of his senior staff had been lent to
him by McCain. The transition was described by insiders at the time
as rocky, with Hull's staff irritated by the intrusions of the
former Symington and McCain staffers, many of whom were famous for
aggressiveness and hard-nosed approach to politics.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, McCain himself reportedly demanded of Hull that
she fire her chief of staff, Rick Collins, for an unknown offense.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by the Times to confirm that story during an interview,
``the governor turned to Collins and made light of the episode,''
the newspaper reported. `` `Did he actually want me to fire you?'
she asked, `or just boil you in oil?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was fire,' Collins replied with a smile. `It
was, ``Just kill him!'' ' '' &QL;

DOLE PRAISES COMMUNITY NEWSPAPERS IN LECTURE AT K-STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BySTEVE KRASKE  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ In his days in the limelight, Bob Dole had his
share of battles with the media.
</P>
<P>
   Once he referred to the newspaper in Hutchinson, Kan., as the
``Prairie Pravda.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday at Kansas State University, Dole took a different
tone, at least regarding the nation's small-town community
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Those papers, which often have circulations of just a few
thousand, are the backbone of the nation, Dole said. They report
information that people care about, such as social news and
goings-on at churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose your community newspaper, you can lose your
entire town, because that voice, that independent voice, is gone,''
Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, a former Senate majority leader and presidential
candidate, was in Manhattan to give the first lecture honoring Huck
Boyd, Dole's political mentor who once published the The Phillips
County Review in north-central Kansas. A center for community media
has been established at K-State in Boyd's name.
</P>
<P>
   Dole knows something about small newspapers. When he first was
elected to the U.S. House in 1960, he represented much of western
Kansas in the state's sprawling 6th District. The 6th contained
dozens of small-town papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to connect with a community is through the
community newspaper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But his thoughts on the media made up only a part of his address
to more than 1,700 people in McCain Auditorium. Dole, who spent 35
years in Congress, couldn't resist tossing out a few nuggets about
national politics.
</P>
<P>
   He said his wife, Elizabeth, made the right choice in abandoning
the 2000 presidential race. Elizabeth Dole couldn't compete with
the fund-raising juggernaut of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to talk about what it would be like to be the
first first man,'' Bob Dole said, referring to his role had his
wife won the White House. ``But I can't talk about that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had changed his views on campaign finance given
his wife's problems raising money, Dole sided with reformers, such
as Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Dole said he now favored
phasing out ``soft money,'' the unlimited donations that can be
made to political parties. He also favors an increase in the $1,000
limit on individual donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the parties think of other ways to get people involved,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate recently defeated legislation to ban soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Dole would not say who he now backed for president but suggested
that his wife would be a good running mate for the eventual GOP
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is that she's a big asset in the campaign,'' he said,
``because we've lost a lot of women in the Republican Party with
this confrontational attitude on too many issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that Pat Buchanan had formally left the GOP Monday to join
the Reform Party, Dole said simply, ``Good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat's a great critic of everybody else in the party,'' Dole
said. ``He did a great job on `Crossfire.' But I don't believe he
represents the mainstream of the Republican Party. He never has. I
wish him limited success.''

SMITHVILLE MAN CHARGED IN MASSACHUSETTS INTERNET THREAT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRAHAM  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 19-year-old Smithville man was formally charged Monday with
using an Internet chat room to threaten Massachusetts middle school
students and directing them to sites with child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Hunold, paralyzed in a 1995 auto accident, was charged
in Ayer District Court, Mass., with four felony complaints related
to dissemination or possession of child pornography and four
misdemeanor charges related to the threats.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Hunold faces up to 20 years in prison on each of
the pornography charges and six months each on the others. Hunold's
arraignment was set for Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, Clay County Circuit Judge Larry D. Harman
granted a request by Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon to detain
Hunold for 96 hours for mental evaluation and possible treatment.
Clay County authorities escorted Hunold to Western Missouri Mental
Health Center on Monday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A person who answered the telephone at the Hunold home on Monday
said the family had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the charges came as a shock to many, said Smithville
Mayor Ron Van Winkle. Hunold and his family are highly respected in
the town of 3,044 north of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad thing,'' Van Winkle said.
</P>
<P>
   But any community would be upset by threats, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age, a terrorist scare tactic is terrible no
matter who does it,'' Van Winkle said. ``It's a sad thing for the
family; it would be sad no matter where he lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Smithville Police Chief Paul Vescovo said Hunold is a ``very
bright, outgoing young man, very friendly.'' He has never been in
trouble with the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithville community has supported Hunold and his family
since the car accident. School bands at Smithville High School,
which he had played in, held benefit concerts on his behalf. A fund
was established to help with expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Hunold has battled back from the injury and paralysis. Following
the accident, Hunold had only partial use of his arms. But with
therapy he has regained the use of his arms and has slight movement
in his legs.
</P>
<P>
   He is classified medically as quadriplegic because of the
location of a spinal injury, according to a 1998 interview with The
Kansas City Star given by Hunold and family members.
</P>
<P>
   Hunold attended summer school and used tutors to graduate with
his peers in May 1998. He now attends Maple Woods Community
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all surprised about the allegations that have come
forward,'' said Smithville High School Principal Wayne Krueger.
``This could happen anywhere, but in our own town? We all know the
young man. We believe he came from a stable and good family.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunold allegedly began communicating in the chat room in
September, authorities said. The students from Hawthorne Brook
Middle School in Townsend, Mass., had access to the chat room from
home computers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Hunold met a Townsend student who logged onto the
Internet at home and entered a chat room related to the rock group
Limp Bizkit. That student later introduced Hunold to classmates who
also communicated with him from home computers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Over several weeks, Hunold directed students to child
pornography Web sites he created, officials said. Then last week,
prosecutors said, he told them he was in their community, that he
would bomb their school and shoot 24 students and three teachers on
a hit list.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend Superintendent of Schools James McCormick said someone
from the community also received a suspicious phone call that made
references to the April shootings at Columbine High School in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Some frightened children told their parents, who then called
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear that was expressed by students, parents and teachers
in this community was very real,'' said Massachusetts Attorney
General Tom Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Those chat room messages ``intended to create a sense of panic
in the community,'' said Kurt Schwartz, deputy chief of the
attorney general's Criminal Bureau. ``He made it sound as if
violence was imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, school officials notified the parents of Hawthorne
Brook's 650 students about the threats and held an assembly to calm
students' fears. Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought into the building,
and students' bags and backpacks were searched, McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Massachusetts attorney general's office,
along with Townsend's police chief and superintendent of schools,
planned to meet with parents at a community forum Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri attorney general's office has Hunold's computer and
is searching it for evidence, said spokesman Scott Holste.
</P>
<P>
   Hunold will be issued a summons to appear for the arraignment
and will be expected to arrive in court on his own recognizance,
said Ann E. Donlan, a spokeswoman for Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Vescovo said he, like many in Smithville, has sympathy for both
the Hunold family and the people in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there's empathy for the family,'' he said. ``But I'm
sure there's plenty of understanding about what kind of turmoil has
been caused by this.''

STEWART GREW UP BEFORE OUR EYES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Payne Stewart was supposed to live long enough to walk his
13-year-old daughter down the aisle on her wedding day or have his
10-year-old son caddy for him on the Senior Tour. He certainly was
supposed to live long enough to defend his U.S. Open title next
year in Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, life is like the game that consumed Stewart for the better
part of his 42 years: It cannot be conquered so it might as well be
enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's death in a Learjet crash Monday came too soon but not
before he had learned to savor truly all his blessings, great and
small. If there's anything that can allay the pain Stewart's
family, friends and the golfing world is feeling today it's the
knowledge that in the last few years of his life, Stewart became a
man in full.
</P>
<P>
   The competitor who iced his second U.S. Open title in June with
a dramatic 15-foot par putt was not the self-involved,
tunnel-visioned golfer who could have been flagged for
unsportsmanlike conduct on the green in 1989, so excessive was his
celebration after he edged Mike Reid to win his first major, at the
PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing second more than two dozen times can humble the
proudest of men. So can fathering two children. With age, Stewart
acquired a peace of mind that wasn't predicated on fame or fortune
but rather on family.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke recently of the pleasure of driving his children
Chelsea, 13, and Aaron, 10, to school in the morning and picking
them up in the afternoon. He derived joy from being a spectator at
their games, instead of the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week Stewart watched his son score his first
touchdown. Friends say he couldn't have been prouder.
</P>
<P>
   Between winning his first U.S. Open championship in 1991 and his
second at Pinehurst, Stewart embraced Christianity and became a
more huggable person. In his final years he was a warmer husband,
father and son.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a void in my life,'' he said in June after
collecting the U.S. Open trophy. ``The peace I have now is so
wonderful. I don't understand how I lived so long without it.''
</P>
<P>
   How many people go their whole lives without experiencing such
an epiphany?
</P>
<P>
   How blessed Stewart was, to awake one morning in his late 30s
and get offered a mulligan. How wise he was not to refuse it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him an attitude adjustment,'' his mother Bee delighted
in telling reporters after this year's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   What his mother left unsaid, the Scriptures delineated.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart began each day by reading from the Bible and it showed.
His inner peace was outwardly visible; he wore it as comfortably as
he did his colorful, stylish plus-fours.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to really be enjoying life,'' Spaniard Jose Maria
Olazabal said Monday upon hearing the news of Stewart's death.
</P>
<P>
   It would be regrettable if Stewart were to be remembered for
something he recently said on the golf course rather than anything
he did.
</P>
<P>
   At the PGA Tour stop last week in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.,
Stewart used the occasion of a rain delay to lash back at British
golf analyst Peter Alliss, who had been critical of the behavior in
September of the U.S. Ryder Cup team members, Stewart among them.
</P>
<P>
   Alliss had been quoted as saying American golfers are so
different than their European counterparts, they ``might as well be
Chinese.'' Stewart, squinting into a television camera, stuck out
his teeth and, in a cartoonish Chinese accent, directed a sarcastic
reply to Alliss.
</P>
<P>
   We'd be lying if we said we'd never seen that churlish side of
Stewart before. We had been on the receiving end of his
condescending, patronizing comments. But that's not the side of
Stewart we'll remember.
</P>
<P>
   What we'll never forget is how Stewart conceded a putt to
Scotsman Colin Montgomerie at the Ryder Cup last month to give
Montgomerie the final match in a competition the Americans already
had clinched. It was the kind of sportsmanlike act that isn't seen
enough in today's athletic arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Stewart delivered a speech at a charity
event in which he said, in part, ``The good thing about dreams is
sometimes you get to live them out. I've accomplished quite a bit
in my career. But really what excites me as much as winning is
being able to make a difference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Stewart most certainly did. &QL;

<P>
   VENTURA -- Nearly 500 Muggles -- nonmagical children who should
have been in school and the parents who missed work to drive them
-- lined up Monday to catch a magical moment with J.K. Rowling, the
British author whose wildly popular ``Harry Potter'' books have
captured imaginations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Raquel Reinteria of Oxnard in Ventura County north of Los
Angeles was the first to show in the predawn hours, parking her
beach chair near the back entrance of the Adventures of Kids
bookstore in city of Ventura at 4:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still trying to get rid of the morning chill,'' she said,
her Harry Potter books in a cloth bag nestled between her feet. ``I
have not read them, but I like them because of the imagination and
the fact they get kids not reading to read,'' said Reinteria, who
volunteers to read books at local schools every other week.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old George Papador of Ventura tried reading ``The
Hobbit'' and ``The Red Wall'' but couldn't get into them like he
did the adventures of Harry Potter, an 11-year-old wizard who
attends the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have really good detail, real adventure and are exciting
books,'' he said. ``I'm really into the past and wizardry stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   George didn't do much reading until Harry Potter came along,
said mom, Heidi House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has inspired him like the Harry Potter books,'' House
said. ``It's been incredible literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowling was a struggling single mother when she penned her first
book, ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' on scraps of paper
in cafes. The series' three books now hold the top three places on
the New York Times best-sellers list and have been translated into
more than two dozen foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   As she autographed copies of her book in purple ink, Rowling
shook hands with some of her fans, chatting with them about the
weather and asking how they were doing. She did not talk to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   One adoring mother gushed to the casually dressed Rowling that
she was better than authors C.S. Lewis and Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about Shakespeare?'' Rowling replied jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Some people brought gifts, including 10-year-old Emily Felton of
Ventura, who presented Rowling with a small vase of flowers picked
from the family garden and a handmade card.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're exciting,'' said Emily, who has read each of Rowling's
books eight times.
</P>
<P>
   The magic that entrances the children has drawn criticism from
some parents locally and as far away as Georgia and New York, who
have said the books should be removed from classrooms. One Moorpark
parent claimed the books have a sinister undertone, and transferred
her son out of his fourth-grade class when the teacher read the
book aloud.
</P>
<P>
   But parents at Monday's book-signing had only high praise for
the best-selling fantasy books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much ado about nothing,'' said parent Bill Ratliff, who's
reading ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' the third
installment in the series. ``I think there is not much more than
what they see on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The books are nothing for parents to worry about, said Ratliff
and his 11-year-old son, Billy, who got in line at 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the magic and the characters. And I like the third book
because the guy from prison escapes, and it's cool how he gets
out,'' said Billy, who sported a temporary tattoo of a purple
lighting bolt on his forehead -- just like the title character, who
earned the scar when he was attacked as an infant by the evil Lord
Voldemort.
</P>
<P>
   Store owner Jody Fickes Shapiro called the books delightful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a very strong sense of good and evil,'' said
Shapiro, who dressed in black wig and costume to assume the
identity of the deputy headmistress of Hogwarts. ``If people start
to nitpick over every little questionable thing in a book, there
would be no `Wizard of Oz' or `The Lion, The Witch and the
Wardrobe.' There would be no children's books with any moral issue
to them.'' Author J.K. Rowling is scheduled to sign books at 7 p.m.
Wednesday at Barnes &AMP; Noble Booksellers, 160 S. Westlake Blvd., in
Westlake Village. For more information, call (805) 446-2820.

IMMIGRANT FREED AFTER BEING HELD FOR 19 MONTHS IN TERRORISM CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Palestinian immigrant who had been held for 19 months on
secret evidence accusing him of terrorism was freed on Monday night
from a New Jersey jail after the Justice Department decided not to
appeal a court order to release him.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Hany Kiareldeen, 31, was released from the Hudson
County Correctional Center about 10:30 p.m. and returned to his
wife and family in Bloomfield, N.J., said David D. Cole, one of his
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen, a native of Gaza who is married to an American
citizen, had been held in jail since March 27, 1998. Immigration
officials accused him of threatening the life of Attorney General
Janet Reno, having links to terrorist groups and meeting in his
home with one of the men later convicted in the 1993 bombing of the
World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   But the government would not reveal the basis for the charge,
which Kiareldeen's lawyers said came from his embittered ex-wife.
Several judges at various levels declared the evidence against him
unreliable and ruled that his detention while immigration
authorities tried to deport him was unconstitutional. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service maintained that he was a
threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a three-judge immigration appeals board decided to
stay Kiareldeen's release until midnight on Monday night to give
the Justice Department a last chance to decide if it wanted to
continue pressing its case. The department declined to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Justice Department said that both the
department and the commissioner of the INS believed ``that after
submitting the evidence to an immigration judge and the board, the
process has taken its course, and as a result the Department has
decided not to take the extraordinary step of appealing the board's
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole said on Monday night that he was exhilarated to learn that
his client's long legal battle appeared to be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great news,'' he said. ``It comes a year and a half too
late, unfortunately. This is a man who, according to every judge
who has looked at his case, never should have spent a day in
prison, but freedom is always a great thing, even when it comes
late.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Kiareldeen, who has lived in the United States
since 1990 and worked in an electronics store in Paterson, N.J.,
before he was jailed, would consider suing the government for
wrongful imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for immigrants had called Kiareldeen's case a powerful
argument against the practice of imprisoning people based on secret
evidence. In August, Kiareldeen filed a federal suit that argued
that refusing to let an accused person know the source of the
evidence against him was a fundamental violation of constitutional
right to due process. His lawyers say there are about 20 people
across the country, most of Arab descent, being held on the basis
of secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this proceeding had gone forward on the basis of open
evidence from the outset,'' Cole said on Monday night, ``I think he
would have spent three or four days in jail instead of 19 months.
But because the evidence was kept in secret, it took this long to
demonstrate to everyone's satisfaction that he is an innocent
person who never should have been detained.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen was initially arrested for having an expired student
visa and was threatened with deportation. When his lawyer argued
that he should be allowed to stay based on his marriage to an
American citizen, the government opposed Kiareldeen's application,
saying that there was ``secret information'' linking him to the
1993 World Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The government claimed that Kiareldeen met with Nidal Ayyad, who
was later convicted for conspiring in the bombing, just a week
before the bombing. But judges said the government never made its
case.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, Kiareldeen seemed to be on the verge of
freedom several times. In April, an immigration judge ordered that
he be released after calling the evidence against him ``meager''
and saying that the government had failed to prove any links
between Kiareldeen and terrorists who bombed the World Trade
Center. The INS appealed.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 18, the Justice Department's Board of Immigration
Appeals upheld the release order, but the immigration service
appealed again.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, a federal district judge, William H. Walls,
ruled that Kiareldeen's due process rights had been violated and
ordered him released.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first ruling in the nation's history that detaining
immigrants on the basis of secret evidence was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The INS appealed, arguing that the judge did not have
jurisdiction. The day after that, a federal appeals court judge
blocked Kiareldeen's release but ordered the three-judge Board of
Immigration Appeals to review the case immediately.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the board ruled that only ``a brief stay'' of
Kiareldeen's release was warranted. It expired on Monday night.

PAYNE STEWART'S HOMETOWN MOURNS HIS DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY and OSCAR AVILA  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD _ At the Bill &AMP; Payne Stewart Municipal Golf Course on
Monday, employees were silent.
</P>
<P>
   They let their actions speak for their sense of loss. They
lowered the American flag in front of the clubhouse to half-staff
in a show of respect for a local legend lost young, a legend whose
name will stay in bright orange and black on the golf course sign.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kuhn, a senior at Southwest Missouri State University, was
on the course Monday afternoon, remembering well a day early this
year when he met Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart had come back to Springfield and was giving a clinic for
not-so-experienced, not-so-good golfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like 100 degrees out here,'' Kuhn said, ``but he was
out hitting whatever shot people called out for him to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Vinson, also of Springfield, couldn't fathom what she had
heard Monday, that Stewart had died in such a mysterious crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't seem believable. He had just reached the top of
his game. It just didn't seem possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Working the cash register of the Texaco service station within
view of the course, Vinson recalled meeting Stewart there in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She was a high school golfer then, and her Hillcrest High School
team had made the state tournament for the first time. She and the
other girls saw the course pro in his office talking to someone. It
was a new face, one they didn't recognize at first.
</P>
<P>
   But then they realized it was the hometown hero, Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just in awe,'' Vinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other people in Springfield, Vinson was happy when Stewart
came back to this Ozarks town last summer after his second U.S.
Open victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't get near the course,'' she said. ``There was a
sense of pride that a local got that far.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was a 1975 graduate of Greenwood Laboratory School, a
prestigious institution known more for academics than athletics.
Stewart was a natural athlete who excelled in basketball and
football as well as golf.
</P>
<P>
   People at the tight-knit school _ each class contained about 30
students _ were stunned to hear of the famous alumnus' death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in disbelief today,'' director Gerald Moseman said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart donated money to build a golf trophy case near the
gymnasium. His honors, naturally, filled much of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a quarter-century removed from high school, Stewart
stayed connected to Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Bee Payne-Stewart, said Monday her son was looking
forward to coming home for Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved his golf game, but the family always came first,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's mother said he often called to get updates on how the
leaves were changing colors and how the flowers were blooming.
Living in Florida, he missed the changes of Missouri's seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always said that he lived in Orlando but that Springfield
was his home,'' Stewart's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds mourned Stewart's death at the Missouri Sports Hall of
Fame in Springfield. The hall displays some of Stewart's golf
clubs, bags and distinctive clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was part of the 1993 inaugural induction class with such
legends as George Brett, Len Dawson and Frank White.
</P>
<P>
   Jerald Andrews, the Hall of Fame's president, said Stewart
ranked among the titans of Missouri golf: Horton Smith, Tom Watson
and Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart never failed to support golf in Missouri, including a
Nike tour stop in Springfield. Organizers were looking forward to
him playing in a Senior Tour event in Kansas City when he turned
50.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart cared about more than golf.
</P>
<P>
   When his career slumped in the mid-1990s, friends knew it was
because he wanted to spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``That spoke well of his priorities in life,'' said Andrews, who
heard of Stewart's death at a Nike Tour meeting near Jacksonville,
Fla. ``He made us realize that there are more important things than
careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was indelibly linked with his father, Bill, a colorful
furniture salesman who was a state amateur and senior champion.
</P>
<P>
   The golf course that bears Payne Stewart's name also bears
Bill's.
</P>
<P>
   In memory of his father, who died of cancer, Stewart donated his
entire $108,000 check from the Bay Hill Classic in 1987 to an
Orlando hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart credited his father for much of his golfing success.
</P>
<P>
   When Stewart was storming to a dramatic comeback victory at this
year's U.S. Open, he told The Kansas City Star that he remembered
some of his dad's tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close your eyes,'' Bill would tell his son, ``and breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Stewart sometimes brought young Payne with him on sales
calls throughout the Midwest. At the time, Stewart was establishing
himself as one of the top amateur golfers in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   When they stopped in Kansas City, the Stewarts often visited the
Italian Gardens restaurant downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The Stewarts were regulars at the Sabanedica table, reserved for
athletes and salesmen eating alone while on the road. Stewart
expressed his love for the table in a Sports Illustrated article.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stewarts were members of an exclusive club of favorite
customers that loved to eat at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Stewart's golf kept him away from Kansas City, he
regularly called restaurant owners to say hello.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne was a sweet person, truly a nice guy. His father was an
absolute gem,'' Italian Gardens president John Bondon said Monday.
``They were like part of the family. This just makes my heart
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Bondon said his family followed Stewart's career. When he
called, they'd tell him how proud they were.
</P>
<P>
   And much of Springfield would hold its collective breath when
the flamboyant Stewart would fight for golf titles.
</P>
<P>
   But Springfield's devotion went beyond that, Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll miss him in the sports world. We'll miss seeing him play
golf,'' he said. ``But the hurt that his family is feeling, that
the community is feeling, that is what saddens us tonight.''

M'S DO ALL THE RIGHT THINGS IN GM PROCESS

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the arcane argot of baseball, there is a term for the
Mariners' selection of Pat Gillick as general manager.
</P>
<P>
   No-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   However, given the 23-year history of the Mariners, one should
never assume anything.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given Gillick's 62 years and commitments to his family,
as well as the general mayhem and nonsense that prevail in
America's most poorly run major sport, there were good reasons not
to come cross country to work this outfit.
</P>
<P>
   And mention hasn't been made yet of the possibility of being
labeled as the guy who traded away Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   To induce a man of Gillick's esteem and reputation to reconsider
his withdrawal and agree to help slow this virtual jailbreak, the
Mariners had do something right.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, it involved cash. Large, unmarked bills.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the job doesn't work out, a promise by the club to get
him swiftly into the federal witness protection program.
</P>
<P>
   Gillick takes the job at the most significant crossroads in the
franchise's history.
</P>
<P>
   From indoors to outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   From tenant to landlord.
</P>
<P>
   From cheap to overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   From fearful to accountable.
</P>
<P>
   From a hitting team to a pitching team, from glamorous to
anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   And, probably, from victimhood to perpetrators (see stadium cost
overruns).
</P>
<P>
   Pulling off this profound transformation will require the ablest
of helpers. Gillick is such a fellow.
</P>
<P>
   He is a baseball heavyweight. A Clint Eastwood sort who comes to
town after the baddies have had their way with the women, whiskey,
horses and cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Gillick's success in building an empire in Toronto and a
contender in Baltimore screams louder than anything on the resumes
of the other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   That prestige will be crucial in two matters: Persuading his
bosses to go along with good ideas, and persuading other clubs to
take the Mariners seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those were happening under Woody Woodward, and might
not happen with a selection of either of the in-house candidates,
Roger Jongewaard and Lee Pelekoudas. Both have done more good for
the Mariners than fans will ever know. But the addition of the new
stadium, its expectations, the complexity of handling a 16-person
ownership cabal and the annual ratcheting of pressure in a
dysfunctional industry requires a GM well-experienced in matters
beyond administration and scouting.
</P>
<P>
   The job, the franchise and the city are different now than when
Woodward began his tenure in 1988. There is a sales job required
now as never before, in-house as well as externally. Belatedly,
Mariners ownership has come to that realization.
</P>
<P>
   The stale Mariners office joke, ``Where's Woody?'' is no longer
tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat is a perfect fit,'' said Howard Lincoln, the new Mariners
CEO who, along with president Chuck Armstrong and minority owner
Chris Larson, interviewed all nine candidates. ``Besides being a
team player with a strong work ethic, and compatible with Chuck and
me, he has good communications skills, which are just critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential that someone communicate not only throughout
the organization, but with fans and media, to explain what we're
doing and why we're doing it. We place a high value on open
access.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lincoln means it, that transformation will be more dramatic
than discovering Lou Piniella is a nurturer of pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Piniella, Gillick unequivocally endorsed the
Mariners manager, denying a report in Baseball Weekly that claimed
Gillick viewed Piniella as a lousy handler of hurlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea where that ever came from _ that's
completely not the fact,'' Gillick said. ``I'm a big fan of Lou's.
He's done an excellent job. He's a winner and a player's manager,
one of the game's best.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Gillick was being honest or diplomatic remains to be
seen. He is not without flaws in his judgment. He left his two
previous teams with losing records, and earlier this year hooked up
with some investors in a dubious, failed scheme to buy Toronto's
Skydome and, eventually, his old Blue Jays team.
</P>
<P>
   But both the Blue Jays and Orioles were flummoxed by chaotic
ownership scenes. After winning championships in 1992 and 1993, the
Blue Jays were severely damaged by the 1994 strike as well as
ownership changes and Skydome's near-bankruptcy, litigation from
which could fill Hudson's Bay.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1995 season, he was hired by the Orioles, where he
helped produce division titles in 1996 and 1997 (remember how badly
the Mariners were outplayed in the '97 Division Series?) but had a
falling out with Peter Angelos, the meddlesome, overbearing owner.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, Gillick claims to see none of those threats, only
commitment, energy and enthusiasm. As was said, his judgment is not
flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he also sees a 2000 player payroll of the kind he worked
with in Toronto and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mariners drafted, signed and developed Griffey and
Rodriguez. We have to be creative to retain them, but it can be
done,'' he said. ``It won't be a slam dunk, but it's something I
think we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he doesn't, he's well-suited for the consequences, with a
residence far away in another country.

M'S GIVE GILLICK BIGGER TOOL BOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Pat Gillick became general manager of the
Baltimore Orioles after the 1995 season, he got together with
manager Davey Johnson and looked at what he had.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles had not made the playoffs in more than a decade. But
their core was solid, and they had money to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of re-building, Gillick and Johnson decided to go for
it. They signed closer Randy Myers and second baseman Roberto
Alomar, who had played for Gillick with the Toronto Blue Jays. They
traded for another ex-Jay, starter David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two years, the Orioles played in the American
League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's capable of making those decisions,'' Johnson said of
Gillick, 62, who Monday accepted a three-year contract to become
Mariners general manager. ``He'll look at where they are, and
decide whether to keep their big guys or make trades and look two
years down the road. You couldn't have a better guy making those
recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gillick will be able to assert more control than he ever had
under meddlesome Orioles owner Peter Angelos.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners president Chuck Armstrong, team chairman Howard Lincoln
of Nintendo and minority owner Chris Larson of Microsoft did not
compare notes while interviewing nine candidates in more than a
month. But when they met last weekend, Gillick was their unanimous
choice to replace Woody Woodward, who announced his retirement
Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nintendo and Microsoft people, they're going to like him a
lot,'' Johnson said Monday. ``I'm sure they'll let him do his job
more than Angelos did. We could've really had a good thing in
Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gillick begins the task of building a good thing in
Seattle. His immediate task is to sign Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex
Rodriguez, both of whom have been offered eight-year deals worth
more than $15 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Gillick will fly to Florida next week to meet with both players
and their agents at the players' homes. Armstrong and Lincoln also
will attend, and manager Lou Piniella also will be visited at his
home in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, Rodriguez and Piniella all have contracts that expire
after the 2000 season. Like his two stars, Piniella expects a
possible contract extension will be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't discussed any extension at this point,''
Gillick said. ``Lou's focus is the same as everybody else's in the
organization _ on trying to get Alex and Kenny signed. I am a fan
of Lou's, and I think Lou's done an excellent job. ... With the
type of team we're hopefully going to put together, Lou's the best
guy for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella is doing his part. Last week, he flew to Miami to meet
with Rodriguez for several hours over lunch. The meeting was an
extension of the one they had in Texas the last week of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put on a salesman's job as well as I could,'' Piniella said
Monday in Tampa. ``It was a little more detailed (than in Texas). I
told him about the new ballpark, the re-commitment of ownership to
put a winning product on the field, the advantages of playing in
Seattle and how much he's respected and wanted by the organization,
his popularity with the fans. I told him, `Look, let's win a World
Series in Seattle.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's situation differs from Rodriguez's, since Griffey can
not be traded without his consent. Still, Griffey's agent, Brian
Goldberg, said the selection of Gillick was positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see Pat taking that job unless he feels like he can
succeed in the short-term,'' Goldberg said Monday. ``Pat's
situation doesn't lend itself to taking over a team where he's
told, `We don't expect you to do anything the first couple of
years.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the Mariners to do anything next year, they will need more
than Griffey and Rodriguez. Gillick, who will have a payroll budget
of as much as $70 million to use, said he recognized the Mariners'
``long shopping list.'' He said the team needs a leadoff hitter, a
left-handed hitting outfielder and infielder (probably at first
base), a left-handed reliever and a starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The starter Gillick is seeking, he said, is ``a veteran-type guy
who could fit in probably as a No. 2 or No. 3.'' That's the
strongest statement the Mariners have made about upgrading their
rotation, and it could indicate Gillick will pursue a free agent
such as Chuck Finley, David Cone, Kenny Rogers or Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   Another obvious fit is John Olerud, the New York Mets first
baseman and Seattle resident who played for Gillick in Toronto. The
Mets want to re-sign Olerud, but the free agent-to-be has been
non-committal about his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``With (Edgar) Martinez, Rodriguez and Griffey, along with the
pitching staff, I think we have a very good nucleus to be a very
competitive, exciting team,'' Gillick said. ``And if we add the
right pieces, we could challenge for the Western Division
championship. ... (But) we've got our work cut out for us the next
few months.''
</P>
<P>
   The payroll increase _ up from $53 million this year _ helps,
but Gillick said he would have taken the job without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say there are a lot of attractive situations, but
this was one of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the payroll was what it was last year, $55-$60 million, I
probably would have taken it, because it's a good, solid
organization with great fans and a new park. But going to $70
million allows you to sign (Griffey and Rodriguez) and also spend
some money to make the rest of the ballclub competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillick helped make the Blue Jays one of the leaders in
international scouting, and he made inroads in re-vamping the
Orioles' farm system as well. He pledged to make that a top
priority with the Mariners as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the rosters of major league teams, 40 percent
are international players,'' Gillick said. ``It's the
responsibility of the GM to use every tool possible to improve the
ballclub, be it in trades, free agency, the amateur draft, the
international market. You're not doing your job if you don't use
every area. That is one we need to develop further.''

 By JAYNE CUSTRED  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The images of Payne Stewart will always remain among the most vivid
in golf.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His knickers and tam-o'-shanter hat made him one of the most
recognizable players in the game, just as his fiery spirit made him
one of the most competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, fans flocked to Stewart, attracted at first
by his flamboyant style and cocky attitude. But in recent years, it
was his game that overpowered his wardrobe, earning him the respect
of his peers and a place in the history of the game for what he
won, not what he wore.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Stewart gave the game a montage of colorful
snapshots golf lovers won't soon forget.
</P>
<P>
   There was the brash, young Stewart at the 1989 PGA Championship,
talking cockily to reporters after besting a teary-eyed Mike Reid
by a stroke for his first major win. His victory speech bordered on
arrogance after Reid's heart-wrenching collapse at Kemper Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Stewart stood in glory on the 18th hole at
Hazeltine in Minnesota after winning an 18-hole playoff with Scott
Simpson to capture his first U.S. Open title.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1994 Masters, it was a different picture, as a surly,
frustrated Stewart leaned against the veranda at the clubhouse at
Augusta National, talking about giving up golf until he could get
his game _ and his attitude _ back up to par.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the 1995 Shell Houston Open, when a sympathetic but
satisfied Stewart watched his Orlando, Fla., neighbor Scott Hoch
drop seven strokes over the final 13 holes to force a playoff
Stewart would eventually win _ his first victory in four years.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most vivid images are the most recent ones.
Images of an older, wiser Stewart thrusting his arm in the air
after an incredible victory over Phil Mickelson in the 1999 U.S.
Open.
</P>
<P>
   And most poignant, the picture of Stewart, standing on the roof
of the clubhouse at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., squirting
champagne on the cheering masses and celebrating arm-in-arm with
his Ryder Cup teammates their record-setting come-from-behind
victory over the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   That was one month ago, and it should be the image golf fans
keep close to their hearts. It was, as it turned out, one of
Stewart's finest yet final moments.
</P>
<P>
   And with Stewart's death in a plane crash Monday, much of the
color disappeared from the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always remember that smile, that laugh and that
beautifully graceful swing,'' said Ben Crenshaw, who was captain of
the victorious 1999 Ryder Cup squad. ``He was 42 years old and
right in his golfing prime. He was doing the things he wanted to
achieve. This year had to give him so much pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if Stewart had come full circle. Born in Springfield,
Mo., and a product of Southern Methodist University, Stewart began
his PGA Tour career in 1981. However, he soon became better known
for his string of second-place finishes than his victories in the
1982 Quad Cities Open and 1983 Walt Disney World Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1983 and his 1989 win at the MCI Heritage Classic,
Stewart became jokingly known as ``Avis'' _ the man who was always
second, always having to try harder.
</P>
<P>
   But if Stewart was having trouble winning, he had no trouble
collecting admirers. Under contract with the NFL, Stewart soon
became best known for wearing knickers and hats in NFL team colors.
He was always decked out in the hometown team's colors for Sunday's
round.
</P>
<P>
   The fans loved his outfits, just as they loved his cocky
competitiveness, and Stewart established himself as a force on the
tour with two wins in 1989, including the PGA; two in 1990,
including the Byron Nelson Classic; and the 1991 Open victory.
</P>
<P>
   But then Stewart went into the worst slump of his career, going
winless for four years and winning just once _ in Houston _ in
eight years. Something would have to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the combination of a number of things,'' Stewart said
in 1996. ``There were so many variables. You've got to come out
here with a clear mind to do well. You can't have distractions. And
I couldn't handle them.''
</P>
<P>
   The distractions included a new equipment contract and the
construction of a 13,000-square-foot home in Orlando. But when it
was all said and done, and Stewart made the time to re-evaluate his
game, his goals and his life, he decided that perhaps it was time
for the cocky young kid to become a different sort of man.
</P>
<P>
   Family, friends and Christianity replaced golf as the top
priorities in Stewart's life, and his calmer yet equally
competitive demeanor on the golf course paved the way for the
greatest accomplishments of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart started the 1999 season by winning the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am, and afterward he talked about his new image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot older, and I'm a lot wiser,'' Stewart said. ``I'm
more mature. I'm not going to blink and miss my family growing up.
When I'm out at the golf course, I'm going to prepare myself to be
the best I can. And when I'm home, I'm going to be a father.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart came to Houston for the 1999 SHO as he did almost every
year. He was dedicated to Houston's PGA Tour event, playing in
Houston 14 out of the 17 years he was on tour.
</P>
<P>
   Houston golf fans also got to see another side of Stewart many
others did not. In addition to his love of the game, Stewart also
enjoyed music and played a mean harmonica. Most nights during the
SHO, Stewart could be found in the Bunker, on stage, playing
harmonica or singing with Austin band Duck Soup.
</P>
<P>
   And when he was on the golf course, no one drew bigger galleries
than Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a terrific fan favorite here,'' said Eric Fredricksen,
executive director of the Houston Golf Association. ``He's going to
be missed by everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who know him best say Stewart died a happy and
fulfilled man.
</P>
<P>
   In June, he etched a memory in everyone's mind when he sank a
15-foot par putt on the final hole at Pinehurst No. 2 in North
Carolina to win the U.S. Open by one stroke over Phil Mickelson. It
was the longest putt ever to decide an Open Championship on the
72nd hole in the event's 99-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Stewart talked about his newfound faith and his love
and gratitude for his wife, Tracey, and his children, 13-year-old
daughter Chelsea and 10-year-old son Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the fact that my faith in God is so much
stronger, and I'm so much more at peace with myself than I've ever
been in my life,'' Stewart said. ``Where I was with my faith last
year and where I am now is leaps and bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than three months later, Stewart would be part of another
amazing victory, as he and his Ryder Cup teammates staged the
greatest comeback in the history of the event to win at The Country
Club. Stewart was responsible for winning only a half-point in the
competition, but he was credited with inspiring a lot more with his
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great spirit he had,'' said Bruce Lietzke, Ryder Cup
assistant captain. ``He had a real inner drive. You could see it in
his eyes. Both on the course and off, he had such great competitive
spirit. And Payne was such a big part of the Ryder Cup. That spirit
of his was so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that spirit is what his friends and colleagues on the PGA
Tour are remembering, hoping to keep some of the magic that was
Stewart alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, as a golfer, Payne was everything I respect in a
golfer,'' said Ryder Cup teammate Jeff Maggert. ``The
competitiveness, the ability to play under pressure, his honesty,
his feelings, both good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the type of person who could tell you something you
didn't want to hear. He was the kind of guy who would come right
out and say it to you if it was something you needed to hear. He
was just a good person. He was just a lot of fun to be around. And
it's hard to have him gone.''

STARS AT THEIR WORST IN LOSS TO MAPLE LEAFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ This was the game the Stars feared when they first
learned their injury list had ballooned to include seven regulars.
</P>
<P>
   The young defensemen stepping in to play significant minutes
would falter. The offense with continuously rotating wingers on
each line would struggle to score. The team would be hard pressed
to win.
</P>
<P>
   The fears they had before playing Edmonton and New Jersey last
week were the reality they faced Monday night against Toronto. The
Maple Leafs exposed the Stars injury-induced weaknesses for a 4-0
victory at the Air Canada Centre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, our problem is without the puck. I think we're just
running around and guys are getting caught out of position and
trying to do too much,'' Stars center Mike Modano said. ``That's
the thing you run into when you have a lot of new guys.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Stars played their best game of the season in a 2-1
victory against New Jersey on Friday, Modano said they played their
worst Monday night. Stars coach Ken Hitchcock, coaching in his
300th NHL game, found the whole thing to be largely forgettable and
injuries to be nothing more than an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with injuries. Don't go there,''
Hitchcock said. ``I thought we were outplayed. Their best players
were better than our best players. With our situation and the way
our team is, we needed our best players to be great players in the
game and they weren't. They were poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The adjective is appropriate up and down the Stars lineup and in
every facet of their game. The defense was porous, combining for
nine of the Stars' 20 giveaways. The offense was sporadic,
struggling to get the puck through the neutral zone at times. The
power play was nonexistent, going 0-for-3.
</P>
<P>
   The result was obvious and easily summed up in a single word by
Hitchcock: ``Uncompetitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The game began snowballing out of control from the get-go with
the final indignity coming at 12:02 of the third period. Tomas
Kaberle scored the Leafs' fourth goal as two defenders swarmed to
cover Alyn McCauley, who dropped the puck back to Kaberle for an
easy goal.
</P>
<P>
   The last was like the first was like the second was like the
third. They all rolled together into one big loss.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Stars goalie Ed Belfour allowed four goals on 26 shots, but
shots isn't a fair description. Belfour really found himself facing
scoring chances. Their goals weren't as much shots as set 'em up,
shoot 'em down scoring chances provided by Stars breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came at us quick, and there were a lot of turnovers by
our defense and they got a lot of good chances off of it,'' Stars
defenseman Brad Lukowich said. ``I think the goals they scored were
given to them. They were chances that were obviously laid out right
in front of them and they buried them.''
</P>
<P>
   The first began when Stars defenseman Jamie Pushor coughed up
the puck in the neutral zone, allowing Maple Leafs center Nik
Antropov to skate across the blue line and fling a hard shot at
Belfour. He made the save, but the rebound popped out to Leafs
winger Mike Johnson, who had blown past Stars defenseman Alan
Letang. Johnson popped it in for an easy goal 2:08 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs' second goal was equally frustrating for the Stars.
There was another Leafs player (Steve Thomas) getting behind the
same Stars defenseman (Letang) and another Leafs goal (this time by
Thomas) for a 2-0 first-period lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially when things started going a little bad, I found
myself trying to run around instead of ... '' Letang said not
exactly knowing how to finish the sentence. ``Sometimes, it's tough
enough just to do your own job and do it for 60 minutes. And when
you start running around you get yourself out of position and you
are not helping your teammates and not helping yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs third goal at 3:26 of the third period may have been
the easiest. Their newest player, Dmitri Khristich, was standing
alone in front of Belfour when Antropov, from along the boards, put
the puck on the sweet part of Khristich's stick. He didn't have any
choice but to score.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, usually the poster children for positional hockey,
were killed by it Monday night. The silver lining in the otherwise
dark cloud that was last night is likely will be the last game they
play without Joe Nieuwendyk, Darryl Sydor and Richard Matvichuk.
The Stars expect to get three of their seven injured players back
for Saturday's game against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, for one, wasn't breathing any easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we're going to count on two or three guys coming
back in our lineup and all of a sudden that's going to jump start
us, we're wrong,'' Hitchcock said. ``That's not why we lost. We got
beat by a better team, but we also got outbattled and outworked by
a better team, and that's not right.'' nn

MAGIC OVERCOMES WEARY MAVERICKS

<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Exhausted from not having enough healthy bodies,
the Mavericks faded in the second half en route to dropping a
109-97 decision to the Orlando Magic on Monday night at the Orlando
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   With starters Michael Finley, Steve Nash, Gary Trent and Shawn
Bradley nursing injuries, a hodgepodge of fill-ins couldn't prevent
the Magic from stretching their preseason record to 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very, very happy with the first half, but we ran into a
fatigue factor after that,'' Mavericks coach/general manager Don
Nelson said. ``When you have as many players missing as we do, I
expect \Rfatigue\S to be a factor, and it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks led, 60-58, at intermission, but were outscored
24-11 in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   A late 7-0 run moved the Mavericks within 103-97. But Cedric
Ceballos missed a 3-point field goal with 37 seconds remaining, and
the Magic pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that shot would have gone in, that would have boosted us
up,'' said Ceballos, who finished with 19 points on 7-of-25
shooting. ``But we just got bad shooting percentage from everybody,
myself included.''
</P>
<P>
   Erick Strickland led the Mavericks with 20 points, five assists
and five rebounds, and Dirk Nowitzki scored 14. The Mavericks will
take a 2-4 record into their preseason finale against the Milwaukee
Bucks at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday at Reunion Arena. STRICKLAND SHINES
</P>
<P>
   He stayed on the trading block for most of this past summer.
Now, guard Erick Strickland is in the middle of the Mavericks'
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland is second on the team in scoring with 16.6 points per
game, and averages five rebounds and 3.8 assists in 29.6 minutes.
Strickland knows his playing time is because of injuries to guards
Steve Nash and Michael Finley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the way I'm playing, but we've got guys
injured,'' Strickland said. ``I'm playing solid and playing hard,
and I'm doing the best I can with the minutes that are given to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to be blessed to be playing because of injuries to others,
that's not good. However, I am happy to be able to get on the court
and be able to play.'' NBA CITY
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Mavericks players and coaches flocked to nearby
Universal Studios during their stay in Orlando to visit the NBA's
newest attraction _ NBA City.
</P>
<P>
   NBA City, which opened nearly two months ago, is a two-level
restaurant and interactive playground with various games and a gift
shop. There are also television monitors at most of the tables, and
two giant TV screens that constantly show video of NBA games.
</P>
<P>
   Among the footage involving Mavericks players were a reverse
layup by Hubert Davis, Minnesota's Kevin Garnett dunking over Shawn
Bradley, and highlights of coach/general manager Don Nelson during
his playing days with the Boston Celtics.

because of the possibility that some of its gigantic ice cap, which
contains about 90 percent of the world's ice, could slide into the
sea. If just part of the ice cap _ the West Antarctic Ice Sheet _
should do this, global sea level would swiftly rise by about 17

The skull is that of a young woman believed to have roamed the
savannah of south-central Brazil some 11,500 years ago. A
reconstruction of her cranium indicates that her features are
negroid rather than mongoloid, suggesting that the New World may
have initially been settled not only earlier than thought, but by a

wringing in obsessive compulsive disorder, the ringing in the ears
of tinnitus, the unrelenting discomfort of chronic pain and the
shaking and immobility seen Parkinson's disease all stem from the
same basic brain defect _ a decoupling of two brain regions that

MEMORIES OF STEWART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I vividly recall being a high school freshman and sitting in my
English class when we were informed another student, a friend of
mine, had collapsed and died during gym. I couldn't help but think,
``It's just not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   I had similar feelings when I heard Monday's distressing news
that Payne Stewart had perished in a learjet crash in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Why him?
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, one of more likeable figures in sports, was much more
than an accomplished player, a winner of two U.S. Opens and three
major championships. He was a character, someone with personality,
someone who clearly enjoyed life.
</P>
<P>
   And now he has been taken away from us.
</P>
<P>
   When I think of Stewart I, like almost everyone, think of the
knickers. Stewart said he went to the driving range at a tournament
one day and saw another pro wearing exactly the same outfit. He
decided to go back to the clubhouse for something different.
</P>
<P>
   Really different.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be worth it to tune in to the weekly golf telecasts
just to see what Stewart was wearing. For years, he'd be decked out
in colors of National Football League teams, from the red and white
of the Arizona Cardinals to the black and gold of the Pittsburgh
Steelers to the aquamarine of the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   I never liked aquamarine, by the way. Still don't.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, like the rest of us, wasn't infallible. Sometimes his
carefree personality got in the way. Did anyone catch his ESPN
interview a couple of days ago, in which he was asked to respond to
Peter Allis' diatribe of American golfers, particularly Ryder
Cuppers?
</P>
<P>
   Allis, a BBC commentator who also does work for ABC, was talking
about the Americans' wild celebration on the final day of the
recent matches and said, ``They're so different from Europeans they
might as well be Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart responded in his best Chinese impersonation, which was
not, to say the least, in good taste. He later apologized for his
ill-conceived mannerisms.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just Payne being Payne. Just as it was Payne being
Payne at this year's U.S. Open at Pinehurst, where he openly shed
tears after his stirring victory.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it was Payne being Payne at the Ryder Cup. He had
criticized the matches for losing their vitality, their sense of
urgency, and repeatedly warned his teammates they would hear Bruce
Springsteen's ``Born in the USA'' blasting off the hotel walls at
all hours of the day and night.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also was the consummate sportsman, such as when he
conceded Colin Montgomerie's birdie putt on the final hole of their
match -- in turn, giving Montgomerie a 1-up victory -- because he
realized The Country Club crowd was on the verge of bedlam.
</P>
<P>
   When I see golf now, I see wretched excess. I see money. I see
greed. What I don't see is much fun.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Stewart offered a refreshing change. Oh, he could
be deadly serious come tournament time, but he never let it get to
the point where he became another in the growing legion of golfing
robots whose goal in life is to say ``Pay me'' first and ``Thank
you'' later, if then.
</P>
<P>
   And what a golf swing. His peers only could dream of having the
same tempo and fluidity. If anyone could make the game look easy,
it was Stewart with that long, sweeping backswing and his knack for
staying in perfect balance.
</P>
<P>
   And now the smile, the swing and the zest for life are gone.
</P>
<P>
   It's just not fair.

HUNTER ENJOYS THE STAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Brian Hunter committed those two Game 1 errors
in one inning to tie an unwanted World Series record, he didn't
fret too long about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a game of ups and downs and that inning was one of
the downs,'' said Hunter, the Atlanta Braves' right-handed hitting
first baseman who platoons with Ryan Klesko and is scheduled to
start tonight against the New York Yankees' lefthander, Andy
Pettitte. ``This game constantly tests your toughness and resolve.
You just have to forget about what happened yesterday, and go on to
the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   At 31 years old, Brian Hunter, a 1985 graduate of Paramount High
who played two seasons at Cerritos College, has had his mettle
tested throughout his major league career that began in 1991 with
the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   It was that season he became an instant hero in Atlanta when he
hit a climactic two-run home run off the Pittsburgh Pirates' John
Smiley to seal a seventh game victory for the Braves in the NLCS
series.
</P>
<P>
   He would then play in all seven games of the World Series
against the Minnesota Twins, and it seemed as though the then
23-year-old Hunter had a bright future with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't quite work out that way for Hunter, as it doesn't
quite work out for a vast majority of men who play baseball for
wages.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he would remain with the Braves the next season when he
wound up batting .239 with 14 home runs and 41 RBI, but the
merry-go that would become his baseball existence would commence in
1993 when he split time between Atlanta and its top farm team,
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates, played a
few games for them in 1994, and then at mid-season was sent to the
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   He would split time between the Reds and their Triple A minor
league team, Indianapolis, the next season and would repeat the act
with the Seattle Mariners and Tacoma the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was becoming pretty frustrating,'' admits Hunter. It would
become even more frustrating for Hunter in 1997 after he signed a
minor league free agent contract with the Reds and wound up
spending the entire summer playing for Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was seriously considering quitting,'' says Hunter. ``I was
really down. I knew I was good enough to play in the majors, but
for various reasons it just wasn't happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like it at all playing in the Reds' organization. I
guess when you start with a class organization like the Braves, it
kind of spoils you. I was very unhappy with the Reds.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter was unhappy, but his strong-willed mother, Paulette
Marlowe, a Lakewood resident who works in the district attorney
office in Cerritos, instilled in her son a resilient work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to quit, but I'm not a quitter,'' says Hunter, whose
younger sister, Loree Moore, is a junior point guard star at
Narbonne High.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter would depart the Reds, and would spend most of the 1998
season with the St. Louis Cardinals, observing Mark McGwire's epic
march toward 70 home runs from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a spectacle that was,'' says Hunter, who, alas, for the
fourth consecutive season would spend a portion of it in the minors
(11 games at Calgary).
</P>
<P>
   Hunter would return to his Brave roots in the off-season, and
would find himself sharing duty at first base this summer with the
left-handed hitting Klesko after Andres Galarraga was diagnosed
with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared in 114 games during the regular season, and would
bat .249, hit six home runs and have 31 RBI in his 181 plate
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   And, once again he would be a NLCS star for the Braves, as his
eighth-inning, Game 7 single off the New York Mets' John Franco
would pull his team even at 8 and would send the game into extra
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Until he delivered his clutch hit, Hunter had been 0 for 13
during the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I waited for the right time to get a hit,'' he says,
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The stout, 6-0, 225-pounder is an amiable fellow whose face is
usually covered with a smile around the batting cage, and why not?
</P>
<P>
   Playing in his third World Series in the 1990s he saw action
against the Toronto Blue Jays in 1992 erases those harsh recent
memories of scuffling around in Richmond, Indianapolis, Tacoma and
Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you beat this?'' he says. ``And playing against the
Yankees? Wow. I grew up idolizing people like Reggie Jackson. It's
a tremendous experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a lucrative one, since Hunter is being kindly
indemnified by the Braves, earning a salary of $1.75 million this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't complain too much,'' says Hunter, who resides in the
off-season in Lake Elsinore with his wife and three-year-old son.
``Sure, I've had some tough times. But everyone has them in life.
I'm still in the big leagues. It's not that bad a life. And the pay
certainly is good.''

MCCAIN SAYS ATTACKS ARE EMANATING FROM BUSH CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ GOP presidential hopeful John McCain, in San
Francisco Monday to deliver a speech, turned on Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, charging that the Republican front-runner's campaign has
begun to orchestrate personal attacks against him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's unusually harsh comments came at a news conference when
he was asked his reaction to a New York Times story published
Monday that suggested his volatile temperament has become a
campaign issue. In the story, Arizona Gov. Jane Hull said McCain's
temper was a critical factor in her decision to support Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, the memo has gone out from the Bush campaign to
start attacking John McCain _ something I hoped wouldn't happen,''
said McCain, who spoke before the Bay Area Council. ``It's
unfortunate these types of personal attacks would be orchestrated
from the Bush campaign. ... We are closing in on them, (and) that
clearly has them unhappy. I hope they'll resort to other tactics if
they want to try and ding me up.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's comments came on the same day the GOP presidential
field shrank by one, with the defection of Pat Buchanan to the
Reform Party, and the Bush campaign announced the kickoff of its
television advertising campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   With the first real contests of the 2000 presidential race less
than 100 days away, McCain's comments illustrate the increasingly
competitive nature of the contest on the Republican side, which has
been dominated by Bush's poll numbers and fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Both McCain and Bush campaign officials in California all but
dismissed the Buchanan move Monday as insignificant to their
campaigns and the GOP. McCain, in his San Francisco news
conference, reacted to Buchanan's departure with the words of an
old country song: ``Thank God and Greyhound he's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's California chair, Gerald Parsky, said Buchanan's views
were ``basically rejected by the Republican Party, and certainly by
Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Buchanan shift could affect the GOP hopefuls. A Field
Poll last week showed that the former TV commentator's Reform Party
candidacy would siphon off enough Republican voters in California's
March open primary to give Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
front-runner, a symbolic victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do have reason to worry, but we're very early in the
process,'' said Field Poll director Mark DiCamillo, adding that
Buchanan's run ``seems to take more votes from Bush than (would)
any of the other third-party candidates,'' including Minnesota Gov.
Jesse Ventura, billionaire Donald Trump and party founder Ross
Perot.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, who appears to have made it a two-man race in New
Hampshire and New York _ where he has cut Bush's lead in half _
instead saved his ammunition for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, who has called on fellow GOP candidates to
abide by Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment and not speak ill of each
other, pointedly accused the Bush campaign of launching an open
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to get rough, and I'm sorry about that. Because, as
you know, I have never said anything about Gov. Bush, any of his
supporters, any of his people,'' he said. ``That's not the kind of
campaign I'm going to run, even if it would gain me (something)
short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Bush was abiding by the 11th commandment, McCain said,
``I don't know if he personally is _ but his campaign isn't. ... He
never announced he was taking the 11th commandment, but I did and
I'm sticking to it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was ``intrigued'' that the New York Times article
included personally critical comments from Michigan Gov. John
Engler, because ``I think I've met the guy twice.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCain expressed surprise at the harsh criticism from
Arizona's governor, saying he has consistently supported Hull, her,
 &LR; campaigned with her and even given her his contributor list.
</P>
<P>
   ``She expressed her gratitude on many occasions ... so her
depiction of our relationship doesn't really coincide with the
facts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also noted that the Bush campaign has indicated ``they're
going to spend several million dollars in Arizona,'' adding, ``They
even put the governor's son on the payroll. I think they're very
generous.''
</P>
<P>
   In another shot at Bush, McCain said the GOP front-runner has no
problem running expensive TV ads, but he noted that Bush has
declined to participate in two debates this month because he says
``people aren't interested'' in the race yet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's California campaign spokeswoman, Margita Thompson, was
quick to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he has always done, Gov. Bush is running a positive,
issue-oriented campaign based on his message of improving schools,
strengthening our national defense and cutting taxes,'' she said.
``As he has said before, he likes Sen. McCain as a person and will
treat him with respect.''

REP. CAMPBELL SET TO ANNOUNCE BID FOR SEN. FEINSTEIN'S SEAT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARK SIMON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Undaunted by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein's
commanding lead in recent statewide polls, Republican Rep. Tom
Campbell will declare Tuesday that he is preparing to run against
the popular Democrat, according to GOP sources.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who represents the southern part of the San Francisco
Bay Area, has scheduled a 6 p.m. news conference at the Capitol
Hill Club in Washington, D.C., and sources confirm that he will
announce he has formed an exploratory committee with the
expectation that he will run for Senate next year. Campbell, 47,
the only Republican in the Bay Area delegation, would not comment
on the matter Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell would give the GOP a contender with solid credentials
as a moderate, a record that has hurt him within his own party but
is considered an asset when challenging Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   If he runs, Campbell will give up the traditionally Democratic
South Bay seat he has represented only  &LR; since 1995. It is a seat
Democrats say they can win back as part of their drive to regain
the majority in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   He would be joining as many as three other Republicans in the
race to unseat Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   High technology entrepreneur Ron Unz, who sponsored a statewide
initiative banning bilingual education, declared his candidacy
earlier this month. San Diego County Supervisor Bill Horn and state
Sen. Ray Haynes of Riverside also are expected to run for the GOP
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein has no Democratic opposition for the March 7 primary
election. She is far ahead of her potential Republican challengers,
according to the latest Field Poll, which showed her attracting 55
percent of the likely voters in an open primary.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was in second place in the poll, but trailed Feinstein
by 44 points.
</P>
<P>
   However, Campbell backers insist other polling shows Feinstein's
lead to be much smaller and her vulnerability much greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not behind her by 25 points, but he is behind her by 15
to 20,'' said a Republican strategist. ``He's definitely got a shot
at her. She's a lot more vulnerable than the conventional wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein supporters had been nervous about the entry of a
moderate, like Campbell, but Monday insisted that he poses no
special threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is a serious candidate and he is a tough opponent _
and we'll be ready for him,'' said Feinstein's campaign adviser,
Kam Kuwata. ``But I would say the same thing about other
candidates'' running for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   As a two-term congressman, Campbell ran for the Senate in 1992,
losing the Republican primary to conservative TV commentator Bruce
Herschensohn, who lost the general election to Democrat Barbara
Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell returned to Congress in 1995, winning a special
election to replace Democrat Norm Mineta, who surrendered the 15th
District seat he had held since 1974 to pursue a career in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1992 Senate race, Campbell was plagued by accusations
from his conservative rivals that he was too liberal for the
Republican Party, particularly for his positions in support of
abortion rights and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives in the congressional caucus say that this time
they will support Campbell, and some of them have begun introducing
Campbell to key supporters in their districts, including Orange
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``He isn't a squishy moderate,'' said one member of the state's
GOP delegation. ``He is exactly the same as Dianne Feinstein on
some issues _ gun control and abortion and campaign finance and gay
rights, to name four. ... On other issues, he is much sturdier than
most Republicans _ on spending, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Senate, where everybody is blown over by a light wind,
he'll be very strong. He doesn't have trouble staking out a
position and sticking to it.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about Feinstein's vulnerability, other
political insiders said Campbell is getting into the race late and
would be better off to wait until 2004, when Boxer faces
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell's decision is due, in part, to the possibility that
he might lose his tenure as a professor at Stanford Law School,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue was forced,'' said a Campbell backer.
</P>
<P>
   A teacher at the law school since 1983, Campbell was the
youngest tenured professor in the school's history.
</P>
<P>
   When he launched his political career, running for Congress in
1988, he essentially went on leave from the law school, teaching
only one course per session. He currently teaches at Stanford's
Washington campus.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Sullivan, recently named dean of the law school, has
been negotiating with Campbell to return to teaching full time or
to surrender his tenured position. That put Campbell in the
position of having to decide between remaining in Congress or
returning to Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Should Campbell lose the Senate race, he has been promised he
can return to full-time teaching at the law school, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   A changed atmosphere in Republican politics also has encouraged
Campbell to run, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at his record, he's the epitome of the new
California voter _ a fiscal conservative who is a social
libertarian,'' said one veteran GOP strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Key backers of Texas Gov. George W. Bush's campaign for
president say Campbell will be an asset to the GOP ticket's efforts
to win California, and they also have been urging him to run,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush people perceive Campbell will give a more moderate
view to the ticket in California,'' said a source.
</P>

THE AESTHETICS OF HOMELESSNESS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Leave It to Homeless Beaver:
<P>
   In Contra Costa County, the Public Health Dept. and the
``Continuum of Care Board'' are producing a documentary film on
county homeless families. During the planning, there has been
discussion of finding ``good homeless families.''
</P>
<P>
   Several possible scenes have been rejected by the public health
employees in charge of the project. Reason: ``Too depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the film could show them digging some half-eaten Happy
Meals out of Dumpsters.
</P>
<P>
   GO YANKEES! Please get the World Series over in a hurry. I'm
depressed by the thought of a seven-game series dominated by TV
close-ups of Joe Torre's morose mug. Joe, it's baseball!
</P>
<P>
   Although I'd be grumpy, too, if I was manager of the mighty
Yankees and they made me wear a hotel towel around my neck to stay
warm. Man, them sophisticated Noo Yawkuhs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a Yankee sweep would prevent the Atlanta fans from going
public again with their humiliating war chant and tomahawk chop.
May they all develop repetitive-stress injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Atlanta: You bribed your way into the '96 Olympics, now
you're trailer-trashing another World Series. Give it a rest,
y'all.
</P>
<P>
   MR. EAT, the beloved free-range dilettante restaurant
pseudo-expert, took me to the Red Herring, just off the
Embarcadero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best fish menu I've seen,'' Mr. Eat said, perspiring with
anticipation. ``Not as heavy as McCormick &AMP; Kuleto's, which is the
`War and Peace' of seafood menus, but a real page-turner
nonetheless.''
</P>
<P>
   They've got a major fishing theme going at the Red Herring, but
stopped tastefully short of having waiters with Cap'n Ahab peg
legs. Mr. Eat went nuts for the fish tacos with the house's Hell
Sauce. He gives the place (on scale of 5) a 4.5 for food, 4.5 for
'tude and 4 to 5 for mood, depending on whether you get a view
table _ at the front sidewalk, or facing the bay.
</P>
<P>
   HOW HOT is the Bay Area economy? Even lifelong losers are
cruising down Easy Street. At Van Ness and Mission, Larry Davis saw
a brand new BMW with plates: W LOMAN.
</P>
<P>
   Davis says, ``Maybe Willy finally got the severance package and
stock options he was entitled to.''
</P>
<P>
   CELL PHUNNIES: On the 19 Polk Muni bus, the driver whips out his
cell and makes three separate calls. Good to know our Muni drivers
have such fine hand-eye-mouth coordination.
</P>
<P>
   My inside spy says BART train operators are encouraged to use
their personal cell phones while driving, because the train radio
system is so shaky.
</P>
<P>
   KoolBrit was in her night school class when the professor
excused himself in mid-lecture, mid-sentence, to answer and chat on
his ringing cell.
</P>
<P>
   Night Train says to watch the crowd shots at the World Series,
look for cell-u-lites. He spotted four during one playoff game
telecast and was disgusted. Using a cell phone in the stands at the
World Series is, of course, a quality-of-life crime.
</P>
<P>
   And Chris Beach springs to the defense of cell-bashers who
criticize the use of cell phones in public rest rooms. ``How else
are those people supposed to answer the call of nature?''
</P>
<P>
   IDEAL FOR TAP-DANCING: Don Doolittle, driving on Howard between
First and Second, noted the plethora of the huge steel plates used
as temporary covers for potholes, ditches and construction craters.
</P>
<P>
   ``One steel plate was covering another steel plate,'' he says.
``Has the first steel plate been there so long that it developed
potholes?''
</P>
<P>
   DOG FREAKS, and you know who you are, be aware of the Halloween
costume party for pooches at the El Cerrito dog park (Saturday,
noon to 3). It's a charity event and games include bobbing for
pigs' ears.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's best-costumes prizes went to a Leonardo-and-Kate
``Titanic'' duo, in tuxes and lifejackets, and a greyhound dressed
as a bus.
</P>
<P>
   WE CAN'T AFFORD shelters for all the homeless, but why can't we
buy 'em some secondhand shopping carts? Many have called and
written to suggest: Have the city, or corporate donors, pop for a
fleet of shopping carts, so Safeway and Cala can have back their
carts and the homeless can have a shred of dignity and mobility.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely that news of the cart giveaway would set off a
national gold-rush-type fever among the homeless. ``Let's go to
'Frisco; there's free carts in them thar streets!''
</P>
<P>
   TIP TO THE HOMELESS: Low profile.
</P>
<P>
   Stick to the shadows, back streets and alleys. The pattern seems
to be that the city powers, the murkily anonymous folk who call
these shots, don't like high-visibility public gatherings of the
downtrodden in places like Civic Center and U.N. plazas.
</P>
<P>
   The cart crackdown, though called off before it was cranked up,
would have given the homeless more of a just-passing-through look,
and would have ended the circled-wagon-train of carts at U.N.
Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The Marin sandwich kids were chased out of Civic Center Plaza to
a park well off the tourist path. And last week, two Food Not Bombs
activists were busted for handing out bagels and juice in U.N.
Plaza, where they were drawing a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Since those arrests: Not one single reported case among the
homeless of bagel-borne botulism.

 &HT;    Residents of Everglades town feel forgotten
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAHOKEE, Fla. _ What got to Larry Wright was that business on
the radio about how some of the golf courses in West Palm Beach and
Jupiter, Fla., were closed. Call FEMA! The fairways were flooded.
</P>
<P>
   Golfing.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine.
</P>
<P>
   This suggestion that a lost leisure was somehow equal to
suffering did not sit right with the man who had been without
electricity for 115 long, hot hours. He couldn't do laundry or
watch TV or turn on the light by his bed. He was worried sick about
his mother, afraid she was going to drop over from the heat. ``Day
after day, I just watched her deteriorate,'' said Wright. ``The
heat took it out of her.''
</P>
<P>
   During the days, he helped neighbors and friends haul tree
trunks. He chopped wood. He drove around town and checked on his
oaks and mangoes. Had all his favorite landmarks made it through
the storm? Then at night he sat, hot and tired, waiting for the
darkness to end and the air to kick on. Four days and( 19 hours
later it finally did.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, Larry Wright was mad.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Irene might have arrived last weekend wearing a pink
pastel suit and white gloves, but there was nothing nice about what
she did to the Glades. First off, she surprised the heck out of
these lake communities. They were expecting a polite little blow,
not a storm that would send them to the center of their homes,
hearts thumping. Irene came through and uprooted old mango trees
and toppled power lines and flooded streets with sewage. About
20,000 people in Palm Beach County were without power after she
came and went. According to Betty Nunez with Florida Power &AMP; Light
Co., Belle Glade was the last pocket of the county to get totally
restored _ about 200 homes early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, somebody somewhere had to be last.
</P>
<P>
   But the people here want to know: Does it always have to be
them?
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall feeling in town, quite frankly, was 'Hey, we had a
hurricane out here. Doesn't anyone know it?' `` Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, a Pahokee, Fla., boy from birth, has survived this
redheaded stepchild stuff before. Something happens and the
politicians and the news folks stream to the other neighborhoods,
not the Glades. They go to the neighborhoods closer to the coast so
they can pop in and out and still be home in time for Dan Rather.
They go to the neighborhoods with more money, more influence. But
this time _ who knows, maybe it was the heat _ this time around,
the snubbing hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a struggle,'' Wright said. ``Just the everyday things
were hard. Like, I was tired of looking at the carpet. It was
covered with leaves and dirt, but I couldn't run the vacuum
cleaner.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and Mr. Larry Wright would like to ask one last thing:
</P>
<P>
   Does anybody out there care?
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning a week ago:
</P>
<P>
   I cleaned up the dishes from our impromptu Friday night
hurricane party with friends while my husband hauled a tree limb
from the pool. Thank goodness the cable was back on. What an
inconvenience! It had been out for almost 12 hours, but luckily
we'd slept through most of it. Whew. Our kid played Nintendo 64. We
had grilled cheese and soup for lunch, then hung out, played
Payday!, went to a movie, then crashed in the cool quiet of the
bedroom about 11 o'clock. The next day we watched baseball on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning a week ago:
</P>
<P>
   Dot Abrams, her husband, Everett, and their two kids woke up
after the storm had passed. They could not believe how strong those
winds had been. That was unbelievable! That was a hurricane! They
were hot and sweaty and still tired. Then Dot started worrying
about all that food in her refrigerator. Would the power come back
on before it all went bad?
</P>
<P>
   Dot Abrams is pretty darn sure Hurricane Irene roared right past
her tidy little house in Pahokee that night. ``It was loud,'' she
said. They lost the mango tree in the back yard, and the neighbor's
tree was pulled up by its roots, crumbling their storage shed. They
also lost power _ for five very long days.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, who works at Pahokee Elementary School, a quick walk
from her house, watched as the houses around her began to light up
in the days after the storm. The neighbors across the street. The
neighbors behind her. All her colleagues at work. They were
blow-drying their hair and making chicken and rice for dinner and
watching television at night. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, their lives
were pretty much back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   But Dot Abrams was still driving the whole family to her
sister's house to shower. She and Everett, a probation officer,
were forking out money they didn't have for restaurant meals. The
laundry was piling up. And the heat was relentless. Finally, the
neighbor across the street ran an extension cord to their house so
they could have a fan at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, just after lunch on Wednesday, just as everyone at
school was going on and on about poor Dot and how this wasn't fair
and wondering to anyone who would listen, Where was the help, just
as Dot Abrams thought she just might be at her wit's end, a half
dozen or so workers from Tennessee _ just a few of the 4,000
workers FPL contracted with for storm cleanup _ got things hooked
back together on the power pole behind her house.
</P>
<P>
   Everett turned on the air conditioning right quick. And Dot
Abrams, a woman of few words, smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Pahokee Fire Chief Gary Burroughs has heard it a million times
over: No one cares about us out here. We don't get our fair share
of county dollars. We don't get our fair share of county attention.
We don't get our fair share of help.
</P>
<P>
   He listens. ``If that's their perception, I wouldn't challenge
it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean he always agrees.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Burroughs thinks the crews got there fast
enough. ``You can't fix power lines in standing water,'' he says.
He thinks the Red Cross workers were a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks people in his town feel ignored and forgotten for one
very simple reason: They are.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a nice community when I moved here in 1966,''
Burroughs says. ``But a lot of people have moved away and because
less and less people are living here, there seems to be less and
less of a concern from the county commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a bunch of Century Village retirees have something to
complain about, they get on their Century Village bus and go to the
county commission. We don't have a Century Village bus out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think anyone starved. We take care of each other
out here.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what Kathryn Davis, 44, did when her lights came on at
2:13 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. Well, really, she beamed. She put her hands over her
heart and looked at that ceiling light as though it were an emerald
the size of her fist and Indiana Jones himself had just handed it
to her.
</P>
<P>
   She remembered to thank God.
</P>
<P>
   She remembered to thank her neighbors, who had pulled together
and warmed her heart, even though what she'd really needed was a
burst of cold air.
</P>
<P>
   She remembered to close the windows and crank up the air.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, she remembered that first.

 &HT;    The dangers of my car's interior
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Truth is, I never even heard the siren.
There's no telling how long those red and blue lights had been
flashing in my rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   When I pulled off the side of the country road I had no idea I
was being followed. I was too busy.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the police officer had climbed out of his cruiser
and was approaching my car, I had already thrown open the driver's
door, jumped out, whipped off a sneaker, and begun beating the
daylights out of the steering wheel. The policeman looked puzzled
but asked politely, ``Ma'am, what are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   A rhetorical question since he could clearly see (and hear) what
I was doing.
</P>
<P>
   I was jumping around and swearing like a shameless sailor. The
young officer appeared a bit nonplussed to see a person of my
gender and apparent age, carrying on like something he'd be hauling
out of a riverfront bar on Saturday night. Then, I started to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am, calm down now,'' he said sounding as gentle as a guy
with a gun strapped to his belt possibly can. ``I've been following
you for a while trying to figure out what's going on. You haven't
been speeding. Truth is, I clocked you at 18 m.p.h. on the road,
and 12 on the shoulder. Please don't cry; I'm not going to arrest
you.'' I told him that wasn't why I was crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm crying because there's a bug in my car and I can't find it
and if I get back in that car it's going to crawl on me and then
I'll have a wreck.'' I could tell he was having a hard time not
laughing by the way he kept biting his upper lip and scrunching his
eyes. Instead, he offered to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me what happened,'' he said. Minutes later I was pretty
sure he was sorry he'd asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on my way home from Fremont (a nearby town where four days
a week I spend two torturous hours in a gym trying to reverse the
ravages of time and butter pecan ice cream), and I was driving
along (snuffle) when this hairy-legged spider dropped from the sun
visor onto the steering wheel and just sat there looking at me. He
was all (here I exhaled dramatically and aspirated) HAIRY!''
</P>
<P>
   The officer, chin raised, lips parted, nodded slowly. Suddenly,
I was listening to myself, and wondering if he was getting ready to
call for backup _ the kind with the padded doors. I took a deep
breath and started over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spider was sitting on the horn button; I was trying not to
look at him because I could tell he was getting nervous by the way
one of his legs was twitching.'' Stupid, I say to myself. You're
telling too much. Just explain what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I was trying to find something to hit the spider with while
I was driving, but the only thing I could think of was my sneaker
and that's why I kept running off the side of the road _ I was
trying to take it off. But I'm short, and I have to sit real close
to the steering wheel so I can reach the clutch, and that's why I
couldn't get my foot out from under it to take off my shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am,'' the nice policeman said, leaning into the car, ``let
me see if I can't find that spider and kill it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right, I've heard this one before. He's going to slap at
the steering wheel a few times and then tell me it's dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to show me the body,'' I said right up front so
there'd be no ugly misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   He asked if I were related to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   After much thrashing, the officer emerged triumphant and showed
me the remains on the bottom of my shoe. ``That's only one leg,'' I
whined. He said it was the best he could do since the rest of the
bug had run back under the horn button.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drive carefully now, Ma'am,'' he said, touching the brim of
his hat and heading for his cruiser. ``You'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him to say. I had another four miles to go shut up in
my car with a seven-legged spider who, by this time, has got to be
madder than hell. But I thanked him anyway.

 &HT;    Rescuers rise as tot's cancer straps family
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In early July when 20-month-old Logan
Lewis of West Palm Beach fell ill, a pediatrician found nothing the
matter, and sent the child home.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the toddler grew worse and was taken to the emergency
room. And while the admitting physician also could find nothing to
explain the child's distress, he saw something he thought the
parents needed to explain: bruising.
</P>
<P>
   What had they been doing to this child? he asked pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, Sean and Mary Lewis of West Palm Beach, were
clearly distressed at the implication and showed the sick youngster
to their neighbors and good friends, Liz and Tim Hulett. The
Huletts own Hulett Environmental Services in Riviera Beach, where
Sean works in termite control. The Lewises could not have guessed
just how good their friends would prove to be.
</P>
<P>
   Liz, a former medical technologist, took one look at the bruises
on Logan and thought, ``My God, this child has leukemia!'' She
didn't say that, of course. What she said was, ``What did the blood
tests show?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood test? They never tested his blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan Lewis did not only have leukemia, he had an especially
rare kind of leukemia that defies the conventional chemotherapy
regime and comes back stronger. Despite intensive treatment at St.
Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach, the child was near death.
But not for lack of support from the home team.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, an endless stream of Hulett Environmental Services
employees, dozens in all, queued up to donate blood and platelets
for Logan's many transfusions. One employee, Dan Clarey, called The
Palm Beach Post to remark on the extraordinary turnout. The women
in the office, he said, cooked meals for the family, cleaned house,
bought groceries and contributed money.
</P>
<P>
   When I stopped by the Hulett's offices in Riviera Beach, Tim and
Liz confirmed Clarey's remarks and provided details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Logan is being treated at St. Jude's Hospital in Memphis,''
said Tim. ``They specialize in treating childhood cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire Lewis family is staying at St. Jude's Target House
while Logan is being prepared for a marrow transplant from his
sister, Kelcie, 7. And while treatment and lodging are free, the
family has no income except what the Hulett employees can give
until Sean can return to work in December, if all goes well.
</P>
<P>
   The family's medical insurance for uncovered expenses does not
cover out-of-state treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until a family has experienced what the Lewises are going
through,'' Liz said, ``they can have no idea of the economic
devastation such an illness can bring. The bills just keep piling
up, homes go into foreclosure, cars go back to the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   I felt mean about the question I needed to ask: Is it really
necessary for both parents to stay months with the child? Couldn't
the father stay home and work?
</P>
<P>
   The answer was yes, certainly, if you were willing to forget
what it must be like for a sick child in the throes of chemotherapy
without at least one parent always on hand to comfort him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistically, children without both parents fail very
quickly,'' explained Liz.
</P>
<P>
   Tim added: ``Every time the child sees a nurse or a doctor, he
thinks he's going to be stuck with a needle.''
</P>
<P>
   At St. Jude's, the parents stay with their child by shifts,
waving as they pass. The other children need parents, too. If one
parent catches cold or flu, he or she cannot go into the hospital.
Sniffles can kill. So the parents stay near the hospital. For
months, if need be.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Palm Beach County, the Lewises' friends have not
been idle.
</P>
<P>
   When, through the pest control company, a member of the Palm
Beach Chapter of the Air Conditioning Contractors of America
learned that the family's wall unit air conditioners would have to
be replaced by central air with asthma filters, the group quickly
got the components donated by members. On a recent Saturday, a host
of volunteer work crews installed central air and the ductwork.
Days later, an electrical contractor's group from Fort Lauderdale
turned out to rewire the Lewises' house for the new air
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked how it was possible that the Lewises would even
have a home when they returned, Tim said, cryptically: ``That's
been taken care of.'' How long, I wondered, had Sean Lewis been
with the company to earn such loyalty, both from his employer and
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean came to work for us in May of this year,'' his boss said.
</P>
<P>
   I probably looked as amazed as I felt because Tim added: ``We
have known Sean and Mary for years. We live on the same street.
Their daughters look up to our daughters as big sisters.'' Until
May, Sean was a career boat captain. Then he told Tim that he was
ready to take a cut in pay if he could find a job that kept him at
home with his family.
</P>
<P>
   If you know the Lewises, don't let on that you read about them
in the newspaper or that they have an air-conditioned and rewired
house waiting for them when they return with Logan. That's a
surprise. And if you wanted to add to that surprise, you might send
a note with a little something to The Logan Lewis Trust Fund, 1959
W. Ninth St., Riviera Beach, FL 33404.

 &HT;    Give gifts, but go easy on the plastic
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An outfit in Utah is offering _ ``just in time for
X-mas'' _ a credit card with a $4,000 credit limit.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that this service would cost you $39.95. Nor will I
go into the question of whether the offer is legitimate. What
really bugs me is the thought that getting another credit card is
the best way to prepare for an expensive holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the things you really need and want,'' the solicitation
urges. ``Don't go another holiday season stressed out because you
don't have enough money. ... We're ready to give you the credit
your deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Bah! Humbug!
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to spend too much is a real problem, of course.
Last year, American households spent an average of $1,148 for the
December holidays, according to American Express. Many of those
families spent more than they could afford, and a high percentage
were paying off holiday debts for many months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The temptation to use credit is just phenomenal,'' said Sharon
Cabeen, education director at the Consumer Credit Counseling
Service of Greater Atlanta. ``The closer the holiday gets and the
faster the pace gets, the more tempting it is to take the easy way
and charge it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the solution is not more credit cards. If you don't have the
money now, chances are you won't have it when the bills start
coming due.
</P>
<P>
   The real way to get ready for the biggest spending season of the
year is to draw up a spending plan and make it work. Using the
worksheet, you can follow this three-step approach to avoiding
financial wrecks:
</P>
<P>
   1. Set a savings goal. This is, in a rough way, what you can
realistically afford to spend for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to look at your income from here to there and your
routine expenses,'' said Cabeen. The difference in those is the
amount of holiday cash you can save. Divide that by the number of
weeks or paydays you have coming between now and the holidays, and
you have a weekly savings goal.
</P>
<P>
   Your total spending might be higher, of course. If you already
have put some money aside, add it in. If you will use credit cards,
add that to your total spending target.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you should set a goal for how much you will be able to
charge,'' Cabeen warned. ``You shouldn't charge more than you can
pay off in 60 to 90 days.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Work out a spending plan. Using the worksheet, write down how
much you want to spend for each category. Maybe you should use a
pencil for the first trip down the list.
</P>
<P>
   When you get to the bottom line, compare it to your total
spending target. If you want to spend more than you plan to have,
start over.
</P>
<P>
   You can balance the numbers two ways: Cut back on routine
spending, or increase your income. You might cut back on eating out
for the next two months, for example. Or you might be able to boost
income, perhaps by taking a part-time job for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Many savvy shoppers trim expenses the old-fashioned way: hitting
the sales, particularly on the days after Thanksgiving. Another
alternative is shopping for discounts on the Internet. One place to
start is www.amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another is choosing gifts that have sentimental rather than
cash value, such as framed family photographs. You can find other
ideas at www.newdream.org. Search for Christmas-related pages.
You'll find some inspired ideas, side-by-side with gooey
sentimentality. You decide which is which.
</P>
<P>
   3. Shop early and not too often. Using the third section of the
worksheet, make yourself a list of who you are buying for, what you
want to give and what you expect to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have a list, you end up buying a lot more than
you intended to buy,'' said Jan Holman, who is both a certified
financial planner and an executive of American Express. ``You know:
This thing looks good for your sister, and so does that thing, and
so does the next thing you see.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this process, your goal is to get a grip on yourself
before you whip out your checkbook or credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Having a plan may also make it easier to get an early and
focused start, meaning that you won't spend as much time wandering
the malls and snatching up unwanted items.
</P>
<P>
   One last tip: Forget about that ``X-mas'' credit card. The ads
seem to suggest that plastic is the same thing as gold. Only
suckers will believe that.

   1. Set a savings goal. This is, in a rough way, what you can
realistically afford to spend for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to look at your income from here to there and your
routine expenses,'' said Cabeen. The difference in those is the
amount of holiday cash you can save. Divide that by the number of
weeks or paydays you have coming between now and the holidays, and
you have a weekly savings goal.
</P>
<P>
   Your total spending might be higher, of course. If you already
have put some money aside, add it in. If you will use credit cards,
add that to your total spending target.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you should set a goal for how much you will be able to
charge,'' Cabeen warned. ``You shouldn't charge more than you can
pay off in 60 to 90 days.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Work out a spending plan. Using the worksheet, write down how
much you want to spend for each category. Maybe you should use a
pencil for the first trip down the list.
</P>
<P>
   When you get to the bottom line, compare it to your total
spending target. If you want to spend more than you plan to have,
start over.
</P>
<P>
   You can balance the numbers two ways: Cut back on routine
spending, or increase your income. You might cut back on eating out
for the next two months, for example. Or you might be able to boost
income, perhaps by taking a part-time job for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Many savvy shoppers trim expenses the old-fashioned way: hitting
the sales, particularly on the days after Thanksgiving. Another
alternative is shopping for discounts on the Internet. One place to
start is www.amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another is choosing gifts that have sentimental rather than
cash value, such as framed family photographs. You can find other
ideas at www.newdream.org. Search for Christmas-related pages.
You'll find some inspired ideas, side-by-side with gooey
sentimentality. You decide which is which.
</P>
<P>
   3. Shop early and not too often. Using the third section of the
worksheet, make yourself a list of who you are buying for, what you
want to give and what you expect to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have a list, you end up buying a lot more than
you intended to buy,'' said Jan Holman, who is both a certified
financial planner and an executive of American Express. ``You know:
This thing looks good for your sister, and so does that thing, and
so does the next thing you see.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this process, your goal is to get a grip on yourself
before you whip out your checkbook or credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Having a plan may also make it easier to get an early and
focused start, meaning that you won't spend as much time wandering
the malls and snatching up unwanted items.
</P>
<P>
   One last tip: Forget about that ``X-mas'' credit card. The ads
seem to suggest that plastic is the same thing as gold. Only
suckers will believe that.

 &HT;    NUTS &AMP; BOLTS: Don't fall behind when autumn chores beckon
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaves. They're the reason we call it fall.
</P>
<P>
   Waving overhead in all their red-and-gold glory one day; sodden
and wretched underfoot the next. That's nature's little practical
joke on those of us with lawns to rake and gutters to clean.
</P>
<P>
   Well, we might as well get to it.
</P>
<P>
   CLEANING GUTTERS
</P>
<P>
   At least twice a year you need to get up on your ladder and
clean out leaves and other debris. In the spring, you're cleaning
out the junk that hit the roof over the winter. At this time of
year, you're dealing mostly with leaves. Sometimes one cleaning in
late fall after most of the leaves have fallen is enough, but if
you have lots of tall shade trees around your house you may need to
repeat the process a couple times.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't clean out the leaves, they decompose and clog the
gutters and downspouts. That impedes the flow of water and can lead
to everything from roof leaks to ice dams to damp basements to
sagging gutters.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning gutters is a simple matter of scooping out leaves and
other junk and throwing them away. The challenge is doing the job
without falling off the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Lean an extension ladder against the house, not against the
gutters. If you have trouble reaching the gutters with the ladder,
buy a U-shaped stabilizer that holds the ladder out from the wall a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   Place the ladder so the distance from the feet of the ladder to
the house is about one-fourth the height of the ladder. For
instance, if the top of the ladder is 12 feet off the ground, the
base of the ladder should be about three feet out from the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the ladder is on level ground; on uneven ground, use
wood shims to level the legs.
</P>
<P>
   If the ground slopes away from the house, place a 2-by-4 board
on the downslope side of the base of the ladder and drive stakes
into the ground to hold the board in place.
</P>
<P>
   While you're up on the ladder, don't try to reach any more than
two feet to either side. Move the ladder often and keep your weight
centered as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Scoop the leaves and other debris out of each section of the
gutter and inspect the gutter as you go.
</P>
<P>
   Look for low spots in the gutter and indications that water is
not flowing smoothly. Also check for loose seams, holes or rust
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've cleaned a section of gutter, run water from a garden
hose through it to make sure it's not sagging or leaking.
</P>
<P>
   Leaky seams usually can be fixed with a tube of gutter caulk,
which is found with other caulks or with gutter and downspout
supplies at hardware and home-improvement stores.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape away mild rust deposits with a wire brush, then coat the
exposed metal with rust-inhibiting paint.
</P>
<P>
   Small cracks and holes can be sealed by applying a patch held in
place inside the gutter with roofing cement. The sheet metal used
for roof flashing makes a good patch, but heavy aluminum foil or
plastic sheets also work.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure water coming out of the downspouts is carried two feet
or more from the house and that the lawn slopes away from the house
at least a little where the water is released.
</P>
<P>
   Storm water emptied too close to the house can saturate the
ground and leak through cracks into your basement. The same goes
for water that leaks out or spills over gutters.
</P>
<P>
   If you get a lot of leaves in a particular gutter, consider leaf
guards that keep leaves from accumulating
</P>
<P>
   ON THE LAWN
</P>
<P>
   If you notice the floor of natural forests, you'll see little or
no grass is growing. Dense trees kill grass by blocking sunlight
and smothering the ground with a blanket of leaves. A thick blanket
of leaves also provides a breeding ground for fungi and diseases
that can attack your lawn.
</P>
<P>
   While it's fine to let leaves stay in some spots where you're
not trying to grow grass, you need to keep them from building up on
your lawn.
</P>
<P>
   If you have only a few small trees that drop a scattering of dry
leaves over the lawn, you can keep ahead of the leaves with a
mulching mower.
</P>
<P>
   Set the mower blades fairly high and move forward a little more
slowly than normal. The mulching blades will chop the leaves finely
and drop the pieces into the tall grass, where they are less
visible.
</P>
<P>
   Don't wait to clear leaves until there's a solid blanket over
the yard. And mulching probably won't handle a lot of damp leaves.
When leaves start to accumulate, you need to rake.
</P>
<P>
   You generally shouldn't bag leaves to put out with your other
household trash. And few communities allow open leaf burning.
</P>
<P>
   Check with your local government to see if it has a leaf-removal
program. Some jurisdictions send vacuum trucks to collect leaves
that have been swept to the curb.
</P>
<P>
   Composting is another option. If you have a large yard with a
lot of leaves, it may be possible to set aside an inconspicuous
corner to pile leaves over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, decomposed leaves can be used as mulch. Before
using the leaf mulch around plants, be sure plants are compatible
with decayed leaves and the fungi they may hold.

 &HT;    TRAVEL: Philadelphia's shining past meets today
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Remember the kid who was a head taller than
everybody else in seventh grade? The one who had hair on his chest
and could carry five classmates on his back during playground
football?
</P>
<P>
   Remember how he stopped growing that year, and everybody else
shot past him, and all through high school he wore that sneer of
aggression to hide his insecurity? Think of that kid the next time
you're in Philadelphia and this city will make sense.
</P>
<P>
   For a few brief, shining moments, The City of Brotherly Love was
that kid. Philadelphia was the nation's 18th-century center of
commerce, culture, government and intellect. It was the original
Athens of America. It was Benjamin Franklin and the Constitution
and the birthplace of Liberty. And it was over pretty quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The South lobbied to move the capital to Washington, and New
York hit a growth spurt of epic proportions. Philly _ 90 miles
south of the Big Apple and 120 miles north of D.C. _ was cast into
the shadows, and it never quite recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Californian Tug McGraw understood the city's psyche and played
to it intuitively when he pitched there. During the Phillies' 1980
victory parade, after they won their first and only World Series,
McGraw worked a crowd of 100,000 into a frenzy when he said ``New
York can take this championship and . . .''
</P>
<P>
   New York wasn't in the World Series. The Phillies beat the
Kansas City Royals. But that wasn't the point.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the now-famous billboard that stood along a
Philadelphia highway during the 1970s: ``Philadelphia isn't as bad
as Philadelphians say it is.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true, it's not. But Philly wouldn't be Philly without the
addytood, without that sense of self-deprecation and toughness. In
a famous scene from Rocky filmed in South Philly, a vendor tosses
Sylvester Stallone an orange as he runs through the Italian Market.
Stallone catches it and tosses it to another guy who wasn't
expecting it. So he hurls it back at Rocky. Hard. What the hell did
he want with a used orange? That part of the scene was cut.
</P>
<P>
   Live in Philly for a few years, and those equal portions of
generosity and distemper cease to seem like a paradox. Sooner or
later, it makes sense that the city of Brotherly Love was named, in
two different surveys taken three months apart, the nation's
friendliest city _ and its most hostile.
</P>
<P>
   As far as American cities go, Philadelphia is well past middle
age. Even though it doesn't like to admit it, it's grown into one
of North America's most fascinating metropolises. Walk the 20
blocks from Washington Square to City Hall, and you'll pass 300
years of architecture and likely hear a dozen languages.
</P>
<P>
   To the east, by the Delaware River, is Independence Square,
where the Liberty Bell and its famous crack draw millions of
tourists from all over the world. Those Americans who aren't with
grade-school history classes almost always take a quick look and
keep walking. But the foreigners, especially those from places
where liberty is elusive, line up for hours. A block away is
Independence Hall, a formal, red-brick, Georgian building that's
surprisingly small for a structure that looms so large in the
nation's annals.
</P>
<P>
   This eastern enclave of historical landmarks is the most famous
in the city built at a time when anything was possible. The second
great wave of lasting architectural achievements came about a
century later, when Philadelphia was absorbing hundreds of
thousands of immigrants and putting them to work making everything
from trains to tools to railroad tracks. By the end of the 19th
century, while New York and Washington were establishing themselves
as the focal points of American power, Philadelphia became known as
the workshop of the world. Italians, Jews and Irish flooded dozens
of neighborhoods in North and South Philadelphia. At the same time,
the blue-blood industrialists who employed them were building homes
and neighborhoods of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most famous of these Gilded Age landmarks are City
Hall and the Bellevue Hotel. Both dominated the skyline for most of
this century, and in inimitable Philly style, both are easy targets
for hecklers.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphians have always harbored a love-it-or-hate-it
relationship with the massive Second Empire-style seat of their
city's government. Started in 1871, City Hall wasn't finished until
1908. Tales abound about how the walls _ which are 22 feet in some
places _ kept getting thicker and thicker as the payrolls got
larger and larger. Graft or no graft, the building has survived
talks of pulling it down at least partially because demolition
would be so costly.
</P>
<P>
   And, rundown or not, there is a palpable sense of majesty about
City Hall. It's the tallest brick structure in the world, and the
statues that decorate it resonate with the self-importance that
graced Philadelphia during this end-of-the-century boom. Statues on
the four faces of the building address the themes of justice, law
and order and technology as well as the different peoples of the
planet. City Hall was designed to be at the center of America. For
a while, it almost was.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the statue of William Penn standingatop City Hall.
Philadelphians are justifiably proud of Penn, the founder of the
city who laid out the streets and the public parks in 1682. The
joke goes that _ from the northeast, at least _ William Penn sure
looks proud of Philadelphia, too. The appendage that seems to be
addressing the city is actually Penn's right hand pointing
northeast toward Penn's Treaty Park, where he signed a treaty with
the Lenni Lenape Indians when he first came to town.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellevue is another quintessential Philly tale. Finished in
1908, the hotel looks like a wedding cake with all the trimming and
is every bit the grande dame it was touted to be when it was first
erected. It was the home away from home for the mega-industrialists
who came to Philadelphia during the height of the Gilded Age.
</P>
<P>
   When it opened, the Bellevue was considered the foremost display
of French Renaissance architecture in the land. It had 1,090 rooms,
700 employees, 50 cooks and 12,000 electric lights. It was said you
could keep track of the city's business by sitting in the lobby and
watching who was dining with whom. But play word association with
the Bellevue, and you're less likely to hear the word Renaissance
than Legionnaire's.
</P>
<P>
   Though the city's tourism pamphlets detail the dining room's
``intimate elegant atmosphere . . . decorated in tones of biscuit,
ginger and apricot,'' they fail to mention the tragedy that shut it
down for three years. In 1976, several thousand members of the
Pennsylvania Department of the American Legion stayed at the
Bellevue. Almost 200 became sick with a baffling illness that was
later dubbed Legionnaire's disease. In the end, 29 people died from
the airborne bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   After a few management changes, the Bellevue today has been
refurbished to its original splendor. Rooms are spacious, service
is impeccable, decor is, well, gilded. Take the hotel bar on the
19th floor. It has 20-foot ceilings, walnut-paneled walls replete
with a fireplace and library and sumptuous leather chairs and
couches. And that's in the sports bar.
</P>
<P>
   To see where the wealthy lived during the Gilded Age, it's only
a 10-block walk to Rittenhouse Square, named after 18th-century
Dutch astronomer David Rittenhouse. Still the most prestigious
address in the city, the square is bordered by tony apartment
buildings and majestic, turn-of-the-century mansions built by
old-money Philadelphia families such as the Drexels, the Wideners
and Wetherills. When the weather cooperates, Rittenhouse is packed
with business people on their lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   To see how the rest of Philadelphia lived at the turn of the
century, head to South Philadelphia on a Sunday morning. You'll
pass dozens of row houses with windows open and heavenly smells of
Italian cooking wafting out along with Frank Sinatra music. The
Chairman of the Board is played all Sunday every Sunday by Sid
Mark, Philadelphia's DJ emeritus, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on
WWDB-96.5 FM. The show is a staple of South Philly Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   To find out where all those vittles came from, head to the
Italian Market five blocks south of South Street. On Saturday
morning, the four-block market is a circus of fruits, cheeses, fish
and freshly butchered meat. On the north end, the market is
presided over by a two-story mural of Mayor Frank Rizzo, the
deified, pearl-handled-pistol-packing giant of a man who ruled this
city through most of the '70s. Genuflection isn't required, but
don't let any of the locals see you spit.
</P>
<P>
   For a little more highbrow culture, follow Rocky's jogging route
to the Philadelphia Art Museum. Actually, you may want to take a
taxi. The path Stallone took to the top of the museum's steps is
about 17 miles. More than two decades after that movie was
released, its effect on the city is still enormous. Stand atop the
art museum steps any day, any time and you'll undoubtedly see a few
wannabe Rockys puffing up them.
</P>
<P>
   But when you look out over the city, you won't see the same
skyline Rocky did in 1976. In 1983, the city overturned a
long-standing gentleman's agreement that said that nothing should
be built higher than the top of William Penn's hat (491 feet).
</P>
<P>
   Today, seven buildings rise taller than Penn. The skyline is a
beautiful cornucopia of modern and postmodern architecture that
appears to be leading this city into a bright future. Yo, New York!
You gotta problem wid dat?

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``I'm getting fired!'' That's the first
thought that raced through Jennifer Love Hewitt's mind when ``Party
of Five'' producers Chris Keyser and Amy Lippman called her into
their office last year. Hewitt just knew her plucky Sarah character
was a goner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never had a meeting with me before,'' Hewitt recalls with
a hearty giggle. ``I just thought, `Oh my God, what have I done?
I'm fired. They're finally going to say that Sarah is getting
kicked off the show and I will never work again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the perpetually perky actress didn't get the dreaded
heave-ho. Instead, Hewitt, 20, got her own series. In ``Time of
Your Life,'' a ``Party of Five'' spinoff, Sarah heads to New York
to find her biological father. But she's really in the Big Apple to
find herself and her place in the world _ much like what's
happening in Hewitt's real life.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sarah, Hewitt has slowly embarked on a new adventure called
feature films. As the star of the ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer'' movie franchise, Hewitt is a screen star waiting to
happen. (She reportedly commands $5 million per picture.) And
leaving the cozy confines of ``Party of Five'' wasn't easy. After
all, Hewitt has played Bailey's (Scott Wolf) steady for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a family for me,'' she says softly. ``But I think,
very much like what Sarah's doing, when you grow up, sometimes it
means moving on and it means doing things that are hard at the
time. But it makes you a better person and it teaches you something
new, so I guess I'm sort of learning from my character in that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Keyser and Lippman weren't too thrilled with
producing a ``Party of Five'' spinoff when their agent suggested
it. ``When we first talked about it, we kind of dismissed the idea
out of hand because we thought we didn't want to destroy the
franchise,'' says Lippman. ``And then we thought, `Oh my God,
there's Love. There's a fantastic actress who can really hold her
own and there's a character who can stand separate from ``Party of
Five.'' ''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that Hewitt has to-die-for appeal. Girls love her
and guys want to be with her. But there are risks. ``Time of Your
Life'' often plays like a ``Felicity'' retread. And Sarah's
time-worn character feels as fresh as six-week-old bread.
</P>
<P>
   The original pilot definitely didn't feel fresh to Fox. Even
Keyser admits Sarah came off too naive in the big city. Since
``Time of Your Life'' was originally going to air before ``Party of
Five,'' the show was supposed to feel like a continuation of Fox's
angst-ridden drama. The programming suits, however, moved ``Time of
Your Life'' to Mondays at 8 p.m., right before ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we had to sit down with Fox and decided that it was
probably better to produce a pilot that one, felt more like a
companion piece to ``Ally McBeal'' and two, sort of stood out on
its own,'' Keyser explains.
</P>
<P>
   The result?
</P>
<P>
   Sarah is New York's hot single babe who just happens to be
surrounded by a bunch of hot single pals. There's her
roommate/wannabe actress (Jennifer Garner); an up-and-coming
musician (Johnathon Schaech); a hunky neighbor with six-pack abs
(Diego Serrano); a kooky building manager (Pauley Perette), and a
cute waitress (Goma Ravera).
</P>
<P>
   Since Sarah waits tables at a karaoke bar, Hewitt will put her
healthy set of pipes to good use. She can be the Vonda Shepherd of
her own show.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the often dreary ``Party of Five,'' the producers promise
``Time of Your Life'' will have a lighter tone. In the series
opener, Sarah is already seen getting drunk, jumping turnstiles and
mouthing off to transit cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be as much crying on this show,'' Hewitt admits,
``but since it's produced by Chris and Amy, there will be a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt knew she wanted to be a star when she was little. In
fact, she knew it when she was 7 after her mom showed her the movie
``Sabrina'' starring Audrey Hepburn. (Hewitt will play the
legendary actress in an upcoming ABC movie.)
</P>
<P>
   ``She is to me what I think a woman should be,'' says Hewitt.
``She was sexy, cute, classy, sophisticated, smart, funny all
wrapped up in one. Most women, if they're lucky, get to have a
couple of those traits. She had them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waco, Texas native, who studied tap, jazz and ballet,
started singing at age 6 when she performed at a livestock show in
the middle of a pig farm. ``I always wanted to entertain people and
to make them smile and make a difference somehow,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt went to L.A. and appeared in more than 20 commercials. In
1989 she got a gig on the Disney series ``Kids Inc.'' Small parts
followed on series until she got the ``Party of Five'' job.
</P>
<P>
   In person, Hewitt is a delightful study in contrasts. Dressed in
a simple black dress and matching pumps, she's a curvy siren, yet
she still exudes a wonderfully charming girl-next-door warmth. One
moment she's gushing about cover stories that have been written
about her (``I frame them. I think they're really cool!''), the
next she's steaming up the dance floor salsa-style with Wilmer
Valderrama of ``That '70s Show,'' who's rumored to be Hewitt's new
steady now that she and MTV's Carson Daly are history.
</P>
<P>
   While Hewitt is often poised and mature beyond her years, she
can also sound like the 20-year-old she is. Listen to her explain
her Times Square experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shooting the promos for the show, so they shut down
Times Square and there were all these people standing there and the
lights were shining and it was really loud and smelly because it
was New York, and all of these people knew my full name,'' she
says, smiling broadly. ``I thought that was the oddest thing in the
world. There were so many people and I was like, `Why do they
care?' I got really excited and started crying in the middle of
Times Square.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Will Hewitt cry if ``Time of Your Life'' fails?
It's not certain if her Sarah will return to ``Party of Five'' if
Hewitt's show is canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Is Hewitt worried?
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't really talked about it,'' she says. ``We're all
just trying to get as hopeful as possible that this show will go.''
</P>

   WIGGINS-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In early July when
20-month-old Logan Lewis of West Palm Beach fell ill, a
pediatrician found nothing the matter, and sent the child home.
Later, the toddler grew worse and was taken to the emergency room.
And while the admitting physician also could find nothing to
explain the child's distress, he saw something he thought the
parents needed to explain: bruising. What had they been doing to
this child? he asked pointedly. The parents, Sean and Mary Lewis
were clearly distressed at the implication and showed the sick
youngster to their neighbors and good friends, Liz and Tim Hulett.
The Huletts own Hulett Environmental Services, where Sean works in
termite control. The Lewises could not have guessed just how good
their friends would prove to be. (Wiggins, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hurricane Irene might
have arrived last weekend wearing a pink pastel suit and white

Everglades, and more specifically, to the town of Pahokee, Fla.
Irene came through and uprooted old mango trees and toppled power
lines and flooded streets with sewage. Of course, somebody
somewhere had to be last to have power restored, water restored,
lives restored. But the people here want to know: Does it always
have to be them? Minor, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

busy. By the time the police officer had climbed out of his cruiser

door, jumped out, whipped off a sneaker, and begun beating the
daylights out of the steering wheel. (Schuett, Cox News Service)

   OBESITY _ Obesity has reached historic highs in the United
States and should be combatted with the same kind of national
effort that was directed at smoking, CDC Director Jeff Koplan will
say in a speech and special issue of the Journal of the American
Medical Assn this week. According to new information being released
in a special obesity-themed issue of JAMA, half of American adults
are now either overweight or obese; weight levels are rising
significantly across the country, but in Georgia, increased by more
than 100 percent between 1991 and 1998,the single worst rate for
any state. Complications from excess weight (heart disease,
gallbladder disease, diabetes II, high blood pressure and
osteoarthritis) contribute to 280,000 deaths annually and could
overwhelm the health care system as overweight adults age, Koplan
and the AMA said. (McKenna, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

<P>
   TEENS _ ``The Lost Children of Rockdale County'' depicts an
attenuation of middle-class, suburban life _ one most felt by
teenagers. Without meaningful work, spiritual or family lives, they
fill the void with TV and hanging out in parking lots, drifting
into orgiastic sex just for the novelty of it. Yet talking to
teens, pollsters and other experts, a different picture emerges. As
a whole, teens have their acts together. They're grounded,
optimistic _ even mindful of their parents. (Harris Atlanta

 &HT;    On the horns of a strange conundrum
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Would you rather dive headfirst off a
high diving board into an empty pool . . . or be bungee-snapped
back into a wall of needles? (Neither? Totally understandable.)
</P>
<P>
   How about this: Would you rather have a lisp that appears only
in your writing . . . or fizz up like Alka- Seltzer whenever you go
into water? (Things to consider: making your own Perrier, typing
``Mithithippi.'')
</P>
<P>
   Last one: Would you rather have a ketchup-dispensing navel . . .
or a pencil-sharpening nostril?
</P>
<P>
   These are the absurd dilemmas that keep authors Justin Heimberg
and David Gomberg awake at night. Or at least well-published.
</P>
<P>
   The former college roommates, who used to pitch loaded questions
at each other for sport, have just published their second book of
made-up conundrums, ``Would You Rather 2, Electric Boogaloo?''
(Plume, 204 pages, $9.95), named for an obscure 1980s break dancing
movie. This and its predecessor, the plain-titled ``Would You
Rather . . . ?'', have spawned a Web site (www.wouldyourather .com)
and talk of a possible game show.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the possibilities: A schoolmarmish mother from
Cleveland standing in front of a national television audience as a
poodle-haired host pelts her with such questions as, ``Would you
rather . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Be tenderized to death with a small wooden mallet or consume
Kleenex until you die?
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat a live gerbil or remove your own appendix with nothing but
a shoehorn and a rusty old menorah?
</P>
<P>
   _ Have stained-glass windshields on your car or blacklight
headlights?
</P>
<P>
   _ Feel like there's always an eyelash in your eye or like
there's always a trout in your pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually have a trout in my pants,'' Gomberg, 26, said during
a recent interview. ``I can tell you, it's not an entirely
uncomfortable feeling.'' Not such a far-fetched statement for a guy
who tests toys for a living for a big company in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The concept for the ``Would You'' books began while Gomberg and
Heimberg were students at Duke University. Gomberg used to torture
pledges at his Theta Chi fraternity house with questions like,
``Would you rather have to always wear orthodontic headgear or two
left shoes?''
</P>
<P>
   Heimberg, also 26, wrote a shortened version for a college
writing class. The material cracked up the class, and the two
turned it into a book and shopped it to publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Each writer offers his own warped take. Heimberg, who is half
Jewish and half Unitarian (''It's religion with arts and crafts''),
veers more often toward celebrity with such questions as ``Would
you rather have your parents replaced by Salt N' Pepa . . . or
begin to more closely resemble Sammy Davis Jr. as you get older?''
</P>
<P>
   Gomberg's questions tend to let his Orthodox Jewish upbringing
show. Exhibit No. 1: ``Would you rather wrestle as The Rowdy Rabbi,
where you throw bagels to the crowd and enter the ring to Hava
Nagila . . . or as General X, a wrestler with a Gen-X motif _ not a
good guy, not a bad guy, just really apathetic?''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the jokes are G-rated. (The new book has this
``disacknowledgement'' from Gomberg: ``This is a book I do not show
my rabbi.'') A memorable bit of potty humor offers readers the
choice of having either Silly String or grits emerge from sensitive
body parts. Another suggests having either your partner vanish
suddenly at the moment of ecstasy or your sexual exploits commented
upon by football announcers Pat Summerall and John Madden.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's funny is that now my grandmother and her mah-jongg
posse sit around playing it, reading questions to each other at
Leisureville,'' Heimberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother likes to read it to everyone and brag about her son
the author,'' Gomberg said. ``I tell her, 'This is not appropriate
for your 50-year-old friends. It's a read-it-and-wipe book, Mom.'
``
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of insane questioning, we asked Would You Rather .
. . authors Justin Heimberg and David Gomberg a few of our own.
</P>
<P>
   WOULD YOU RATHER . . .
</P>
<P>
   Drive fast in the slow lane . . . or slow in the fast lane?
</P>
<P>
   David: ``Fast in the slow lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin: ``I do drive slow in the fast lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Have a paper cut on your tongue . . . or lemon squirted in your
eye?
</P>
<P>
   Both: Lemon.
</P>
<P>
   Force feed Ally McBeal . . . or starve Barry White?
</P>
<P>
   Both: Force feed Ally. ``The sight of an emaciated Barry White
would scar me for life,'' Justin said.
</P>
<P>
   Have roller skates instead of feet . . . or suction cups for
hands
</P>
<P>
   David: ``Suction cups. That sounds cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin: ``Roller skates.''
</P>
<P>
   Take O.J. Simpson to a knife factory . . . or ride shotgun with
Ted Kennedy on the way home from a party?
</P>
<P>
   David: ``O.J.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin: ``That's tough. Both are going to get away with it
either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Scream ``YES!'' when your significant other asks if her butt is
too big . . . or tell your significant other that her mother's butt
is too big?
</P>
<P>
   David: ``The mother. Anyone with a girlfriend knows you can
never talk about her butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin: ``Trash the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Give Tom Brokaw the ability to pronounce his Ls correctly or
prevent Peter Jennings from saying ``Aboot''?
</P>
<P>
   David: ``Jennings.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin: ``I don't ever want Brokaw to stop. It's the whole
reason to watch.''

   OBESITY _ Obesity has reached historic highs in the United
States and should be combatted with the same kind of national
effort that was directed at smoking, CDC Director Jeff Koplan will
say in a speech and special issue of the Journal of the American
Medical Assn this week. According to new information being released
in a special obesity-themed issue of JAMA, half of American adults
are now either overweight or obese; weight levels are rising
significantly across the country, but in Georgia, increased by more
than 100 percent between 1991 and 1998,the single worst rate for
any state. Complications from excess weight (heart disease,
gallbladder disease, diabetes II, high blood pressure and
osteoarthritis) contribute to 280,000 deaths annually and could
overwhelm the health care system as overweight adults age, Koplan
and the AMA said. (McKenna, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

   TEENS _ ``The Lost Children of Rockdale County'' depicts an
attenuation of middle-class, suburban life _ one most felt by
teenagers. Without meaningful work, spiritual or family lives, they
fill the void with TV and hanging out in parking lots, drifting
into orgiastic sex just for the novelty of it. Yet talking to
teens, pollsters and other experts, a different picture emerges. As
a whole, teens have their acts together. They're grounded,
optimistic _ even mindful of their parents. (Harris Atlanta

Waving overhead in all their red and gold glory one day; sodden and
wretched underfoot the next. That's nature's little practical joke
on us with lawns to rake and gutters to clean. (Cummings, Dayton

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Oprah Winfrey chatted away with her guests on
live television, her words scrolled across the bottom of the
picture in Spanish. With a click of a mouse that triggered a
sophisticated computer program, the scrolling words changed into
French and then into German.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology has been 20 years in coming,'' said Lawrence
Silverman, using the talk show hostess' popular program to
demonstrate what he hopes will become a popular worldwide
subtitle-generating system. ``For the first time, automated
translation engines are fast enough to make this process work,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Known as GlobalTV, the system is being marketed by his firm,
Multilingual Media Inc., which is based in Natick, Mass. Within the
next two weeks, Silverman said, GlobalTV will be making
U.S.-produced cable programming available for the first time to
Spanish-speaking cable viewers in a South American city he declined
to name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to test it further,'' Silverman contended. ``We
already know it works.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've put together a very nice new appliance which
is beneficial both to them and to (TV) content providers,'' said
Steve McClure, an analyst for International Data Corp., who studies
user interfaces and text recognition engines for the
Massachusetts-based research firm.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here, Silverman noted that ``hundreds of dynamic
American TV programs are being produced every day which can be
viewed only within the United States while U.S. audiences have
limited access to real-time foreign language programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 7 million Hispanic households in this country are less
likely to subscribe to cable television services because of a basic
lack of Spanish language content, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new GlobalTV service is designed to close this two-way TV
language gap.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Silverman, a longtime broadcast executive,
co-founded the company with Mary Flanagan, who has a doctorate in
linguistics and who serves as the fledgling firm's chief technology
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previously,'' Flanagan said, ``translation services were
developed with well-written text in mind. But the kind of live TV
news features and sports shows we're dealing with is another animal
altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan, who accompanied Silverman to the successful
demonstration, contends that some types of TV content are both too
costly and too time-consuming for human translators. Automating the
translation process through the use of high-performance machine
translation technology is the only viable solution for enabling
multilingual TV distribution, she argued.
</P>
<P>
   GlobalTV already utilizes such software to produce rapid
translations between English and French, German, Spanish,
Portuguese and Italian, and from French, Spanish and German into
English. Other languages, including Chinese, will be added later,
Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   In marketing GlobalTV, Multilingual Media intends to bypass both
content providers, such as Oprah, and individual subscribers.
Instead, the service is being offered ``at the head-end to cable
and satellite television operators at a cost of less than 50 cents
per subscriber per month,'' Silverman said. In making available the
additional programming to subscribers in their native languages,
the operators will be free to set their own fees.

SCORSESE'S NEW FILM ECHOES PAST WORK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1976, Martin Scorsese made ``Taxi Driver,'' one of the best
films of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with one of cinema's finest visual openings. A mammoth
taxi comes toward us, slowly, appearing ominously out of the street
steam, like a giant tyrannosaur tramping out of prehistoric mist.
Then we see a close-up of Robert De Niro's wary eyes, scanning the
streets he passes.
</P>
<P>
   So it's with a jolt of recognition that we see the opening of
Scorsese's new film, ``Bringing Out the Dead.'' An ambulance is
coming at us. In close-up, we see Nicolas Cage's wary eyes,
scanning those same New York streets.
</P>
<P>
   If that opening were used by any other director, it would be
regarded as a homage _ or perhaps a rip-off _ of Scorsese. But how
to consider it when the director is Scorsese? Is he saluting
himself? Is there a message here?
</P>
<P>
   Film critics could ponder the significance of this a long time,
but Scorsese would advise against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just put it in,'' Scorsese says matter-of-factly. You can
almost hear him shrug over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Scorsese gives the real credit for this parallel to his
editor, Thelma Schoonmaker. She has worked on almost all his major
films since ``Raging Bull'' in 1980. (Marcia Lucas, George Lucas'
former wife, was the editor on ``Taxi Driver.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Thelma put in a couple of shots of Nic's eyes and I liked it.
Thelma didn't cut (edit) `Taxi Driver,' Marcia did, so she didn't
know. It reminded me of that nice image of (De Niro's) eyes in
''Taxi Driver.``
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You know, it's `Taxi Driver,' but leave it in. It's a
nice little reference.'''
</P>
<P>
   So that's how the great filmmakers do things.
</P>
<P>
   Scorsese is one of the youngest recipients of the American Film
Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award, which he received in 1997,
when he was 54. Three of his movies were on last year's AFI list of
the 100 best American movies ever: ``Raging Bull'' (voted 24th),
``Taxi Driver'' (47) and ``Goodfellas'' (94).
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' now in theaters, will not rank with
those classics, but it is a definite return, after ``Kundun,'' to
the kind of full-bore, gritty New York filmmaking that was long
Scorsese's trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Taxi Driver,'' ``Raging Bull'' and ``The Last Temptation
of Christ,'' ``Bringing Out the Dead'' has a screenplay by Paul
Schrader. Like ``Taxi Driver,'' it is about someone who works New
York city streets at night, where he sees _ and is powerfully
affected by _ the ugliness and horror.
</P>
<P>
   But where ``Taxi Driver's'' protagonist, Travis Bickle, felt an
urge to kill, ``Bringing Out the Dead's'' Frank Pierce is driven to
save lives and haunted by those he's lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not Travis,'' Scorsese says.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a book by former paramedic Joe Connelly, ``Bringing Out
the Dead'' focuses on nighttime Emergency Medical Service personnel
in New York. After years of racing from one tragedy to another,
Frank is a disturbed, spooked man, constantly seeing the ghosts of
people he could not save, and begs his boss to fire him. But he's
unable to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Before making the movie, Scorsese, Cage and Schrader rode nights
in EMS ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't such a bad couple of nights (for me),'' Scorsese
says. ``But Schrader had quite a night. There was a man hit by a
train. But by the end of the night, he had a baby being born. So he
went through the exultation, down in the depths, and then suddenly
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Scorsese is at his best when filming the rough edges of New
York. The sickly son of immigrants, he was born in Queens and
raised there and in Manhattan's Little Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the movies I make,'' he said when receiving the AFI
award. ``And I know they're not to everyone's taste.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, after an early film of his own, Scorsese went to
Los Angeles to work for the king of cheap independent movies, Roger
Corman, making the crime quickie ``Boxcar Bertha.'' But he soon
returned to New York, where, with Corman's support, he made the
film ``Mean Streets,'' a low-budget but superior film about young,
low-level gangsters. Critics quickly hailed the film, which helped
launch the acting careers of its young stars, De Niro and Harvey
Keitel, who became Scorsese regulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mean Streets'' was followed by ``Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore,'' and then ``Taxi Driver,'' which made Scorsese famous.
Among his many films since are ``New York, New York''; ``The Last
Waltz''; ``The King of Comedy''; ``The Color of Money''; ``Cape
Fear''; and ``The Age of Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxi Driver'' and ``Bringing Out the Dead'' form similar, but
not matching, bookends to Scorsese's career so far.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader has said he was attracted to ``Taxi Driver'' and this
story by their occupational metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talking,'' Scorsese says, ``about the idea of a taxi
driver, which is a metaphor for loneliness, a man who travels
through cities at the random beck and call of strangers who control
your life, where you go. Paul was attracted to it because (of) the
metaphor of being in your own universe and being knocked about by
fate. Not knowing what's going to happen to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of the EMS men and women who do this incredible
work, they really don't know what situation they're going to be
involved in next. Your life is totally, completely uncharted.
There's no rhyme or reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they call and say someone has a problem breathing, you
could arrive there and it could be a murder. The murderer could
still be there, you see. So it's a very hair-raising way of
working. It's a job, like a taxi driver or policeman, in which
you're exposed to life, from the top to the bottom. Mainly the
bottom. The end of the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Scorsese talks in a rapid-fire stream of words, as if he is
always thinking about what he wants to say next and is hurrying
through the current sentence to get to it. Sometimes he pauses for
a split second to ask, ``Do you understand?'' or ``You see?'' but
before you can answer, he's off again.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' Scorsese's work style is just as
fast. The movie is a wild ride, not only in pace but in visual
impact and emotion. He seems to be trying to capture the pressure
and intensity of the EMS job through his camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, definitely,'' he says. ``It has to be (seen) through
Frank's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's drinking a little bit and he's not sleeping and he's
upset and he feels guilty, and he feels he's not making any
difference anymore in the world. I mean, is there a plan? Is there
a God?
</P>
<P>
   ``So you begin to see the world through his eyes, which is
almost hallucinatory. I tried to pick up a lot of things as I was
riding in the front of the ambulance at night. What your eye
perceives, what you see on the periphery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to pull together imagery like that. You really don't
know what you're seeing when you're flashing through the streets at
night in Manhattan. Lights blaring and flashing on and off and
sirens and rock 'n' roll playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You arrive somewhere and you see from far away, that's the
nightclub, somebody got hurt. You get there and you don't know
who's in the crowd and who's the person who's hurt. I tried to
capture that.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is also a return for Cage to the serious, tough parts
that gained him a top acting reputation, before he became an action
hero. Scorsese says he wanted Cage for the part because of ``his
face, his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew him staring out into the street was going to look
good. He doesn't have to do much more.''

   What color is the cosmos? Planets, nebulae and galaxies appear
wan and faint when eyed through a backyard telescope. But
researchers using imaging techniques show us a much more chromatic
view.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the colors in many familiar photographs of the
cosmos are fake. For more than 20 years, space agencies have
embellished images of the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the images have to be enhanced: Photos assembled from
wavelengths beyond the eye's perception have no color, so
researchers paint them anyway they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Venus, for example, has invisible cloud patterns that show up in
infrared photos; NASA depicts them in orange and blue.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, X-ray detectors reveal invisible galactic structures.
Researchers colorcode these features according to wavelength or
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   False color, for the sake of drama, got a lot of reinforcement
when the giant outer planets were photographed during the Voyager
mission in the late 1970s and 1980s. Researchers intensified color
and contrast to maximize detail, and the media fell in love with
the brilliant images.
</P>
<P>
   When Voyager 2 reached Neptune in 1989, the previously pale
planet was promoted to sky blue with red tinges. Uranus was _ and
still is _ presented as lime green.
</P>
<P>
   No scientific principles justify these embellishments; Uranus is
featureless. Without detail to enhance, the planet needed a rich
new color to get the attention of the press.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Mars has been painted circus red instead of pale
pumpkin. And Jupiter's yellow-white bands and light-pink Red Spot
have been tweaked to orange and candy-apple red.
</P>
<P>
   Colorization is not confined to images from deep-space probes.
Consider the celebrated 1995 Hubble photo, dubbed Pillars of
Creation, by Jeff Hester and Paul Scowen of Arizona State
University. This vivid image of the Eagle nebula's spirelike
columns has graced the covers of astronomy magazines and has been
made into a hit poster.
</P>
<P>
   Through amateur telescopes these faint gas clouds appear gray
and unexciting. Larger instruments sometimes show such nebulae as
pale green because the retina responds to that tint in dim light.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, photography brings out a dominant red emitted by
the Eagle's hydrogen atoms. The universe is well stocked with these
lovely cherry-red nebulae, thanks to hydrogen's omnipresence.
</P>
<P>
   But such unvarying red can become tiresome after the first few
thousand light-years of cosmic inventory. To avoid such
monochromaticity, astronomers took separate pictures of the Eagle
through different filters. Coloring each image with brilliant tints
and bleeding them together yielded the spectacular hues of the
Pillars of Creation.
</P>
<P>
   Hester says his celebrated Hubble picture was merely intended to
bring out scientific detail. The real Eagle nebula, he surmises,
would look ghostly faint with pale, feeble colors. He calls his
work an ``artistic rendering of what the scientist sees.''
</P>
<P>
   Such artistic license is so commonplace that the presented
universe bears little resemblance to the real thing. Instead, we
have a cosmos in designer colors.

INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL DESERVES A PRESIDENTIAL VETO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Department of Interior Appropriations Bill (H.R. 2466) is
ripe for a veto. Passed by Congress last week, the bill is loaded
with 26 anti-environmental amendments and special-interest
giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   This is one veto that President Clinton shouldn't lose any sleep
over.
</P>
<P>
   The American people have spoken clearly in national poll after
national poll when quizzed about protecting the environment and
public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Consistently, more than three-quarters of Americans polled want
greater protection of their lands.
</P>
<P>
   Back in early August, as a public relations gimmick, the Senate
reinstated Rule XVI, which prohibits adding unrelated policy
legislation to appropriations bills. It was proclaimed to mean that
no more anti-environmental or other riders could be added to the
Interior appropriations bill. The Senate was set to control its
anti-environmental ardor. At that point there were little more than
a dozen environmentally objectionable riders. Now there are 26.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the riders that were stricken under Rule XVI were later
added by a vote of the full Senate. A few riders were added in the
House-Senate conference committee that negotiated the language of
the final bill. So much for self-control and the restrictions of
Rule XVI.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Congress is attempting to pass rider legislation
that would prohibit public and federal oversight of grazing on
millions of acres of federal public rangelands. The rider requires
that the Bureau of Land Management renew expiring grazing permits
under the same rules contained in the old permit. This automatic
renewal means that changing environmental conditions, like the
erosion of riparian areas contained in a federal lease or other
problems, cannot be taken into account and regulated. This rider
was added by Republican Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., added a rider that gives 10 ranchers
special dispensation to renew and extend livestock grazing within
the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area in his state. In 1990,
the National Park Service found that livestock grazing is
incompatible with the area's prime use -- recreation. The agency
gave ranchers a number of years to make the transition. By 1997,
all livestock grazing had ceased in the recreation area. This rider
benefits a few at the expense the thousands who visit the area each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada inserted a rider into the
appropriations bill that will give away 2,500 acres of public land
to the City of Mesquite in eastern Nevada. Free of charge. The
American public gets nothing in return. Mesquite wants the land for
an airport.
</P>
<P>
   And the rider prohibits any environmental review of the impact
of this use of the land.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry has many friends in Congress, but none better
than Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Republican from Texas. She added a
rider that delays the implementation of the new oil valuation rule
by the Minerals Management Service. This is the fourth time this
rule has been delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutchinson rider was stricken from the Senate version of the
Interior Appropriations bill because of the reinstatement of Rule
XVI.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hutchinson re-introduced the amendment and, on a floor
vote, the Senate voted 51-47 to add the rider. The General
Accounting Office estimates that the oil industry is underpaying
its royalties to the public by $66-$100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 requires that
the secretary of the Interior protect federal lands transferred to
other parties for their temporary use. It allows the secretary to
remove federal lands from access by mining companies. Sen.
Christopher Bond, R-Mo., wanted an exemption for lead mining in the
Ozark National Scenic Riverways. He introduced a rider to allow
mining that would affect watersheds of major rivers in the Missouri
Ozarks. The rider was first prohibited by Rule XVI, and then
re-introduced and passed on the floor of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A provision was added to the final Interior Appropriations bill
during the House-Senate conference committee by Sen. Robert
Bennett, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Inserting a rider into the bill in conference committee means
the provision had no public hearing and no debate in either house
of Congress. Bennett's rider delays the Department of Interior's
attempt to reform existing hardrock mining regulations so that
environmental controls are strengthened. The rider extends the
moratorium on hardrock mining reform until the end of fiscal year
2000. Existing regulations in this area allow bankrupt mining
companies to abandon polluting mines and leave the taxpayers to pay
the millions of dollars for cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Despite opposition by citizens and local governments in his
state, Republican Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado
introduced a rider that earmarks $2 million for clear cutting aspen
trees in the White River National Forest and Grand
Mesa-Uncompahgre-Gunnison National Forest. The logging would
benefit the Louisiana Pacific Corp.'s mill in Olathe, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic senators from Nevada, Harry Reid and Richard
Bryan, had a provision inserted into the Senate version of the
appropriations bill as part of a manager's amendment. A manager's
amendment is not debated by the full legislative body. It has no
public hearing. The Reid-Bryan rider delays efforts to reduce noise
pollution in the Grand Canyon. The air tour industry had its hand
in this provision, but the public had no way to debate or defeat
the rider.
</P>
<P>
   Disregarding a vote in the U.S. House not to weaken the 1872
Mining Law in conference committee, the House conferees capitulated
to Senate demands. The provision in this bill exempts all existing
mines or expansions of existing mines from toxic dumping
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   And there are more giveaways of public money and more excuses
for industries to continue to pollute public lands in this
appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Congress may think, the American people will cheer a
presidential veto of this monstrosity, if they learn what
special-interest provisions were larded on to it at their expense.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   He's handsome, he's gifted, he's smart, he's on the verge of
becoming a movie star. But Jeremy Northam would like to voice a
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare that people see me as a contemporary guy _ as an
actor OR as a person,'' he laments.
</P>
<P>
   Northam, best known for his portrayals of repressed Englishmen
(``Emma,'' ``Carrington,'' ``The Winslow Boy,'' ``An Ideal
Husband''), is speaking in his perfectly cultivated British accent,
even though he's trying _ really trying _ to be colloquial.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get on my tits and take the piss out of the proper way
I talk,'' he says, ``as if I'm some dinosaur from some bygone
age.''
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, then, that the 37-year-old actor was delighted to
rip off his waistcoat for ``Happy Texas,'' a comedy that was the
talk of last year's Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Northam stars as one of two American convicts who bust out of a
Texas jail. In an extreme case of mistaken identity, the men are
assumed to be a gay couple arriving in town to stage children's
beauty pageants.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that Northam has to do a working-class American
accent _ while convincing the town's closeted sheriff, William H.
Macy, that he wants to date him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he's trying to woo Ally Walker, who believes he's
gay.
</P>
<P>
   So how did writer-director Mark Illsley know that Northam could
veer so far from type?
</P>
<P>
   ``I cast Jeremy because of `Emma,''' Illsley says. ``He's an
actor who does wonderful things in a close-up. In the smallest
ways, he tells you so much. And I do think he was the most
courageous member of the cast: He had to play American and be
funny. He did it brilliantly. And he worked for no money! Only nice
people work for no money. Jerks will never do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Offscreen, Northam does seem like a completely modern, unstuffy
guy, dressed in a short-sleeved shirt, black jeans and
violet-tinted wire rims.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's humorously self-conscious about the danger of
appearing too effete, too British (``I notice if I even use the
words `theatrical' or `poetry' that they have funny overtones these
days,'' he says), he's also reluctant to embrace the role of a
rising Hollywood star. Gossip columns, he says, make him nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no desire to appear in columns that say `He was
there,''' he says. ``It's hard enough just being in a crowd like
the one at the Talk party in New York and being yourself. It's the
work that's the fun thing for me _ if I can say that without
sounding dull and overserious.''
</P>
<P>
   But poor Northam can't help it if he was raised to be a man of
substance. His father is a professor of literature at Cambridge,
and he got his acting chops at places like the Royal National
Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's played a couple of bad guys and heavies in American
films _ opposite Sandra Bullock in ``The Net'' and Sharon Stone in
the ``Gloria'' remake _ he didn't seem to have much fun doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep telling my agent I don't just want to play period
movies or bad guys anymore,'' Northam says.
</P>
<P>
   But he shyly admits he's about to do both _ in the same movie.
He'll be playing Nick Nolte's son-in-law in the Merchant Ivory
production of Henry James' densest novel, ``The Golden Bowl,''
alongside Anjelica Huston, Uma Thurman and Kate Beckinsale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it means going back to old Edwardian costume,'' Northam
says, smiling. ``But I am drawn, I have to admit, to the abstract
and the complicated. I like density of character _ not just a
reduction of motives to one simple thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his busy schedule, Northam says, his own life has
seemed somewhat one-dimensional lately; he's had no real home or
love life to speak of. But the recent death of his mother after a
long illness has made him realize it's time to consider settling
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to share the things I love,'' he admits. ``I'm
desperate for that now. But honestly, I've given up. Most of the
great women I meet are going out with the sexiest men in the world.
And when I go out with non-actresses, they're convinced all actors
are liars.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you convince women you're telling the truth?'' he
continues. ``I've given up now. As they say in London, I've done
myself up like a kipper _ smoked, flattened and tinned.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true Englishman. &QL;

AUTHOR OF ALPHABET MYSTERIES KEEPS HER DISTANCE FROM TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ You don't need to be a big-time gumshoe to get
to the bottom of this one.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Grafton knows she could bag a suitcase stuffed with
greenbacks if she sold the movie rights to Kinsey Millhone, the
heroine of her best-selling alphabet series of mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   But Grafton is no longer struggling to make ends meet, and she's
seen firsthand how Hollywood can trample all over a writer's
creation.
</P>
<P>
   So the studio moguls can keep their six-figure checks, Grafton
reasons, and she _ and Millhone, her alter-ego who appears in her
15th thriller, ``O is for Outlaw'' _ will hold onto their
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the truth about Hollywood: The minute they've paid you
the money, you've given them the power,'' said Grafton, sitting
poolside indoors at The Desmond in suburban Albany one afternoon
last week, fashionably dressed in a black mock turtleneck, short
charcoal gray skirt and black stockings.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time they get to the end of the process,'' she added,
``they've got Eddie Murphy playing Kinsey Millhone and you're
supposed to be happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgive Grafton if she sounds cynical. She's speaking from
experience. The author toiled for more than 15 years in Los
Angeles, working as a free-lance screenwriter, writing novels in
her spare time. She wrote an episode of the television series
``Rhoda,'' as well as numerous movies for television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mind the money, but I didn't like the creative
process, if you want to call it that,'' Grafton quipped. ``I don't
like sitting in meetings with 26-years-olds telling me how to do my
job. And they're always 26, for some reason. It seemed like every
meeting I was in, there was a 26-year-old running it.''
</P>
<P>
   Millhone, Grafton's heroine, is a small-town shamus based in
Santa Teresa, the fictional Southern California town invented by
acclaimed mystery writer Ross Macdonald. A former cop, Millhone is
36 and single, having survived two disastrous marriages in her 20s.
</P>
<P>
   She has aged just four years since making her debut in May 1982
in ``A is for Alibi,'' living in a time warp many of us might envy.
Grafton, 59, figures that by the time she completes the final book
in the series, ``Z is for Zero,'' Millhone will turn 40 while
Grafton will be 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't she lucky?'' Grafton said.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsey Millhone can't even find a lover, Grafton added. ``She's
too fussy. But I can't really blame her there. Any intelligent
woman is going to be fussy about men.''
</P>
<P>
   During a 45-minute interview, Grafton often referred to Millhone
as if her fictional creation were a real person, a best friend. ``I
feel she controls me. She runs my life. I wouldn't be on this tour
if it wasn't for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, lots of others, are also infatuated with Millhone.
Grafton not only has a granddaughter named Kinsey, she has received
30-some letters from readers who have named their children after
Millhone.
</P>
<P>
   The author doesn't take such compliments lightly. She says she
writes personal letters to each child named Kinsey (the letters are
signed by Millhone with her signature signoff, ``Respectfully
submitted''), giving them advice any parent would approve of: Take
lots of naps and don't cuss. She also sends each girl a
hand-painted barrette, from Millhone, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between Grafton and her heroine are many. Grafton
also survived two marriages, along with a bitter custody battle at
the culmination of her second marriage. She has been committed to
writing all her life, completing seven novels (five of which were
never published; the other two are now out of print) before the
first in the 26-book Millhone series appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Millhone, though, Grafton did meet a man with whom she is
compatible. She and Steve Humphrey, a philosophy professor, have
been married more than 20 years and divide their time between
Louisville, Ky., where Humphrey teaches and Grafton was raised, and
Montecito, Calif. Also, Grafton disdais junk food, while
Millhone's idea of a sensuous treat involves a fast-food
quarter-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   Both battle fear on a regular basis, however. Millhone's work
takes her into dangerous situations, where her safety is undeniably
at stake. Grafton claims she faces fear every time she sits in
front of the word processor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what writing is _ fear, at least for me,'' she said.
``I'm always skating on thin ice. I'm always taking on more than I
can handle. I think that's what keeps me fresh, pure adrenaline and
horror.''

SAVE NOW, RELAX LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There is a great scene early in the movie
``Speed,'' when the villain takes a hostage and threatens to do all
sorts of nasty things. The two police officers know the best way to
simplify the problem and thwart the villainy: Shoot the hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, that strategy is a lot more acceptable in fantasy than
in reality, but it might be the best way to think about your
career. In this case, the hostage is your paycheck. You are afraid
to leave a lousy job or demand more time with your family or stand
up to a nasty boss because the hostage might get killed or
seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But if your paycheck isn't so crucial, you can take a lot more
risks and have a lot more fun. You can also negotiate better if the
company needs you more than you need that paycheck. One way to do
that, of course, is to cut your expenses, but college students and
young workers have a much better option.
</P>
<P>
   Sell out early.
</P>
<P>
   I know that sounds like baby-boomer blasphemy, but it is the
best way these days to make sure that you have an enjoyable career.
It just takes a little patience.
</P>
<P>
   People who came of age in the 1930s and 1940s had seen how grim
things could be, and often were thankful to hold any decent job.
</P>
<P>
   Their children, the baby boomers, wanted their careers to be
more satisfying, so many ended up majoring in the liberal arts, and
moving into jobs that rewarded their emotions more than their
wallets.
</P>
<P>
   Both generations' strategies made perfect sense at the time. But
now the boomers are going through their midlife crisis, and many
are finding that even ``fun'' jobs can get stale after 20 or 30
years. They would like to change careers or start their own
business or cut back, but they have families and bills and
obligations, and not enough savings to take any serious risk.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting the hostage is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the corporate ruthlessness of the 1990s and they
don't even have the job security that their parents eventually
found.
</P>
<P>
   They feel like the bus in ``Speed''; if they don't stay above 50
mph, their careers will explode.
</P>
<P>
   That is why college students and younger workers need to adopt a
different strategy: For the first few years of your career, become
a raging capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   If you emphasize money in your first few years _ knowing how to
earn it, budget it and invest it _ you should be able to save
$50,000 by the time you're 30. After all, you are going from a
college lifestyle to an annual salary of $50,000 or more. You ought
to be able to save $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the good part: Even if you never save another penny,
if you invest that $50,000 and get the typical stock market return
of 11 percent a year, it will grow to more than $1.6 million by the
time you are 65.
</P>
<P>
   What it also will do is give you options and peace of mind as
you move along in your career. You know that you will have the
money to start your own business when you are in your 40s, and that
you will have a cushion in case age discrimination strikes. If you
want to take a leave or go back to school, you will be able to.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you will love what you do and want to work 80-hour weeks
when you're 80. Great. Maybe money will never be important. Fine.
At least you will be able to pass along some wonderful gifts to
children or charities.
</P>
<P>
   People who decide when they're 25 that money is not important
have to live with that decision for the rest of their lives. They
can start saving more as they get older, but it is hard to beat the
magic of compounding. They won't have the same career and lifestyle
options as you will.
</P>
<P>
   Once you save the $50,000, evaluate your career. Are you doing
something you enjoy? Keep at it and keep saving. The options will
keep growing. You have already built a financial foundation that
can help you the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't enjoy your career, evaluate how important money is
to you. It is a lot easier to do that after you have been in the
``real world'' for a few years than while you are in college. Think
about what career would allow you to spend the most time doing the
things you enjoy, in work and in life, and go for it.

   SAYING GOODBYE TO UNCLE WILT. Columnist Akilah Monifa remembers
the late Wilt Chamberlain and the legacy he left behind. ``He was
almost like a family member. Uncle Wilt was an integral part of my
family. We embraced him as a hero, just as much as we embraced Dr.
Martin Luther King,'' she writes. Monifa reflects on his
accomplishments, both on and off the court. ``Chamberlain was the
epitome of a strong, uncompromising black man ... Not only did we
perceive Chamberlain as physically dominant, he was also
intellectually dominant. He shattered stereotypes of the big,
stupid athlete. He was extremely articulate and outspoken.''

<P>
   CALIFORNIA DREAMING AND THE GAY CIVIL-RIGHTS REALITY. California
has become the national front-runner in the march toward full
equality for lesbians and gays. Earlier this month, Gov. Gray Davis
signed into law three new pieces of gay civil-rights legislation.
One creates a statewide domestic partnership registry for same-sex
couples. Another law bans discrimination and harassment in public
schools and universities. A third law expands protection in
employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and adds
protection in housing. Gov. Davis says he wants ``a new California
based on hope instead of fear, tolerance instead of ignorance.''
``That sounds very Californian to me,'' columnist Chuck Colbert
writes, adding ``and quite all-American.''

<P>
   LEGALIZING THE ILLEGALS. Almost one-third of America's farm
workers are illegal aliens. Yet, due to stricter border
enforcement, the farm-worker labor pool is shrinking, and shortages
of workers are devastating many farm areas. Take, for example, the
San Joaquin Valley, where the most fertile eight counties in the
country suffered a shortage of 80,000 workers last year and
millions of dollars in rotted crops. Farmers and Congress are
working to produce new guest-worker programs that might alleviate
agricultural chaos in the future. A report by columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras.
</P>
<P>
   BILINGUAL EDUCATION CHALLENGED AGAIN. A movement to kill
bilingual education has begun in Arizona. Ron Unz, the Silicon
Valley businessman who fought and beat California's educational
establishment last year, is backing an initiative recently filed by
a Tucson-based group. Members of English for the Children-Arizona
want Latino students who are enrolled in bilingual education
classes to be transferred into a one-year English immersion
program. Unz hopes to get the Arizona initiative on the November
2000 ballot. The effort has frightened some education experts. ``If
polls can predict the future, then the initiative may pass and
affect the way more than 111,000 students with limited English
proficiency are taught,'' writes Rachel Ochoa in this editorial
from Hispanic magazine.

   SEN. HELMS' VINDICTIVE USE OF CONFEDERATE FLAG IS FOR REAL. Sen.
Jesse Helms has an agenda all his own, and he is prepared to
sacrifice the goals of his party and its presidential candidates to
his keep his fixations alive, writes columnist Vernon Jarrett.
Currently, Helms is after former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun,
President Clinton's nominee for ambassador to New Zealand. Helms
announced that he would block her appointment unless she apologized
for a speech she made six years ago on the Senate floor. Her speech
reversed the Senate's prior approval of a Helms-backed bill to
renew the design patent for the United Daughters of the
Confederacy. The Confederate war flag was the centerpiece of the
design. She also led the fight to defeat Helms' attempt to stop
renewal of funding for a commission established to promote
recognition of the Martin Luther King Jr. federal holiday. A
report.

   SAYING GOODBYE TO UNCLE WILT. Columnist Akilah Monifa remembers
the late Wilt Chamberlain and the legacy he left behind. ``He was
almost like a family member. Uncle Wilt was an integral part of my
family. We embraced him as a hero, just as much as we embraced Dr.
Martin Luther King,'' she writes. Monifa reflects on his
accomplishments, both on and off the court. ``Chamberlain was the
epitome of a strong, uncompromising black man ... Not only did we
perceive Chamberlain as physically dominant, he was also
intellectually dominant. He shattered stereotypes of the big,
stupid athlete. He was extremely articulate and outspoken.''
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA DREAMING AND THE GAY CIVIL-RIGHTS REALITY. California
has become the national front-runner in the march toward full
equality for lesbians and gays. Earlier this month, Gov. Gray Davis
signed into law three new pieces of gay civil-rights legislation.
One creates a statewide domestic partnership registry for same-sex
couples. Another law bans discrimination and harassment in public
schools and universities. A third law expands protection in
employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and adds
protection in housing. Gov. Davis says he wants ``a new California
based on hope instead of fear, tolerance instead of ignorance.''
``That sounds very Californian to me,'' columnist Chuck Colbert
writes, adding ``and quite all-American.''

   SAYING GOODBYE TO UNCLE WILT. Columnist Akilah Monifa remembers
the late Wilt Chamberlain and the legacy he left behind. ``He was
almost like a family member. Uncle Wilt was an integral part of my
family. We embraced him as a hero, just as much as we embraced Dr.
Martin Luther King,'' she writes. Monifa reflects on his
accomplishments, both on and off the court. ``Chamberlain was the
epitome of a strong, uncompromising black man ... Not only did we
perceive Chamberlain as physically dominant, he was also
intellectually dominant. He shattered stereotypes of the big,
stupid athlete. He was extremely articulate and outspoken.''

   CALIFORNIA DREAMING AND THE GAY CIVIL-RIGHTS REALITY. California
has become the national front-runner in the march toward full
equality for lesbians and gays. Earlier this month, Gov. Gray Davis
signed into law three new pieces of gay civil-rights legislation.
One creates a statewide domestic partnership registry for same-sex
couples. Another law bans discrimination and harassment in public
schools and universities. A third law expands protection in
employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and adds
protection in housing. Gov. Davis says he wants ``a new California
based on hope instead of fear, tolerance instead of ignorance.''
``That sounds very Californian to me,'' columnist Chuck Colbert
writes, adding ``and quite all-American.''
</P>
<P>
   LEGALIZING THE ILLEGALS. Almost one-third of America's farm
workers are illegal aliens. Yet, due to stricter border
enforcement, the farm-worker labor pool is shrinking, and shortages
of workers are devastating many farm areas. Take, for example, the
San Joaquin Valley, where the most fertile eight counties in the
country suffered a shortage of 80,000 workers last year and
millions of dollars in rotted crops. Farmers and Congress are
working to produce new guest-worker programs that might alleviate
agricultural chaos in the future. A report by columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras.
</P>
<P>
   BILINGUAL EDUCATION CHALLENGED AGAIN. A movement to kill
bilingual education has begun in Arizona. Ron Unz, the Silicon
Valley businessman who fought and beat California's educational
establishment last year, is backing an initiative recently filed by
a Tucson-based group. Members of English for the Children-Arizona
want Latino students who are enrolled in bilingual education
classes to be transferred into a one-year English immersion
program. Unz hopes to get the Arizona initiative on the November
2000 ballot. The effort has frightened some education experts. ``If
polls can predict the future, then the initiative may pass and
affect the way more than 111,000 students with limited English
proficiency are taught,'' writes Rachel Ochoa in this editorial
from Hispanic magazine.

   SEN. HELMS' VINDICTIVE USE OF CONFEDERATE FLAG IS FOR REAL. Sen.
Jesse Helms has an agenda all his own, and he is prepared to
sacrifice the goals of his party and its presidential candidates to
his keep his fixations alive, writes columnist Vernon Jarrett.
Currently, Helms is after former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun,
President Clinton's nominee for ambassador to New Zealand. Helms
announced that he would block her appointment unless she apologized
for a speech she made six years ago on the Senate floor. Her speech
reversed the Senate's prior approval of a Helms-backed bill to
renew the design patent for the United Daughters of the
Confederacy. The Confederate war flag was the centerpiece of the
design. She also led the fight to defeat Helms' attempt to stop
renewal of funding for a commission established to promote
recognition of the Martin Luther King Jr. federal holiday. A
report.

OBESITY RATES RISE SHARPLY IN U.S.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Americans are gobbling down more calories than
ever, resulting in a 50 percent increase in the nation's obesity
rate, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Young people, the more highly educated and Hispanics are leading
the way.
</P>
<P>
   The figures released by the federal agency in Atlanta show that
17.9 percent of Americans are obese. In 1991 the proportion was 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And 45 of the 50 states have rates of obesity of more than 15
percent, compared with just four states in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Federal guidelines define obesity as being at least 30 percent
above ideal weight. For example, a 5-foot-9-inch person who weighs
more than 220 pounds is considered obese.
</P>
<P>
   CDC officials said the results of the study, based on a large
telephone survey of more than 100,000 people, are further evidence
that more effort must go into public health campaigns to combat
poor eating habits and encourage physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity is linked to many chronic and life-threatening diseases,
including heart disease, diabetes and hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Tufts University School of Medicine in Medford,
Mass., reported Monday that 280,000 deaths a year can be attributed
to obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC data, to be published in Wednesday's edition of the
Journal of the American Medical Association, revealed that obesity
was increasing fastest among 18- to 29-year-olds, people with
college educations and people of Hispanic descent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey did not find any significant changes in the rates of
physical activity, indicating that overeating was the cause of most
of the increase in weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the same issue of the medical journal:
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers at Children's Hospital in Boston report that young
people who ate more fiber were less likely to be obese and have
high blood pressure and high levels of bad cholesterol. Fiber
outstripped lower fat intake as being correlated with those
positive health results.
</P>
<P>
   _ A researcher from Saint Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York
found that injections of the hormone leptin increased weight loss
for both obese and lean subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Like other tests of leptin, which is linked to appetite
regulation, the studies did not demonstrate a dramatic difference,
although users did lose more than those who received injections of
a placebo. At the highest doses, obese patients lost an average of
15.6 pounds after 24 weeks. They were also on a diet designed to
give them 500 fewer calories per day than they needed to maintain
their normal weight.

   ROYAL: When it comes to the American Royal, Brenda Spencer and
Julie Weiss are two people from different backgrounds. For Spencer
the Royal is a family tradition. Each year the Kansas architect
follows her dad's footsteps by running the Royal's ``Ring Gang,''
15 guys who keep Hale and Kemper Arenas operating smoothly. Weiss
is a Kansas City advertising account executive who hadn't attended
the Royal since she was a kid. Now she's coordinating this year's
new mass media ad campaign. They represent the crossroads for
Kansas City's 100-year old rodeo and livestock event: celebrating
tradition while replacing the loss of about 40,000 FFA attendees.
This year the Royal has different entertainers such as Bill Cosby,
more prize money for the big livestock events and other attractions

AS COLD WEATHER BECKONS, TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT SKIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The cold almost took Fred Schroeder's toes during
the winter of 1944, when he was stationed in Germany during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just numb for a long time,'' said Schroeder, an avid
outdoorsman who lives in West Sand Lake, N.Y. ``Now I make sure I
wear the right footgear and socks.''
</P>
<P>
   His toes are still hypersensitive to dips in the thermometer, a
lingering complication of frostbite, one of several cold-related
health problems to watch out for this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Add hypothermia, chilblains and Raynaud's phenomenon to the list
and you might wonder whether it's a better idea to hibernate or
head to Florida. Moving south is exactly what some people with
severe cases of Raynaud's phenomenon decide to do. One of the
lesser known afflictions of cooler temperatures, Raynaud's
phenomenon is actually quite common, affecting up to 10 percent of
the population, mostly women between 15 and 50. It usually improves
over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have it, their hands usually turn white,'' said Dr.
R. Clement Darling III, who heads the vascular surgery division at
Albany Medical Center Hospital. ``People complain of having a numb
or dead hand, and they worry that their fingers are going to fall
off.''
</P>
<P>
   In people with the condition, nippy weather or other exposures
to the cold, such as air conditioning or handling a package of
frozen food, can trigger an attack. The problem seems to be an
exaggeration of the body's normal response to cold, when the blood
vessels that supply the hands constrict.
</P>
<P>
   Such vasoconstriction is intensified in people with Raynaud's,
temporarily cutting off the blood supply to the fingers. ``Some
people, it's so bad, you counsel them to move to another part of
the country,'' Darling said.
</P>
<P>
   Others with Raynaud's wear gloves at the slightest chill. In
those with severe cases, physicians may prescribe calcium channel
blockers that help open blood vessels. Otherwise, the best
treatment is prevention, as is the case with all cold-weather
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Although less common than frostbite, cases of chilblains do
happen in the winter. ``It's caused by frequent, repeated exposure
to the cold,'' said Dr. Samuel Bosco, the chief of emergency
medicine at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany. The parts of the body
most often affected are the extremities _ hands, feet, ears, nose
and cheeks. Unlike frostbite, where the cold actually freezes and
kills affected tissue, chilblains is a cold-induced inflammation of
the skin. The affected areas usually become swollen and purplish.
The initial symptoms sometimes include the appearance of pale, numb
spots, followed by a roughening of the skin and pinhead-size
blisters.
</P>
<P>
   While anyone can get a cold injury, those most susceptible are
the young, old and anyone with impaired circulation because of
smoking, drinking, diabetes or neuropathies.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, 74, said he has noticed his tolerance to the cold
gradually diminishing over the past 10 years. ``My fingers will
freeze almost immediately if I don't care for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a reaction is not uncommon, as the body's protective reflex
becomes slower, Bosco said. Besides age, previous cold weather
injuries will also make the body less tolerant to future exposures.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Wood, a technical sergeant with the 109th Airlift Wing of
the New York Air National Guard in Glenville, spends time each year
in Greenland and Antarctica, and helps teach a program on
cold-weather survival. Besides the obvious strategies of dressing
warmly with hats and gloves, he emphasizes the importance of
staying hydrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to drink a lot of water, because of the energy you
exert getting around and keeping your body warm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although you may not feel like you're sweating, ``when you see
your breath hanging in the air, that's moisture leaving your
body,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the proper common sense precautions, winters can be safe
and even pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the snow,'' Schroeder said. ``I wouldn't head down
south for anything.''

DRUG MAY HELP FIGHT `IMAGINED UGLINESS' DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ People who are convinced some part of their body
or face is repulsively ugly may find relief in a drug used to fight
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of body dysmorphic disorder _ also known as ``imagined
ugliness'' _ often seek multiple cosmetic surgeries, cover their
face with makeup, wear wigs and hide at home feeling ashamed of
their appearance. They also obsessively check mirrors and windows
for their reflection, often upsetting themselves further.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published in the November issue of the Archives
of General Psychiatry, researchers found that two-thirds of
patients with the disorder responded to the drug clomipramine,
which blocks the reabsorption of the brain chemical seratonin in
cells. The drug is also used to treat obsessive compulsive
disorder, from which many victims also suffer.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising number of sufferers _ 60 percent in the latest
study _ are men, said Eric Hollander of Mount Sinai Medical Center,
co-author of the research. He presented the results Monday at the
American Medical Association's Science Reporters Conference at the
University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a man believed his penis was being retracted into
his body and had surgery to detach some of the muscles in his
groin.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, a lawyer, worked as a messenger because he was too
afraid of being in situations that might bring attention to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   One in four people with the disorder will attempt suicide,
Hollander said, and most are single because they can't enter into
or sustain relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Still, until fairly recently it has ``been regarded as a rare
and trivial disease,'' when, in fact, it affects as much as 1 to 2
percent of the population, Hollander said. Body dysmorphic disorder
became a diagnosis only 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hollander believes many people diagnosed with obsessive
compulsive disorder, depression and social phobia actually suffer
from BDD but are too ashamed to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   And the relentless bombardment in modern society of images of
perfect bodies may set up conditions that trigger the disorder more
easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of unrealistic images out there, both of men
and women,'' Hollander said.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgeons are becoming increasingly aware and wary of
patients with BDD. Sufferers are usually unhappy with the results
of cosmetic procedures, often suing or even attacking their
surgeons. Many doctors try to screen patients for the disorder
before agreeing to treat them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hollander said, one patient underwent a whopping 23
surgeries in the quest for the perfect face and body.
</P>
<P>
   The disorder usually begins in adolescence, but there have been
some cases where it appeared as early as age 5.
</P>
<P>
   Hollander and colleagues in Rhode Island and Cincinnati are
currently recruiting teen-age sufferers for trials of another drug,
fluorextine, also used for obsessive compulsive disorder.
</P>
<P>
   It has fewer side effects than clomipramine, which has been
known to cause dry mouth, blurred vision and constipation.

STEWART FONDLY REMEMBERED FOR SPIRIT, GOOD WILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KATHY KUDRAVI AND TRAE THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps his last victory will be the one golf fans remember the
most.
</P>
<P>
   On Father's Day 1999, Payne Stewart sank critical putts on the
final three holes to edge father-to-be Phil Mickelson for his
second U.S. Open title. As the last putt dropped, Stewart shouted,
thrust his arms in the air and leapt into the arms of his caddie.
He grabbed Mickelson, told him he would make a great father and ran
to his family to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was killed, along with at least four others, after the
Learjet he was aboard flew uncontrolled from Orlando, Fla., for
hours Monday and crashed near Mina, S.D. He was 42.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were not announced Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was to compete in The Tour Championship in Houston this
week. The pro-am that was scheduled for today was canceled, and the
schedule for the rest of the week was in flux pending memorial
services for Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   A blue ribbon was tied to the name plate on his parking spot at
the Champions Golf Club in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and agents Robert Fraley and Van Ardan were on their way
to a meeting about a proposed venture to build a golf course on 600
acres in Frisco.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Orlando resident and the Tour's leading money winner,
Tiger Woods, was shaken by the news. ``I am deeply saddened by the
events that have taken place,'' Woods said. ``I can't even
comprehend the scope of it. None of us can right now. He was a
close friend of mine. There is an enormous void and emptiness I
feel right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's victory in the Open in June secured him a spot on the
U.S. Ryder Cup team. He won just a half point in that event last
month near Boston, but his presence was considered a motivating
factor for the Americans in the dramatic, come-from-behind victory
over the European squad.
</P>
<P>
   On his dramatic victory in the Open, Stewart said: ``All I
wanted to do was give myself a chance. I never gave up. I got the
job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for his golfing wardrobe of knickers and jaunty cap, as
well as his fiery on-course spirit, Stewart had been undergoing a
career revival recently, capped off by the victory in the Open.
Stewart credited his newfound faith for the turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the fact that my faith in God is so much stronger
and I'm so much more at peace with myself than I've ever been in my
life,'' Stewart said after the Open. ``Where I was with my faith
last year and where I am now is leaps and bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   He had also put his career and family in perspective. ``I'm a
lot older and I'm a lot wiser,'' he said after winning at Pebble
Beach in February. ``I'm more mature. I'm not going to blink and
miss my family growing up. When I'm out at the golf course, I'm
going to prepare myself to be the best I can. And when I'm home,
I'm going to be a father.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to winning the 1999 Open, Stewart also won the 1991
Open and 1989 PGA Championship. His 11 career Tour victories
included the 1990 Byron Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is survived by his mother Bee, of Springfield, Mo., his
wife Tracey and his children _ 13-year-old Chelsea and 10-year-old
Aaron. Stewart was born in Springfield and graduated from SMU in
1979, where he played golf.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the SMU community was stunned by his death.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was awarded the 1998 Distinguished Alumnus Award and was
the grand marshal of the homecoming parade. When the award is
presented later this week, SMU President R. Gerald Turner said
there will be a ``moment of real remembrance'' for Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be doing other things that we simply haven't had time to
think about,'' Turner said. ``We have simply been shocked by this
and grieving over it. As (athletic director Jim) Copeland said, he
was a great alum, a faithful alum, proud of his university, and we
were awful proud of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his legacy is simply one of excellence. He came in as
a very good college golfer and he kept working to make himself
better.''
</P>
<P>
   While Stewart went through an eight-year slump in which he won
just once and he sometimes turned surly toward the galleries and
the media, he always retained his respect for golf's traditions.
</P>
<P>
   He stood up for Colin Montgomerie as the boorish crowd at The
Ryder Cup hurled insults at Montgomerie. With the cup already
decided, Stewart conceded Montgomerie's final putt.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was born Jan. 30, 1957. He attended the tiny Greenwood
Laboratory School in Springfield, which had an enrollment of 400
students and housed grades K-12. From 1971-1975, Stewart was a star
athlete on the school's football, basketball, track and field and
golf teams.
</P>
<P>
   Before his achievements in sports, Stewart began to make a name
for himself in the classroom, said Ruth Norton, who first met
Stewart in 1968 when he was a sixth-grader enrolled in her Spanish
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of my very first students,'' Norton said. ``He was
a very good student and very happy young man. What I liked about
him was his optimism. He was a very nice person and he was a very
responsible student. I was very, very proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Another person who Stewart touched was Jan Stahle. The two first
met in 1975, when Stahle arrived at Greenwood Lab as an exchange
student from Sweden. Stahle had wanted to try out for the football
team that fall and came out dressed in his soccer shorts and shoes,
but saw everyone playing with a football instead. Stahle eventually
made the team, and soon became the kicker. Stewart was the team's
punter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the day when the coach said, `You're on the team.'
I didn't understand, but I looked at Payne and asked him what this
meant and he said, `We've got us a kicker!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Stahle ended up taking Stewart's job, but the two became great
friends and were also teammates on the golf team. Perhaps the
fondest memory Stahle had of Stewart came in 1981 when he saw him
in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just coming back from Sweden and I saw Payne and I said,
`Payne, what are you doing here?' '' Stahle said. ``He said he was
just getting back from his first British Open, and I asked him how
he did. He said, `I finished 63rd.' I asked him how many golfers
were there, and he said 65. But then he said, `Jan, one day you're
going to be one of the best kickers in the NFL and I'm going to be
one of the best golfers in the PGA.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, of course, did just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sure lived up to his statement,'' Stahle said, ``but I
certainly didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart attended SMU from 1976-79. In his final year on the
Mustangs' golf team, Stewart was named the Southwest Conference
co-champion and was also an All-American.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart turned professional and played on the Asian Tour
circuit, where he met his wife, Tracey Ferguson, who was from
Australia. Two years passed before Stewart captured the first
victories of his career, winning the Indonesian and Indian opens.
In 1982, Stewart won his first Tour event at the Quad Cities Open.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, Stewart made a name for himself and was the
second-ranked golfer in the world. He finished the year with $1.2
million in earnings and won two Tour events, the most memorable of
which came when he shot a 67 to beat Mike Reid by one stroke in the
PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and teammate Justin Leonard lost in alternate shot match
play to Jesper Parnevik and Sergio Garcia, 3 and 2, during
September's Ryder Cup. On the final day, Stewart lost to Colin
Montgomerie, 1-up, but will be remembered for conceding the final
hole in a classic display of sportsmanship so that Montgomerie
would no longer have to endure heckling from the gallery.

YANKEES' BROSIUS SHINING IN SERIES AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time when Scott Brosius was an obscure
third baseman for the Oakland Athletics, a decent player but one
fully destined for an unremarkable career.
</P>
<P>
   He hit .304 for the Athletics in 1996, but slumped to .203 in
'97, a sign his productivity was all but spent. Major-league teams
usually have little use for a 31-year-old third baseman who hits 11
homers, drives in 41 runs and strikes out 102 times.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Hayes wasn't doing much better for the New York Yankees,
who were also looking for someone to take pitcher Kenny Rogers and
his $5 million-a-year salary. So a trade was made, one of several
that worked out far better than the Yankees imagined and have
helped push them to the verge of their third world championship in
four years.
</P>
<P>
   They lead the Atlanta Braves two games to none as the World
Series resumes Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium, and the play of a
once-obscure third baseman has done much to put them in that
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited, obviously,'' Brosius said, recalling the trade
that sent him to the Yankees for Rogers. ``Just because when you go
through a year like I went through in Oakland that last year and as
a team struggling like we did, to come over and have a chance to
play on a team that can win the championship, it was like a shot in
the arm for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have received several of those on their way to
becoming a dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cincinnati Reds manager Lou Piniella grew impatient with
Paul O'Neill's inability to hit for power so O'Neill was traded to
the Yankees for Roberto Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners couldn't afford Tino Martinez, just another
big bat in their powerful lineup, so they traded him and reliever
Jeff Nelson to the Yankees for pitcher Sterling Hitchcock and third
baseman Russ Davis. The Yankees rescued catcher Joe Girardi from
the Colorado Rockies for two minor-league pitchers. Chad Curtis was
picked up from the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our particular club, I don't think we hang our hat on one
particular guy,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``I think that helps
everybody feel that what little they do is going to contribute to
our winning.''
</P>
<P>
   But none of them have been as big of a surprise as Brosius, who
hit .300 with 19 homers and 98 runs batted in last season, made the
American League All-Star team and wrapped the season as the most
valuable player in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott gets big hits,'' Torre said. ``He could look awful on
one at-bat, then all of a sudden get a basehit to right field or
hit a home run down the right-field line.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 season wasn't as magical for Brosius. His production
was down, quite possibly because he was worried about his father,
Maury, who was home in Oregon fighting a losing battle to colon
cancer. He passed away Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question it's been a more difficult year than it was last
year, focus-wise,'' Brosius said. ``There's been times when
obviously my mind has kind of been in two places at one time, and
it's difficult to really keep the focus 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In another week, win or lose, I'll be going home,'' said
Brosius, who lives in McMinnville, Ore. ``I'll have the opportunity
at that point to deal with the things that I need to and take care
of things. It's a little bit easier at this point now to kind of
put those other things on hold knowing that some time soon I'll be
back to take care of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' pitching has dominated the Braves in two games,
just like they did the Rangers and Boston Red Sox. But Brosius is
emerging as a legitimate threat to be the first player to win two
consecutive World Series MVP Awards.
</P>
<P>
   He went 3-for-4 in Game 1, and his eighth-inning single off Greg
Maddux started the Yankees' four-run rally. He was 2-for-5 in Game
2 with a run-scoring single in the first and a fifth-inning double
that led to another run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's swinging the bat really well,'' shortstop Derek Jeter
said. ``He makes the offense go from the bottom of the lineup. He's
stepping it up again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers aren't likely to trade outfielder Juan Gonzalez for
Brosius. Nor would they be willing to give up catcher Ivan
Rodriguez or left fielder Rusty Greer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers _ any team _ would love to stumble on some
obscure major-leaguer and find out that when the playoffs come
around, he turns into a big-time player.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius is one reason the Yankees keep winning and are close to
winning again. nn

BRAVES' WOES MAKING COX LOOK BAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If it seems odd using something Bobby Valentine said
to defend Bobby Cox, consider it one of the quirks of baseball. The
ball looks perfectly round, but it can take some awfully strange
bounces.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the players make the plays, the manager looks OK,''
Valentine had said after the Mets had won a dramatic, 15-inning
Game 5 against the Braves in the National League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, managing out of complete desperation, had used every
move he ever knew and some he didn't to keep the Mets alive during
that long afternoon and night at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Players made plays. Pitchers pitched. Hitters, eventually, hit.
Otherwise, some of Valentine's decisions in that game would be
second-guessed until the day he dies.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that, until that game, Cox had done absolutely
nothing wrong in the postseason. Every move he made, every button
he pushed seemed to work. The consensus had been overwhelming: Up
to that point, Cox had been giving Valentine a lesson in postseason
managing.
</P>
<P>
   Since Game 5 of the NLCS, things have changed dramatically. Now,
it's Cox who can't seem to do much of anything right.
</P>
<P>
   His Braves will walk into Yankee Stadium on Tuesday for Game 3
of the 95th annual World Series down two games to none to the
defending world champion Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing Cox does right in this Series might be his first.
</P>
<P>
   When announced first-game starter Tom Glavine, who is scheduled
to pitch Tuesday, called in sick Saturday, Cox naturally tabbed a
well-rested Greg Maddux to take his place. The Yankees tagged the
four-time Cy Young Award winner for four runs in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cox had replaced Ryan Klesko, a defensive liability at first,
with Brian Hunter. Hunter made two costly errors in the four-run
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Cox brought in closer John Rocker early to try and quell the
threat. Left-handers hit only .147 off Rocker this season, and Paul
O'Neill batted .190 against them, but O'Neill pulled a 3-1 fastball
into right field for a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for some way to score runs in Game 2, Cox surprisingly
shook up his lineup, benching three regulars in favor of ancient
shortstop Ozzie Guillen, fastball-hitting second baseman Keith
Lockhart and left-handed-hitting catcher Greg Myers. Cox knew he
was sacrificing defense in an effort to get more offense. He didn't
know he was cutting his own throat.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart botched a double play and threw a ball against the
screen behind first. Guillen dropped an easy soft liner for an
error to cost another run. The two were a combined 0-for-6. Myers
was 2-for-3 and drove in a meaningless run in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Cox has often seemed helpless as Yankees counterpart Joe Torre
has outmaneuvered him to get more favorable matchups.
</P>
<P>
   When his players fail, Cox has been able to do little but throw
up his hands and shake his head in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   He's not this bad, I promise. Bobby Cox is, in fact, one of the
best managers in the game. He rarely gets much credit outside the
Braves' organization, but was recently honored as ``The Sporting
News'' manager of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Even Valentine had said Cox ought to get the award, ``because he
had to manage this year.''
</P>
<P>
   It was taken as a backhanded compliment at the time, but
Valentine was right. With first baseman Andres Galarraga, catcher
Javy Lopez and closer Kerry Ligtenberg out of the lineup most of
the season, with John Smoltz battling injuries and with Maddux
having an un-Maddux-like year, Cox couldn't just rely on his great
pitching staff to get him by.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 question has to be: `Can you lead men?' Bobby Cox
can lead men,'' Braves president Stan Kasten told ``The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution'' before the Series began.
</P>
<P>
   His players love him, at least partly because they never have to
fear what he's going to say to reporters after a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing worse than being ripped and reading about it
in the newspaper,'' Glavine said in the same article. ``You're more
fearful of making a mistake if you think you're going to read about
it for the next four days or sit on the bench for the next five.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Myers, a veteran of five organizations: ``Even if it's not
in the paper, in other clubhouses, you might get a sniff that a
manager doesn't like a certain player. You don't hear that around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some managers, Cox doesn't separate the stars and the
role players. He probably spends more time with the latter than he
does the former, understanding that they need it more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our confrontations,'' Cox said of his relationship
with the players, ``but they never become public. They haven't been
printed because nobody knows about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cox can't hide what's happening in this World Series. The
Braves' dreadfully thin bench has been exposed. Their defense has
been awful (13 errors in 12 postseason games). Their lack of a true
cleanup hitter without Galarraga has been glaring.
</P>
<P>
   What Valentine said can just as easily be turned around: When
players don't make plays, the manager DOES NOT look OK.
</P>
<P>
   Cox keeps pushing all the same buttons that helped the Braves
win 103 games during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment at least, no one's answering the bell. nn

GLAVINE TO START GAME 3 FOR BRAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Braves pitcher Tom Glavine, hindered by the flu and
scratched from his Game 1 start, is expected to start Tuesday
night. Glavine threw off the mound before Game 2 in Atlanta without
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt pretty good,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``He
thinks he can start.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine said Monday he lost 5 to 7 pounds while he was sick, and
his stamina is a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to eat and drink as much as I can the last
couple of days,'' Glavine said. ``I don't know how much weight you
can gain by eating soup and eating crackers, but I feel OK. I don't
know how my stamina is going to be. I'm 100 times better today than
I was (Sunday). Am I going to be 100 percent (Tuesday)? I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz would pitch if Glavine can't go. ROCKER RECEPTION
</P>
<P>
   Braves reliever John Rocker returns to New York on Tuesday, his
first appearance since the National League Championship Series at
Shea Stadium. Rocker spent three days in the NLCS vilifying Mets
fans, and they responded with heavy boos, catcalls and occasional
debris being thrown his way.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker said Yankees fans, ``will probably be loud. There's only
10 or so people who I care about, and none of them will be in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   The visitors' bullpen at Yankee Stadium can be a tough place. It
sits just beyond the left-field fence and just below the bleachers,
which usually has a vociferous crowd especially during the
playoffs. BRAVES STILL HOPEFUL
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitching and history give the Braves hope they can come
back and win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and Greg Maddux in Games 3,
4 and 5,'' Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone said. ``When you have
a rotation like that, you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves also remember 1996. They were down three games to one
in the NLCS against St. Louis and won three in a row. They also
know they won the first two games of the World Series that year in
New York, only to have the Yankees win the next four, including
three in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it can be done,'' Braves third baseman Chipper Jones
said. ``Not many people are giving us a chance, but I'll tell you
what: When we won the first two games here in 1996, no one gave
them a chance either. And they came back against our staff, when
they were in their prime. It's definitely a steep hill to climb,
but it can be done.'' TORRE ON OWNERS
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre has worked for George Steinbrenner and
Ted Turner. Torre was the Braves' manager in 1982-84 and said the
biggest difference is Steinbrenner is much more active with his
team now than Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both want to win,'' Torre said. ``They both want to be
No. 1, and, of course, maybe Ted, his focus, he went to satellite
and TBS and CNN and CNN2 and Captain Courageous (yachting) and that
whole nine yards. He's tried a number of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is George's life, and Ted has other things that go on in
his life.'' DH POSSIBILITIES
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox said Jose Hernandez will be his designated hitter for
Tuesday's game against left-hander Andy Pettitte. He said Keith
Lockhart will fill the role against right-hander Roger Clemens in
Game 4 and Orlando Hernandez in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Torre gets to choose between Chili Davis, Darryl Strawberry and
Jim Leyritz, but has not announced a decision. Leyritz, a
right-handed hitter, is a possibility because Glavine is
left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said the designated hitter is an advantage for the Yankees
because, ``We only sign people to be the designated hitter in our
league.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said the Braves had the advantage in Atlanta without the DH
but, ``we let them escape. It didn't work out that way. They scored
enough runs to win.''

IT MAY BE CLICHE, BUT TEAM EFFORT SPURRED COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cliche: When the going gets tough, the tough get
going.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Deion Sanders defies Cowboys' medical staff and plays most
of Sunday's second half against Washington after suffering a
first-quarter concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Cliche: Leaders aren't made, they're born.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Several Cowboys leaders take it upon themselves and do
something about the team's slide the previous two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cliche: You're only as good as your last game.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: The Cowboys have to look ahead because they face the
toughest six-week block of games on their schedule, including four
road games, beginning Sunday at Indianapolis, and followed by a
group of 1998 playoff teams _ at Minnesota, Green Bay, at Arizona,
Miami and at New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked to me like we had some guys who didn't like where we
were, and wanted us to get to another (level),'' Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey said Monday. ``There were some guys who took it personally
to help lift this team up'' after successive 13-10 road losses to
Philadelphia and New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey didn't name names but might as well have been referring
to Sanders, Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Larry Allen, `Rocket'
Ismail, Darren Woodson and Chad Hennings. This core of veteran
players came through Sunday in a convincing, return-to-first-place,
36-20 victory over the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey praised the offensive line, particularly the play of
All-Pro Larry Allen at left guard. Smith (80 yards on 24 carries)
was effective inside the tackles and Aikman was neither sacked nor
pressured into any interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no long-winded speeches during the week,'' Gailey
said. ``All you can do (as a coach) is address the issue of where
we are and where we need to be, and then see if your guys can start
to pull together. I think there were some subtle (signs of
leadership) that went on within the team during the week, and on
Sunday they did (pull together).''
</P>
<P>
   No more so than Sanders, who said that he took it ``personally''
to make a big play on special teams _ something that hadn't
happened in the first five games. Sanders, concussion and all, put
the game away with a 70-yard punt return for a touchdown with just
over nine minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he took it personally,'' Gailey said with a wry grin.
``I'll make sure I address it the same way this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who had been replaced by Kevin Mathis at right
cornerback, took it upon himself to race back onto the field
straight from the locker room during an early third-quarter
defensive series. Gailey thought he had been cleared to play.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until immediately following the punt return that
Gailey was informed that the Cowboys doctors and trainers didn't
want him playing after a helmet-to-helmet collision with
Washington's 290-pound long snapper Dan Turk on a first-quarter
punt return.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey admitted that he generally will err on the side of
caution in most cases. But in this case, even if he had known about
the Sanders' failure to receive medical clearance, he may not have
stopped Deion from doing what Deion wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   Cliche: You can't have good leaders unless you have good
followers.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: Jason Tucker, Jeff Ogden, Robert Thomas, Dat Nguyen and
Charlie Williams were just a few of the Cowboys' second-line
players who contributed to victory with at least one impact play
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said that these young players couldn't help but receive a
message from such contributions as Sanders' stoicism, Smith's
perseverance, Aikman's leadership, Allen's consistency, Hennings'
courage and Woodson's headiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these things do is set an example, a tempo, whatever you
want to call it,'' Gailey said. ``It lets the young guys sense the
importance of where we are and what we're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we have to do: We have to create a sense of
importance and let everybody understand that this is how we have to
go about it each week.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliche: There is no time like the present.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: The Cowboys begin their toughest stretch of six games on
the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we don't stay on an even keel,'' Gailey said. ``I
hope we build on this game. Because if you don't have a sense of
urgency every week in this league, you'll lose.'' nn

COWBOYS' SANDERS OUTFOXED DOCTORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys coach Chan Gailey never thought
his admission that nobody cleared Deion Sanders to play in the
second half of Sunday's 38-20 victory against the Redskins after he
suffered a mild concussion in the first half would be the source of
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of the increased attention head injuries are
receiving, Sanders' decision to circumvent doctors orders by
sneaking out of the locker room and running straight on the field
is creating quite a stir.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who said he didn't know Sanders returned to the game
without permission until after his 70-yard punt return for a
touchdown in the fourth quarter, said Monday that the Cowboys'
doctors were not happy about the situation. Dr. J.R. Zamorano was
the attending physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have turned out much worse,'' Gailey said. ``But
players take that chance every time they play. I thought he had
been cleared. Normally guys don't run back on the field unless they
have been cleared. They said he was not supposed to be out there. I
told him to come off. He did reluctantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who also suffered slight amnesia, said he was fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my first concussion,'' Sanders said. ``I've had one
before. But I wasn't concerned about that. As long as I can see the
numbers and know what I got to do, I'm all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Also driving Sanders was a desire to teach Redskins receivers
Albert Connell and Michael Westbrook a lesson about talking trash.
Apparently, he wanted to finish what they started early in the week
with comments about Sanders not being able to cover Connell or
Westbrook one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said the Redskins receivers went too far. He told
Redskins receiver Irving Fryar, who like Sanders is also a
preacher, as much before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to the Rev. Fryar and told him, `Please excuse me for
what I'm about to do,' '' he said. ``Because I knew I was going out
there to fight a little bit and crank it up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   On the second play of the game, Sanders said he ``layed hands''
on Connell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deion lifted (Connell's) helmet up and punched him on the
chin,'' said Westbrook, who pulled Connell away from the scene.
``He should have gotten called for a penalty or thrown out of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said he wasn't worried about getting a penalty because
of his reputation. He said the bottom line was that ``if you're
going to talk that talk, you've got to walk that walk. He wasn't
ready to walk that walk yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Connell beat The knockout came with Sanders' punt return for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't no fun when the rabbit got the gun,'' Sanders said.
``I know a lot of guys want to make a name off me because I'm a
big-game player, but I got the gun also.'' IRVIN EXAMINED
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin was examined Monday by Dr.
Drew Dossett, a local spine and back specialist. The findings were
inconclusive, but Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the exam showed
nothing alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said X-rays ``showed nothing positively or negatively,''
about the swelling in Irvin's cervical spine near his neck. Irvin
will undergo an MRI later in the week, Jones said, and it will be
compared to an MRI taken after he suffered the injury after a hit
in the game at Philadelphia. INJURY REPORT
</P>
<P>
   Out _ WRs Wane McGarity (separated right shoulder) and Michael
Irvin (spinal cord contusion).
</P>
<P>
   Questionable _ CB Kevin Mathis (left hamstring), CB Kevin Smith
(strained neck) and S George Teague.
</P>
<P>
   Probable _ RB Emmitt Smith (right groin strain), C Mark
Stepnoski (lower back contusion), FB Robert Thomas (right knee
contusion). nn

FLORIDA STATE, PENN STATE TOP FIRST BCS POLL (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gentlemen, start your hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series rankings were released Monday
night, with five more computer rankings added to the statistical,
analytical mix. And Version 1.0 of this window to the 1999 college
football national championship shows that the top two teams in the
computer rankings match in the traditional writers and coaches
polls _ Florida State and Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS rankings are used to decide which two teams will play
for the national championship. The top two teams in the final poll
on Dec. 5 will play for the national championship in the Sugar Bowl
on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   If the Seminoles (8-0) and the Nittany Lions (8-0) finish the
regular season undefeated, they're practically assured of playing
each other in New Orleans. And that means that Virginia Tech, No. 3
in both polls and the BCS rankings, could be denied a chance at the
national championship even if the Hokies finish 11-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not telling them (Virginia Tech's players) anything about
rankings, computers, the BCS,'' Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer
said Monday. ``If we take care of business, everything will turn
out OK. You think about all the different possibilities, that's the
wrong thing to think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when all is said and done, the two best teams will
play for the title.''
</P>
<P>
   The rankings are figured this way: an average of the writers and
coaches polls; an average of the computer rankings (for each team,
its seven top rankings in the eight computer polls are used);
strength of schedule and won-lost record. Each of those four
components makes up 25 percent of a team's ranking.
</P>
<P>
   In Week One of the BCS rankings, Virginia Tech is the No. 1 team
among the computer rankings category, but is significantly behind
the top teams in terms of strength of schedule. The Hokies opened
the season against James Madison, a Division I-AA school. Plus, the
Big East Conference is not considered strong.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State, one of six undefeated Division I-A teams, are
ranked sixth in the writers and writers polls, the Big 12
Conference's highest-ranked team. Tennessee and Florida, each with
one loss, are ranked ahead of the Wildcats in both polls. Kansas
State is No. 5 in the BCS rankings, but was hurt by its strength of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even remotely concerned about the BCS,'' Kansas State
coach Bill Snyder said Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, the defending national champion, was No. 4 in the BCS
rankings. The Vols benefitted from their strength of schedule,
which is ranked first among the top 15 BCS teams.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the first under the BCS system, the first week's
poll had UCLA and Ohio State ranked No. 1 and No. 2. Neither played
for the national championship. The teams that met in the Fiesta
Bowl, Tennessee and Florida State, were ranked No. 3 and No. 5 in
the first poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of football left,'' Beamer said. ``If we do
anything but focus on Pittsburgh (Saturday's opponent) and the rest
of our games, none of this is going to matter.'' nn

INJURY-FREE PACK IN POSITION AT FRONT OF POINT-GUARD PACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Robert Pack sat at his locker wearing ice packs on both
knees and on one shoulder. But for a change, Pack is not on ice.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mavericks are hurting, Pack feels great. Six players,
including point guard Steve Nash, who has battled Pack for the
starting job, are in the training room trying to get well for the
Nov. 2 season opener. Pack is in only for maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   He laughs at the irony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely feels good not to be injured,'' Pack said.
</P>
<P>
   A medical student might find Pack an interesting case study. In
his eight NBA seasons, he has had a dislocated left shoulder, a
torn right hamstring, a torn ligament in his right thumb, a
fractured fourth metacarpal in his left hand, a sprained left
ankle, a bone bruise, a damaged peroneal nerve in his right leg and
loose cartilage in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Can you feel Pack's pain?
</P>
<P>
   Injuries, instead of points or assists, have defined his career.
Pack has played in only 379 of a possible 624 games. At his
healthiest, Pack played 77 games for Denver in 1992-93 and averaged
10.5 points and 4.4 assists per game in his second season. If he
can play that many games this season and produce those kind of
numbers, Pack could become the point guard of choice for the
Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing a perfect game for him,'' Mavericks coach and
general manager Don Nelson said. ``There's nobody better at the
running game.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was running the show for New Jersey and Dallas in
1996-97, Pack averaged 14.3 points and 8.4 assists per game in 54
games. But part of the reason he has played for five NBA teams
might be his injury issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like when I'm on the court people can see that I can
play,'' said Pack, who missed 25 of 50 games last season because of
two separate injuries. ``I am confident. I came into this league
undrafted, went into Portland's camp and made that team. I've
always had confidence. But I have to be on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Pack blames bad luck. How else to explain his being injury
prone?
</P>
<P>
   The only question about Pack's workout habits is whether he
trains too hard.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 190-pounder is the picture of health. His legs are
built like Sycamores, his arms like sledgehammers. Assistant coach
Donnie Nelson wonders if Pack's tightly wound muscles make him more
susceptible to pulls and tears. Pack quit wondering a long time
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been little injuries that have kept me out _ a
broken hand here, a torn ligament in a thumb there,'' Pack said.
``They have been little things that have nothing to do with the
physical. You're working out and in shape, which makes it tough.
But I've had my will to keep coming back. I know I still love this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehabilitation has become an accepted part of Pack's game.
</P>
<P>
   Getting healthy, however, is the easy part. The hard part comes
in regaining his confidence and his fearlessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a hindrance in missing games. It's a hindrance
in putting yourself in the heat of a battle,'' Donnie Nelson said.
``You're more reluctant to go in there with a reckless abandon, and
you're a little bit more cautious because you do want to stay
healthy. That has a tendency to play mental mind games with guys
who have chronic injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once did Pack consider that he might never play again.
</P>
<P>
   He was averaging career-highs of 18.1 points and 7.8 assists
with a youthful Washington team in 1995-96 when he was hit on the
side of his right knee. Pack had damaged the peroneal nerve, a
debilitating injury usually seen in hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caused my whole foot to go dead,'' Pack said. ``It's
similar to being paralyzed. It was just freaky. Because I could
walk, people would think that I could play, but you can't run. You
can't even pick up your foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part is there's no treatment for it. You just have
to sit there and wait for the nerve to rejuvenate. It took me three
months before I got the feeling back in my foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Pack did not return that season, which led to questions about
his toughness. But while big bodies and bad luck have broken his
bones, words have never hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in inner-city New Orleans, where murder was a part of
life. He also grew up in the same house with four women _ three
sisters and his mother _ which made getting to the bathroom first a
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm a competitor. I know I go out there and give my all
every night, so I can't understand people questioning whether I
want to play or not,'' Pack said. ``But I'm a tough person maybe
because of the way I've grown up. My background has made me tough.
Things like that, people questioning me, that can never break my
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only he can stay healthy. nn

YANKEES' PITCHING DOOMS BRAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Clemens is considered one of the nine greatest pitchers of
all time, but right now he's only the fourth-best starter on the
New York Yankees staff.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the World Series is over. The Yankees will take at
least two of the next three in the Bronx and the Braves will never
get back to Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves must win with starting pitching, but so far Orlando
Hernandez and David Cone have been better than Greg Maddux and
Kevin Millwood. In most other areas the Yankees are better, so when
the Braves get beaten at their own game at their own park, you know
they have no chance.
</P>
<P>
   Other random observations:
</P>
<P>
   If Rangers fans have been watching the playoffs closely, they
should realize there's a real possibility that the second-best team
in baseball resided in Arlington this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers don't have the Braves' starting pitching, but they
were much better in every other area, especially offense.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers owner Tom Hicks is right when he says the Rangers should
cut their payroll, but not just to save money. They need an
infusion of youth, which they'll get from Ruben Mateo in center
field and Mike Lamb at third base.
</P>
<P>
   But developing young pitching is the only way they'll ever get
better than the Yankees and the two most important players in
spring training next year will be Esteban Loaiza and Matt Perisho.
</P>
<P>
   If Loaiza can build on his second-half success and Perisho can
crack the rotation after winning 15 games at Triple A, then the
Rangers can let left-handers Corey Lee and Doug Davis get a full
year in at Triple A themselves. By 2001, the Rangers could have a
young and talented rotation.
</P>
<P>
   It's either that or pay $6.6 million bonuses to Cuban refugees.
The Yankees have never hesitated to flaunt their riches, they're
just spending it better and they hit the jackpot in Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The fans _ not some self-impressed blue-ribbon panel _ should
pick the All-Century Team, but Frank Robinson, Joe Morgan and
Roberto Clemente were glaring omissions. Having a committee add at
least five players to correct oversights was the right thing to do
because in their time, Stan Musial and Christy Mathewson were two
of the most popular and well-respected players ever.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the Pete Rose controversy is this: Former commissioner
Bart Giamatti and then-lieutenant Fay Vincent originally offered
Rose a 10-year suspension. Then they dropped it to seven. Either
way he'd now be automatically reinstated. But he took the
indefinite suspension because he really thought he'd be reinstated
after one year.
</P>
<P>
   If you ever watched ``Hawaii 5-0, Hill Street Blues'' or
``Barney Miller'' religiously, you'll remember that once a season
there was a crook who looked just like John Rocker and was just as
crazy.
</P>
<P>
   If you watch the Yankees long enough, you grow tired of Paul
O'Neill. He whines too much at the umpires and throwing an elbow at
Maddux in Game 1 was cheap. But the guy has incredible at-bats. No
other player fouls off as many tough pitches as O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' starting pitching is just like the Rangers' offense:
good enough to get you there but not good enough to finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-kept secret at the World Series is Don Baylor will be
the Cubs manager as soon as it's over. Odds are Yankees third base
coach Willie Randolph will get the job in Milwaukee while the
Indians job is between Cleveland hitting coach Charlie Manuel or
Yankees hitting coach Chris Chambliss.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hargrove must ``really'' want to manage again _ and exact
revenge on Indians GM John Hart _ if he's foolish enough to pursue
the Orioles job.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers feel they have three qualified managerial candidates
in dugout coach Bucky Dent, third base coach Jerry Narron and
Triple-A manager Greg Biagini. But general manager Doug Melvin said
nobody has called looking for permission to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   Still haven't received a satisfactory explanation to why the
Secretary-General of the United Nations is throwing out the first
pitch before Game 3. But no doubt NBC's Jim Gray will get to the
bottom of it soon enough. nn

TEXAS COACH PRAISES PLAY OF DEFENSIVE TACKLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After the upset victory over Nebraska on
Saturday, Texas coach Mack Brown went coast-to-coast with the news
that the Longhorns had two of the best defensive tackles in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I thought we had two of the best in the country who
were on the rise because they were unknown right now,'' Brown said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Make that heavy on the were unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Juniors Shaun Rogers and Casey Hampton shed whatever national
cloak of anonymity they were wearing with a big-play-after-big-play
performance in the 24-20 victory over then-No. 3 Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to build ourselves up as a defense and
especially as a front four,'' Rogers said. ``I think Casey and I
are one of the best defensive tackle tandems in the nation. And
when you beat a team like Nebraska that has the tale about them
always having one of the best offensive lines in the country, it
does bring how people view you up to their level.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lines might soon start measuring their performance by
how they handle the 6-foot-4, 315-pound Rogers. He won his second
Mike Campbell Award, signifying the team's top defensive
performance, against Nebraska. Rogers made nine tackles _ five of
them for losses _ as Texas limited the Huskers to 192 yards
rushing, 73 yards below their average.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers previously won the Campbell Award for his performance in
a 38-21 victory against Rutgers. He leads Texas with 16 tackles
behind the line for 56 yards in losses, is second with four sacks,
and fourth on the team with 46 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska had almost no success running up the middle against
Rogers and Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nebraska squirted some runs on us with the tailback probably
because we overplayed the option,'' Brown said. ``But the fullback
doesn't hurt us and normally the fullback trap kills you against
Nebraska. And the quarterback doesn't hurt us taking it up inside.
All their yards were outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tackles have been the key to our defense because they've
put so much pressure on quarterbacks, they've allowed our young
secondary to grow up. I felt they were every bit as physical as
Nebraska's front _ and they are one of the best offensive lines in
the country year in and year out. \RRogers and Hampton\S played as
well in that game as anyone could have.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton won Campbell Awards against North Carolina State and
Kansas State. His 54 tackles, including 28 solo tackles, lead the
team. He also has 10 other stops for losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to the tackles taking on the blocks and the
linebackers cleaning up and making the plays,'' linebacker Anthony
Hicks said. ``These guys are taking on the blocks and making the
plays before we can get there. They're getting into the backfield
and disrupting plays before they start.''
</P>
<P>
   Country, take note. nn

TEXAS A&AMP;M MIGHT HAVE TO START FRESHMAN AT QUARTERBACK
</HEADLINE>
 12 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a separated left shoulder prevents Texas A&AMP;M quarterback
Randy McCown from playing in Saturday's game against Oklahoma
State, coach R.C. Slocum said Monday that his starter will be
freshman Mark Farris.
</P>
<P>
   McCown suffered the injury to his non-throwing shoulder in a
51-6 loss to Oklahoma on Saturday night. He is listed as
questionable for Saturday's 2:30 p.m. game in College Station
between No. 22 A&AMP;M (5-2, 2-2) and Oklahoma State (3-3, 1-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see what Randy can do by the end of the week,''
Slocum said. ``If he can't play, we would go with Mark Farris.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris, 24, spent five years as a minor-league baseball player
in the Pittsburgh Pirates' farm system before enrolling at A&AMP;M in
January. He shared the backup duties with redshirt freshman Vance
Smith, a Fort Worth Christian graduate, until the Oklahoma game,
when Slocum said Farris' performance in relief of cCown moved him
ahead of Smith.
</P>
<P>
   After McCown departed with 9:20 remaining in the third quarter
against the Sooners, Smith entered the game. He completed 1 of 6
passes for 5 yards, with one interception. Farris replaced him and
connected on 3 of 10 for 30 yards, with no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark moved ahead of Vance for this week, based on that
performance,'' Slocum said. ``If Randy can't play, we'd go with him
and see how it goes.'' SOLICH SEES HOLDING
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing videotapes, Nebraska coach Frank Solich said
game officials missed a holding call on Texas wide receiver Kwame
Cavil on the play that produced the Longhorns' game-winning
touchdown pass in a 24-20 victory over the Cornhuskers. Texas'
final score came on a short pass from Major Applewhite to Mike
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas tight end turned it into a 17-yard touchdown play by
breaking tackles and following downfield blocks as he traversed the
left sideline. One of those clearing blocks, said Solich, showed
Cavil with a handful of jersey on a Nebraska defender as Jones
passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about it,'' Solich said. ``I've seen it
from a lot of different angles.''
</P>
<P>
   The score, with 5:51 remaining, came on a third-and-7 play.
Asked if he thought it made the difference in the outcome, Solich
said: ``If the penalty is called, they don't get points there and
they have to try again. I'd like to think it would have made a
difference.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   This week's Oklahoma at Colorado game has been moved into the
2:30 ABC time slot.
</P>
<P>
   Big 12 players of the week included Kansas State quarterback
Jonathan Beasley (offensive), Colorado linebacker Jashon Sykes
(defensive) and Texas Tech kick returner John Norman (special
teams).
</P>
<P>
   Colorado coach Gary Barnett said he expects quarterback Mike
Moschetti, who missed last week's 16-12 victory over Iowa State
because of a concussion, to play Saturday against Oklahoma. nn

RADER OUT, HENDERSON IN AT TULSA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave Rader, who coached more football games than anyone else in
Tulsa history, was fired Monday in the midst of the school's eighth
consecutive losing season.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Judy MacLeod announced that defensive
coordinator Pat Henderson, who was an assistant at TCU from
1994-96, will coach the final four games of the season. The Golden
Hurricane is 1-6 on the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a difficult year for our players, as well as our
coaches, fans and the university,'' said MacLeod, who gave Rader a
four-year contract extension last year. ``The decision has not been
an easy one, but we felt that this was the appropriate time to move
in another direction. We appreciate the contributions that Dave
Rader has made to the University of Tulsa. He has represented the
university and directed the football program in a first-class
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   An extremely popular individual and former star quarterback at
Tulsa, Rader, 42, was in his 12th season as the Hurricane's head
coach. Despite the team's record, the timing of his dismissal drew
criticism from his fellow coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saddened and disappointed,'' TCU coach Dennis Franchione
said. ``When that day comes for me, I just hope they let me finish
the season before they fire me. There are probably a lot of reasons
other than Dave why it didn't work out up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand why we need to do that. That guy's
coached there 12 years, and we're talking about four more games _
maybe a month. They couldn't give him that?''
</P>
<P>
   Rice coach Ken Hatfield had a similar response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saddened completely,'' he said. ``If there's a better man
to do that job at Tulsa, I don't know who he is. Dave has given
that school his blood, sweat and tears for a long, long time, and
nobody in America had less to work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``To rebuild that program, they're probably going to have to
give the next coach twice as much as they gave Dave ... which
brings up the question, why didn't they give it to a guy who loved
the school so much? I will sorely miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   A Tulsa native, Rader was a two-year starter who amassed more
than 3,000 total yards with the Golden Hurricane and led the 1978
team to a 9-2 record. He played one year in the NFL with the Giants
before becoming an assistant coach for several years at Alabama,
Mississippi State and Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming the head coach in 1988, he took Tulsa to two bowls in
his first four seasons, with the '91 team going 10-2 with a victory
against San Diego State in the Freedom Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   After that, however, a long spiral of losing set in as Tulsa
slashed its athletic budget and tightened its academic
requirements. Following Saturday's loss to Hawaii, Rader's record
stood at 49-80-1.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, 47, was TCU's defensive coordinator for three seasons
before returning to Tulsa _ he coached the linebackers in 1983-84
before going to Arizona State with John Cooper _ for the same job.
His first game as interim head coach will be Saturday against
Fresno State.

AUTHOR CAN RELATE TO BibLE'S `BAD GIRLS' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eve, the first woman in the Bible, becomes Evelyn Whitebloom of
Savannah, Ga. Delilah, the Philistine woman who cuts Samson's hair
to rob him of his strength, is Lila, a hairdresser from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the fictional versions of biblical characters
presented in Liz Curtis Higgs' new book, ``Bad Girls of the
Bible,'' (WaterBrook Press, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``I did this because I was a bad girl myself,'' Higgs said this
week. She is an author and humorist who speaks throughout the
nation. In 1995, she received the Council of Peers Award from the
National Speakers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Previous titles include ``Only Angels Can Wing It, The Rest of
Us Have to Practice'' and ``Why Life is More Fun After the Big
4-0.'' She also is a columnist for Today's Christian Woman
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I studied a lot of biblical role models for women, but I found
I could not identify with them,'' Higgs said. She didn't have much
in common, she said, with Mary the mother of Jesus; Ruth, the
faithful servant and wife; or Esther, who courageously spoke out
for her Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just too good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biblical women she felt close to was Jezebel, a
wealthy Phoenician princess and follower of the god Baal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I identified with her pushy personality. I understood her need
for control. I empathized with her angry outbursts ... and I was
aghast when I got to her gruesome ending,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a bad girl all right, but boy did she teach me what
not to do in my marriage!''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Because they were made in the image of God, as we
were, these bad girls weren't truly rotten to the core. They just
behaved that way _ and very convincingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Women of the Bible have been written about for years, said
Dorothy Patterson, editor of the Woman's Study Bible, published in
1995 by Thomas Nelson and including essays on about 100 biblical
women.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more recent books about wayward women is ``The Harlot
by the Side of the Road,'' a 1997 book by Jonathan Kirsch
(Ballantine, $14.95), which takes a more scholarly approach, said
Patterson. She directs a new women's theological studies programs
at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not an approach I would take,'' Patterson said of Higgs'
book. ``I prefer to let the Bible speak for itself instead of
reading things into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Higgs' book does provide fresh insights on biblical women,
Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Higgs tells of her own experiences as a ``bad girl'' at the
beginning of the book. She says she put herself in a position of
being sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1950s and 1960s, there were a lot of barriers to being
bad girls, but they all broke down in the 1970s,'' she said. ``I
was looking for joy and, instead, settled for fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think humor tears down walls,'' Higgs said. ``My book was
written for the heart of women. I hope many `bad girls' out there
will be helped by it.''

GALVESTON WRECK SITE IS CONCRETE REMINDER OF SHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ She sits there, partially submerged in
Galveston Bay like a Phoenix that stumbled and stuck in the mud.
Her hull is mostly above the waterline, her bow pointing upward,
toward the bay bridge that helps tourists and commuters move
between Galveston Island and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Local shrimp boats pass to either side of her without bother, as
though she were just a shadow cast on the water by billowy clouds.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for a small historical marker a half-mile away on
the edge of Pelican Island, curious ferryboat riders and saltwater
fishermen could only guess at the identity of the aged gray,
ghostlike ruin. The constant wash of the bay has dulled her once
sharp definition.
</P>
<P>
   She is the SS Selma, a World War I-era steamship that was
commissioned too late to join in the war effort and was constructed
of unusual materials because of a wartime steel shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The Selma was made of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steel shortages during World War I led to the U.S. to build
experimental concrete ships, the largest of which was the SS Selma,
today partially submerged in Galveston Bay and visible from this
site,'' reads the historical marker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was built in Mobile, Alabama, and named to honor Selma,
Alabama, for its successful wartime liberty loan drive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Selma was launched on June 28, 1919, which just happened to
be the same day the Germans signed the Treaty of Versailles,
officially ending World War I.
</P>
<P>
   There were about a dozen concrete ships built at the time, but
the Selma was the largest at 7,500 tons. Her cost was about $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Given the cost, and the great curiosity surrounding cement
ships, the Selma was immediately pressed into service carrying
crude oil from Tampico, Mexico, to ports along the Texas coast.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain just how many trips she made. Some reports say
she steamed the Gulf for three years; one says she made several
successful trips; and yet another says she ran aground on a jetty
in Tampico and split her hull near the bow on her first voyage.
</P>
<P>
   The historical marker says, ``In Tampico, Mexico, on May 31,
1920, the SS Selma hit a jetty, ripping a hole in its hull about 60
feet long.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, she was towed back to Galveston for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't be made. The U.S. Shipping Board gave up on
repairing the unique ship and decided to sell the Selma but
couldn't find any buyers. Eventually, she was stripped of all her
equipment, and a trench was gouged out in the bay for her burial.
</P>
<P>
   On March, 9, 1922, she was laid to rest in a channel 1,500 feet
long and 25 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, a couple of buyers did appear and apparently
purchased the curiosity for $1,000. The Selma has been handed down
and traded off ever since. She is now owned by a Houston resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Selma has since been the object of failed plans to convert
it from use as a fishing pier, pleasure resort, and oyster farm,''
the marker says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A source of curiosity and local legend, it remains important
to scientists who continue to study aspects of its concrete
construction.''

   Q: I have a recipe that calls for blackberry Jell-O gelatin.
Where can I find it or a comparable product from another company?
</P>
<P>
   _ T.M.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: After being discontinued for many years, that Jell-O flavor
was brought back as Berry Black and is sold as a Halloween snack,
according to Kraft Foods.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find a flavor, the Jellophile World Wide Web site
has a suggestion: Mix fruit juice or something similar with a
powdered gelatine product such as Knox Unflavored Gelatin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each small box of Jell-O has the equivalent of one packet of
unflavored gelatine in it,'' C.M.J. Boston Baden writes on
Jellophile. ``Set aside one packet for every two cups of juice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jellophile site is at www.boston-baden.com/hazel/Jello. You

AUTHOR CAN RELATE TO BibLE'S `BAD GIRLS' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eve, the first woman in the Bible, becomes Evelyn Whitebloom of
Savannah, Ga. Delilah, the Philistine woman who cuts Samson's hair
to rob him of his strength, is Lila, a hairdresser from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the fictional versions of biblical characters
presented in Liz Curtis Higgs' new book, ``Bad Girls of the
Bible,'' (WaterBrook Press, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``I did this because I was a bad girl myself,'' Higgs said this
week. She is an author and humorist who speaks throughout the
nation. In 1995, she received the Council of Peers Award from the
National Speakers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Previous titles include ``Only Angels Can Wing It, The Rest of
Us Have to Practice'' and ``Why Life is More Fun After the Big
4-0.'' She also is a columnist for Today's Christian Woman
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I studied a lot of biblical role models for women, but I found
I could not identify with them,'' Higgs said. She didn't have much
in common, she said, with Mary the mother of Jesus; Ruth, the
faithful servant and wife; or Esther, who courageously spoke out
for her Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just too good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biblical women she felt close to was Jezebel, a
wealthy Phoenician princess and follower of the god Baal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I identified with her pushy personality. I understood her need
for control. I empathized with her angry outbursts ... and I was
aghast when I got to her gruesome ending,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a bad girl all right, but boy did she teach me what
not to do in my marriage!''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Because they were made in the image of God, as we
were, these bad girls weren't truly rotten to the core. They just
behaved that way _ and very convincingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Women of the Bible have been written about for years, said
Dorothy Patterson, editor of the Woman's Study Bible, published in
1995 by Thomas Nelson and including essays on about 100 biblical
women.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more recent books about wayward women is ``The Harlot
by the Side of the Road,'' a 1997 book by Jonathan Kirsch
(Ballantine, $14.95), which takes a more scholarly approach, said
Patterson. She directs a new women's theological studies programs
at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not an approach I would take,'' Patterson said of Higgs'
book. ``I prefer to let the Bible speak for itself instead of
reading things into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Higgs' book does provide fresh insights on biblical women,
Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Higgs tells of her own experiences as a ``bad girl'' at the
beginning of the book. She says she put herself in a position of
being sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1950s and 1960s, there were a lot of barriers to being
bad girls, but they all broke down in the 1970s,'' she said. ``I
was looking for joy and, instead, settled for fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think humor tears down walls,'' Higgs said. ``My book was
written for the heart of women. I hope many `bad girls' out there
will be helped by it.''

GALVESTON WRECK SITE IS CONCRETE REMINDER OF SHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ She sits there, partially submerged in
Galveston Bay like a Phoenix that stumbled and stuck in the mud.
Her hull is mostly above the waterline, her bow pointing upward,
toward the bay bridge that helps tourists and commuters move
between Galveston Island and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Local shrimp boats pass to either side of her without bother, as
though she were just a shadow cast on the water by billowy clouds.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for a small historical marker a half-mile away on
the edge of Pelican Island, curious ferryboat riders and saltwater
fishermen could only guess at the identity of the aged gray,
ghostlike ruin. The constant wash of the bay has dulled her once
sharp definition.
</P>
<P>
   She is the SS Selma, a World War I-era steamship that was
commissioned too late to join in the war effort and was constructed
of unusual materials because of a wartime steel shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The Selma was made of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steel shortages during World War I led to the U.S. to build
experimental concrete ships, the largest of which was the SS Selma,
today partially submerged in Galveston Bay and visible from this
site,'' reads the historical marker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was built in Mobile, Alabama, and named to honor Selma,
Alabama, for its successful wartime liberty loan drive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Selma was launched on June 28, 1919, which just happened to
be the same day the Germans signed the Treaty of Versailles,
officially ending World War I.
</P>
<P>
   There were about a dozen concrete ships built at the time, but
the Selma was the largest at 7,500 tons. Her cost was about $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Given the cost, and the great curiosity surrounding cement
ships, the Selma was immediately pressed into service carrying
crude oil from Tampico, Mexico, to ports along the Texas coast.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain just how many trips she made. Some reports say
she steamed the Gulf for three years; one says she made several
successful trips; and yet another says she ran aground on a jetty
in Tampico and split her hull near the bow on her first voyage.
</P>
<P>
   The historical marker says, ``In Tampico, Mexico, on May 31,
1920, the SS Selma hit a jetty, ripping a hole in its hull about 60
feet long.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, she was towed back to Galveston for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't be made. The U.S. Shipping Board gave up on
repairing the unique ship and decided to sell the Selma but
couldn't find any buyers. Eventually, she was stripped of all her
equipment, and a trench was gouged out in the bay for her burial.
</P>
<P>
   On March, 9, 1922, she was laid to rest in a channel 1,500 feet
long and 25 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, a couple of buyers did appear and apparently
purchased the curiosity for $1,000. The Selma has been handed down
and traded off ever since. She is now owned by a Houston resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Selma has since been the object of failed plans to convert
it from use as a fishing pier, pleasure resort, and oyster farm,''
the marker says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A source of curiosity and local legend, it remains important
to scientists who continue to study aspects of its concrete
construction.''

THINGS ARE BEGINNING TO GEL

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a recipe that calls for blackberry Jell-O gelatin.
Where can I find it or a comparable product from another company?
</P>
<P>
   _ T.M.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: After being discontinued for many years, that Jell-O flavor
was brought back as Berry Black and is sold as a Halloween snack,
according to Kraft Foods.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find a flavor, the Jellophile World Wide Web site
has a suggestion: Mix fruit juice or something similar with a
powdered gelatine product such as Knox Unflavored Gelatin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each small box of Jell-O has the equivalent of one packet of
unflavored gelatine in it,'' C.M.J. Boston Baden writes on
Jellophile. ``Set aside one packet for every two cups of juice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jellophile site is at www.boston-baden.com/hazel/Jello. You
can contact Kraft Foods by calling (800) 431-1001 or visiting the
Web site www.kraftfoods.com.

<P>
   Q: I'm looking for a movie I saw when I was a teen-ager. I
thought the name was ``Girl on the Red Velvet Swing'' but I have
been unable to locate a movie by that name. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.L., Brownwood, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The 1955 movie ``Girl in the Red Velvet Swing'' starred Joan
Collins, Ray Milland and Farley Granger.
</P>
<P>
   In a story based on a famous 1906 murder, Collins played Evelyn
Nesbit Thaw, a model and showgirl whose nickname was used as the
film's title. Thaw's millionaire husband (Granger) shot and killed
her lover, the architect Stanford White (Milland), leading to the
20th century's first ``trial of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   The film does not appear to have been released on video.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to golfer Sergio Garcia?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.C., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Garcia or other pros on the Professional Golfers
Association tour in care of the PGA, 112 TPC Blvd., Ponte Vedra
Beach, FL 32082.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 19, turned pro this year, finishing second to Tiger
Woods at the PGA Championship in August.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia is a native of Castellon, Spain. He won 17 of the 21
amateur events he entered in 1997 and 1998 and won the Irish Open
and German Masters tournaments this year.

   GOLDMAN-NETWORKING Janet Tiebout Hanson had been one of just a
few women professionals at Goldman, Sachs, where her male
colleagues had honed networking over the decades into a science.
But women like her who left, staying at home with their children
for a few years, later found their Rolodexes out of date and their
skills rusty. Why not, Ms. Hanson mused, jump-start the networking
process for them? So Ms. Hanson created an organization two years
ago called 85 Broads, a playful reference to the firm's location on
85 Broad Street. ``The reason I can do this is that I made it out
of Goldman into a successful entrepreneurial experience,'' Ms.
Hanson said. By Reed Abelson.

LAWYER MAKES THE RIGHT CALL ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Maybe phone calls would do it, Charles Juntikka
thought.
</P>
<P>
   So, working with student interns in his Manhattan law office _
and prepared to spend around $4,500 of his own money to make the
point _ Juntikka rented some toll-free phone numbers. Then he sent
20,000 post cards to targeted voters. On the post cards, he
suggested that these voters use his toll-free phone numbers to call
New York Gov. George Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and
State Senate Majority Leader Joe Bruno to urge support of some
bills that would limit lobbyists's gifts to lawmakers and tighten
campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Then Juntikka waited to see what would happen.
</P>
<P>
   What happened, apparently, was that the phones went absolutely
wild in the offices of Pataki, Silver and Bruno. What happened
after that was a stern phone call from Bell Atlantic to Juntikka
informing him that he was misusing the toll-free numbers he had
rented and ordering him to cut it out.
</P>
<P>
   No, Juntikka said, I won't cut it out. I'm not misusing these
toll-free numbers, and you have no authority to do anything about
this. Juntikka also pointed out to the lady from Bell Atlantic, a
regulated utility seeking state permission to get into the
long-distance business, that he'd gone to law school.
</P>
<P>
   So, presumably, phones are still ringing in the office of the
governor (888-894-4573), the speaker of the Assembly (888-894-3737)
and the state Senate majority leader (888-627-5137).
</P>
<P>
   Juntikka is urging callers to express support for legislation
that would overhaul the lobby and campaign finance laws, bills
expected to be on the table in December's special legislative
session (specifically, bills S. 3794, A.6940 and Program Bill 92).
</P>
<P>
   All of which is wonderful, but fixing this won't be that simple.
You could see that last week when Bruno had to write a $1,000 check
to a developer whose corporation had given the lawmaker a $6,000
campaign contribution. Under current New York law, corporations can
give individual candidates no more than $5,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Much was made of this illegal donation because the developer,
U.W. Marx, is involved in the development of a warehouse operation
in Rensselaer County, in Bruno's Senate district, that's to receive
a $1 million state grant, courtesy of Bruno. Not only was this
contribution larger than the law allows, but _ like most political
contributions _ it seemed also to have a distressing relationship
to the distribution of your money and mine.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is, though, that the illegal contribution was only
dopey and not overtly evil. Any corporation eager to get around
campaign financing laws can find two dozen ways to do it legally.
Marx, for example, could have hired a lawyer, given the lawyer a
big chunk of cash as a legal fee and then had the lawyer contribute
it in his or her name. That's the way the mob does it. Marx could
have given big bonuses to key employees, had them pay the income
tax on the money and then had them donate what was left as
individuals, for whom the legal giving limit is $30,500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Juntikka is on the right track, though. The link between
campaign contributions and the expenditure of tax dollars is
generally direct and disturbing. We need better laws. Sure,
campaign contributions are speech under the First Amendment, but
free speech is not an unfettered right. It damages the democratic
process when Donald Trump can shout so much louder than the rest of
us.
</P>
<P>
   So we need to tighten up on this stuff, but we need also to
recognize that every campaign finance law has its loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   And if anybody knows where they are, it's the people who write
those laws in the first place.
</P>
<P>

ASCENT INTO THE PAST: THE GHOSTS OF EVEREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The discovery of the bleached body of British mountaineer George
Leigh Mallory, frozen high on Mount Everest for 75 years in a
position of self-arrest, may not have solved a mystery, but it has
generated renewed controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition, including
a veteran Mount Rainier guide, have published an engrossing
account, ``Ghosts of Everest,'' of their quest last spring for the
bodies of Mallory and his climbing partner, Andrew Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Ghosts of Everest'' grossly exploits the reader's morbid
curiousity with close-up pictures of Mallory's body, his broken leg
and upper torso. The dead Mallory previously graced the cover of
Outside magazine and the pages of Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, 1924, Mallory and Irvine set out from
27,000-foot-high Camp VI on Everest's north face. They were last
seen a thousand vertical feet below the 29,028-foot summit.
Climbers have long wondered whether they reached the top and fell
while descending in the dark. The mountain eventually was climbed
in 1953 from the south.
</P>
<P>
   The quick-and-dirty magazine accounts of the discovery of
Mallory's body are more repulsive than fascinating. In a picture
sold for thousands of dollars, the extended hand gripping the
mountainside can be seen to symbolize the grasping, overreaching
commercial excesses of today's mountaineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghosts of Everest'' settles the stomach a bit. The
climber-researchers appear to have a deep appreciation for the man
whose remains they sought. (Irvine's body was not found.) They
respected the body even while searching for evidence to determine
whether Mallory and Irvine made the summit before falling to their
deaths. An Anglican committal service was read for Mallory, the son
of a vicar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very comfortable being with `George,'''
climber-researcher Jake Norton reflected in the book. ``We wanted
to spend more time with him; he was so impressive to be with, even
in death.''
</P>
<P>
   Equal respect came from climber Dave Hahn, who said: ``We knew
we were going to have to disturb him to do our job, and we only
wanted to disturb him once. Then we wanted to leave him in peace.
We knew if we did not do a thorough search for the camera and other
artifacts, people would keep coming back and disturbing him
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they disturbed him twice, but they did not find
Mallory's camera amid his personal effects. Kodak had assured the
expedition that any exposed film could be developed. Using a metal
detector, they uncovered Mallory's watch. A pocket in his
disintegrating coat yielded letters to friends and notes to
himself. Missing was a picture of Mallory's wife, which he had said
he intended to leave at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Later, during a successful Everest summit ascent, researchers
were to find the most tantalizing clue of all _ a 1924-vintage
oxygen tank. Mallory's notes were later deciphered as a calculation
of how much oxygen was available to use in his bid for the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the notes and the recovered bottle, expedition leaders
concluded that Mallory and Irvine may have left Camp VI with three
oxygen canisters apiece. It had been widely believed they had only
two, which would have been insufficient to negotiate three tricky
``steps'' _ small walls _ along the northeast ridge, and then
ascend the summit pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   The research expedition's chief expert, a German graduate
student named Jochen Hemmleb, meticulously studied landmarks on the
north face for more clues to what may have happened to Mallory and
Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmleb tried to match his views with reports from those who
accompanied the lost climbers. At 12:50 p.m. on June 6, 1924,
supporting climber Noel Odell looked up and saw ``the whole summit
ridge and final pyramid unveiled.'' He saw Mallory and Irving
moving with ``alacrity'' toward the summit. The mist then closed in
again.
</P>
<P>
   Where exactly were the climbers? Odell's account seemed to
suggest they were surmounting the Second Step, a prowlike rock
formation that is the ridge's greatest obstacle. Under criticism,
he later retreated and suggested it was the lower First Step.
</P>
<P>
   After retracing the route according to Odell's view, and
watching climber Conrad Anker's freestyle ascent of the Second
Step, Hemmler came away convinced that Mallory and Irvine had
overcome the most difficult stretch of the climb.
</P>
<P>
   When Mallory and Irvine were last seen, it was late in the day
for an attempt on the summit and a return to safety. Mallory,
however, was making his fourth bid for Everest and, at age 38, it
was almost certain to be his last. Mallory's longtime friend,
Geoffrey Winthrop Young, was positive he would have pressed on
``because Mallory was Mallory.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should we care? Because, in this age of exploring space and
cyberspace, humankind must not forget that until recently there
were unreachable heights and unexplored spaces here on Earth. All
14 of the planet's 8,000-meter (26,200-foot and higher) peaks have
been climbed for the first time only in the last half of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``All other mountain ranges belong to the earth, but the
Himalayas are of the heavens,'' John Kenneth Galbraith, the
economist and onetime U.S. Ambassador to India, once observed.
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith is right, of course. ``Ghosts of Everest'' quotes
Mallory's awe at his first sight of the mountain that would consume
his life _ ``a summit far higher in the sky than imagination had
dared to suggest.'' The Tibetan name for the mountain is
Chomolungma, meaning goddess mother of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Even at great distance, Everest can be distinguished by the
enormous snow plume blowing from its summit. The peak, nearly 6
miles high, literally sticks into the jet stream. Its winds have
killed scores of mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
   Today's climbers attack the mountain with an array of
high-altitude down suits, hydration systems, technical ice-climbing
boots and communications gear. Guide outfits offer clients the
summit of the world for a fee of $60,000. ``Ghosts of Everest'' is
replete with grumbling about the airwaves around Everest being full
of cell phone calls, voice mail messages and answering-machine
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The British of the 1920s had none of this high-tech gear and
protective clothing. They set out for the top of the world in tweed
trousers, Norfolk jackets and fedoras. ``Hell, I walk out on the
street in Seattle with more clothing than he had on at 28,000 feet
on Everest,'' Hahn explained afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Ghosts of Everest'' points out, however, the expeditions of
three quarters of a century ago pioneered routes and established
camps still used by those climbing the Tibetan side of the
mountain. And they equaled or beat the pace of today's climbers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 1924 British climbers, Howard Somervell, had a vision
after establishing Camp VI, ``a curious sensation ... as if we were
getting near the edge of a field with a wall all round it _ a high,
insuperable wall. The field was human capacity, the wall human
limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology has vastly expanded what humans can do. But it seems
to have contracted mountaineering books, which nowadays spend too
much time on self-glorification and the settling of scores.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a famous Eastern Washington climber threatened legal
action unless several offending passages were removed from the
memoirs of a renowned Seattle mountaineer. The deletions, duly
made, had to do with expeditions to K2, the world's second-highest
mountain, more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghosts of Everest'' is waspish at times. It delivers a hard
poke at the British Broadcasting Corp. for being cheap in its
offers to sponsor the expedition, and then precariously late with a
vital payment.
</P>
<P>
   The climbers bestow a bit of purple prose on themselves. There
is a celebration of team leader Eric Simonson's ``restless'' hands,
which seem independent of his body. (Simonson is a founding partner
of Mount Rainier Alpine Guides.)
</P>
<P>
   And what readers really don't need to know is Hemmleb's
``passion'' for Everest costs him another form of intimacy.
``Hemmleb has learned, as other climbers have learned before him,
that establishing and maintaining meaningful intimate relationships
is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in death, however, Mallory exercises a kind of literary
control. He was a climber of extraordinary grace and a literate,
well-educated and reflective man. His climbing companion ``Sandy''
Irvine was, at 22, gifted in another way, with the ability to
repair equipment and work the primitive oxygen apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   In true British fashion, Mallory was driven with what he
described as ``the indomitable desire to see what lies beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   He created a mystery not solved even by the discovery of his
corpse. The pictures of his corpse may be appalling, but the text
of ``Ghosts of Everest'' does justice to the man.

<P>
   PARAGUANA, Venezuela _ The skyline along this hot and arid
peninsula, which lies between the northern coast of Venezuela and
the island of Aruba, is dominated not by buildings but by an
endless maze of metal.
</P>
<P>
   More than 940,000 barrels of petroleum flow through miles of
pipes, tanks, and ovens and onto supertankers each day, most of it
destined for the East Coast of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of this carefully orchestrated movement of oil
through twisted steel, large banks of computers monitor every step,
making the world's largest oil refinery a crucial laboratory for
one of the world's most important technological experiments.
</P>
<P>
   From Venezuela to Beijing, governments and corporations around
the world are scurrying to solve the Y2K problem, all with varying
degrees of optimism. As is widely known, on Jan. 1 older computers
may interpret the year '00 as 1900 instead of 2000. If the Y2K bug
is not fixed, specialists warn, there could be computer crashes and
disruptions in service from utilities, businesses, and governments.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of a computer meltdown would be devastating for
countries like Venezuela and Mexico, Latin America's biggest oil
producers, whose economies depend heavily on how much petroleum
they sell to the United States. For Americans who get most of their
oil from Latin America _ and who are being assured that most
critical systems in the United States are now Y2K-compliant _ an
oil supply disruption could mean everything from higher prices at
the gas pumps next year to long-term fuel shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) and
Petroleos de Mexico (PEMEX) sound confident when they talk about
their Y2K conversion strategies. Both companies, which are
state-controlled monopolies, say they have updated more than 95
percent of their computers.
</P>
<P>
   But even the most optimistic programmers admit they won't know
whether their preparations will work until that Saturday in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything from our payroll to the pipelines and our health
clinics is run mostly by technology,'' said Luis Paredes, Y2K
project director for PDVSA in Paraguana. ``We've taken care of just
about everything, but there are so many possibilities of what could
happen at midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the concerns that something could happen on New
Year's Day, both corporations have developed dozens of contingency
plans to cover virtually every aspect of their operations. PEMEX
alone, which delivers about 1.3 million barrels of oil a day to the
United States, has prepared 281 different emergency responses in
case anything goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   At the PDVSA refinery in Paraguana, which was created in 1997
when two separate refineries were connected by a 15-mile pipeline
that runs alongside the main highway, technicians have been working
since mid-1998 to update their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crude oil here comes from wells around Lake
Maracaibo and the Gulf of Venezuela to the southwest. When it
arrives, it is cleaned, cooked, distilled, and mixed with additives
that produce everything from unleaded gasoline to kerosene and
propane gas.
</P>
<P>
   The mixtures are then stored in massive tanks that must preserve
the proper chemical combination of each product. From there, the
final products are sent via a spaghetti bowl of narrow,
silver-colored pipes to the docks for delivery onto waiting
tankers.
</P>
<P>
   To cut labor costs and modernize its systems, the Venezuelan
operation, like many US oil companies, began investing billions of
dollars more 20 years ago to automate nearly every step of the
production process from the well to the tanker.
</P>
<P>
   But relying so much on technology has also made it more
vulnerable to any glitch that might occur. So far, PDVSA has spent
more than $200 million to adapt its entire computer system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an understanding that this is not just a technical
issue, but a serious business matter,'' said Ivan Crespo, Y2K
director at the company's headquarters in Caracas. ``If something
goes wrong, it could affect our ability to deliver to our clients
or the way we pay our suppliers.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, PEMEX, which gets most of its heavy crude oil from
offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, has not invested as much
in technology _ it even exports most of its heaviest petroleum to
the United States for refining _ meaning that while its production
processes may not be as advanced as PDVSA's, it faces less of a Y2K
risk. Experts say the company's financial departments are the most
dependent on computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still has many systems and computers that must be Y2K
compliant,'' said Alredo Jalife-Rahme, an international relations
professor at the University of the Americas in Mexico City who has
studied PEMEX's operations. ``They say they've solved nearly all
their problems, but it is a very closed institution and we haven't
had any outside observer who can verify what they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   To help remedy their Y2K problems and to reassure their American
clients, both the Venezuelan and Mexican firms have collaborated
with national and international Y2K commissions, such as the
American Petroleum Institute's Year 2000 task force.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Quiggins, the task force chairman, said the US petroleum
industry is about 90 percent compliant, based on its last quarterly
survey. What's more, he added, any disturbances that might happen
abroad from the Y2K bug probably won't be immediately felt because
the United States has about three months' worth of oil reserves
saved up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are basically a risk-based industry, so this is nothing
more than managing another risk,'' said Quiggins. ``But unlike the
electricity and telephone industry, we can store fuel even if our
supply chain is cut off.''
</P>
<P>
   George Baker, a petroleum industry analyst in Houston, agrees up
to a point. Although any temporary glitches in Venezuela and Mexico
could be made up by domestic producers without any dramatic surge
in retail gas prices, that could change if companies try to profit
off the fears of scarcity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry has some irrational components, and scarcity has
a market value,'' Baker said. ``Even if the underlying reality is
that there is enough fuel, gasoline marketers know how to work a
scarcity scenario at the pump.''
</P>
<P>
   For many US petroleum industry officials, the biggest concerns
about foreign providers like PDVSA and PEMEX are not so much about
the companies' Y2K strategies but about whether their respective
governments, suppliers, and banks will be ready.
</P>
<P>
   A US Senate report released in August concluded that Venezuela
was 12 to 18 months behind schedule in adapting its most critical
government and business systems, mostly because of the political
and economic turmoil that has gripped that country. It also
predicted that 33 percent of all Mexico's computer systems would
fail because of Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials dismiss such reports as ``misinformation.''
And they argue that more than 5 million computers in three major
sectors _ government, financial, and nonfinancial _ have been
successfully converted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We benefit from the fact that many of our most important
systems are concentrated in a small number of organizations, like
PEMEX,'' said Antonio Puig Escudero, president of Mexico's
Institute on Statistics, Geography and Information, the federal
agency that oversees the country's Y2K commission.
</P>
<P>
   Even if all this Y2K anxiety ultimately turns out to be more
hype than crash, Puig notes that there has been a benefit to all
that worrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a huge challenge for us, but here has been an
unexpected positive impact,'' Puig said. ``This has increased our
cultural awareness of computers, and it's forced many of our
government and businesses to update their old equipment, which they
probably wouldn't have done without this.''

CANDIDATES WITH CASH NARROW THE FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For a growing number of congressional candidates,
campaign finance is becoming simply a matter of personal finance.
</P>
<P>
   With the 2000 elections more than a year away, the candidate
fields are being narrowed early, often because the contenders are
dumping their own money into their campaigns and scaring off
challengers, campaign analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, political parties are turning to candidates who
can self-finance or who have great personal wealth to fall back on
if the campaign account runs low.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 20 candidates for the House and Senate have lent or
contributed $100,000 or more of their own money to their campaigns,
according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.
Republican presidential contender Steve Forbes is financing his own
campaign, and two possible Reform Party candidates, Ross Perot and
real estate mogul Donald Trump, can afford to bankroll a national
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of money has forced four candidates out of the GOP
presidential race, even though the first primary is months away.
</P>
<P>
   Big money doesn't always guarantee a winner. In fact, said
Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution, ``most self-financed
candidates who spend big bucks lose.'' But it gives immediate
credibility to a candidate who might not otherwise have a chance,
campaign analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``By accident, we're going to have a plutocracy _ government by
people who can afford to pay for a campaign,'' said Steven Schier,
chairman of the political science department at Minnesota's
Carleton College.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Representative David Minge of Minnesota, a Democrat.
Minge pulled out of the Senate race largely because of his
inability to raise cash. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee made it clear, he said, that it couldn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word I got, third- or fourth-hand, is that some decision
had been made by the DSCC. They had limited resources, and if they
could find a candidate who could self-finance, that would be an
advantage,'' Minge said. ``It's pretty disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading Democratic candidates now is attorney Michael
Ciresi, whose law firm shared a $6.1 billion settlement against
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Without that money, Schier said, Ciresi never would have been
considered a viable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's achieved instant credibility without ever having spent a
day in political life, and the reason is that he's got deep
pockets,'' Schier said.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, wealthy candidates often can make a populist
appeal, Schier and others noted, since they can say they are not in
the pockets of special interests who contribute money to campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, critics say, is that the high cost of campaigns
could shut out worthy contenders across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will become a nation of two parties: old money and new
money,'' said Brad Johnson, a onetime adviser to Mario M. Cuomo
when he was governor of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Jon Corzine, a former chief executive officer of
Goldman Sachs, has an estimated $300 million in personal wealth to
bring to his race for the Senate next year. James Florio, the
former New Jersey congressman and governor who is also seeking the
Democratic nomination in the Senate race, has put $100,000 of his
own money into his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, Democratic senatorial candidate Bob Rovner has
dumped more than $1 million of his own money into his campaign. The
Democrats recently tapped multimillionaire attorney Ed Bernstein to
run from Nevada for the Senate. In Washington, former US
Representative Maria Cantwell is drawing attention from Democrats _
as senior vice president at RealNetworks, a Seattle-based company
dealing in streaming media technology on the Internet. She is now
believed to be worth many millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   House candidates are also dumping their own funds into their
races. West Virginia Democrat James F. Humphreys has sunk $600,000
into his own campaign, while Texas Republican John Mark Brewer has
put in nearly $560,000 into his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Democratic committee does not discourage candidates
who aren't rich, said political director Jim Jordan. But ``the
ability to self-finance is an asset,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't actively try to move people out of races,'' Jordan
said. ``Certainly, if we don't believe someone doesn't have the
ability or the stomach for serious fund-raising, that's something
we discuss with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of self-financing candidates for the 2000 elections
is currently lower than the final tally from previous election
cycles. But wealthier candidates are pouring big money into their
own campaigns much earlier this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell our clients to put their own money in, and put it in
as soon as possible, to scare other candidates,'' said Democratic
consultant David Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a heartbeat and a checkbook is most important for the
Democrats,'' said Pete Sekulow, spokesman for the Republican
Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senate candidates so far haven't been self-financing
because ``we're in the majority. We're playing defense,'' Sekulow
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think self-financing always wins the day,'' said
Minge. ``But all things being equal, it's a clear advantage.''

RIDING THE RANGE OF NEW CDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not the ``Super Tuesday'' of last fall when albums by
superstars Garth Brooks, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey hit the
stores on the same day. But Tuesday is an especially busy day for
rock fans, because new CDs arrive from hippie forefathers Crosby,
Stills, Nash &AMP; Young, British upstarts Bush, the reunited Stone
Temple Pilots, and the recycled Alice in Chains.
</P>
<P>
   Rock is back, but the results are not what you might think.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought the megahyped Bush would bomb, then you're wrong.
And if you thought CSN &AMP; Y would return with a
voice-of-the-generation excellence, then you're also wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, the worst album of the lot is CSN &AMP; Y's often dry and
preachy ``Looking Forward,'' the foursome's first record since
1988's equally inconsistent ``American Dream.'' CSN &AMP; Y are selling
reams of tickets these days
</P>
<P>
   _ they just sold out their March 26 FleetCenter date at up to
$200 per ticket _ but the sales are obviously not predicated on
this embarrassingly spotty disc. Concertgoers are looking to hear
older, more meaningful CSN &AMP; Y tunes such as ``Ohio'' (about the
National Guard killing of four Kent State youths at a campus
protest) and ``Carry On.''
</P>
<P>
   The new disc has nothing in that league. Stephen Stills makes a
game effort with his new rocker, ``No Tears Left,'' about telling
youths that their elders are ``terrified that you might go out and
find out for yourself . . . what they can't teach you.'' And David
Crosby speaks from the heart with the folk-rocking ``Dream for
Him,'' about the fear of lying to a child about the world's
realities: ``How do you explain the world we face to all of the
innocents we brought to this place?'' It's Crosby at his tender
best.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the new CSN &AMP; Y songs fall flat. The album opens
with the cheesy calypso of ``Faith in Me,'' which sounds like a bad
rewrite of the Beach Boys' ``Kokomo.'' Neil Young follows with the
title track, ``Looking Forward,'' an inert acoustic tune that only
makes you look back to his better work. Another Young number,
``Slowpoke,'' is a shameless rewrite of his classic ``Heart of
Gold.'' He adds some tasty guitar elsewhere and adds body to the
group's still-soaring harmonies, but individually, this disc is
filled with cracks. And it rarely rocks, preferring to settle for a
soft, gushy focus.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the new Bush album, ``The Science of
Things,'' is a refreshing surprise. Singer Gavin Rossdale rented a
house on the coast of Ireland to write the songs and they are more
cohesive than anything he's done before. Although he's still the
master of the occasionally inscrutable lyric (``Altered States''
talks about ``living in a cage, washing the bird bath, singing in a
fish bowl''), he reaches more deeply with the new single ``The
Chemicals Between Us'' (an ode to past lovers, with a U2-like
guitar sound) and the AIDS-inspired ``Letting the Cables Sleep,''
about urging an HIV-positive friend to share his feelings and not
retreat into silence.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bush album is sonically uplifting, with easily the
group's most creative arrangements. It rocks with taut precision on
``Warm Machine'' and the future single ``Jesus Online,'' which,
according to Rossdale in a recent interview, is about ``trying to
accept yourself and find something spiritual in this technological
age.'' He and the group also turn experimental with the Pink
Floyd-like ``40 Miles From the Sun'' and the spiraling guitar
figures of ``Spacetravel,'' with friend Gwen Stefani (of the band
No Doubt) on backing vocals. The album is filled with potential
radio hits.
</P>
<P>
   Another strong effort is Stone Temple Pilots' ``No. 4,'' the
group's fourth album. It harks back to the headbanging sound of
their first two discs, ``Plush'' and ``Core,'' which released a
pent-up energy caused when singer Scott Weiland's heroin addiction
went out of control two years ago; he left the group to make a solo
record. Weiland was jailed earlier this year (he's due for possible
release in March) after violating parole by failing to show up for
a drug test, but not before finishing this rock-as-catharsis
reunion CD.
</P>
<P>
   From the jagged-edged ``No Way Out'' (``I'm suffocating . . .
but I'm holding on,'' Weiland sings), to the country-ish ``I Got
You'' (``I got you to paint the roses on my grave'') and the
incense-and-candles psychedelia of the Doors-like ``Atlanta,''
Weiland and STP are in peak, battle-scarred form.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Alice In Chains on their new ``Music Bank,'' a
three-CD boxed set named for their rehearsal space in Seattle. The
box has the essential Alice grunge/metal tracks _ notably ``Man in
a Box'' and ``Rooster,'' about the scarifying Vietnam War
experience of guitarist Jerry Cantrell's dad. The box is a must for
Alice fans who have been stuck during the band's extended hiatus;
the group hasn't played live in three years, but hasn't officially
broken up.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Layne Staley, who has battled his own heroin problems,
confirms his stature as one of rock's most bruising, most
despairing vocalists. His far-out ``Sickman'' and ``Junkhead''
(from a previously unreleased 1992 demo) probe a shattered psyche.
</P>
<P>
   The feedback-laced metal of Alice In Chains holds up well _
really, was there a better metal band in the '90s except for maybe
Metallica? _ though some of the demos get tiresome. But those are
the early, decade-old songs when the band was still aping such
influences as Guns N' Roses and Aerosmith.
</P>
<P>
   The Alice box, enhanced by liner notes from Cantrell, does a
good job of showing how the band grew into its grinding, yet
mind-expanding, sound. And the honesty of the music is striking. By
the time the third CD rolls around with ``Down in the Hole'' and
``Heaven Sent You,'' the listener is wishing that Alice would
regroup for the next chapter.

BIRTH CONTROL PILL IS SLOW TO CATCH ON IN JAPAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Available to Japanese women 35 years after its approval
in the United States, the birth control pill shows little sign of
unleashing the kind of sexual revolution it spawned in the West.
And health officials here point to decades of fear, bad publicity,
and cultural barriers to explain lackluster demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese women are scared of artificial intervention when it
comes to reproduction. Whatever comes naturally we think we should
not resist,'' said Yuko Kawanishi, a sociologist who has performed
studies comparing Japanese and American women's responses to
reproductive change.
</P>
<P>
   Many say the Japanese government prevented distribution of the
Pill for so long because of its fear that Japan's anemic birth rate
would plunge further, reducing the labor force and leaving society
vulnerable for the care and hospitalization of its aging citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Erika, a 38-year-old who was prescribed the oral contraceptive,
says many of her friends would take medicine for a cold or
headache, but would be reluctant to use a painkiller for a
menstrual cramp for fear that it could affect their ability to bear
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a friend sees me taking just an aspirin or something for
menstrual cramps, she'd yell at me and say, `That's bad for you,
didn't your mother ever tell you?' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The most common forms of birth control in Japan are condoms and
the rhythm method. Condoms are not used regularly enough and rhythm
is rarely effective. The result: two-thirds of pregnancies are
unplanned, the highest rate in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion is also used as a form of birth control, health workers
say. Nearly a quarter of all pregnancies are aborted. Unlike in the
United States, there is almost no controversy surrounding abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a loophole in Japanese law, at least 200,000 women
have been taking a high-estrogen version of oral contraceptives,
misusing a drug prescribed for menstrual cramps. The newly approved
Pill, similar to that used in the United States, has a much lower
dosage of estrogen and is considered safer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many say the medical community, which has made a
lucrative business out of performing abortions, may have helped to
block the Pill's approval and to have propagated its negative
image.
</P>
<P>
   The government had also said it was concerned about the Pill's
side effects and, particularly, the spread of AIDS. But after Japan
legalized Viagra, the men's anti-impotency drug, in January in a
six-month process, women's advocates accused the government of
applying a double standard to male and female sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The uproar spurred the Pill's approval in June. It went on sale
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But few women are racing to their gynecologists for a
prescription.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about the side effects, although I guess I don't
really know what they are,'' said Yuki Yamada, 19, a university
student.
</P>
<P>
   Most Japanese women are not well-versed in the Pill. Nearly 80
percent of women who responded to a recent survey conducted by
Janssen-Kyowa Co. said they did not know much about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese women are scared of the Pill the way people are
scared of ghosts,'' said Midori Ashida, a leading women's health
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Given that it took Japan decades to legalize the Pill, she
expects it could take just as long before Japanese women become
more accepting of it.
</P>
<P>
   She and other advocates maintain that one reason why it took so
long for Japan to approve the Pill was the fear in this
male-dominated society that women would have more sexual freedom
and independence. Today, a minority of women work outside the home,
and fewer embark on careers. Ashida claims that if Japanese women
could plan their pregnancies better, their roles in society might
change.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kunio Kitamura, director of the Japan Family Planning
Association and a proponent of the Pill, says an anonymous
right-wing group mailed him a copy of a newspaper article he had
written, with a red X drawn through his face. ``They wrote that if
Japanese women use the Pill, they'll be able to control their
bodies by themselves and that would be a very terrible thing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pill would be liberating for Japanese women, Kitamura said.
He cited a recent survey of French women; when asked to name the
thing that changed their lives most in the last 20 years, more than
half of the respondents named the Pill.
</P>
<P>
   Pill user Erika says oral contraception makes her a more
independent woman. She says she could not run her translating
business if she could not effectively plan when and whether to
become a mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to have children, and there's nothing easier and
better than the Pill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has learned how the Pill might affect her body and she says
she is not scared. She ticks off the possible negative side effects
_ weight gain, increased risk of breast cancer, and liver problems
_ but then dismisses those risks as slight and says that they are
outweighed by the Pill's health benefits, such as a lower risk of
ovarian and other types of cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese women remain wary and fearful though, and some are
displeased that the Pill has been approved. They worry that women
who use it, even those who are married, will be putting themselves
at risk for disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that many Japanese husbands are having sex with
other women. If women don't protect themselves with condoms, they
can get infected with viruses like AIDS,'' said Junko Yasuda, a
34-year-old married woman with no children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why the government approved this. Using the Pill
is just for pleasure,'' Yasuda said.

HONORING A VROOMING ICON THAT SPED INTO HISTORY

   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ The faithful arrive daily from afar,
recording the origins of their pilgrimages in the neatly kept
guestbook. In recent days, they have traveled from Florida, Texas,
and Indiana. From Missouri, Pennsylvania, and New York. From
Australia, England, Denmark, and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Their destination is a one-story brick building that, despite
almost rubbing up against Interstate 291, takes some finding. The
Indian Motocycle Museum is a low-profile shrine that honors
America's first commercially produced motorcycle, a vrooming icon
that was built here near the banks of the Connecticut River between
1901 and 1953.
</P>
<P>
   The walls and floors of this 86-year-old building, which
originally housed the Indian Motocycle Co.'s engineering
department, are jam-packed with Indian-related and other motorcycle
artifacts, from bikes to tools to catalogs. ``This place is a time
warp,'' mused one first-time visitor, a tanned and burly biker from
California.
</P>
<P>
   He got that right. But the museum pays homage to both a product
and a place. Indian once employed some 5,000 souls in Springfield,
turning out as many as 60,000 motorcycles per year in a big factory
called The Wigwam. Its success _ it was once the country's
best-seller and outlasted all of its domestic competitors except
its fierce rival, Harley-Davidson _ was a source of Pioneer Valley
pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our hometown bike,'' explains Jim Seidell, who lives in
nearby Westhampton. Notice the present tense. Seidell, a
44-year-old heating contractor, has owned several Indians in the
past two decades, two of which he currently drives a combined
distance of 8,000 miles a year.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else who rides a made-in-Springfield Indian,
Seidell extols its physical virtues. ``I don't ever think I've seen
a prettier bike,'' he says. ``It's simple, but it has everything
that's necessary on a motorcyle. And, of course, it runs forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments _ not to mention curiosity _ are what bring many
visitors to the Indian Motocycle Museum. (That's no typographical
error, incidentally. Indian took the ``r'' out of ``motorcycle.'')
They are almost always greeted by 84-year-old curator Esta Manthos,
who, with her late husband, Charles, founded the museum facility
more than a quarter of a century ago by opening the doors to their
personal Indian collection.
</P>
<P>
   Esta Manthos is a slim, white-haired, and feisty woman whom some
might call cranky. She herself says she can be ``Miss Nasty.'' She
has a long list of severe dislikes, which includes Japanese
motorcycles, the California company that recently acquired rights
to the Indian name and has begun producing motorcycles, and
allowing photographs to be taken of either herself or the
motorcycles she oversees.
</P>
<P>
   But Manthos loves Indians. She is a former insurance underwriter
who says she knew the company's founders, George Hendee and Oscar
Hedstrom. She also says she still rides a 1941 Indian motorcycle,
and is restoring a bicycle made by the company in 1901, when it was
known as the Hendee Manufacturing Co.
</P>
<P>
   She is an outspoken authority on every item in the funky museum
and often follows visitors on their tours while providing a kind of
soundtrack. ``See those two plaques over there?'' she might say,
pointing to two Indian heads on one wall. ``They came from the main
office. We have a photograph to prove it. We don't lie.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 40 old motorcycles lined up on the museum's
linoleum floor, and Manthos says she has a volunteer staff of four
former Indian employees to keep them running. (``We used to have
six. Two died.'') Not all are Indian bikes. You'll also see the
Harley, Yale, Henderson, Cleveland, Simplex, Excelsior, Pope, and
Hercules names. But Indian is clearly king here, from the blue 1904
one-cylinder model to the 1951 orange Indian Chief with sidecar.
``Anyone who says they have a 1901 Indian is lying,'' Manthos
announces firmly ``There are none in existence.''
</P>
<P>
   The building also houses such historic bric-a-brac as posters,
helmets, boots, photographs, racing trophies, pins, postcards,
brochures, stock certificates, patches, advertising, and even some
of the other products _ an outboard motor here, and airplane engine
there _ made by Indian. There are also the shop tools of Oscar
Hedstrom _ ``The ones he used to invent the Indian,'' Manthos says
proudly. And there is the curator's stash of some 5,000 toy
motorcycles, a collection she says she began in 1929. ``I have all
the sales slips, with what I paid for them,'' she declares.
</P>
<P>
   Facing some troubles after World War I, Indian nevertheless
survived in Springfield for three more decades, whereupon it was
sold and its name packed off to England. Its early reputation had
been solidified via racing, and it later persevered because many
recreational riders saw in it the same virtues as does Seidell
today: style, engineering, and durability. Meanwhile, Indian
remained a deeply rooted part of working-class Springfield, both
among loyal employees and dedicated riders.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of members of the Indian flock still gather annually
'round the museum on the third Sunday of July, carrying on an
Indian Day tradition begun by the company 75 years ago. Part
showplace and part marketplace, the event allows Indian-heads to
lament the passing of a local institution while paying their
respects to its two-wheeled survivors.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a chance to knock Harley-Davidson, which is still
considered an unworthy rival by the Indian faithful. Listen, and
you can almost hear them chant in derision: ``Harley-Davidson, made
of tin. Ride 'em out, and push 'em in.''

IMPORTANT VERDICT: THE EARS HAVE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like diseases and trilliums, complaints come in clusters, and
the past year brought a flurry of objections to importantly. A lot
of people, it appears, have been taught that ``most important, she
loves her job'' is the only proper wording, and that most
importantly deserves only pity and scorn. Rose M. Mula of Andover,
testifying for the prosecution, wondered if people who say more
importantly would ``proclaim Tom Cruise to be more handsomely than
Leonardo DiCaprio?'' Stewart Coffin, also of Andover, was dismayed
by this reminder: ``Be sure to bring lunch, trail snacks, and most
importantly extra water.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly for lovers of certainty, it's hard to make the case that
more (or most) importantly is any less respectable than its
truncated sibling. There wasn't even a debate till midcentury; H.
W. Fowler doesn't mention important(ly) at all, and H. L. Mencken,
in 1919, himself used most importantly, the Merriam-Webster usage
dictionary notes. Maybe the important form was drilled into us by
the same teachers who, trying to tidy up the loose threads of past
usage, said that first, second, and third were the required forms.
(Again, this is a fairly recent campaign; Fowler was content with
first, secondly, thirdly, and called it pedantry to impose strict
parallelism on the series.)
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against importantly, though, don't hold water.
``How does one bring something importantly?'' asked Coffin. Well,
pompous waiters certainly do it, but that's not what importantly
means in his sample sentence: It means that bring water is the most
important of the injunctions on the list.
</P>
<P>
   But a double meaning is no sin in adverbial society. In Happily,
the tornado missed us, we've got a sentence adverb, modifying the
whole idea; in We emerged happily from the storm cellar it's a
garden-variety adverb modifying emerged. Hopefully, for the
multitudes who accept it as a sentence adverb, leads a similarly
two-faced life.
</P>
<P>
   So why not importantly? One argument holds that more important
is a shortened form of the older construction what is more
important. But whether you say (What is) more important, he
deserved it or More importantly, he deserved it, the phrase is
modifying the entire sentence, not just a noun or verb. It's hard
to see why one is grammatically superior. And in practice, both
versions remain common, among the best writers as well as
journalistic drudges.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you want to play it safe, more important is the
way to go, since that's the choice of people who feel strongly
about it. Or you can wimp out entirely, as the new edition of
Strunk &AMP; White advises, and ``Avoid by rephrasing'': S&AMP;W changes
``More importantly, he paid for the damages,'' to ``What's more, he
paid for the damages.'' But what's more won't always work, and
what's more, there's no what's most to substitute for most
important(ly).
</P>
<P>
   Free spirits, though, can follow their ears: If you hear the
echo of What's more important _ especially at the start of a
sentence _ important may sound right there. In other positions,
rhythm may favor importantly. And even if you're a hard-liner,
don't be too quick to condemn the dissidents: The jury in this case
is likely to be out for a good long time.

THE CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO RELATIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EILEEN MITCHELL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN RAMON, Calif. _ You know what creeped me out the most about
confessed killer Cary Stayner? The fact that he's so normal
looking. I mesan c'mon, check out his picture. Tall, nice build,
good looking, rugged. Friends and co-workers painted a portrait of
someone who was always rather nice, unassuming and easy-going.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he's the kind of guy that I, or any of my single
girlfriends, would have considered dating. He's also a guy who told
the authorities investigating the deaths of two women and two
teen-age girls in the area of Yosemite National Park that he
fantasized about killing women since he was 7 years old, an age
when most boys care more about bugs than bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   It's scary being a woman these days. It's even scarier being a
single woman who likes men. We just never know what we might be in
for when we accept a date. Let's face it: The news isn't exactly
awash with stories about men disappearing or being raped, abused or
decapitated. It's women who are the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Women.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems there are no guarantees, no matter what the
precautions. When my recently divorced friend Robin decided she was
ready to date again, she didn't want to hit the bar or club scene.
So she joined a singles group sponsored by her church. She soon
became friendly with a fellow member, a nice man who said he too
was divorced. Everyone in the group knew him.
</P>
<P>
   Good guy, they all agreed.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine Robin's surprise when, after three months of dating,
one day she found his pregnant wife at her doorstep, demanding an
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Seems Romeo had been living a dual life. Robin was lucky to
escape the relationship with nothing more than a bruised heart.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Francis, a handsome engineer who appeared to be
friendly, sweet and fun to be with. At least that's what Janine
thought until he started acting possessive after only two dates.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling uncomfortable, Janine stopped seeing Francis. That
didn't stop Francis from seeing Janine. He started following her.
</P>
<P>
   Calling her and hanging up. Leaving obscene messages on her
answering machine. Tailing her in her car. Hanging out near her
office. Scaring the bejeesus out of her.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for Janine, her brother is a cop. So is her father. And
two aunts. And countless other family members and friends. A few
informal, off-duty visits were enough to persuade Francis into
leaving Janine alone.
</P>
<P>
   But a stalker or cheater is nothing compared to the other
worries women must harbor. These days, aside from wondering if a
potential date is really unmarried, we now have to question if it's
safe to be alone with him in a car or let him know where we live.
Safe to invite him in our home or give him our phone number. We
have to worry about date rape. Torture. Murder.
</P>
<P>
   Today women have to bear in mind that lurking among the many
perfectly decent, kind and considerate men could very well be
another Ted Bundy or Cary Stayner. So gentlemen, pardon us if we're
a tad leery about whom we associate with these days. We don't like
it, but we have to be wary about which men we invite into our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   There could be as little at stake as a broken heart. We're more
worried about the stabbed heart.

HOW DOES THRILLER WRITER'S WIFE FIGURE IN THE PLOT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Having authored 39 novels that have been translated
into 35 languages, and that have sold more than 60 million copies,
Dick Francis, the jockey who became a thriller writer, is one of
popular fiction's greatest success stories.
</P>
<P>
   But an unauthorized biography of the 78-year-old Francis,
published this week, says that his wife of 52 years, Mary, helped
to write the books but never got credit.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Mary Francis actually wrote the books, heavily edited
them or merely provided research and inspiration to her husband, is
a mystery that, unlike his racing-theme thrillers, has no
black-and-white resolution.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dick Francis: A Racing Life,'' Graham Lord builds a
circumstantial case against Francis, based in part on the theory
that since Francis quit school at 15, he was not capable of
researching and writing the books on his own. He quotes one of
Francis' oldest friends, recalling how bad Francis was in English
at school.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Mary Francis is portrayed as the brains of the duo,
someone who earned university degrees in French and English by the
time she was 19, and who worked as a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Lord quotes a previously unreported conversation he
said he had with her in 1980, which implies that Mary Francis
played a much bigger role in the books than has been publicly
acknowledged. Lord said that when he was interviewing the Francises
for a newspaper article, Dick Francis praised his wife so much that
``he made it sound as if it were she, not he, who actually wrote
the books.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord said Mary Francis downplayed her role, and later called him
at home and asked him not to include references to her
contributions in his article. Lord said he asked Mary Francis
pointblank if she wrote her husband's books.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an impossible question to answer,'' Lord quotes her as
replying. ``Yes, Dick would like me to have all the credit for
them, but believe me it's much better for everyone, including the
readers, to think that he writes them because they're taut,
masculine books that might otherwise lose their credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lord said he had sat on what some interpret as
Mary Francis's admission for two decades, out of respect for the
couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was I to spoil their careers?'' Lord said. ``Using this
now will not have the impact on their careers as it would have
then.''
</P>
<P>
   The Francises, who live in the Cayman Islands, will not be
responding to Lord's claims until after the biography is published
and they have a chance to read it, said Nicky Stonehill, a
spokeswoman for Dick Francis' London publisher, Michael Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Francis is considered a national treasure here, a champion
jockey who switched to writing in 1962 after a series of falls.
Although he won some of Britain's biggest races, he is best
remembered for being aboard Devon Loch, a horse owned by the Queen
Mother, when it collapsed 50 yards short of the finish line,
denying him victory in the Grand National in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mother remains one of Francis' biggest fans. Two
months ago, at the launch of what many thought would be his last
novel, ``Second Wind,'' Francis said he had agreed to the Queen
Mother's request that he write one more to commemorate her 100th
birthday next year.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations that Mary Francis was more than a muse and spelling
checker for her husband have been bubbling around literary circles
here for years. In interviews last month with the Mail on Sunday, a
British newspaper, the Francises tried to blunt the impact of
Lord's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graham Lord is guessing and he has no hard facts,'' Mary
Francis told the newspaper. ``The amount of sharing we do is
private.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same interview, Dick Francis said, ``It is not the case
that Mary writes the books. I do all the stories. I write them out
in longhand. She then reads and edits them, because she can manage
my handwriting, and I put them into the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Lord and Francis were colleagues at the Sunday
Express, where Lord was the literary editor and Francis was the
racing correspondent. But Francis' son, Felix, who also is his
manager, disputes claims that Lord is close to the family.
</P>
<P>
   Lord said his book is ``a warm and affectionate tribute'' to the
Francises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry they seem to be upset,'' he said. ``But I also think
it's appropriate that Mary receive the credit she deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis, meanwhile, has authorized the republication of his
autobiography as an alternative to Lord's 400-page biography.

GETTING OUT THE VOTE FOR BLACK FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like smoke from a distant fire, the e-mails began arriving weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   This from Dallas: ``Just wanna give y'all a heads-up on getting
out for the opening weekend of `The Best Man.' Throw your support,
'cause we need that (box office).'' And from Baltimore: ``Tell your
friends and family to get to the movies to see `The Best Man.' And
from New York: `` `The Best Man' is opening soon, and we just want
to remind our folks to make sure they're out there for the opening
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a get-out-and-vote campaign with the box office subbing for
the ballot box, a Sunday morning call from the pulpit waiting for a
response from the parishioners. ``The Best Man,'' a romantic comedy
starring Taye Diggs, Nia Long, and Morris Chestnut, is the latest
recipient of a largely grassroots effort by African-Americans to
support movies by black filmmakers, and especially, those featuring
a predominantly black cast. Realizing the importance of a solid
opening weekend, black film lovers _ from Boston to Berkeley _ have
been encouraging their brethren to pump the film at the local
multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   And it worked. The film topped the box office last weekend,
earning an estimated $9.1 million. Though far from a
record-breaker, it was more than enough to slap Brad Pitt and
Edward Norton's ``Fight Club'' from No. 1 to 3, and to stiff Martin
Scorsese's ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' which also opened last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Rocco, who heads distribution at Universal, which released
the film, said audiences for ``The Best Man'' were 80 to 85 percent
black, but ``the movie did very well across the board. It played
well with the white community.'' The film also more than doubled
the per-screen average _ $6,761 vs. $3,202 _ of ``Bringing Out the
Dead,'' while playing in fewer theaters _ 1,346 to 1,936.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, other groups have taken cues from this just-folks
support network. A few weeks ago, Hollywood types were knocked out
of their Italian loafers when ``The Omega Code,'' starring Michael
York, Casper Van Dien, and Catherine Oxenberg, landed in the top
10. Despite precious little advertising and few positive reviews
(if the film was reviewed at all), it earned $2.4 million, based on
a whopping $7,869 per-screen average in just 305 theaters. The film
concerns an apocalyptic battle between good and evil, and was
greatly buoyed by conservative Christian moviegoers who put up
posters in churches and steered people toward the film's Web site,
which is receiving 12,000 hits a day.
</P>
<P>
   But the blueprint for such efforts was first drawn by black
filmgoers.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early 199Os, movies with black casts were usually ``
'hood'' films _ gritty dramas like ``Juice,'' ``Menace II Society''
or ``Boyz N the Hood,'' or low-brow comedies like ``Booty Call'' or
``Friday.'' In such films, blacks were portrayed either as
gun-toting gangstas or 40-ounce-swilling goofballs. And while the
films didn't uplift the race, they usually made money. Some feared
that images of blacks on film would forever be stranded in the
ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   That began to change in 1995 with ``Waiting to Exhale,'' which
starred Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Loretta Devine, and Lela
Rochon as four accomplished black women dealing with man troubles
in Phoenix. Since trifling men come in all races, the film
connected with women across the board. But its initial boost came
from within the black community _ from urban radio stations,
networks like Black Entertainment Television, Web sites and
magazines devoted to black folk, and an e-mail campaign with
strangers telling strangers to support the film's positive
portrayal of upwardly mobile black women.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, similar efforts have been used to turn such films as
``Soul Food'' and ``Eve's Bayou'' into hits. But it's not a
foolproof method. It didn't help the fortunes of the sorely
overlooked ``love jones'' in 1997, nor did it save the very
satisfying adaptation of Walter Mosley's ``Devil in a Blue Dress,''
which starred Denzel Washington and Don Cheadle, from tanking in
1995. And last year, blacks stayed away in droves from the
post-slavery epic ``Beloved,'' even though it starred Oprah Winfrey
and was based on the great Toni Morrison novel.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, they haven't garnered any recent hits for Spike Lee,
whose ambitious ``Summer of Sam'' sank all too quickly a few months
ago. (But maybe Spike will have the last laugh. He is the executive
producer of ``The Best Man,'' which was written and directed by his
cousin Malcolm D. Lee.)
</P>
<P>
   And it's also a very selective support. It's not enough to be a
black movie; it has to be the right black movie, one that turns its
back on easy stereotypes _ portraying Huxtables, not hoodlums. To
wit, all of the characters in ``The Best Man'' could be
card-carrying members of W.E.B DuBois's ``Talented Tenth.'' There's
an author (Diggs), a TV producer (Long), and a football star
(Chestnut). Even the ne'er-do-well played by Terrence Howard is a
sometime classical guitarist and the scion of a luxury hotel owner.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say ``The Best Man'' a great film. It's too
long, tosses way too many N-bombs to establish street cred, and has
moments of such banality it could star Matthew Perry. Still, it
achieves something more important as perhaps the first successful
predominantly black romantic comedy, And it sends a message to all
those suits in Tinseltown: Films with worthwhile portrayals of
contemporary African-Americans can make money.

SYDNEY'S MANY CHARMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The countdown is on as Olympic fever races through
Sydney. Electronic billboards proclaim the number of days left
until the Olympic games begin here in September 2000. The
110,000-seat Stadium Australia, where opening and closing
ceremonies will be held, has become a tourist attraction in itself.
And the nickname Sydney 2000 is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't need an Olympics to enjoy the treasures of
Australia's biggest city, home to 4 million of the country's 17
million residents. With its favorable climate and cosmopolitan
attractions, any time is a good time to visit Sydney _ and any time
besides the Olympics will undoubtedly be less crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you go, you'll meet some of the world's friendliest
people. But a great place to start is The Rocks, site of the
nation's first non-aboriginal settlement more than two centuries
ago. Only you'll be going voluntarily: The first settlers were
prisoners, relocated here primarily from Great Britain. Life wasn't
easy for them: Some committed suicide rather than face the
loneliness, drudgery, and harsh discipline involved in transforming
this area of sandstone and sadness into a community. A plaque marks
the site of the first hanging; the crime was stealing food.
</P>
<P>
   For many more years, The Rocks was a raucous and rowdy place,
best avoided. But today, the only resemblance to The Rocks of old
is its look, with cobblestones, old-style street lamps, and places
with names like the Heart of Waterloo pub and the Lord Nelson
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sweating and struggling, today's visitors stroll,
taking in the atmosphere and attractions, which include museums,
restaurants, arts and crafts galleries, boutiques, the usual
souvenir shops (and some very nice ones as well), and spectacular
views of Sydney Harbour.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasures of the harbor are many. The Sydney Opera House,
with its graceful clamshell-style roof, is one of the world's most
recognizable buildings. Guided tours are available, and the opera
house will be the starting point of the Olympics triathlon. The
Sydney Harbour Bridge, another landmark, can be climbed with a
small group and a guide from the tour operator BridgeClimb for one
of the best views in the city. (Another place to reach the heights
is the top of the AMP Tower, 1,000 feet up.)
</P>
<P>
   More fine views, especially of the Opera House, are available
from the sea, by private boats, ferries, or dinner boats. The
biggest and most luxurious of the dinner boats is the new MV Sydney
2000 (there's that name again), which departs from historic
Circular Quay and offers four-course dinners as well as
entertainment, which on some nights fittingly includes opera.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney's museums and galleries, meanwhile, include the Art
Gallery of New South Wales, the Australian Museum, the National
Maritime Museum, the Mint Museum, and the Powerhouse Museum, which
houses Sydney's Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights:
</P>
<P>
   --Homebush Bay. This site, open to touring, is where many of the
venues and facilities for the 2000 Olympic and Paralympic games are
found. There are athletic, aquatic, hockey, and tennis centers; a
visitors' center; parks; a hotel; a cafe; gardens; an archery park;
the Sydney Superdome; and Stadium Australia, the showpiece.
</P>
<P>
   --The Royal Botanic Gardens. The gardens, established in 1816,
contain one of the best collections of South Pacific plant life, as
well as a rose garden, a cactus garden, and _ boo! _ a bat colony.
</P>
<P>
   --The Taronga Zoo. Here's one place you'll be sure to see
Australian animals, including a platypus, echidna, and kookaburra.
In all, there are 4,000 creatures. There's also another excellent
view, overlooking Sydney Harbour.
</P>
<P>
   --Chinatown. Like Chinatowns everywhere, this area is bustling.
The many Chinese and other Asian restaurants range from noodle
joints to attractive and expensive eateries.
</P>
<P>
   --Kings Cross. With everything from fine hotels to good
restaurants to strip joints, Kings Cross has a reputation for both
raffishness and refinement. It attracts myriad sightseers, some in
search of sleaze and others just looking for a lively night.
Darlinghurst Road is the main drag.
</P>
<P>
   --Paddington. Sloping streets, Victorian homes, bookstores,
restaurants, art galleries, and trendy shops are all part of this
intriguing area. On Saturday mornings, the Paddington Village
Bazaar, with its many and varied stalls, takes place.
</P>
<P>
   --Darling Harbour. The area is home to a great seaside shopping
district, which also includes such attractions as the National
Aboriginal Cultural Centre and the Chinese Garden of Friendship.
The area will play a role in the Olympics, too. Boxing, judo, and
wrestling will be held in the Sydney Exhibition Centre, and
weightlifting will be at the Sydney Convention Centre.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the beaches, 20 of them. The most famous is Bondi
Beach, south of Sydney, which is known both for surfing and as a
gathering place. When the Olympics are underway, it will be the
site of beach volleyball competition. Manly Beach, north of the
city, is also well known, while the other 18 range from the
built-up to the largely undeveloped. Sometimes there are pollution
problems, so check conditions before making a splash.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to think of this vast land without thinking of nature.
And the Sydney area has some spectacular reserves and national
parks. Botany Bay, about 9 miles south of Sydney, was Captain
Cook's first landing point in Australia. It's aptly named, because
it's a botanist's heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Royal National Park, 22 miles south of Sydney, was established
in 1879 as the second national park in the world (Yellowstone was
first). The park is on the coast and boasts excellent surfing
beaches. There are walks and trails as well as canoeing and
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, just over 12 miles from
Sydney's city center, is where you'll find aboriginal rock carvings
on sandstone slabs. You'll also find a rain forest, eucalyptus
forest, heath, and a lot of wildlife, including (if you're lucky)
the lovely lyre bird.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't want to visit Australia and not see kangaroos in
their natural habitat, right? A bit farther from Sydney (about 40
miles), the 249,008-acre Blue Mountains National Park is home to
lots of gray kangaroos. On a daylong expedition with Australian
Wild Escapes, I saw so many of these marvelous marsupials that I
took perhaps 75 more photos of kangaroos than I will ever need.
Platypuses, wallabies, and many kinds of birds are park residents,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Mountains themselves are more like hills, and get their
color from the abundance of eucalyptus. Among the attractions are
Wentworth Falls, Govett's Leap, and the Three Sisters, famous rock
formations that to some look just like three sisters and to others
look just like three chunks of rock. In the winter (our summer),
snow has been known to fall on the mountains for a few hours. This,
an Australian told me, causes such an influx of Sydney sightseers
that traffic jams result. By the time the drivers get to the Blue
Mountains, the snow, alas, is gone.

NOISE GOES; MUSIC STAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1978, Amar Bose was on a flight from Zurich to Boston and
planning on doing some work while listening to the plane's music
selections. Between the noise of the aircraft and the poor quality
of sound from the earphones, Bose, the founder of the company that
bears his name, accomplished nothing. But it got him thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some 20 years after that flight, those thoughts have become
reality. American Airlines on Nov. 1 will introduce earphones
developed by Bose that cut out aircraft noise and provide superb
sound so you can catch all the soft sounds of music or talk from a
movie without having a broken-up blast in your ears.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone to The Mountain in Framingham where Bose
headquarters is to hear a demonstration by Bob Maresca, Bose's
noise-reduction chief engineer, I'd have to agree these are going
to be a great feature on flights.
</P>
<P>
   Bose, which is known for its speaker systems, first filled the
auditorium with the typical 84-decibel rumble that is heard in a
Boeing 767 at cruising altitude. Then they showed film clips with
the sound playing at a comfortable level. We first heard the sound
track over regular earphones, and it was difficult to catch some of
the dialogue and music. Then with the Bose Acoustic Noise
Cancelling headset on, the airplane roar became a whisper, and the
dialogue and music were clearly and easily heard without increasing
the sound volume.
</P>
<P>
   The earphones have a microphone in the ear cup that monitors
sound entering the ear, comparing it to the sound the person wants
to hear. The difference between the existing and desired sound is
then processed and creates an equal and opposite correction signal
that reduces noise, distortion, and frequency response anomalies.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers using these headsets will also be able to rest
comfortably and avoid the fatigue sometimes associated with
exposure to continuous noise.
</P>
<P>
   While some other airlines already offer noise-canceling
headphones on certain flights, American says the ones they're
getting from Bose are the best. The headsets are light and quite
comfortable to wear. American tested the Bose headsets with
competing units on its first-class flights. ``Our passengers
preferred the Bose headsets by a wide margin, and they cited the
dramatic quiet, the quality sound, and the lasting comfort in
particular,'' said Mike Gunn, senior vice president of marketing at
American.
</P>
<P>
   The earphones are quite expensive. Bose would not reveal the
cost, but a much bulkier model used by private pilots costs around
$1,000. American plans on introducing the new earphones to
first-class passengers on trans-Atlantic and South American flights
first. Later the units will be available to business-class
passengers and also on long-haul domestic flights.
</P>
<P>
   American has a six-month exclusive agreement on the Bose system,
which means other airlines may be able to add these to their
flights. Maybe someday even for those of us in the back of the
plane.

River Shipyard. The vessel will be docked at the Harbor Express
water shuttle dock off Route 3. Tours are $3 for adults and $1 for
those under 10. In addition to the Empire Sandy, the USS Salem, a
World War II vessel, is also open for touring. A special Haunted
Ship program aboard the Salem is available at an additional charge.
Free parking is offered, and the shipyard can be reached by MBTA

Nov. 5-7. Whale-watchers will gather to take photos of the great
humpback, a mammal that can be 40 to 50 feet long and weigh an
impressive 35 tons. Whales often migrate to the pristine Alaskan
waters in groups of 80 to feed on schools of small fish. The area
near Sitka attracts the breathtaking humpbacks each year from the
end of September until mid-January during their southern migratory
route through the Inside Passage. The Whalefest is also a time for
song, education, and food. People can also enjoy an Alaskan trade
market, listen to a world-renowned marine biologist, or take
whale-watching excursions. Lectures and the Whalefest reception
require a fee. All other events are free.

Foliage scene
</P>
<P>
   Leaf peepers can still see good foliage throughout New England.
For example, in Bethel, Maine, ``foliage is still special for this
time of year,'' said Robin Zinchuk, executive director of the
Bethel Area Chamber of Commerce. ``It's late but it is amazing.
There's still the impact between the green of trees and oranges and
yellows. It's a lot less crowded for visitors, and there's plenty
of room.'' For more information, or rooms in the Bethel area, call
800-442-5826. Oh yes, Zinchuk also reports there is snow on some
mountaintops. Another season, another reason to visit Bethel.

RIGHT IDEAS MAKING SOME START-UP EXECUTIVES VERY RICH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slap a dollar value on our best ideas, and we won't be talking
about the kind of money that makes you think of mansion living or
early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But hot money and quickly evolving technology are creating
opportunities for the right people with the right ideas to amass
huge paper fortunes in unthinkably brief periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to capitalize financially on your idea is
unprecedented right now,'' said one venture capitalist in the
business of funding young companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hard work, under those circumstances, can sometimes yield stock
or cash worth $100 million or more after two or three years for a
start-up's top executives. Occasionally, a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore Networks Inc. of Chelmsford, Mass., smacked a home run
for the ages Friday when its initial public stock offering hit the
market and soared so high it became the state's fourth
most-valuable public company.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Desh Deshpande and chief executive Daniel Smith, who
joined the young company at its earliest stages about 18 months
ago, suddenly owned a pile of Sycamore stock worth more than $2.5
billion apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Now coming to the plate: Akamai Technologies Inc. of Cambridge,
Mass., a hot Internet technology company whose IPO is scheduled to
be launched at the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai makes products that help speed the delivery of content
over the Internet, directing huge flows of information so it
doesn't get jammed in high-tech bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Akamai offering has generated lots of attention, we
have no idea what will really happen to the stock. But even at the
low end of the offering's current estimated price of $16 to $18 per
share, the company's two founders would own an interest worth more
than $150 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, considering the company created by F. Thomson Leighton,
an applied mathematics professor at MIT, and one of his graduate
students, Daniel Lewin, was competing among a field of start-ups in
the MIT $50K Entrepreneurship Competition in spring 1998. (Akamai
was a finalist but didn't win.)
</P>
<P>
   As startling as their fortunes seem, the people behind Sycamore
Networks and Akamai Technologies are hardly alone among the quickly
ultra-wealthy entrepreneurial class.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Silverstream Software Inc. went public and today
the shares owned by chairman David Skok and chief executive David
Litwack are worth more than $100 million each.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the summer of 1996 when Boston Capital wrote about
Skok launching his fifth new company from the temporary digs of his
venture capital firm's office.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months ago, Redstone Communications of Westford skipped
the IPO route and sold out directly to German telecommunications
giant Siemens AG for $500 million, a deal that earned the company's
cofounders an estimated $50 million each.
</P>
<P>
   When Redstone agreed to the sale, the company was a mere 18
months old and had not shipped a product.
</P>
<P>
   How can high-tech entrepreneurs make so much money so fast
today? The answer lies mostly in the vast amounts of money
available for investment and the uncertainty of rapidly evolving
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for Internet-related venture capital funds to
raise as much as $1 billion at a time in 1999. The companies that
ultimately received that venture funding are often pushed to
proceed from concept to test product in as little as 18 months. At
that point, the young companies often land in a public stock market
with a seemingly insatiable appetite for prospects in certain
industries like telecommunications and the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Under those pressurized circumstances, experienced executives
and blockbuster ideas command a huge premium.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore Networks's Deshpande and Smith drew investors because
they had performed so well just a few years earlier, when they ran
Cascade Communications. Skok had made money for investors over and
over in his four previous companies, though he usually didn't stick
around very long himself.
</P>
<P>
   Top-flight management is also in demand when investors are
uncertain how a technology will develop, as is the case in the
fiber-optic network field where Sycamore works.
</P>
<P>
   Ask most professional investors why they bought Sycamore
Networks stock and hardly any will say it was because of the
technology. Practically everyone we asked said they were placing a
bet on the ability of Sycamore's management to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists say another underlying theme in industry
competition and the stock market, the winner-take-all mentality, is
behind the huge stock portfolios of a few executives.
</P>
<P>
   That trend, noted broadly this year in the book ``Profit
Patterns'' by Mercer Management Consulting executives Adrian
Slywotzky and David Morrison, has created leading companies that
own a disproportionate share of their industry's business and stock
market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who want to climb aboard those winning horses early
have been willing to pay dearly for the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But don't envy the new wealthy tech entrepreneurs too much.
Their fortunes are mostly on paper and, as they say, fortunes can
change.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, we wrote about four local software megamillionaires who
amassed hugely valuable stock holdings in their own companies after
years of work. Since then, two have gone through another experience
foreign to us. Alan Trefler of Pegasystems Inc. and G. Drew Conway
of Renaissance Worldwide Inc. each lost hundreds of millions of
dollars on paper in sudden declines of less than a year.

FENCING OUT GATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much has been said about how Congress is taking down the old
barriers that it erected at the bottom of the Great Depression
between securities firms, insurance companies, and banks.
</P>
<P>
   Less noted has been the great wall between banking and commerce
that it is reinforcing.
</P>
<P>
   The relaxation of restrictions on financial services firms is
spectacular enough. When Citigroup Inc. co-chairman Sanford I.
Weill last week reported a 250 percent increase in third-quarter
earnings from the year earlier, one reason they were said to have
skyrocketed was attributed to cross-selling since the acquisition
by Citibank of insurance giant Travelers Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that the Asian crisis is substantially over too. But
the bankers had promised to partially unwind the Travellers deal if
the repeal of the 66-year-old Glass Steagall Act prohibiting such
combinations didn't go through.
</P>
<P>
   How pleasant for Citigroup, therefore, that HR10 did go through
_ at 2:45 a.m. Friday, when bleary-eyed Jim Leach (R-Iowa),
chairman of the House Banking Committee, announced that a
compromise had been achieved between a House and Senate conference
committee and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   So now Citigroup looks like the wave of the future _ a
gargantuan one-stop-shopping mall for financial services. With its
Salomon Bothers Smith Barney subsidiary, it stands ready to sell
you anything from a personal insurance policy to an annuity to
corporate debt offering.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead lies a wave of consolidation with profound but uncertain
implications for Boston. Will Fleet Financial Group acquire John
Hancock Mutual Life Insturance Co. once the old mutual life insurer
has coverted to a publicly owned company? Will Fidelity
aggressively expand into a full-service firm?
</P>
<P>
   One thing is crystal clear. Commercial firms have been excluded
from finance as firmly as banks, insurance companies, and
securities firms have been included. Great companies with enormous
credit subsidiaries that only a few years ago seemed poised to
enter financial services in a big way _ Wal-Mart and Sears Ford and
General Motors, IBM and Microsoft _ are banned more firmly than
ever by HR10's definitions of banking and commerce and the
separation thereof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft was the 800-pound gorilla that everyone was afraid
of,'' Robert Litan said Monday. The banking expert at the Brookings
Institution, an accute student of deregulation, asserted that was
the single-most important fear that drove lawmakers to close the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been no deal, anybody could have bought a thrift,
and a thrift is like a bank. There would have been no stopping
these companies from coming in,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Fierce lobbying efforts had been brought to bear these last few
years to dispense with the old arguments in favor of a sharp
separation between banking and commerce. Companies that became
adept at overseeing consumer or commercial credit empires had every
reason to want to go the rest of the way and open their doors to
deposits.
</P>
<P>
   But reglators _ especially central bankers such as former
Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker and former New York
Federal Reserve Bank chief Gerald Corrigan _ argued forcefully that
the monetary system would be all but ungovernable once explicit and
implicit guarantees were extended to firms that manufactured
widgets as well.
</P>
<P>
   Would the shadowy doctrine of too-big-to-fail be extended to an
automotive manufacturer whose designs met resistence in the show
room? Could the antitrust division of the Justice Department
proceed forcefully against a company that dominated not only
operating systems but virtually of all the nation's system of
demand deposits as well?
</P>
<P>
   There seems little doubt that there will be a wave of business
combinations among financial firms before the end of the year. But
there is nothing else obvious about the post Glass-Steagall world.
What will be the role of the Internet in preserving competition,
for example?
</P>
<P>
   Building the new financial supermarkets will be easy, but there
are any number of ways for them to break down or backfire or
otherwise fail to work. Congress is wise not to moosh things up any
more than it has with the Financial Services Act of 1999.

TAKING THE PLUNGE IN THE ADRIATIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MATTINATA, Italy _ The Adriatic is irresistible. &UR;  &LR; But chilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``So-o-o invitingly bloo-oo-oo!'' says my friend, Aurelio. But
then suddenly wet and breathless &UR; .  &LR; ... ``Whoo-oo-oo!'' Too late.
The plunge has been taken, and there's nothing for us to do but
swim for whatever warmth that might provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bloody gin-and-tonic blue for my taste,'' observes our
pal, Ron Sampson. He casts an abstaining ballot by remaining on the
beach of smooth, layered pebbles that rattle pleasantly as
castanets accompanying a slight tide. So perfect are these stones
that they might have been polished by a lapidary, and Ron is
content to sit among them, his backrest a striated limestone cliff,
as he dives into a good book.
</P>
<P>
   Limestone abounds in the sea, poking out in marvelous formations
sculpted by Neptune. The prize is a high archway, a furlong or so
offshore, that may have given ancient Roman architects ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like the Arch of Titus in the Forum,'' says Aurelio,
striking out in that direction, forgetting the autumn cool. ``We
can't leave without swimming through it and around that huge
rampart that's pretty near.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a triumphal legion doing the crawl through the emperor's
monument?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' she says. And we do, noting cactus and other greenery
embellishing the two gray monoliths, and wondering how long they've
stood monumentally _ and will be allowed to stand by the Adriatic
as it washes the Gargano Peninsula along the southeast coast of
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   It registers as an all-timer among splendid swims, and Ron
concurs that it was clearly ``one of the best I've ever missed.''
</P>
<P>
   We've gotten to the heel of things, if not quite the bottom-most
bottom of the Italian boot, that being the southwest coastal toe,
Calabria, stretching almost to Sicily. The Gargano is a spur,
sticking out and jabbing the ocean not far above the heel, and the
region is Puglia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll like Puglia,'' Grace Rettondini at the Cavalieri Hilton
in Rome had advised. ``It doesn't get much tourism, and the coast
can be spectacular. The food, too. It's Italy's leading olive- and
wine-producing area.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors have not flocked, especially in 1999 because of the
proximity of the Balkan war zones just across the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bad year for us,'' said Felice, a waiter at the attractive
cavern restaurant of the 18th-century Grotta Palazzese Hotel in
Polignano. The sea rushes in through an opening in the rocks and
surrounds a crag where tables are perched and birds and waiters
with nothing much to do flit about. ``We get our fish, clams, and
mussels right here.'' He sighed and added, ``So fresh, but we
cannot fish for guests.''
</P>
<P>
   He told us that some of the luckier seaside hotels had been
commandeered by Britain's Royal Air Force to house crews that flew
daily bombing missions from a nearby base. ``Not exactly the kind
of tourists we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees aren't either, and they are plentiful. One we
encountered outside of Alfadena at least had a job. Acif Panika, a
scruffy shepherd whose bell-clinkling charges, just-shorn and
shivering, momentarily blocked the road, said he had escaped Kosovo
with his own narrowly unsheared skin, and nothing else. ``The rest
of my family was killed by Serbs. The sheep are my family now.''
</P>
<P>
   The destination that day was Santa Maria di Leuca, a port at the
tip of the heel, locale of a salty clash of the seas: Ionian bumps
heads with Adriatic. Such collisions can be wildly dramatic, as in
the tumultuous adversarial meeting of Pacific Ocean and Tasman Sea
off Cape Reinga at New Zealand's northernmost end. Not here. No
battering-rams action but merely a sheepish sort of churning
mingling.
</P>
<P>
   It required a swim to check out the contestants, of course, from
a rocky thumb called Punta Ristola where fishermen with very long
poles gave us short ``what's the point?'' stares. Because of
shipping, the water isn't as visually welcoming as at Mattinata. A
few splashes sufficed, with the pushy Adriatic getting a slim edge
in the territorial battle.
</P>
<P>
   As the only guests at the small, spare and quiet Hotel Minerva
in an apparently deserted neighborhood, we seemed to personify
Ron's remark: ``I feared this would happen _ that someday we'd be
down at the heel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll recover,'' said Aurelio. ``Way down but not out in
Italy, guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``August is our season, but it wasn't much of a season,'' said
the one-man staff, Ottavio. ``But you'll have a good fish dinner at
Fedele on the harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right, one of an unfailingly satisfying string of seafood
repasts at unimposing trattorias in waterfront towns. Places like
Trattoria dal Baffo in Otranto. In the kitchen the proprietor's
mother, Giuseppina Conte, delicately fried all sorts of fish, and
the sea outside was aqua like her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Or Rampa la Conca in Trani. There Antonio Giuliano had a light
touch in frying squid, octopus, and shrimp brought to him by the
blue fishing boats tied at the dock across the street, delicacies
that he wove into a succulent spaghetti di mare.
</P>
<P>
   We'd been told of good restaurants in Bari, Puglia's largest
city, where refugees as hookers were in business along the
outskirting road. But Bari seemed a good place to get through and
past. The main street, Via Dante, would be considered a modern
purgatory by its namesake, the old scribbler Dante Alighieri. A
canyon walled by grim five-story apartment buildings with overbite
balconies, it was a traffic inferno of double parking and
roar-through intersections. Well left behind.
</P>
<P>
   But now, drying off after that fine, if frigid, swim, the goal
is lunch farther along the peninsula, at Peschici. Ascending into
pine forests and dropping to sea level and sandy beaches, the road
also courses through resort villages, fields that will be
stunningly poppified in spring, and pastures populated by scrawny,
ribby cows.
</P>
<P>
   On a bluff above the Adriatic is La Grotta, a restaurant hacked
out of the limestone of Peschici, opened by newlyweds Antonio and
Mattea DiMilo more than a half-century ago. Their wedding photo is
on the wall. So is a more recent shot, much wider and very crowded:
Mattea and Antonio with their 14 children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm number five, Orlando DeMilo,'' says the young man in
charge. ``That's papa, having coffee at the bar. Mama isn't in the
kitchen anymore, but she had to be a good cook just to feed all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is there today does a very nice job with the linguine
and clams. Ron, looking around the subterranean room, says, ``We've
hit rock bottom in this country, but it tastes pretty darned
good.''

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ America watched as the Air Force searched a
snow-covered mountain in Colorado for a $6 million A-10 jet that
mysteriously crashed with a load of bombs in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The missing pilot, Capt. Craig D. Button, was the subject of
network news shows, countless newspaper articles and lengthy
military investigative reports.
</P>
<P>
   But while America wasn't watching, the Air Force kept the
accident from its official accident rate released to the public.
The accident also was never entered on the service's database of
aviation accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force said the accident wasn't counted because Button
committed suicide, making what happened to his plane a crime and
not an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian National Transportation Safety Board includes
suicides in its database and identifies the deaths in official
fatality statistics, an NTSB spokesman said. The NTSB omits
suicides from its accident rate _ accidents per 100,000 flight
hours _ if an NTSB investigation concludes suicide was the cause of
the crash, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Without Button's crash on official records, the Air Force called
1997 ``a relatively good year for the A-10 community'' in its
Flying Safety magazine. But even without counting the Button crash,
there were three Class A accidents involving A-10s that year, one
more than the previous year and exceeding the five-year average,
according to the military's calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Air Force counted Button's crash, the number of Class A
accidents for A-10s would have doubled the previous year's total.
His accident also would have given Davis Monthan Air Force Base,
Ariz., two major accidents in a single year, equaling the total
number of major accidents the base recorded in the previous six
years.
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force instruction allows commanders to exclude suicides
from accident rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force concluded that Button committed suicide without
conducting the same investigation it conducts for other major
accidents _ a secret investigation the military insists is the only
way it can get to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In the Button case, the Air Force decided early on not to do its
secret safety investigation. Instead, it dispatched a team of
officers to do a publicly releasable and less thorough report
called the Accident Investigation Report.
</P>
<P>
   The officers _ none identified as a criminal investigator _
arrived at their conclusion that Button committed suicide not
because they had physical evidence showing he had killed himself,
but because they found no evidence that anything else could have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Among several possible other explanations investigators were not
able to rule out was alcohol or drug use. There weren't enough
remains to test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I would have ruled,'' said Eagle County
Coroner Donna Barnes. ``To some extent, it is still undetermined.
We can still change what happened (the official cause of death) in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, however, said some of Button's actions before the crash
might have pointed to suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``On every suicide, I'm not 100 percent convinced,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force Office of Special Investigations interviewed
numerous friends of Button's and produced a psychological autopsy
report of more than 150 pages, which included some Bible passages
Button was curious about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears deceased may have been thinking about this for a
long time,'' investigators wrote, referring to suicide. For proof,
investigators noted that Button once told a friend that he ``wanted
to run as far and as fast as I can'' when he was troubled by a
problem he couldn't solve.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also noted that Button, an avid skier, once wrote:
``Nothing can compare with the thrill of flying down the
snow-capped ridges of Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Gen. Richard E. Hawley, who headed the Air Combat Command
at the time of the crash, wasn't convinced of what really happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is insufficient clear and convincing evidence to
determine with certainty why this skilled pilot and fine officer
departed formation flight and flew his aircraft to Colorado,'' says
an addendum to the accident report written by Hawley, who retired
in July. ``There also is insufficient evidence to rule out,
totally, some presently unknown medical explanation for his
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   In absence of other evidence, Hawley wrote, suicide was the
``most likely'' cause.
</P>
<P>
   Button's father, Richard Button, who served at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base in the late 1960s, disputes the finding and says the
Air Force didn't recover enough wreckage to rule out some other
cause, such as oxygen contamination or toxic fumes in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the Air Force people never came up with any
speculation of what could have happened,'' he said of the suicide
ruling. ``They didn't have any justification for that finding.''

   For many hotels, amenities are all-important. And we're not just
talking about those bars of soap and little shampoo bottles you
stash in your suitcases. Look at what these hotels offer:
</P>
<P>
   --The Anderson House in Wabash, Minn., offers kitty
companionship _ your choice of one of 15 felines to keep you
company in your room.
</P>
<P>
   --The Pan Pacific in San Francisco makes pillows to guests'
exact specifications.
</P>
<P>
   --The Grand Bay Hotel in Miami provides cotton gloves so you
won't smudge your hands while reading the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   --The Beverly Hills Hotel gives repeat guests a gold room key
with their initials on it.
</P>
<P>
   --The St. Regis in New York will press two of a guest's garments
for free.
</P>
<P>
   --The Fairmont Vancouver Airport allows guests to check in right
at the airport's arrival halls. Once they identify their luggage,
it is taken directly to their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   --And, if you want to make those back home envious, the Cocoplum
Beach and Tennis Club in Key West, Fla., can create a computerized
postcard of you having a grand time!

   Did you guess it? Alabama (after the Alabama, or Alibamon,
Indians), Arkansas (a French derivative of Siouan Quapaw, or
``downstream people''), Connecticut (Algonquin and Mohican for
``long river place''), the Dakotas (from the Sioux word for
``friend'' or ``ally''), Illinois (French version of the Algonquin
word ``illini,'' meaning ``men'' or ``soldiers''), Iowa (from the
Siouan ``ouaouia,'' meaning ``one who puts to sleep''), Kansas
(from the Siouan ``kansa'' or ``kaw,'' meaning ``people of the
south wind''), Kentucky (believed to be an Indian word meaning
``dark and bloody ground,'' ``meadowland,'' or ``land of
tomorrow''), Massachusetts (named for a tribe that lived near
Milton and meaning ``large hill place''), Michigan (believed to be
from the Chippewa word ``micigama,'' meaning ``great water''),
Minnesota (after the Sioux description of the Minnesota River:
``sky-tinted water'' or ``muddy water''), Mississippi (likely from
the Chippewa words ``mici,'' meaning ``great,'' and ``zibi,''
meaning ``river''), Missouri (Siouan for ``muddy water''), Nebraska
(Omaha or Oto for ``flat water'' or ``spreading water''), Ohio
(from an Iroquois word meaning ``great,'' ``fine,'' or ``good
river''), Oklahoma (Choctaw for ``red man''), Tennessee (after
Cherokee villages named ``tanasi''), Texas (a variation on the
Caddo word for ``friend''), Utah (a Navajo, or Ute, word meaning
``upper'' or ``higher,'' used to designate a Shoshone tribe),
Wisconsin (a Chippewa word, its meaning uncertain, that was spelled
``Ouisconsin'' and ``Mesconsing'' by early explorers), and Wyoming
(Algonquin for ``large prairie place'').
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some believe that Idaho derives its name from Kiowa
Apache word for the Commanche tribe, and one theory holds that
Oregon gets its name from the Algonquin ``wauregan,'' meaning
``beautiful water.'' And finally, Indiana was named by
English-speaking settlers to mean ``land of the Indians.'' We are

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Two pilots were killed and a $2.3 million
aircraft was lost when an F-4G fighter belonging to the Air Force
Material Command at Wright Patterson Air Force Base crashed near
Las Vegas on May 14, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Footage of the burning jet topped the evening news in Las Vegas,
but the crash wasn't included in the official Air Force accident
rate that year.
</P>
<P>
   A Sept. 9, 1996, accident in Orlando, Fla., destroyed a $2.8
million military helicopter assigned to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The crash made the top of the Pentagon's press briefing that
day, and President Clinton called for an investigation into the
safety of aircraft assigned to his fleet. But when the Navy
released its official accident rate that year, the accident was not
included.
</P>
<P>
   These are among hundreds of aviation incidents since 1980 that
the armed services did not calculate in official accident rates,
statistics used by Congress and the public to assess military
aviation safety.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-month Dayton Daily News examination found that among those
not counted were at least 282 Class A and B accidents _ the type
watched most closely by Congress _ that killed at least 78 people
and injured another 130.
</P>
<P>
   And several times during the past 10 years, as the military
boasted that its aviation accident rate had declined, the number of
accidents omitted from official statistics grew. The percentage of
accidents not counted increased from 5.6 percent of total accidents
in 1990 to 23 percent in 1997 _ nearly one of every four incidents.
</P>
<P>
   At least part of the reason the services were able to conceal
the incidents from the public, the newspaper's examination found,
is that military rules for reporting aviation incidents are vague,
leaving commanders wide discretion in determining which accidents
will be counted.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News discovered the uncounted accidents in three
previously unreleased computer databases obtained through the
federal Freedom of Information Act. Though the Army, Air Force and
Navy, which investigates Marine Corps accidents, included all but a
few of the incidents on the databases, special codes prevented them
from appearing on records provided to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is zero intent to hide anything,'' said Brig. Gen. Gene
Martin LaCoste, commander of the Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Frank M. ``Skip'' Dirren Jr., who commands the Naval
Safety Center in Norfolk, Va., said, ``I'm not trying to hide
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Both LaCoste and Dirren said they are following rules given them
by the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting standards change drastically
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason the services don't report all accidents is
because they're not required to under Department of Defense
guidelines. In 1989, those guidelines were rewritten, making it
easier for the services to keep from official statistics the type
of accidents routinely counted by the civilian National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said they rewrote the guidelines to exclude
certain types of aviation accidents because they believed Congress
wasn't interested in knowing about all accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines increased the cost threshold for a Class A
incident from $500,000 to $1 million and increased from $100,000 to
$200,000 the threshold for a Class B incident.
</P>
<P>
   But the new guidelines left much open to interpretation by the
services.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 18, 1994, an F-16 sustained $1.8 million in damage when
its landing gear failed at Moody Air Force Base, Ga. Because the
damage was more than $1 million, it fit the category for a Class A
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Former Lt. Col. Jerry Perkins, who retired in December 1994 as
director of computer operations for the Air Force Safety Center in
New Mexico, said he originally counted the accident in the Air
Force database. He said he later was told by his supervisor that a
general wanted the accident reclassified, making it disappear from
official accident rate statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I objected to the point of being told to shut up and salute,''
Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale the Air Force used for not counting the accident
was that the bulk of damage was to an expensive piece of equipment,
called a LANTERN pod, used for night flying. Because the LANTERN
pod was not a permanent part of the plane, the Air Force believed
it didn't have to count the damage against the $1 million
threshold.
</P>
<P>
   The new directives also didn't clearly define when the services
could exclude an accident because it occurred in combat.
</P>
<P>
   During Desert Storm, the Air Force classified as combat losses
the destruction of an EF-111 and an F-16.
</P>
<P>
   Neither plane was hit by enemy fire. The EF-111 crashed after it
took evasive action while being mistakenly targeted by a U.S. Air
Force F-15, and the F-16 was destroyed when a bomb apparently
detonated prematurely, although other possible causes were not
ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force decision not to include the accident was
subsequently questioned in a special management review, and the
service has since changed its rules. In July 1994, the service
expanded its regulations, making ``friendly fire'' accidents the
same as combat losses: no longer kept in the official accident rate
reported to the public and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   `Flight-related' accidents uncounted
</P>
<P>
   One of the major categories of accidents addressed under the new
regulations was ``flight-related'' _ accidents in which the damage,
though substantial in some cases, is not considered directly
related to the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1980 and 1998, the three services identified 961
flight-related accidents that resulted in at least 26 deaths and
411 injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Each case was identified as flight-related, signaling that they
were not to be included in the so-called mishap rate, the number
frequently provided to reporters and Congress by the military.
Although the incidents were identified on computer databases, those
databases previously had never been released outside the military.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy had the most flight-related cases: 654 since 1980.
Nineteen were Class A accidents that killed 11 people and injured
13.
</P>
<P>
   On April 18, 1996, the tailhook of an F-14 landing on the USS
Nimitz caught a wire that struck and killed a sailor working on the
flight deck and injured six others. On Nov. 16, 1995, the crew
chief aboard a CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter flying a
night-vision goggle training mission in North Carolina fell out of
the aircraft and was killed, and on Aug. 9, 1992, near Reno, Nev.,
another crew chief was killed when he fell out of a helicopter on a
night-vision goggle training mission.
</P>
<P>
   All three accidents were termed flight-related and not
calculated in the statistics frequently provided to reporters and
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Army had 225 flight-related incidents, killing 10 and
injuring 87 others; most of the cases _ at least 161 of them _
occurred after the new rules took effect.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 20, 1995, one soldier was killed and 21 others injured
when they roped down from two helicopters into the wrong landing
site during a night mission in a dense Louisiana forest.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 12, 1996, two soldiers fell from an MH-60 helicopter
into the jungle in Panama, killing one and seriously injuring the
other.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 3, 1992, a civilian kayaker was killed when he fell from
an Army helicopter that was trying to hoist him from the water near
a Texas dam where he had become stranded.
</P>
<P>
   None of the accidents was counted in the Army's mishap rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force termed 82 cases flight-related, with at least 70
of them occurring since the new rules took effect. Five people were
killed and 50 injured in Air Force flight-related incidents.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 3, 1990, Army Pfc. Edward L. Suits Jr. was killed when
the right wing of a huge Air Force C-141 cargo plane hit his
parachute over North Carolina. The aircraft sustained more than
$6,000 in damage, but neither the Army nor the Air Force counted
the accident in its official mishap rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to cover it up,'' said Suits' father, Edward L.
Suits Sr. ``The worst part about it is that they wouldn't tell us
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a paratrooper. I made four trips to Vietnam. I know
about jumping, and I know they were negligent.''
</P>
<P>
   Suits said he was unaware his son's death was not counted in
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope something is done about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On March 17, 1995, Sgt. Sanya Brockinton was trying to parachute
from an Air Force C-23A cargo plane over California when he was
pulled out of the plane prematurely, hitting and damaging a
horizontal stabilizer on the aircraft as he fell. Brockinton, who
was recently married with an 8-month-old child, lost the lower part
of his right leg in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was counted as far as Air Force accidents,'' said
Brockinton, who now lives in Florida. ``If a person got hurt and
the aircraft was damaged, you think it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   NTSB attorney Matthew M. Furman said that if a civilian plane
hits a parachutist, the incident is counted in civilian accident
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Ground accidents also excluded
</P>
<P>
   The military policy adopted in 1989 also allowed the services to
exclude a larger number of accidents occurring on the ground. Prior
to 1989, any incident occurring once an aircraft started its
engines was counted in the mishap rate, but the new regulations
require the aircraft to be moving on a runway and to have an
``intent for flight.'' Helicopters have to be off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB policy is much more far-reaching, counting every
accident occurring after someone steps aboard an aircraft,
regardless of whether an engine is running.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for example, the NTSB counted as an aviation death an
incident in which a ground crew member was struck by a Delta
Airlines L-1011 that was being towed and not operating under its
own power.
</P>
<P>
   At least 42 of the Navy cases, in which nine people were killed
and 23 injured, were cases likely to be counted by the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 Navy accident classified as a ground mishap, a crew
member of an MH-53 helicopter was killed when the helicopter,
rotors still turning, began to shake violently, causing an airplane
engine to fall out of the helicopter's cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy also classified as a ground mishap the much-publicized
Sept. 6, 1996, accident in which a CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter
struck a light pole, rolled over and burned at Orlando Executive
Airport. It was the second accident in a day involving a military
helicopter assigned to support President Clinton's trip to Florida,
and the president immediately ordered a top-to-bottom review of all
aircraft assigned to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   During a press briefing the same day, a Pentagon spokesman in
Washington gave reporters the mishap rate for the type of
helicopter that burned in Orlando. That rate did not include the
very type of accident the reporters were asking about: the Sea
Knight that was destroyed after hitting the light pole.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1980 and 1998, the Army classified 269 incidents as
ground accidents, seven of them Class A accidents resulting in five
deaths. Five of the seven Class A accidents occurred since the
reporting rules were changed and in at least four of those cases,
records indicate the engines were running when the accidents
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, an Army doctor was struck by a helicopter rotor blade
and killed while the aircraft was being refueled. Though the
helicopter's rotor blades were turning, the accident was classified
as a ground accident and not counted in the mishap rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force not only excluded ground accidents from its
official accident rate but until Oct. 1 of this year also kept them
from its aviation database altogether. Prior to Oct. 1, the service
counted aviation ground accidents in a separate database along with
automobile and truck accidents.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 aviation ground accidents, each causing at least
$100,000 in damage, were reported by the Air Force between 1988 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Air Force cases excluded from its database occurred
Dec. 3, 1996, when Navy Seal Theodore M. Moreland was killed after
he was thrown from an Air Force C-17 as the door to the plane blew
open.
</P>
<P>
   Told her husband's death wasn't counted as part of the official
accident rate, Moreland's widow, Tracy, said: ``You're kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force adds the X-files
</P>
<P>
   Although the Air Force had no entries on its aviation database
specifically identified as ground accidents, it created another
classification not used by the other services: ``X's.'' Incidents
identified with an X, excluded from official statistics, totaled
1,273 and accounted for $88.5 million in damages between October
1987 _ the month the Air Force started counting X cases _ and March
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, X cases accounted for more than 10 percent of all
flight incidents in the Air Force Safety Center database. Many of
the X cases involve engine damage inflicted by so-called
foreign-object damage _ a bird or some other object being sucked
into an engine.
</P>
<P>
   D.J. Adkins, a spokeswoman with the Air Force Safety Center,
said the service created the ``X'' category because the Department
of Defense rule changes allowed some flexibility concerning
foreign-object damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no specific guidance on how to manage the change,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the X designation, the spokeswoman said, incidents
caused by foreign-object damage were calculated into the mishap
rate, the one provided to the public and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 13, 1997, a C-5 cargo plane was forced to land at Travis
Air Force Base, Calif., when one of its engines was disabled after
birds caused $1.2 million in damage. That same year, a baseball cap
and an ear protection headset were sucked into the engine of an
F-15 at Rickenbacker International Airport near Columbus, Ohio,
causing an estimated $861,460 in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases were classified as X and not calculated in official
mishap rates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the X classification, the Air Force has two
others not used by the other services: ``non-rate producing'' and
``track only.'' Both identify accidents that the Air Force
includes, or tracks, on its incident database but does not count in
its official mishap rate.
</P>
<P>
   One of the non-rate producing cases involved an experimental
YF-22 fighter that crashed April 25, 1992, at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif. The jet belonged to a command headquartered at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, and because the
jet was experimental, the Air Force didn't count the accident in
its rate.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the track-only cases involved foreign aircraft or ones
from other services, but 12 were Air Force aircraft. Eleven of
those 12 cases were major accidents that resulted in the deaths of
eight people, injuries to six others and damage totaling $129
million.
</P>
<P>
   At least five of the 12 were linked to commands headquartered at
Wright-Patterson. In one of those cases, an F-4 fighter crashed
near Las Vegas on May 14, 1993, killing two civilian test pilots
and causing at least $2.4 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   The fighter, which belonged to the Air Force Material Command at
Wright-Pat, was on loan to a civilian company conducting tests for
the military. The Air Force conducted an extensive investigation
into the accident but didn't count it; neither did the civilian
NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it wasn't counted as a Class A mishap,'' said
Dave Levingston, spokesman for the Air Force Material Command at
Wright Patterson. ``That's interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Helps to keep repair costs low
</P>
<P>
   Accidents can also be excluded from official counts by simply
keeping the cost estimate low. Accidents that do not result in a
death, a permanent total disability or the destruction of an
aircraft must generate at least $1 million in damages to be counted
as a Class A accident or at least $200,000 to be counted as a Class
B accident _ the two classes of accidents most closely monitored by
the services.
</P>
<P>
   On July 16, 1994, a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter crash-landed in a
cotton field near Tifton, Ga., at 60-80 mph, sending the main rotor
blade slicing through the tail section, which severed from the
aircraft along with a maze of hydraulic lines, controls and wires.
The damage was listed at $998,981, avoiding a Class A by $1,019.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know from experience that they work as hard as they can to
get the cost of accidents down,'' said Don Delk, who retired
recently after 22 years as a maintenance officer at Elmendorf Air
Force Base, Alaska. ``The safety people are more concerned with
downgrading accidents than safety.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 19, 1990, an Elmendorf F-15 was accidentally hit by an
AIM-9M missile fired from another Air Force jet, causing extensive
damage to the tail section and moderate damage to the left wing and
engine exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Lt. Col. Jimmy L. Harris, said he was sure the
accident was going to be counted as a Class A. He was almost right.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of repairing the aircraft was fixed at $992,058, or
$7,942 short of being a Class A.
</P>
<P>
   Delk said the accident easily could have been estimated at more
than $1 million had the cost of the replacement tail been included,
but the Air Force didn't charge itself for the tail because it came
from another F-15 that had crashed earlier on a nearby
mountainside.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know they tend to write things off when they're
in-house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Francis C. Gideon Jr., commander of the Air Force
Safety Center at Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M., said he could not
determine if the service calculated the cost of the F-15 tail in
the repair cost.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 20, 1989, less than three months after the Navy
implemented the new $1 million threshold for Class A accidents, a
Navy TA-4 collided with a civilian plane in Pensacola, Fla.,
resulting in what the Navy estimated as $985,090 in damages, or
$14,910 short of the threshold.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Lt. Michael G. Brooks was flying an SH-2F
helicopter when both engines failed and he was forced to crash land
in the salt water of the James River, near Newport News, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sat in the water for a couple of days,'' said Brooks, who
now commands a Navy helicopter squadron in Florida. ``That's the
biggest thing: the salt water damage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy called the crash a Class A accident, but later
downgraded it by lowering the repair cost to $995,271, or $4,729
from the threshold for a Class A accident.
</P>
<P>
   But the repairs apparently were never made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they made a decision not to rebuild it,'' Brooks
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Dirren, commander of the Naval Safety Center,
acknowledged that the helicopter likely never flew again. Although
regulations require that accidents in which an aircraft is
destroyed be classified as a Class A, he said, those rules don't
apply if the service simply decides it is not cost-effective to
make extensive repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Labor often represents a significant portion of repair costs,
and the military keeps repair costs low by calculating labor at $16
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   John Lewis, technical expert for the Professional Aviation
Maintenance Association, said repair costs for civilian planes
range from $45 an hour for small, private planes to $2,000 an hour
for large commercial airliners.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right. The direct cost would seem to be more than $16
an hour,'' said Cmdr. Brooks, who recently completed a Navy course
on accident investigations. ``When you're figuring repair cost of
an investigation, they told us it's $16 an hour. It's still $16 an
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Hardin of Tulsa, Okla., said his company charges about $64
an hour to repair corporate jets.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could repair jets for $16 an hour, he said: ``No
way. The mechanic gets paid that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Military jets ``are at least as sophisticated as the civilian
jets are, and in most cases, more complex than the civilian jets
are,'' Hardin said.
</P>
<P>
   The $16 rate has been used at least since the new Department of
Defense regulations took effect in 1989. All three services use the
rate, but Army officials insist they use the $16 rate less than
half the time, only when actual costs cannot be determined.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, 1994, a Marine Corps HH-46D helicopter sustained
extensive damage when it crashed into a swamp on private property
in North Carolina. The Navy estimated the damage at $933,714, or
$66,286 from the threshold for a Class A accident.
</P>
<P>
   That estimate was based on 9,118 hours of labor at $16 an hour.
Raising the labor cost to $25 an hour would have put the total
repair cost at more than $1 million, the threshold for a Class A
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Dirren did not defend the $16-an-hour rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're paying more for your car (repairs). I'll tell you
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some accidents never counted
</P>
<P>
   A number of accidents are not on any of the services' databases,
and there is no way to find all the uncounted accidents because the
NTSB didn't put them on its database either.
</P>
<P>
   Army and Navy officials said they counted incidents involving
aircraft on classified missions. Maj. Gen. Gideon said the Air
Force does not, but he added that there have been only two such
uncounted incidents during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six people died and at least $16 million worth of
aircraft were lost on April 14, 1994, when two Air Force F-15 jets
accidentally shot down two Army UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters over a
no-fly zone in Iraq. The tragedy made headlines worldwide, but it
did not appear on either the Army or the Air Force's records.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an Army aviation accident,'' the Army Safety
Center wrote in a written response to the Dayton Daily News. ``It
was a friendly fire incident in which Air Force assets mistakenly
fired upon the Army aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Army counted the accident and the 26 deaths, it would
have more than doubled the death toll that year, which was 16.
</P>
<P>
   On May 9, 1996, a CH-53 helicopter earmarked for the White House
fleet crashed in Connecticut, killing four civilian workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy had already paid Sikorsky Aircraft for the helicopter.
The Navy investigated the crash. The helicopter is primary used by
the military. But the accident wasn't counted as a military
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was still being tested, and it crashed at their site,''
said Lt. Tom Dorwin of the Naval Safety Center in Norfolk, Va. ``It
is not a naval aircraft until it has undergone tests.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't a civilian accident either. The NTSB didn't count
it in its database.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the Navy investigated the accident at all instead of
turning it over to NTSB, Dorwin said: ``The government sustained a
loss.''

BIOGRAPHER OF TEXAS GOVERNOR SEES MAN NOT GIVEN TO WORK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  ``FIRST SON: George W. Bush and the Bush Family Dynasty''; By Bill
Minutaglio; Times Books, $25. 
 
By WENDY BENJAMINSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This unauthorized biography could easily be retitled ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporter-author Bill Minutaglio paints a portrait of a man who
has floated through life having a grand old time, bred to believe
in a basic decency, in being a ``Good Man'' _ as long as that
decency did not require too much stridency or detail work.
</P>
<P>
   The George W. Bush portrayed here is part Ronald Reagan, part
Barbara Bush. He is charming, gregarious, uninterested in brainy
matters or public policy details. And like his mother, he has a
wickedly sharp wit and a sharper loyalty streak that places in the
enemy camp those who dare criticize the Family.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's sunny sail to front-runner status in the 2000 Republican
presidential primary was not only aided but perhaps caused by his
family _ who have now for three generations followed almost
identical paths through Ivy League educations, business success and
political careers conservative in both policy and tenor.
</P>
<P>
   One of the rare ways that Bush seems like the rest of the baby
boom generation is that he took a stab, however shallow, at
breaking the pattern. He expressed an interest in attending the
University of Texas; he became engaged to, but then broke up with,
a young woman with society connections; he drank heavily for a time
and caused at least one embarrassing public scene.
</P>
<P>
   But like so many men, Bush wittingly or not returned to his
father's path, which was also his grandfather's path.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who tuned in to the Bush family with the George
Bush presidency, the reach of the clan is astounding. Their blood _
they're related to the British royals _ runs blue through industry,
Wall Street and politics.
</P>
<P>
   George W.'s great-grandfather, Samuel P., was a steel and
railroad industrialist who led the National Association of
Manufacturers and helped found the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as well
as direct the Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland before becoming a
close economic adviser to Herbert Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   His progeny was Prescott, who returned from World War I to Wall
Street, the U.S. Senate and the boards of Pan American Airways,
Prudential Insurance and CBS. Mrs. Prescott Bush was Dorothy
Walker, whose family founded Wall Street's oldest and largest
private investment house and began the family's sports interest,
creating Madison Square Garden, the Belmont Race Track and the New
York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   That was a lot of baggage for little George to carry to public
school in Midland, Texas, in the 1950s. Minutaglio suggests that
the load, as well as fear of his father's disappointment, helped
create the competitive edginess that separates George W. from his
much younger, lower-profile siblings.
</P>
<P>
   In a breezy, often hilarious style, Minutaglio _ a reporter for
the Dallas Morning News _ interviewed friends, neighbors,
co-workers and relatives and scanned records to capture Bush's life
in a work that is painstakingly annotated and a fine piece of
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The book will be a dog-eared reference work for politicos and
journalists and anyone who wants to study the low-key, discreet
Republican version of an American political dynasty. Minutaglio
captures the Machiavellian maneuvers of Washington political aides
and the wacky, often hardball antics of Texas politics with dead-on
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The average reader, however, might want to skim over the
detailed reporting of an entire life that while famous and
privileged is simply not that interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose campaign has diminished Minutaglio's work by
privately calling it ``an elaborate clip job,'' hates the kind of
``psychobabble'' his friends, family and strangers have used to try
to define him and his family, and will likely find the book
distastefully psychological. Minutaglio reports that Bush has spent
his life avoiding introspection and even deep study.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush was provided an education at Houston's Kinkaid
School, Phillips Andover Academy, Yale University and the Harvard
Business School, the academics were largely lost on the future
governor. He managed to pull ``C'' grades but focused on being a
cheerleader, a fraternity brother and the third generation of
Bushes to belong to Yale's secret Skull &AMP; Bones Society.
</P>
<P>
   Debate about the Vietnam War raged while he was at Yale, but
Bush did not join in. The war, and the civil rights movement, Bush
apparently found unpleasant and a distraction from his quest to
figure out which girl's college was having a mixer that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Bush followed the family path back to Texas, where he could be
free, he said, of East Coast 1960s angst and where he could drink
beer, make money and become the purely political animal he has
grown to be.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Bush cannot be bothered with the details of
public policy, the nuances of issues that so delight Bill Clinton
and Al Gore. But Bush developed _ after a disastrous congressional
race in 1978 _ an impeccable sense of political timing that led him
to become one of his father's closest advisers and loyalty
enforcers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also was tapped to be his father's liaison to the religious
right, the very group with whom he is having such delicate trouble
now that he is running for president as a moderate.
</P>
<P>
   But it was while in his father's campaign that he met and bonded
with Lee Atwater, the late political operative who was cool long
before it was chic for political consultants to be cool.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also became friends with Karl Rove, the Svengali consultant
who Minutaglio reports used to teach dirty tricks to college
Republicans and who provided Bush with the underpinnings of his
newly developed political philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttling back and forth between Texas and Washington, D.C.,
Bush did the business phase of a Bush man's life, raising money and
selling people on the oil business and on baseball teams. Again,
Bush didn't delve into the details, but because of his charm and
connections he was always the front man, always the one making the
deal, whatever the fine points were.
</P>
<P>
   Bush waited out his father's presidency, was loyal and loving in
his father's painful defeat and immediately began plotting his
opportunity to enter the politics phase.
</P>
<P>
   It's apparent Bush didn't run for governor because of any
compelling issue but because it seemed the next logical step. In
fact, Bush says his wife, Laura, questioned him about why he was
running; it wasn't clear even to her.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, it was only too delicious to take on Ann Richards, the
New Texas icon who had made a minicareer of turning the Bush family
into elitist laughingstocks.
</P>
<P>
   Well into the first phase of his campaign, organizing and
raising money, Bush came up with his core issues _ tort reform,
welfare reform, juvenile justice and education _ and vowed not to
be moved ``off message'' by Richards' withering wit.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't, of course. Richards came off as snide and
disorganized and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because it is such recent history or perhaps because a
Texas governor has so little true power, Minutaglio skims over
Bush's governorship, leaving non-Texas readers too much in the dark
on his governing style.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's re-election victory _ a double joy for the family because
this time cerebral, calm brother Jeb also won the governorship of
Florida _ was as much a prelude to a presidential campaign as it
was a midpoint in his state political career.
</P>
<P>
   And with the attitude of the man known as the Bombastic Bushkin,
the son and grandson of titans spoke of seeking even higher office:
``People who like me will like me, people who don't like me just
won't like me. How's that for profundity?''

GRAY STICKS TO HIS GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a day when Jerry Falwell welcomed gay men and lesbians into
his church, NBC's Jim Gray refused to treat Pete Rose as a fellow
human being.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview carried live before Game 2 of the World Series
Sunday night, Gray was persistent and relentless, smiling while
refusing to allow Rose an inch with his decade-old denial of
gambling on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Gray was unapologetic Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no agenda,'' he said in a teleconference. ``My intent
was not to be belligerent or antagonistic. My intent was to give
him an opportunity. I gave him that chance on a silver platter
about three or four times. Pete was the one who started to ask me
questions. Had I let that go, all of you would have had me on for
another reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray is right about that. Some of the same people who are
blasting him for asking tough questions are the same ones who blast
sideline reporters for asking ``soft'' questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand by it,'' Gray said. ``It was an absolute proper line
of questioning. I felt that I did my job and I did it well. Pete
had the opportunity to open the door to get reinstated to the Hall
of Fame or at least start a dialogue with Major League Baseball.
But the way he is going about it hasn't gotten him any closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete ruined his own evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but who made NBC an official arm of Major League
Baseball or Gray its enforcer?
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows about the allegations against Rose. Everybody
also knows that he never has admitted betting on baseball. What we
don't know is how Rose felt _ yes, felt _ about the ovation he
received during the introduction of Major League Baseball's
All-Century team. That was the reason he was in Atlanta. That was
the reason Rose entertained questions from reporters before the
on-field introductions. If ever there was a time for a sideline
reporter to ask how an athlete felt, that was it. But Gray ignored
the overwhelmingly positive response from the fans.
</P>
<P>
   The combative interview prompted an outpouring of outrage from
viewers, talk-show hosts, sports media critics, and several New
York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 4's Bob Lobel probably had the right take on Gray: ``The
media can make villains out of heroes and heroes out of villains.''
</P>
<P>
   His complaint was not with the line of questioning but with the
timing. Rose's election to the All-Century team resulted in his
first appearance on a major league diamond since his banishment 10
years ago. He received the loudest and longest ovation, surpassing
even Atlanta's own Hank Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Gray used his 90 seconds to get right to the heart of the
matter, an approach Rose likened to a ``prosecutor's brief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete, let me ask you now,'' Gray started. ``It seems as though
that there is an opening. The American public is very forgiving.
Are you willing to show contrition, admit that you bet on baseball,
and make some sort of apology to that effect?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, Jim, not at all,'' Rose said. ``I'm not going to admit
to something that didn't happen. I know you get tired of hearing me
say that, but I appreciate the ovation. I appreciate the fans
voting me on that All-Century team. I'm just a small part of a big
deal tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray followed up, and clearly didn't like Rose's response.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the overwhelming evidence that is in that report, why not
make that step with this opening?'' Gray asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rose quickly interjected, ``It's too much of a festive night to
worry about that. I don't know what evidence you are talking about.
I mean, show it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose issued the challenge and Gray fell for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well the Dowd report says . . . but we don't want to debate
that, Pete,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, why not?'' Rose asked. ``Why do we want to believe
everything he says?''
</P>
<P>
   The New York media were quick in their condemnation. Phil
Mushnick of  York Post blasted Gray for being ``excessively
confrontational.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray jumped him,'' Mushnick wrote. ``And he jumped him in such
a fashion as to appear more interested in promoting Jim Gray, star
reporter, than interviewing Pete Rose on the occasion of his
one-night-only return to baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times's Richard Sandomir was equally blunt. Gray
``trampled the line of civility in his interview,'' Sandomir wrote.
His ``cannonade of questioning . . . sounded like a grand jury
criminal proceeding, not a pre-game show.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Daily News's Bob Raissman also weighed in: ``Did
Gray _ and NBC Sports _ think getting Rose to issue a mea culpa was
worth tarnishing one of the most moving moments in baseball
history? The result was an embarrassing exercise in excess. Gray
came off as a guy who was looking to enhance his own reputation as
an interrogator, rather than an interviewer with any sense of
fairness or appreciation for the circumstances surrounding the
interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the reviews were negative. CNN-SI managing editor Steve
Robinson applauded Gray, saying, ``I think he did what a
responsible, aggressive journalist would do. It seemed to me that
it was a proper occasion, given that it was the first time in 10
years that Rose officially participated in a MLB event.''

SOCIAL SECURITY IS KEY FOR DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's one key issue that the Democrats have on their side
in their quest to regain control of Congress in the 2000 election,
it's Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   With this issue, of course, goes millions of older voters who
receive, or are close to receiving, this benefit. And on the other
side of this issue is the GOP members of Congress who are pushing
for a major tax cut for the wealthy, who are not in an dire need
for this benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans no doubt are aware of the political fix they got
themselves into by pushing for a big tax cut that President Clinton
warned would severely impact Social Security benefits in the
future. Clinton and other Democrats have suggested that Social
Security fund will go broke in 2034 unless important steps are
taken to prevent it. Clinton's proposal - using the budget surplus
to shore up Social Security _ would extend its life to 2050.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office projects that the total federal
budget surplus over the next 10 years will be $2.9 trillion, of
which $1.9 trillion is generated by payroll tax revenues earmarked
for Social Security. The remaining $1 trillion, which represents
the surplus generated by general tax revenues, is the focus of the
Social Security vs. tax cut fight between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have suggested benefit reductions to keep Social
Security going, which did not resonate well with Democrats or
senior citizens, who vote in high numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps realizing that the White House has the upper hand on the
Social Security issue the Republicans last week called for a
scaled-back version of their earlier tax cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton last month vetoed the GOP-sponsored $792
billion tax cut that was passed by Congress, largely on a
party-line vote. Now the Republican-led Congress is pushing for a
milder, 1.4 percent tax cut across the board. With the White House
rejecting the new tax cut proposal as a ``bad idea'' because, as
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said,``it abdicates
legislators' and the president's responsibility to make choices, to
set priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House is also saying that the GOP's new tax cut
proposal does not include Congress's own 3.4 pay increase. That
drew legitimate criticism from some Republicans as well as
Democrats. And the new proposal still amounts to a huge tax cut
that would still adversely impact Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, knowing that they are looking bad on this and other issues
that could cost them control of Congress next year, the Republicans
have been conducting an advertising campaign designed to make the
Democrats look even worse on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The month-long campaign, at a cost of $445,000 by the National
Republican Congressional Committee, portrays the Democrats as
raiders of the Social Security surplus. And a GOP news release last
week suggested that the Clinton administration has been treating
Social Security like a credit card. ''
</P>
<P>
   But as House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) pointed
out in a Washington Post interview, ``It's kind of ironic that they
have picked this issue to try to demagogue on, because this is the
party that fought the creation of Social Security and Medicaire.
These folks wanted to get rid of these programs since they began,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the electorate know that there are no Democratic
``raids'' on Social Security, and the Clinton administration has
made that clear. To pay for other federal programs, the
administration has proposed a higher tobacco tax to pay for these
programs while protecting the budget surplus which Clinton wants to
use primarily to keep Social Security solvent.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration earlier removed one problem that both
Democrats and Republicans had with the President's overall proposal
to keep Social Security solvent - investing Social Security funds
in the stock market. With that removed, Clinton's proposal to save
Social Security has much more support than the GOP's plan of having
workers to divert a portion of their payroll taxes into individual
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Both the president and congessional Democrats rightfully argue
that such accounts are too risky, an alternative that could
adversely impact the health of the Social Security system. In
essence, the GOP does not appear to want to save Social Security as
much as they want to replace it with something less.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, most of the electorate knows that Social Security, which

hands with Democrats than with the GOP. Republicans might consider
finding a way to basically support the Clinton plan on Social
Security without looking like losers. Unfortunately for them, they
may already have lost that battle.

LOSS OF CABIN PRESSURE MAY HAVE DOOMED STEWART JET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a scary way to die: You are relaxing aboard an aircraft,
miles above Earth, when suddenly you feel a cold wind and start
gasping for breath, blood trickles from your nose, and debris
begins hurtling past your head.
</P>
<P>
   That is what can happen if a plane loses cabin pressure, or
internal air.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case consequences of depressurization were reportedly
illustrated Monday, when it apparently occurred on a Lear 35 jet
carrying golfer Payne Stewart and five other people. If that is the
case, all passengers most likely lost consciousness. Autopsies will
tell whether they died before the crash or from the impact.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Francis, vice chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, said that a sudden decompression of the aircraft was
just one possible theory of the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   But Jonathan Lee, who flies Learjets for SP Aviation Inc. of
Hayward, Calif., said reports indicate that sudden cabin
depressurization led to the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who is not involved with the investigation of the accident,
cited two indirect clues of depressurization: nobody at the
controls and the frost reportedly seen on the aircraft windows. The
frost would form as the air rushed out and the temperature within
plunged, causing water vapor to condense, then crystallize, on the
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably, the plane could have suffered ``explosive
decompression,'' in which air suddenly rushed out, Lee said. He
compared this to being inside a balloon when it bursts: ``All the
stuff comes out, oxygen in your body, (and) crap in the airplane
will come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The air pressure drops so low that suffocation is almost
instantaneous. ``You can't breathe on top of Mount Everest _ and
they were 10,000 feet higher than Mount Everest,'' Lee said. ``They
might not have had any time to react to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the human body has limited ability to function above
10,000 feet, airplane designers compensate by pressurizing the
cabin area. Air enters the engines from outside, and some of it is
drawn off, heated, compressed and fed into the cabin. Valves at the
back of the aircraft open and close to maintain a consistent
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the atmosphere inside a plane never feels any higher
than 8,000 feet, despite the actual height of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   If a plane loses pressure, a warning light goes on in the
cockpit, and oxygen masks drop from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   In aviation circles, there is a term known as ``time of useful
consciousness.'' It is the measure of the time the body can cope
without oxygen, and it diminishes almost quickly with altitude.
</P>
<P>
   At 20,000 feet, the time is 10 minutes. At 26,000 feet, it is
two minutes. At 30,000 feet, it is 30 seconds. At 40,000 feet, it
is 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The plane carrying Stewart was fluctuating between 22,000 and
51,000 feet before it crashed into a field in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Learjets carry the emergency oxygen masks, said Warren
Morningstar, a vice president at the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association in Frederick, Md. ``They're supposed to be able to get
those masks on in less than five seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Clues about what actually happened inside the Learjet carrying
Stewart and the others might come from recovery of the jet's voice
recorder and a device that records its altitude, attitude and
instrument positions, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a long time to find out why the jet crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, it takes the NTSB six months to a year to investigate
such cases and discover their causes, Morningstar said.

 &HT;    PENTAGON BUYS EQUIPMENT WITH ONE HAND, DISPOSES OF IDENTICAL
ITEMS WITH OTHER HAND
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. military keeps such poor track of
inventory that one branch can buy equipment, such as radar or
engine parts, even as another branch discards identical items as
surplus, federal auditors said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than two decades after this problem was first exposed by
the Defense Department itself, the Pentagon has yet to reform the
way it manages $4 billion in spare parts used by more than one
service, the U.S. General Accounting Office said in a report to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, personnel in the Air Force are often in the dark
about what's available in the warehouses of the Army or Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing the problem would bring ``considerable savings,'' said
the GAO.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the latest of dozens of audits panning the
handling of inventory used by more than one branch of the armed
services. Earlier this year, the Defense Department's inspector
general reported that the military had ``inappropriately disposed
of $3.5 million of assets without proper authorization'' and
``retained $1.5 million of excess assets that could have been used
by another Service.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 57,000 items are used in common by the various armed
services, but the federal audit said that frequently the personnel
in one branch have no idea what another branch has on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers Tuesday criticized the Defense Department for failing
to fix the problem of coordinating equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not rocket science,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.
``It makes no sense for the Army to be purchasing parts for an
airplane if the Navy has a surplus of those parts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department offered little hope for fixing the
problem. Roger W. Kallock, deputy undersecretary for logistics,
responding to the GAO audit, said that it is ``rarely feasible'' to
assign a single official to oversee inventory for all the branches.
He argued that the department has improved information sharing.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added that ``further improvements'' would have to
await a total overhaul of the Defense Department's entire computer
system.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment was disputed by James Murphy, one of the authors
of the GAO report.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they have to do is use a fax or telephone call to find out
if another service had the stock on hand,'' said Murphy, whose
agency serves as a bipartisan investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's long-standing inventory problems have irked some
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the cuts being forced on other government programs, this
continued waste is unconscionable,'' said Rep. Peter DeFazio,
D-Ore.

TOURETTE'S HERO: SYNDROME TURNS ASSET IN FINELY CRAFTED NOVEL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (``Motherless Brooklyn''; By Jonathan Lethem; Doubleday, $23.95.) 
 
By MIKE SNYDER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writing a novel is challenging enough. Why, then, would any sane
novelist saddle himself with the complications inherent in a
character _ the protagonist and point-of-view character, no less _
who suffers from an obscure medical condition that causes
involuntary outbursts of bizarre invective? Wouldn't the
descriptions of such behavior disrupt the narrative with irritating
distractions?
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends, of course, on the skill and audacity of the
author. In an astounding display of literary craftsmanship,
Jonathan Lethem has turned Lionel Essrog's Tourette's syndrome into
an asset. In the process he has created a marvelous novel.
</P>
<P>
   The streams of non sequiturs uttered by Lionel throughout
``Motherless Brooklyn'' are chosen and arranged with such care that
they enrich the story rather than detracting from it. These verbal
``tics,'' as Lionel calls them, play an integral role in the
development of this endearing and memorable character.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`EXCUSEBALONEY!' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychicwarlock!'' Lionel screams after hearing a friend's
conversational reference to a psychic hotline operated by pop
singer Dionne Warwick. In response to the question, ``Are you
accusing Tony?'' he shouts, ``Accusatony! Excusebaloney!
Funnymonopoly!''
</P>
<P>
   Lionel is the supreme achievement of this novel, a character so
resonant that elements like plot and theme fade into the
background. In the course of the story it becomes clear that his
strange affliction masks a keen mind, a stout heart and a survival
instinct honed to a fine edge on the Brooklyn streets roamed by
Lionel and his odd assortment of friends and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager in 1979, Lionel was one of four wayward or
orphaned young men plucked from St. Vincent's Home for Boys in
Brooklyn by Frank Minna, 25, who needed some help running errands
for a pair of aging mobsters who employed him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SHADY DOINGS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lionel and his friends, Tony, Gilbert and Danny, happily
accompanied Minna on forays that usually involved loading
merchandise into his battered van and unloading it into a
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   This group evolved into the ``Minna Men,'' who operated what was
ostensibly a car service _ part of the endless variety of public
transportation options in New York _ but was in fact a ``detective
agency'' whose ``cases'' amounted to errands for the aforementioned
mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   The whole enterprise was wrapped in multiple layers of deception
and denial, but the boys _ Lionel particularly _ developed a fierce
loyalty to Minna that overcame any qualms they might have had.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LIONEL THE INVESTIGATOR &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These developments are rendered in flashback after the novel's
opening scene, in which Frank Minna is murdered. Lionel,
discovering reserves of self-confidence and authority he didn't
know he possessed, sets out on the first real ``investigation'' of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   His inquiries take him from Zen meditation sessions in a
Manhattan town house to a lunch of sea-urchin eggs in a restaurant
on the coast of Maine. He copes with danger, hostility and
intrigue. He even, briefly, finds love.
</P>
<P>
   The manifestations of Lionel's Tourette's syndrome accompany him
throughout these adventures, of course, and the varied reactions to
his behavior are most entertaining. A homicide detective
investigating Minna's murder is baffled and irritated; a young
woman named Kimmery doesn't seem to mind the outbursts at all.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MRS. MINNA'S KITCHEN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the book's finest scenes takes place in the apartment
kitchen of Minna's mother. Mrs. Minna was a wonderful Italian cook
and made her living by selling her culinary wares, take-out
fashion, from her home. Lethem, in one of many displays of his gift
for description, writes:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She truly worked an old stove, too, a tiny enamel four-burner
which was crusted with ancient sauces and on which three or four
pots invariably bubbled. The oven of this Herculean appliance was
never cool; the whole kitchen glowed with heat like a kiln. Mrs.
Minna herself seemed to have been baked, her whole face dark and
furrowed like the edges of an overdone calzone. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Writing like this keeps the narrative flowing despite a rather
labyrinthine plot. The events and characters were so difficult to
keep straight, in fact, that it was a relief to find a scene at the
end of the book in which Lionel explains everything that happened
before, what it all meant and who had done what to whom. This is
closer to a TV drama device than to the literary ideal, but
``Motherless Brooklyn'' is replete with virtues that make it easy
to overlook this little transgression.

   Differences make a good story.

George's mother wants George to bark. He is, after all, a dog. But
George meows or quacks or moos. George does not bark.

</P>
<P>
   For the May parade Stella's girl classmates will be tulips.
Stella asks her aunt to sew the most beautiful tulip, ``el tulipan

</P>
<P>
   A young girl and her mother live in a war-torn city, probably in
Eastern Europe. Hope dwindles as people leave, food and heat
supplies evaporate and bombs keep destroying what is left. One day
a shell destroys the relief truck. The weekly supply line was one
of the times when the community gathered outside together. Now that
touch of togetherness is gone, too.

<P>
   Mr. O, a concert musician who worked on his music despite the
distraction of children and war, takes his cello to the deserted
street, sits down and starts to play. He becomes hope, even when a
rocket destroys his cello.

<P>
   The girl, once fearful and teasing of the unusual, unfriendly
Mr. O, tells him how much she appreciated his music and his
courage.
</P>
<P>
   These two very different people draw strength from each other in
a harsh time. Courage can sustain the soul, the girl learns. But
more important, she understands that ``you can't tell a book by its
cover.'' Mr. O is an unlikely hero.

story, set at the turn of the century in Russia, kindness and honor
come from an unlikely place _ a poor, forgetful peddler named
Shimon. The children call him Shnook because he seems a simpleton.
</P>
<P>
   During each of Shimon's visits to a young boy's house, Mama has
only one ruble to spend. When she chooses matches, writing paper
and Sabbos candles and asks how much, ``the magic was that the
peddler always said, `One ruble.'''
</P>
<P>
   One day the peddler drops a dreidel under a chair. The boy sees
it and keeps it. Later, realizing he has turned thief, the boy
searches for the peddler to confess and return the dreidel.
</P>
<P>
   The result surprises the boy. The peddler may be different from
others the boy knows, but those differences make him see himself

   In ``A Boy Named Giotto'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $17), Giotto

On the hillside, he can't keep his mind on the sheep. He wants to
paint.
</P>
<P>
   No, his father tells him, you are a shepherd. But a famous
artist suspects talent in the boy and offers him an apprenticeship.
Giotto becomes the pre-Renaissance master whose frescoes decorate
the Church of St. Francis in Assisi and the Scrovegni Chapel in
Padua.
</P>
<P>
   The book is beautifully made, with illustrations in browns and
golds befitting a story about a great painter. Jonathan Galassi
translated the book from Italian.

 A NEW PICTURE OF THE BIBLE: Barry Moser's illustrated edition  puts
modern faces in ancient settings  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle news file)  
 By JESSE HAMLIN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the Bible according to Barry Moser, nobody
wears halos or is bathed in shafts of celestial light.
</P>
<P>
   His potent engravings portray biblical characters _ prophets and
kings, mothers and whores _ as real people whose suffering,
sexuality and cruelty are not unlike our own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to strip away the piety of Sunday school
illustrations, where these guys look like they send their robes out
to be dry-cleaned and always look gentile,'' says Moser, a
prominent book designer and illustrator who created the acclaimed
new Pennyroyal Caxton Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted them to look like somebody you know. Ordinary people
who have flaws and warts.''
</P>
<P>
   Moser's monumental project was published this month in three
versions. Four hundred copies of a deluxe two-volume edition,
printed on molded paper made by a 400-year-old German firm, sell
for $10,000. About 100 have already been sold. The edition was put
out by Moser's Pennyroyal Press with Caxton, the investment
management firm of his financial angel, Bruce Kovner.
</P>
<P>
   So were the 50 copies of a super-deluxe $30,000 edition. They
were printed on handmade American paper, bound in five volumes and
include a complete set of signed prints, original drawings and
other mementos. Viking has published a handsome $65 trade edition
in one volume.
</P>
<P>
   Several other biblical projects are in the works as the
millennium draws near, including a lectern-size unillustrated
edition of the Bible being created by noted San Francisco printer
Andrew Hoyem's Arion Press. But Moser's is the only 20th century
edition of both Old and New Testaments with original illustrations
by a single artist.
</P>
<P>
   Taking on a sacred text that's also a ``linguistic monument,''
as Moser calls the King James version he worked with, ``is an
awe-striking undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Moser, 59, a sturdy, good-humored guy with a trim white beard,
is a onetime teenage Tennessee preacher who quit organized religion
40 years ago but remains a passionate Bible reader.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Gutenberg on, the great masterpieces of printing have
been Bibles,'' says Moser, who was in town Monday promoting the
book. He was its designer, typographer and illustrator.
</P>
<P>
   He spent four years on the project, which occupied his waking
and sleeping hours. He dreamed of conversing with Mary and St.
Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Moser's engravings are direct and sometimes harrowing. His
characters seem both ancient and modern, contemporary faces in
biblical-looking garb. His Bathsheba and Daughter of Babylon exude
sexuality; he shows Jesus on the cross at Golgotha surrounded by
mocking men (one based on a photo of a Chernobyl survivor), dogs,
crows and skulls.
</P>
<P>
   The crucifixion was the first image Moser engraved for the
edition. It was the hardest because it has been pictured so often,
he says. ``I felt I had to get down and dirty with it, with the
people who were there that day, with the screams, with the feral
dogs licking up the blood. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``What I tried to do is create contemporary images that seem
like they come out of another time,'' says Moser, admired for such
works as his illustrations for Arion Press' ``Moby-Dick'' and the
prize-winning Pennyroyal edition of ``Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   To get that contemporary quality, Moser based many of his images
on live models and photographs. His Jesus was based on an Amherst
chef named Lewis Silver. His Mary was a waitress.
</P>
<P>
   He modeled Job on South African playwright Athol Fugard, who was
teaching at Princeton in 1995, when Moser was also on the faculty.
Fugard's strong face made him think of Job. He photographed Fugard
and ``cloned his face on top of the figure of a man I hired. He
didn't run around his classroom naked with boils all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Some haunting images were inspired by photographs. The starving
mother and child who illustrate a line from Deuteronomy, ``The poor
shall never cease out of the land,'' was based on an 1876
photograph of Indian famine victims.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs give him a sense of being a witness. He could
invent a starving child, he says, but it wouldn't have the same gut
impact. Some readers may recognize the image olying dead:
It's based on a famous photograph of a man lying atop a cord of
corpses at the Buchenwald death camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a dead Jew,'' Moser says. ``I used it because it seemed a
metaphor for Abel, the first fratricide. I see the Holocaust as an
enormous fratricide. We are all brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees his work as one man's response to the Bible, the
response of a man who has been attentive to his own times. ``In my
lifetime I have seen the atomic bomb, the Holocaust. We've seen the
slaughter of innocents in Bosnia. All of this has informed my
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Moser made 234 etchings to illustrate about about 1,000 pages.
He stayed away from the standard images _ there's no Moses and the
burning bush _ and brought out some minor characters whose stories
spoke to him. Many, particularly women such as Moses' Ethiopian
wife and Rahab the Harlot from the book of Joshua, have rarely been
pictured before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women take a bigger part in the Bible than most of them
ol'-time patriarchal governors of the Bible would have us think,''
Moser says. ``I chose to emphasize women where I could without
denigrating the rest of the text.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager in his native Tennessee, Moser thought he'd been
saved by God when a hunter's bullet sailed between his elbow and
chest. He became a Methodist pastor. But he lost faith in the
congregation when it shunned a pregnant girl. He left the South in
the mid-'60s to study printmaking at the University of
Massachusetts and remained in the state as a ``born-again Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people might be drawn to the Bible as the millennium nears
because of its apocalyptic overtones, he says, but ``the Bible is
no more or no less valuable than it was 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells stories about ordinary human beings who are put in
extraordinary situations and who each confront on his own basis
God, or the idea of God, or life itself.''

 A NEW PICTURE OF THE BIBLE: Barry Moser's illustrated edition  puts
modern faces in ancient settings  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``e'' entertainment news 
 file)  
 By JESSE HAMLIN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the Bible according to Barry Moser, nobody
wears halos or is bathed in shafts of celestial light.
</P>
<P>
   His potent engravings portray biblical characters _ prophets and
kings, mothers and whores _ as real people whose suffering,
sexuality and cruelty are not unlike our own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to strip away the piety of Sunday school
illustrations, where these guys look like they send their robes out
to be dry-cleaned and always look gentile,'' says Moser, a
prominent book designer and illustrator who created the acclaimed
new Pennyroyal Caxton Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted them to look like somebody you know. Ordinary people
who have flaws and warts.''
</P>
<P>
   Moser's monumental project was published this month in three
versions. Four hundred copies of a deluxe two-volume edition,
printed on molded paper made by a 400-year-old German firm, sell
for $10,000. About 100 have already been sold. The edition was put
out by Moser's Pennyroyal Press with Caxton, the investment
management firm of his financial angel, Bruce Kovner.
</P>
<P>
   So were the 50 copies of a super-deluxe $30,000 edition. They
were printed on handmade American paper, bound in five volumes and
include a complete set of signed prints, original drawings and
other mementos. Viking has published a handsome $65 trade edition
in one volume.
</P>
<P>
   Several other biblical projects are in the works as the
millennium draws near, including a lectern-size unillustrated
edition of the Bible being created by noted San Francisco printer
Andrew Hoyem's Arion Press. But Moser's is the only 20th century
edition of both Old and New Testaments with original illustrations
by a single artist.
</P>
<P>
   Taking on a sacred text that's also a ``linguistic monument,''
as Moser calls the King James version he worked with, ``is an
awe-striking undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Moser, 59, a sturdy, good-humored guy with a trim white beard,
is a onetime teenage Tennessee preacher who quit organized religion
40 years ago but remains a passionate Bible reader.
</P>

   ``From Gutenberg on, the great masterpieces of printing have

IT'S CROSS VS. THE FOUR HORSEMEN IN NEW PATTERSON THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Patterson's latest thriller, ``Pop Goes the Weasel''
(Little, Brown and Co., $26.95, 423 pages), once again features
District of Columbia Homicide Detective Alex Cross in a chilling
race to stop a serial killer who just happens to have diplomatic
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Weasel'' begins, times are good. Cross finally has put the
Soneji case behind him. He is in love with Christine, the principal
of his children's school. When she agrees to marry him, Cross is
the happiest he has been in years until a string of Jane Does are
found murdered in southeast Washington. When a nurse who Cross'
partner, John Sampson, once dated also is found murdered, the two
are convinced a serial killer they nickname the Weasel is on the
loose.
</P>
<P>
   Cross has no way of knowing that his investigation has been
monitored by British diplomat Geoffrey Shafer, a sociopath who
plays a fantasy game called the Four Horsemen. Shafer is Death, who
rolls the dice to see when and how he will kill. The other horsemen
are Conqueror, who lives near London, Famine in Australia and
Southeast Asia, and War in Jamaica. The horsemen communicate by
e-mail and the games they play are no fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the escalation in Shafer's killing spree, Famine
is sent to D.C. to check him out. Of course, Shafer kills again.
</P>
<P>
   The department assigns Cross to investigate the murder of a
businessman near Ronald Reagan/Washington National Airport. When
the racist police chief learns that Cross, Sampson and two other
detectives are investigating the Jane Doe murders on their own
time, he warns Cross and suspends the three others.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with the department, Cross decides to take Christine, the
kids and his grandmother to Bermuda for a brief vacation. One day
Christine heads for town to buy souvenirs and doesn't return.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Cross receives a phone call and is told to check his
e-mail. The last message was short and concise _ ``She's safe for
now. We have her.'' Sampson flies in to help a frantic Cross hunt
for her. After three weeks, Cross returns to D.C. and begins to use
his contacts at Interpol to not only keep investigating Christine's
disappearance, but also murders around the world similar to the
Jane Doe killings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Detective Patsy Hampton is assigned to investigate
the Jane Doe murders and uses Cross' FBI connection, who tells her
he has discovered a weird game on an Internet chat room called the
Four Horsemen. Hampton logs on and begins asking questions.
Eventually, she finds a 13-year-old hacker who chatted with Death.
He also tracked Death to the address of one Geoffrey Shafer.
Without her boss knowing, Hampton shares her information with Cross
in the hopes that Shafer will make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Cross is one of the best protagonists in the modern thriller
genre, and one of the most likable. Patterson has a unique gift of
making the reader feel Cross' joys and pains. He gives Cross a
worthy opponent _ Shafer probably is the smartest killer spawned by
Patterson's wicked imagination. Well-paced with believable
dialogue, ``Pop Goes the Weasel'' is a worthy addition to the Cross
saga.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lamorna Wink'' (Viking, $22.95, 368 pages), the 16th
Richard Jury mystery by Martha Grimes, is a charming delightful
addition to the series, even if it is Jury-lite.
</P>
<P>
   When Jury is sent to Northern Ireland on a case, his good friend
Melrose Plant decides he needs to get away and takes a train to
check out a manor house called Seabourne that is up for lease in
Cornwall. The house is on a cliff overlooking the sea and is fully
furnished, including pictures of the owners' family and sheet music
on the grand piano. Once he moves in, Plant learns that owners had
moved out more than four years ago after their two small children
were found drowned in the cove.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Plant gets involved with the people of the village,
especially young Johnny Wells, who works in his Aunt Chris'
tearoom, waits tables and cooks at the local pub, drives a taxi and
is a budding musician.
</P>
<P>
   The only cloud for Plant is the arrival of his dreaded Aunt
Agatha, who decides to rent a room in the village and learn the
real estate business. Soon after, Aunt Chris disappears and Johnny
asks Plant for help in finding her. With Jury in Belfast, Plant
seeks another old acquaintance, Devon and Cornwall Police Commander
Brian Macalvie, who is in the nearby village of Lamorna Cove
investigating the murder of an earl's ex-wife. Plant and Macalvie
get together at Lamorna's only pub, the Wink, and trade notes to
see if there is any connection between the disappearance and the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   An AIDS patient at a stately home turned hospice is murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Plant and Macalvie think the murderer really was after
billionaire ``Chicken King'' Morris Bletchley, the hospice's
benefactor and grandfather of the two children who drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Jury returns to Northern Ireland as the investigations get more
complex. Together Jury, Plant and Macalvie must solve the crimes by
digging into the past to prevent more murders.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes captures the flavor of British village life. She fleshes
out her characters with witty dialogue, while moving the plot along
at a gentle pace. Long may she write more Richard Jury mysteries.

THE GREATER GOODALL: CHIMP RESEARCHER'S 
SPIRITUAL SIDE REVEALED IN 
`REASON FOR HOPE' DOCUMENTARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: fact box at bottom) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Jane Goodall: Reason for Hope'' is rather unique
as documentaries go in that it focuses on the spiritual side of a
scientist. In any other case, this would either be anomalous or
miss the point. Here, however, the gambit is not only sensible but
inspirational.
</P>
<P>
   The PBS documentary airing Wednesday _ executive-produced by
Catherine Allan (``Hoop Dreams'') and directed by Emily Goldberg _
makes it clear that Goodall's career was preordained from her
youth. Her first favorite toy was a stuffed monkey _ she has it
today, only with significantly less hair. Her childhood pet dog
Rusty taught her about animals, and her choice of reading is
telling _ ``Dr. Dolittle,'' the man who talked to the animals, and
``Tarzan.'' Goodall whimsically bashes the Jane in the novels _ ``I
would have made a much better mate for Tarzan.''
</P>
<P>
   With precious little formal education, Goodall trekked to Kenya
at age 23, met famed anthropologist Louis Leakey at 25 and a year
later, in 1960, began her famous study of chimpanzees in Gombe. She
spent two full years virtually alone except for her primate pals,
studying them and contributing bold new observations to scientific
literature, and has devoted much of the subsequent four decades to
her work in Gombe. In one memorable moment in her studies, Goodall
becomes so attuned to her surroundings that, she avows, ``I really
was seeing the world as a chimp sees it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reason for Hope'' (in a synergistic touch, that just happens
to be the title of Goodall's recent book) juxtaposes images of the
scientist in Gombe today with surprisingly similar footage in
National Geographic documentaries from decades back. Goodall,
however, notes that in fact the rain forests of Gombe are being
clear-cut, and the remaining virgin land may not be sufficient to
house the chimp population. To that end, in recent years Goodall
has left Africa to promote Roots &AMP; Shoots, her grass-roots
environmental organization. Her motto: ``Be joyful though you have
considered all the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Ford offers stolid narration, while music from Bobby
McFerrin and Yo-Yo Ma provides an aural complement to the arresting
imagery. Goodall, though, remains front and center, making for a
most enchanting subject _ she seems far too peaceful and beneficent
to be a scientist, or even an environmental advocate; she'd make a
good guru (and, in fact, some in the documentary seem to regard her
that way). Even with her hectic travel schedule these days, she
placidly radiates calm and assurance every step of the way; she
invigorates others by her very tranquil nature. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
___ &QL; 
The show: ``Jane Goodall: Reason for Hope.'' &QL; 
What: Documentary about the scientist/animal-rights activist. &QL; 
Who: Narrated by Harrison Ford. &QL;

`WORLD' FLOATS BY THE NEIGHBORHOOD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the alarm clock's unceasing clang, you force your eyes open
and crawl out of bed. You shower, dress, pause for breakfast, then
step onto the patio of your apartment, take a deep breath and
survey the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A familiar routine?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Except that on one morning your neighborhood is the
French Riviera during the Cannes Film Festival or the Grand Prix in
Monaco. On another, you become immersed in Rio's Carnaval. The
Norwegian fiords may beckon in summer, the rain forests of Costa
Rica in winter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A NEW HOME AT SEA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the World of ResidenSea, touted as the first
oceangoing resort _ a bold new venture whose participants can tour
the world without leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   Long on the drawing board (and long scoffed at by critics),
fully owned floating residences will become a reality in January
2002 if ``the World'' debuts on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   A Norwegian shipyard recently signed a $262 million contract to
build the 40,000-ton vessel, whose configuration will include 110
furnished and equipped apartments ranging in size from 1,106 to
3,242 square feet. Also available will be 88 guest suites (258-920
square feet) for use by residents' relatives and friends or by
regular cruise passengers. A ship this size normally would carry
1,000-1,500 passengers; average occupancy here is projected at 285,
with a crew of 252.
</P>
<P>
   One early prediction: We won't be reading about this enterprise
in Arthur Frommer's ``Budget Travel'' column. To purchase the
``cheapest'' apartment, you'll need about $2 million.
Top-of-the-line digs will sell for $7 million. Residents also will
pay an annual charge to help cover the ship's operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you won't have to scramble to find a parking spot for
the family car. And imagine the time and money you'll save on
yardwork.
</P>
<P>
   A concept that will never float, you say? Before construction,
43 residences already have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the World of ResidenSea is beyond our means, can you
imagine the thrill of receiving a Christmas invitation from a rich
uncle who sails from continent to continent?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CRUISING AMENITIES AND MORE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, this 12-deck vessel will resemble traditional
luxury-oriented cruise ships. Anticipated amenities include five
restaurants, several lounges, two swimming pools, a theater, a
nightclub, a casino, a spa and sports facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Living quarters are a different matter. Inside the front door,
you'll find two or three bedrooms, each with an en-suite bathroom;
living and dining areas; a completely equipped kitchen;
floor-to-ceiling glass windows; and a terrace open to the ocean,
with optional jet pool.
</P>
<P>
   Residents can select among interior concepts created exclusively
for ``the World'' by four signature designers.
</P>
<P>
   Normal services and facilities required to maintain a home will
be provided. These include a floating village market, a hair and
beauty salon, and laundry and daily housekeeping services. A
medical center will include a doctor and nurses, a surgery theater
and three wards for recuperation. A house of worship also is
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who tire of ``eating out'' or cooking can utilize an
on-board delicatessen or 24-hour delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   A continual series of lectures is envisioned, with classes
devoted to subjects as diverse as dance, navigation, language,
cooking, music, computers and photography.
</P>
<P>
   For those desiring to maintain an office at sea (a majority of
early buyers are described as active business people in their 50s),
amenities will include a business and conference center,
secretarial service and fax and modem access in each apartment.
</P>
<P>
   And where will this ResidenSea journey? The first two years will
feature calls at ports throughout Europe and the Mediterranean, the
United States, the Caribbean and South America. In contrast to
standard cruise ships, a focus will be on extended stays at the
most popular destinations, especially during major events.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent itineraries are expected to reflect interests
expressed by residents. Think it's a safe wager that those
homeowners' meetings will have good attendance?
</P>
<P>
   Lending considerable credibility to the project is the
involvement of several industry leaders and the participation of
Silversea Cruises, a highly respected luxury line, in an
operational capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Early estimates are that Americans will make up 40 percent of
residents, with many others coming from Europe.
</P>
<P>

to dream.

 UNDATED: ... the Journal piece.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Observers of the Journal were not suprised to find damaging
allegations against Clinton on the editorial page. But what is so
unusual, and unique to Bartley's tenure, is that a story alleging a
violent felony by Clinton was not produced by the news staff, but
by the opinion pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess from where I sit, it doesn't matter to me very much
whether we break a story on the editorial page or on the front
page,'' says Kann. ``The Wall Street Journal probably does more
analytical, interpretive journalism on its front page than most
newspapers, and our editorial page does more reporting, breaks more
news than most, if not all, newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   But managing editor Paul Steiger, who oversees the Journal's
news pages, had reservations about the Broaddrick piece. ``It's not
a story that I would have sent a reporter after,'' he says.
``You've got to make judgments about where you concentrate your
fire. This happened way before Clinton was running for president .
. . It's got to be in the realm of `he said, she said,'
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley's fiercely independent fiefdom can create the impression
that the Journal's editorial and news pages are published by two
different papers, a journalism phenomenon described as the
unbreachable wall between ``church and state.''
</P>
<P>
   Some old hands still recall how Bartley antagonized the paper's
Washington bureau during a combative 1980 dinner meeting by
suggesting that his editorial page staffers were better news hounds
than the Beltway reporters. Bartley acknowledges that at that
dinner, he was sitting on the news that he was about to win the
Pulitzer prize for editorial writing and ``I was full of myself . .
. There was a message that `you have to understand that we have
access to some sources that you don't.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the editorial page alienates crucial Beltway sources,
Steiger calls it an overall ``asset,'' but says, ``yes, there are
people who despise its politics . . . Frankly we can usually make
these people understand the difference'' between news and opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Strange as it may seem, Bob Bartley went on C-SPAN in 1992 and
actually said: ``I don't have any real strong opinions about Bill
Clinton. I don't think he's a menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know at what point I would have explicitly
abandoned,'' that view, he now says. But ``the more you poked at''
the president's Arkansas inner circle, ``the more creatures you
found.'' Rabinowitz says her boss takes genuine ``moral offense''
at the president.
</P>
<P>
   Many editorial pages have made no secret of their quarrels with
Clinton, but none has pursued him with the Journal's vigor. ``The
problem with Clinton was not the sex, but the lies,'' says Bartley,
flashing his lethal wit. ``Sex happened to be the one he got caught
for because it was the hardest to delegate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's case against Clinton long predated Monica
Lewinsky. Early on, the editorial page took aim at Foster, starting
with a 1993 piece called ``Who is Vincent Foster?'' that made a
significant issue of the fact that Foster would not provide the
Journal with a photo. When Foster was later found dead along with a
note that read ``WSJ editors lie without consequence,'' Bartley
went from the hunter to the hunted, with critics questioning
whether he could sleep at night.
</P>
<P>
   After Foster's death, Journal editorials raised the theory that
he had been murdered _ lauding the work of leading murder
conspiracy proponent and fringe journalist Christopher Ruddy _
before finally accepting the suicide ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we said was (Foster's death) was never seriously
investigated and ought to be,'' says Bartley. ``The only guy around
who seemed to be investigating it was Chris Ruddy.'' He dimsisses
allegations that the Journal may have driven Foster to suicidal
despair as White House ``spin . . . We shined the spotlight on this
guy. Vince Foster was thought of as a steely litigator from this
tough law firm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's editorial pages also ardently pursued the Clinton
version of ``X-Files,'' a series of shadowy allegations about drug
dealing and skulduggery near Mena, Arkansas while Clinton was
governor. The story never gained traction in the mainstream press,
but Bartley ran numerous pieces with headlines like ``Mysterious
Mena,'' and ``The Mena Coverup.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits there never was any smoking gun, but ``the point about
Mena . . . and drug smuggling was that Arkansas was a pretty
corrupt place,'' says Bartley. ``He was the governor at the time .
. . Why isn't it a story?''
</P>
<P>
   The fascination with subjects like the Foster murder theory and
Mena not only gained the editorial page a reputation as the media's
leading Clinton hater. It left even some sympathizers shaking their
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as The Weekly Standard didn't like Clinton, we didn't
see as many conspiracies as the Journal,'' says Barnes. And former
editorial page staffer Jude Wanniski chastises Bartley for
``chewing up all his energies playing Captain Ahab trying to get
the White Whale in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bartley speaks, it sometimes looks like the words are
causing him pain. He gives no hint of that passion and
pugnaciousness. But according to his chief deputy, the juices don't
really start flowing until the hunt begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Bartley has probably the best news instinct of any
journalist I've been around,'' says deputy editorial page editor
Dan Henninger, a 22-year Journal veteran, who now supervises much
of the daily workload. ``He loves to chase the news. It actually
physically animates him in a discernable way.''
</P>
<P>
   Steiger, the managing editor, credits Bartley with pioneering
``the reported editorial.'' With Bartley, that can mean the tricky
intersection of fact and opinion. A Journal editorial on Broaddrick
asserted that ``the truth doesn't necessarily lie in a 50-50
balance between consenting parties. The truth is sometimes served
by reporting based on a view of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   That idea sparks some debate. ``Their reporting is not real
reporting,'' says Alter. ``It sometimes digs up great stuff, but at
a fundamental level, it's pretend reporting'' because it doesn't
always examine both sides of an issue.
</P>
<P>
   In a decade-old piece in The American Lawyer headlined ``Daily
Diatribe of the American Right,'' Stuart Taylor asserted that the
editorial page's reporting on a variety of legal issues _ from its
assault on Michael Dukakis' veto of pledge of allegiance
legislation, to its campaign against opponents of Robert Bork's
Supreme Court nomination _ was driven more by raging ideology than
a quest for the facts.
</P>
<P>
   A similarly critcal 1996 Columbia Journlism Review piece by
freelancer Trudy Lieberman called ``Bartley's Believe it Or Not!''
accused the editorial page of being ``riddled with errors.'' It
cited inaccurate Journal attacks on everything from judicial
nominees to the Smithsonian's Enola Gay exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to let a challenge go unanswered, Bartley retaliated
with a 2,000-word Journal piece assailing Lieberman's employer, the
Consumer's Union, as a lackey for big-money lawsuits and lawyers.
In a piece on the controversy that he wrote for the liberal
magazine The Nation, Eric Alterman concluded that picking a fight
with Bartley ``is a bit like leaping head first into a tank of
starving piranhas.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Bartley's biggest _ and most revealing _ battle was the
famous ``Yellow Rain'' affair. Butting heads with The New York
Times and a good chunk of the scientific community, the Journal's
editorial page waged an intense campaign throughout the 80's to
convince readers that so-called ``Yellow Rain'' in Southeast Asia
in the 1970's was a sinister Soviet biological weapon. (In his
recent memoir, former Times executive editor Max Frankel indulged
in a bit of gloating, mocking the Journal's position when, as he
put it, Yellow Rain ``turned out to have been bee excrement.'')
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Bartley remains ``convinced we're right'' about
``Yellow Rain.'' Lipsky calls the subject ``the most important of
the (Journal) controversies . . . It was the implication behind it,
it was that the Soviets couldn't be trusted to stick to a weapons
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   In several telling ways, Yellow Rain was classic Bartley. It
represented reporting based on a world view. And most importantly,
it allowed this quiet man to engage in his favorite passion _
loudly slugging it out with the media establishment, the scientific
community, and anyone else who doubts the righteousness of his
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Bartley admits the ``one time in which (his job) wasn't much fun
was the Bush administration,'' when he had a president he couldn't
love or loathe. Of George W., he says: ``We would hope . . . that
as the campaign goes on Bush develops more of a message on the
issues.'' One gets the strong sense that given his druthers,
Bartley would have more fun spending the next four years
carpet-bombing President Al Gore or Bill Bradley than pulling his
punches with another Bush administration. Conscientious objector
status just doesn't suit him.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Arthur Laffer, one of Bartley's early supply-side
gurus and an old friend, neatly sums up the Bartley credo. ``Bob
really wants to be in the battle til he's dead.''

WALL STREET JOURNAL   FLEXES ITS POLITICAL MUSCLE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Repeating for all needed)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is at least one ominous cloud beginning to threaten the
sunny candidacy of popular Republican frontrunner George W. Bush:
The editorial page of The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the staunchly conservative Journal has
belittled Bush's supposed lack of ideas, mocked his ``compassionate
conservative'' mantra, and in a piece headlined ``From Oil to
Baseball to the Governor's Mansion,'' portrayed him as a stumblebum
businessman who made his fortune trading off family ties and shady
insider connections.
</P>
<P>
   Given its moral certainty, energy, and combativeness, the
paper's opinion page is not simply a repository of lively
commentary. It is a serious journalistic mover and shaker that
likes to change the course of history.
</P>
<P>
   It is a page that helped invent supply-side economics years
before Ronald Reagan made it the cornerstone of US economic policy.
It is from there that editorial board member Dorothy Rabinowitz
launched the crusade that helped reopen the Fells Acres child
sex-abuse case in Massachusetts, and earlier this year, broke the
news that Juanita Broaddrick was accusing President Clinton of a
1978 sexual assault _ a story the paper's news side didn't deem
worthy of pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal was an early and vocal opponent of the now
widely-destained Independent Counsel statute, frequently calling
for the scalp of Iran-Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh. Yet
its animus toward Clinton led the paper to treat Kenneth Starr as a
hero. A furious White House officially charged the ediorial page
with being a conduit of right-wing ``fringe stories,'' and in some
quarters, the Journal's bruising treatment of deputy White House
Counsel Vincent Foster is still blamed for Foster's suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Journal is not only the keeper of the conservative
flame, or what CNN senior political analyst William Schneider calls
``the enforcer of right wing political correctness,'' it is also a
major force in Republican national politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, when it comes to the Journal's editorial page, may be
battling both history and ideology. The paper never thought much of
his father's brand of moderate Republicanism, and so far, it seems
to believe that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokesman would say only that ``we look forward to
discussing the details of our economic and tax policy with them.''
Fred Barnes, executive editor of the conservative magazine, The
Weekly Standard, says an angry Journal might not derail the Bush
freight train. But he warns: ``It's powerful enough that he needs
to worry about it. If I were George W. Bush, I'd want to go and sit
down with Bob Bartley.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley, the shy, retiring 62-year-old Iowan who has run the
Journal's editorial page for 27 years, is far from a household
name, nor is he a member of TV's talking head circuit. He wouldn't
catch your eye at a cocktail party, but his stature at the nation's
largest circulation daily is obvious. Even though he has no
involvement in the news operation, he holds the paper's top title _
editor.
</P>
<P>
   Bartley loves nothing better than a good fight, and his
aggressive reporting ethos, wrecking ball rhetoric and polarizing
views make him one of the most powerful _ and controversial _
journalists in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 PBS piece _ ``Thunder From the Right'' _ called the
Journal's editorial page ``perhaps the most influential, the most
articulate, the most ferocious opinion page in the country.''
Writing in The Weekly Standard, former Journal editorial staffer
David Brooks declared that ``more than any other journalist,
Bartley takes risks, staking out wildly audacious positions and
launching wildly unconventional attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He does stand as a kind of icon to a couple of generations of
young . . . conservatives who really do see the Journal editorial
page as the ultimate source of wisdom on a number of issues,'' adds
Journal publisher and Dow Jones chairman Peter Kann.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Critics accuse Bartley of running the most
lopsided and mean-spirited editorial page in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are very talented polemicists, but for them,
journalism is just an instrument for political ax grinding,'' says
Newsweek senior editor Jonathan Alter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were only a shade removed from Richard Mellon Scaife,''
adds former White House press secretary Mike McCurry, referring to
the conservative billionaire who White House allies view as a
leading fomentor of bizarre anti-Clinton tales. ``There were . . .
times that (their stuff) was just so kooky.''
</P>
<P>
   Revere him or revile him, Bartley is a man whose mystery is his
split personality. There is the mild and quiet soul who is
worshiped by his colleagues: At a party marking his 25th
anniversary running the editorial page, former staffer Seth Lipsky
declared that Bartley ``is probably more loved by those who worked
for him than any editor in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is the relentless assassin at the keyboard who
imparted his core philosophy _ ``all you need is arrogance to write
editorials'' _ to his very first editorial page hire, and who uses
the term ``muzzle velocity'' to describe the bone-shattering impact
he strives to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Kann offers the best theory for reconciling the two
Bartleys. ``He takes delight in controversy,'' the publisher says.
But ``if Bob wants to piss people off, he might as well piss the
country off instead of you, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Journal's editorial philosophy is ``free markets
and free people,'' although Bartley likes to think of his staff as
``18th century liberals.'' (In the 20th century, he explains, big
government has replaced King George as the enemy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's editorial page advocates a muscular foreign policy
that harkens back to the Cold War. It abhors taxes, opposes
increasing the minimum wage, doesn't like unions and rails against
government regulation of the private sector. It's led a tireless
campaign against product liability litigation, decrying lawsuits
against the tobacco, gun and automobile industries and
characterizing trial lawyers as ``the plaintiff bar mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley's minions leave no doubt where they stand in the culture
wars. After the 1993 murder of an abortion doctor, a Journal
editorial dug back a quarter century to blame the 60's, saying
America ``began to tip off the emotional tracks'' during the
anti-war protests at the 1968 Democratic national convention. When
American women captured the World Cup in soccer earlier this year,
the Journal scolded those who saw the win as a victory for gender
equity as ``professional ax-grinders.'' And after hearing that the
Miss America pageant might accept contestants who had been married
or had an abortion, the Journal suggested ``leaving the freak shows
to Atlantic City and moving Miss America to Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Bartley's overarching passion has been a fierce
assault on the occupant of the White House. As proof, the Journal
has published a five-volume collection _ totalling 2,784 pages _ of
Clinton and Whitewater commentary taken from its editorial pages.
</P>
<P>
   The drumbeat never stops, even in these days of ``Clinton
fatigue.'' Hillary Clinton's presumptive Senate candidacy in New
York has already been dismissed as a doomed enterprise. And a
Journal editorial can still muster up the disdain to compare the
president to O.J. Simpson, or blame Clinton for Dan Quayle's
withdrawal as a presidential candidate, claiming the president has
elevated ``money and biography above ideas in our politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley's most explosive scrutiny of Clinton came last February,
just a week after the draining impeachment drama drew to a close,
when Rabinowitz broke the news of Broaddrick's allegations.
Rabinowitz didn't want the Broaddrick assignment. ``I resisted the
idea,'' she says. ``I don't break down doors.'' But Bartley
persisted and the Journal's expose forced the dramatic charges,
which the White House denied, into the headlines. (NBC, which had
conducted the first interview with Broaddrick but delayed airing
it, broadcast the story five days after the Journal piece.)

anniversary running the editorial page, former staffer Seth Lipsky
declared that Bartley ``is probably more loved by those who worked
for him than any editor in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is the relentless assassin at the keyboard who
imparted his core philosophy _ ``all you need is arrogance to write
editorials'' _ to his very first editorial page hire, and who uses
the term ``muzzle velocity'' to describe the bone-shattering impact
he strives to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Kann offers the best theory for reconciling the two
Bartleys. ``He takes delight in controversy,'' the publisher says.
But ``if Bob wants to piss people off, he might as well piss the
country off instead of you, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Journal's editorial philosophy is ``free markets
and free people,'' although Bartley likes to think of his staff as
``18th century liberals.'' (In the 20th century, he explains, big
government has replaced King George as the enemy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's editorial page advocates a muscular foreign policy
that harkens back to the Cold War. It abhors taxes, opposes
increasing the minimum wage, doesn't like unions and rails against
government regulation of the private sector. It's led a tireless
campaign against product liability litigation, decrying lawsuits
against the tobacco, gun and automobile industries and
characterizing trial lawyers as ``the plaintiff bar mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley's minions leave no doubt where they stand in the culture
wars. After the 1993 murder of an abortion doctor, a Journal
editorial dug back a quarter century to blame the 60's, saying
America ``began to tip off the emotional tracks'' during the
anti-war protests at the 1968 Democratic national convention. When
American women captured the World Cup in soccer earlier this year,
the Journal scolded those who saw the win as a victory for gender
equity as ``professional ax-grinders.'' And after hearing that the
Miss America pageant might accept contestants who had been married
or had an abortion, the Journal suggested ``leaving the freak shows
to Atlantic City and moving Miss America to Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Bartley's overarching passion has been a fierce
assault on the occupant of the White House. As proof, the Journal
has published a five-volume collection _ totalling 2,784 pages _ of
Clinton and Whitewater commentary taken from its editorial pages.
</P>
<P>
   The drumbeat never stops, even in these days of ``Clinton
fatigue.'' Hillary Clinton's presumptive Senate candidacy in New
York has already been dismissed as a doomed enterprise. And a
Journal editorial can still muster up the disdain to compare the
president to O.J. Simpson, or blame Clinton for Dan Quayle's
withdrawal as a presidential candidate, claiming the president has
elevated ``money and biography above ideas in our politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley's most explosive scrutiny of Clinton came last February,
just a week after the draining impeachment drama drew to a close,
when Rabinowitz broke the news of Broaddrick's allegations.
Rabinowitz didn't want the Broaddrick assignment. ``I resisted the
idea,'' she says. ``I don't break down doors.'' But Bartley
persisted and the Journal's expose forced the dramatic charges,
which the White House denied, into the headlines. (NBC, which had
conducted the first interview with Broaddrick but delayed airing
it, broadcast the story five days after the Journal piece.)

 &HT;    Stewart gave pieces of himself to Ohio kids
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Payne Stewart had a special thing for kids here
in the Miami Valley. He, quite literally, wrapped his arms around
them.
</P>
<P>
   The last time was a dismal, rainy morning just two months ago at
Firestone Country Club. Stewart _ the colorful golf star who died
in a South Dakota plane crash Monday afternoon _ was on the putting
green, braving the elements for a little practice on the eve of the
NEC Invitational. He was wearing long pants and a blue wind-breaker
rather than his trademark knickers and tam o'shanter cap _ retro
garb that had made him one of the most recognizable figures in
golf.
</P>
<P>
   It was good that Stewart was out of costume that August day.
That way, Dan Herchline _ the St. Luke's sixth grader from
Beavercreek _ got to see him for who he really was.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Dan was having a tough morning. First, he was
dealing with the daily aches, fatigue and fears that come when
you're 11 years old and battling leukemia. Then there was the
disappointment of a dream that seemed about to be washed down the
drain.
</P>
<P>
   Dan had come to Firestone to meet his idol, Tiger Woods, thanks
to the arrangements of the Dayton chapter of the Special Wish
Foundation. The only problem was that thunderstorms had kept Woods'
plane from reaching Akron. As the hours slowly went by for Dan _
and the restlessness of youth turned to the weariness of leukemia _
the people associated with the outing began to fret. No one wanted
to see the bottom drop out of a rare bright day for Dan.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Stewart got wind of the boy's heartbreak. When he
heard Dan was from Dayton, he handed his putter to his caddy and
asked to meet the youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm familiar with the Special Wish deal in Dayton,'' Stewart
said. ``I had another young friend from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Stewart was contacted about 17-year-old Joel
Broering from St. Henry. Joel - who'd been the MVP of the St. Henry
golf team _ was suffering from leukemia, too. As his illness
worsened, Joel asked to meet Stewart, his favorite golfer.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Wish people weren't sure what to expect. At the
time, Stewart was known as much for his often-churlish behavior
with golf galleries, tournament officials and the media, as he was
for a championship resume that would eventually encompass 11 PGA
tour victories including three major titles.
</P>
<P>
   But just like the 1920s outfit he always wore, Stewart's prickly
reputation clothed who he really was. In private, he was the loving
father of two children _ Chelsea is now 13 and Aaron, 10 _ and he's
also a man who has special concerns about cancer. His dad _ the man
who taught him golf _ died from the disease at 64.
</P>
<P>
   So when contacted about Broering, Stewart stunned everyone with
the way he embraced the St. Henry youth, who was flown to the Skins
Game tournament in Palm Desert, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne literally lifted Joel out of the car and into his golf
cart,'' said Dr. David Roer, the Dayton pediatrician and long-time
member of the Special Wish board of directors. ``He took Joel along
for a practice round, carried him when he needed to get him close
and took him into the clubhouse to meet other golfers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clothiers who had Stewart under contract gave Joel two sets of
knickers and leggings to wear for the two-day tournament. Stewart
carried lunch to his new pal, made sure Joel had a cart to follow
him each day and then, when he won the tournament, he gave the
trophy to Joel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went way out of his way for our son,'' Elaine Broering
remembered Monday night. ``He was absolutely wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel's health deteriorated rapidly in the days following the
tournament. Stewart kept in contact with the family and 11 days
after he had given Joel the trophy, he called St. Henry and spoke
to the boy he called ``The Star.'' Two days later Joel died.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple years later I was down at the Masters,'' Roer said.
``I gave Payne a picture of Joel and him. He put it in his golf bag
so he could carry it with him the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that same humanness that showed itself again that morning
at Firestone. Stewart called Dan over, put his arm around him and
they began talking like they were old pals. He asked about Dan's
school, about his golf game and about the other sports he liked.
Soon both were all smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Other golfers _ guys like Ernie Els, Greg Norman and Jose Maria
Olazabal _ saw the way Stewart took to Dan and they too got into
the act. For the next hour Dan was showered with attention and
before he knew it, the rain had let up and there was Tiger Woods to
complete what Dan would later describe as ``the greatest day of my
life,''
</P>
<P>
   Though Dan said he's been feeling better now _ he's playing
soccer _ Monday was one of saddest days in his young life. ``We're
all kind of in shock,'' said Dan's dad Tom Herchline. ``Payne
Stewart seemed like such a classy guy. He was so genuine with our
son. He was someone special.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Broering felt the same: ``After what he did for Joel, our
whole town used to root for him. And any time Payne won, everyone
was reminded of our son. Now we know that won't happen anymore.
That's why, somehow, it feels like we lost another little piece of
Joel. Right now, we're all very sad.''

A PUMPKIN BREAD PLEASURE DOME FILLED WITH SPICES AND PECANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the seventh of eight columns by Amy Scherber of Amy's Bread
in Manhattan. These columns are being written with Dorie
Greenspan.  
 By AMY SCHERBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There can't be another bread that smells better as it is baking,
or that looks more inviting when you cut into it, than this pumpkin
spiral. The shape was inspired by a bread that Toy Dupree, who has
been working with me at the bakeries from the start, saw Pueblo
women making in beehive ovens in Taos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I have refined and changed the recipe, and now
it is the quintessential fall bread, spiced with cinnamon, ginger
and cloves, studded with pecans and coiled around on itself until
it gently domes in the center, evoking the shape of those Pueblo
ovens.
</P>
<P>
   The dough for this rich, tender, slightly sweet bread is soft,
moist and fun to work with _ it takes very light kneading and is
best made in two simple stages. I mix the yeast with honey, pumpkin
puree, cornmeal, milk, egg yolks and some flour.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting mixture, called a sponge in baker's lingo, gives
the yeast a chance to lighten the heavier, wetter ingredients in
the dough before more flour is added.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 minutes or so, when the yeast is activated and the
sponge is bubbling, it is time for Stage 2: adding the remaining
flour and all the aromatic spices. After kneading a few more
minutes, you can start to appreciate the dough's fragrance and
texture. The last step of mixing is to work in a stick of melted
butter before kneading some more.
</P>
<P>
   As dense as this dough may seem, it is delicate enough to
require kid-glove treatment. All the words that are often
associated with kneading _ pound, punch, slap, knock _ are the
wrong words here. I knead with a light push-and-pull motion, until
the dough becomes soft, supple and silken; then, I let it rest for
20 minutes before giving it another gentle knead to incorporate
toasted pecans.
</P>
<P>
   The pecans are latecomers because I don't want their sharp edges
to tear the strands of gluten, the structure-giving element in
bread, that the initial kneading produced. When the pecans are in,
the bread rises until it doubles in volume and is ready to be
shaped.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has worked with clay will be an old hand at shaping
these loaves. The dough is divided in half, and each half is rolled
into a long rope; then, the rope is rolled around on itself into a
coil. Because of its mass, the coil naturally forms a beehive.
</P>
<P>
   I bake the bread at a high temperature for a few minutes, to
give it the quick rise I call ``oven spring,'' then finish it at a
moderate temperature.
</P>
<P>
   And I rarely leave the kitchen while the oven is on, because the
room is filled with a dizzingly sweet, spicy aroma. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PUMPKIN PECAN SPIRAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes, plus 3{ hours' rising time &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   { cup honey
</P>
<P>
   1 cup unsweetened pumpkin puree
</P>
<P>
   { cup milk, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs, separated
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup minus 2 teaspoons coarse cornmeal, plus extra for
dusting
</P>
<P>
   4 cups bread flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   2{ teaspoons Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 stick unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1 cup pecan pieces, toasted. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the sponge: In a large mixing bowl, combine yeast and
\ cup very warm water, and stir to dissolve. Allow to stand for 3
minutes. Add honey, pumpkin puree, milk, egg yolks, cornmeal, and
one and two-thirds cups flour. Stir briskly with a whisk until well
blended. Let sponge stand for at least 15 minutes but no longer
than 30, until it begins to rise slightly.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a medium bowl, combine remaining two and one-third cups
flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and salt. Whisk to blend well, and
add to the sponge. Using your fingers, stir, scraping sides of bowl
and folding dough over itself until it forms a shaggy mass. Knead
dough until it becomes smooth and somewhat elastic, about 5
minutes. Gradually add melted butter, kneading it in until well
combined.
</P>
<P>
   3. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until it
is very smooth, about 5 minutes. (Dough will be sticky at first,
but will become soft, supple and springy.) Shape it into a loose
ball, cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Gently stretch dough into a rectangle about 6 by 8 inches,
and scatter with toasted pecans. Press nuts in slightly, and fold
dough in thirds. Gently knead until nuts are evenly distributed,
about 3 minutes. Shape dough into a loose ball, and place it in a
lightly oiled bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap, and allow to
rise at room temperature until it has doubled in volume, about 2
hours.
</P>
<P>
   5. Dust two large baking sheets with cornmeal, and set aside.
When dough has doubled, transfer to a lightly floured surface and
divide into three equal pieces. Shape each piece into a rope about
24 inches long. To elongate the rope, roll it and stretch gently,
resting dough briefly once or twice. Beginning at one end, coil
rope to form a flat spiral resembling a large cinnamon bun; spiral
should be coiled tightly enough so that a slight dome ({ inch high)
forms in center.
</P>
<P>
   6. Transfer spirals to baking sheets, and cover with oiled
plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature until doubled in volume,
1{ to 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   7. Position oven racks to divide oven into thirds; preheat oven
to 425 degrees. Mix two egg whites with 2 teaspoons of water. When
loaves have doubled, brush surface of each loaf with egg wash.
Place sheets in oven, and using a plant sprayer, mist tops and
sides of oven 6 to 8 times. (This will help the bread spring up and
also enhance the color). Quickly close oven door.
</P>
<P>
   8. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350
degrees. Continue to bake until loaves are golden brown and surface
feels just firm when pressed lightly, 20 to 25 more minutes. Loaves
should have a thin, soft crust. Transfer to a rack to cool
completely before slicing and serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 3 loaves.

SCALLOPS THAT DO A FLAMENCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few foods are as convenient as scallops, which not only have
great flavor and texture, but also cook fast. Other mollusks, like
clams, oysters and mussels, have to be shucked right before eating,
but scallops are shucked soon after harvest and sold virtually
ready to cook. Even a large one needs only to be browned on both
sides. A good searing caramelizes the natural sugars and leaves the
superb interior cool, creamy and delicious.
</P>
<P>
   I like a traditional Spanish method of searing scallops, one
that works equally well with shrimp and squid. It is called a la
plancha, which refers to the large, flat griddle used to sear
shellfish and fish. A cast-iron or nonstick skillet will work
equally well, as long as it is very, very hot, hot enough so that
the muscle of the scallop will contract so quickly upon hitting the
surface that it will literally jump.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, this kind of cooking generates a fair amount of
smoke. But you need less than four minutes for the largest of
scallops, and a good exhaust fan will help.
</P>
<P>
   The seasoning here is Spanish as well: good olive oil, sherry
vinegar or lemon juice, and a little garlic. The scallops are
briefly marinated in this mixture while the pan preheats, and the
same liquid is used to lightly dress them after they are cooked.
(Since scallops can even be eaten raw, there is no problem with
re-using the marinade, as there might be with beef or chicken.)
</P>
<P>
   Four types of scallops are commercially available in the United
States, and for most of the year, only one is worth recommending _
the large, reliable sea scallop. (Ask for ``dry scallops,'' those
that have not been soaked in preservatives.)
</P>
<P>
   But from fall through winter and sometimes spring, true bay
scallops can also be found. They are caught wild in the waters
between Long Island and Cape Cod, and nowhere else in the world.
They are incomparably delicious, and because they are smaller they
need even less cooking _ a minute a side.
</P>
<P>
   Do not mistake tiny calico scallops, at times mislabeled bay
scallops, for true bays. And although Chinese farm-raised bay
scallops are not a bad product, they do not have the great flavor
of the natives. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SCALLOPS A LA PLANCHA
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds big sea scallops
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, peeled and lightly crushed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Sherry vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Minced fresh parsley for garnish. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Toss scallops and garlic on a plate, and drizzle with oil and
vinegar; sprinkle with salt and pepper, and turn over a couple of
times. Go about your business for five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Put a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over high heat.
When the skillet smokes _ this will take a couple of minutes _
drain the scallops and add to the pan a few at a time. By the time
you have added the last scallop, the first one will probably be
browned on one side, so begin turning them. Cook until brown on
both sides but still rare in the center, about 2 minutes a side.
</P>
<P>
   3. Serve, drizzled with the juices from the plate and garnished
with the parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

WINTER WEATHER FORECAST: JUST LIKE LAST YEAR   
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Persistent storms in the Pacific Northwest and
drier and warmer-than-normal conditions in the southern United
States are expected to dominate this coming winter season, top
government weather forecasters predicted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   This winter is largely expected to be a repeat of last year as a
result of La Nina, the cooling trend in the eastern Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Nina will alter the strength and the pattern of the Pacific
jet stream over North America to give us a warm, dry winter in the
southern half of the nation, but more snow and rain to the Pacific
Northwest and the Great Lakes,'' said D. James Baker, head of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the parent
agency of the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio and Tennessee River Valleys are also expected to see an
increase in winter storms with a greater risk that some of those
storms will be severe.
</P>
<P>
   The northern United States will be subject to more temperature
extremes than usual, with periods of cold followed by
warmer-than-normal temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Uccellini, director of the National Weather Service's
National Center for Environmental Prediction, explained that La
Nina causes high pressure systems to form in the North Pacific
Ocean that control whether cold-Canadian air or warmer Pacific air
reaches the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather can alternate from very warm to very cold
conditions that persist for awhile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina began affecting the United States last winter after the
opposite phenomenon known as El Nino subsided. El Nino brings
warmer-than-normal temperatures to the eastern Pacific Ocean, also
affecting weather patterns in the United States. The 1997-1998 El
Nino brought a mild winter to the Midwest and Northeast and heavy
rains along the West Coast and in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina has caused drought conditions in the southern half of
the United States. The dryness of last winter continued into the
spring and summer months and caused an estimated $2 billion in crop
damages. Recent rains from Atlantic hurricanes, however, have
brought relief to parts of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
   Uccellini said a repeat of the 1999 drought isn't necessarily in
the cards because La Nina is expected to abate by March, meaning a
return to normal rainfall in drought-stricken areas as well as a
return to normal weather patterns in the rest of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Here's NOAA's winter weather forecast by region:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pacific Northwest: Above-normal rain and snowfall; near-normal
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   _ California: Below-normal temperatures near the coast;
above-normal rain and snow in the north and below-normal
precipitation in the south.
</P>
<P>
   _ Southwest: Warmer-than-normal temperatures; below-normal rain
and snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rocky Mountain region: Near to above-normal temperatures with
more snow than usual in the north to below-normal precipitation in
the south.
</P>
<P>
   _ Northern Plains: Above-normal snowfall with temperatures near
normal; significant arctic outbreaks likely.
</P>
<P>
   _ Midwest: Above-normal rain and snowfall in the entire region
with temperatures near-normal to above-normal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Great Lakes: Considerable temperature variability from
week-to-week; above-normal snowfall expected.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ohio and Tennessee River Valleys: Warmer and
wetter-than-normal. There is an increased likelihood of
severe-winter weather.
</P>
<P>
   _ South Central and Southeast: Warmer and drier-than-normal,
with dryness most likely in New Mexico, South Texas, West Texas and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mid-Atlantic: Milder-than-normal temperatures with near-normal
precipitation expected.
</P>
<P>
   _ New England: Warmer-than-normal in southern New England;
outlook for northern New England is uncertain at this time.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While NOAA is fairly certain about the effects La Nina will
continue to have on most of the United States, Uccellini said it is
more difficult to predict its effects on the Northeast because a
pressure pattern above the Atlantic Ocean known as the North
Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) also affects weather in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The lesser-understood Atlantic pressure system controls the jet
stream from the Eastern United States to Europe while conditions in
the Pacific like La Nina affect the jet stream across the western
and central United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast, La Nina can produce conditions like it did
last year: warm and dry. But toss in the effects of the North
Atlantic Oscillation and a La Nina winter can look like it did in
1995-96 when the region was socked-in with record snowfall and
colder-than-normal temperatures.

<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   (Will move in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   POPE-BOOK (Rome) _ A new and scalding biography of Pope Pius
XII, ``Hitler's Pope,'' by a British journalist, John Cornwell, has
revived public scrutiny of the wartime pontiff. The intensity of
the dispute has led some Catholic scholars to openly question the
Vatican's decision to keep Pius XII a candidate for sainthood. By
Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-MCDONALD'S (Berlin) _ The opening this month of the
1,000th McDonald's restaurant in Germany was supposed to be a
festive occasion, a moment to toast German-American friendship.
Instead, it illustrated the growing strains in this pivotal
relationship. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   (Will move in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PRIVACY (Washington) _ Exclusive: President Clinton will
soon propose sweeping new federal regulations to protect the
privacy of billions of medical records and will assail Congress for
failing to enact any safeguards, administration officials said
Tuesday. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   SPEND-CONGRESS (Washington) _ The latest Republican strategy for
passing a budget, an across-the-board spending cut, was under
attack even from Republicans on Tuesday, and the House majority
whip, Tom DeLay of Texas, implicitly threatened to shut the
government down if President Clinton did not find a way to match
the spending cuts Congress is backing. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   (Will move in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-CAMPAIGN (Undated) _ After months of relatively smooth
sailing toward the Republican primaries, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas found himself in less placid straits Tuesday, with his two
main Republican rivals attacking him at the same time that new
polls underscored considerable softness in Bush's support. Although
both developments represented the kind of challenges almost every
front-runner faces at some point, they dulled the aura of
inevitability that has surrounded Bush and suggested the extent to
which he will not go untested or unchallenged. By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-TONE (Washington) _ For the first time in more than a
decade, the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination has
triggered a fierce competition for the loyalties of its once
embattled liberal wing. And the catalyst for the struggle is
clearly Bill Bradley, who has consistently positioned himself to
the left of his lone rival, Vice President Al Gore, on a wide range
of issues, from gay rights to health care to child poverty to
criminal justice. By James Dao.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES-MONEY (Undated) _ Last year, as Iowa voters were
preparing to elect a U.S. Senator and an assortment of state and
local officials, the Steve Forbes organization flooded the state
with money for a lucky bunch of Republican candidates to try and
gain their support. Such is the Midas touch of Forbes, a publishing
executive whose net worth of $440 million puts him in the top ranks
of wealth in this nation. And, he is not shy about sharing that
wealth in pursuit of his long-shot bid for the White House. By
Leslie Wayne.

<P>
   SCI-LUNG-TEST (Gaithersburg, Md.) _ Doctors and scientists urged
the federal government Tuesday to start a large study of a new way
to detecting lung cancer as soon as possible _ seizing what they
see as a small window of time to learn if the method works before
it becomes so widely used that no one will test it. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OBESITY-HORMONE (Undated) _ In 1994, researchers discovered
leptin, a hormone that seemed to make fat mice slim. The following
year, to much fanfare, it was announced that humans made leptin
too, raising hopes that the hormone might do the same thing for
people that it did for the mice. But Tuesday, the first published
clinical study of leptin finds that the substance is not the weight
loss panacea that obesity researchers had hoped for. By Gina
Kolata.

 &HT;    He had it all, and we're already missing him

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Don't tell me Payne Stewart is dead.
</P>
<P>
   He's right there walking through a brushy field golden in the
Texas twilight holding hands with his wife, Tracey, after blowing a
golf tournament a long time ago . . . a long time before he was
famous for anything other than wearing those plus-fours britches.
</P>
<P>
   He's right there playing basketball under floodlights in a
buddy's driveway, and, yeah, maybe he is sipping a beer on the
dribble.
</P>
<P>
   He's right there sitting on the tailgate of my car slipping out
of his gold-tipped spikes talking about whatever comes to mind for
just minutes before he has to head home.
</P>
<P>
   He's right there eating lunch in the Muirfield Village grill
room laughing at me paying off a bet after his beloved Orlando
Magic took out the Chicago Bulls in the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He's right there a year later outside the Oakland Hills
clubhouse before a U.S. Open practice round paying back that money
after the Bulls swept the Magic in a playoff rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell me Payne Stewart is dead.
</P>
<P>
   He's right there, everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you see him?
</P>
<P>
   It's the nature of the business that friendships between sports
writers and the men and women they write about are rare. But those
friendships do happen from time to time, and one happened for me
with Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't see each other very often over the course of 15 years
_ and not at all, in fact, over the course of the last one _ but
there was always time for some conversation when we did get
together. Sometimes, if my schedule allowed it and he had an early
Thursday or Friday tee time at a major championship, my method of
checking out the golf course would be to follow his group from
inside the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   He won a few of those things, you know.
</P>
<P>
   He won a PGA Championship in 1989 when even he came to
understand how he was too brash and arrogant to enjoy it, and he
won a U.S. Open in 1991 that was mostly forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Open he won just this past summer at historic
Pinehurst was memorable. Stewart won it by rolling in a 15-foot par
putt on the final hole _ the longest winning putt in such
circumstance in the history of the event _ and celebrated in
unrestrained glee.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell me he's dead.
</P>
<P>
   He's right there, everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   That victory helped Stewart solidify a spot on the U.S. Ryder
Cup team for last month's matches, which he had agonized over
missing in 1995 and 1997. At least there is that. The last
significant mark Stewart made on golf was as part of a winning U.S.
team he one day hoped to captain while wrapped unapologetically in
the patriotic fervor of a competition he loved.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, there is only a miserable image of the burned
wreckage of a Learjet crashed into a field in South Dakota. When
that picture flashed onto a television set late Monday afternoon,
my mind retreated to that other field in the Texas twilight where a
young couple strolled away from a day's disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't have known how much wonder was in store for them
and the children, Chelsea and Aaron, who were yet to come into
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, for them to be able to find another golden place together.

THE 20,000-BOTTLE EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The next time you are trapped washing wine glasses
after the guests leave, cheer up. After each big tasting at the New
York Wine Experience last week, members of the staff at the
Marriott Marquis Hotel had to wash and dry some 27,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Everything at the Wine Experience, a three-day extravaganza for
wine buffs, was outsized, including the number of guests. About
1,100 signed up for the whole long weekend, and an additional 1,500
turned up on either Thursday or Friday evening to sample some of
the 350 wines that were being poured by representatives of 250
wineries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   At several of the sit-down tastings, 1,000 participants consumed
a total of more than 90 cases of wine. Twenty sommeliers worked
behind the scenes, opening, decanting and pouring more than 20,000
bottles of wine over three days.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Wine Experience is presented every two years by M.
Shanken Communications, the publisher of Wine Spectator and other
magazines. In alternate years, the California Wine Experience,
mostly featuring that state's wines, has been held in San
Francisco. The Wine Experience _ this was the 19th _ is the largest
regularly held wine event in this country but it is hardly a recent
phenomenon, nor is it the largest worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   That distinction probably goes to the Fete des Vignerons in
Switzerland, which dates back to the 14th century. It is held every
22 years, most recently last summer. A theatrical spectacle as well
as a wine fair, it attracted more than a million visitors to the
town of Vevey over a three-week period in July and August.
</P>
<P>
   The New York event also offered a banquet on Saturday featuring
the singer Gladys Knight, but the main entertainment was the
promotion of wines. Most of those who attended the Wine Experience
were relatively sophisticated wine drinkers; not too many neophytes
are likely to part with $950 for the weekend. And producers eagerly
showed them _ and got them to drink _ their wines.
</P>
<P>
   That the participants were fairly knowledgeable was evident from
the exhibitors they sought out at the ``Grand Tastings.'' A crowd
at the Chateau Mouton-Rothschild booth was no surprise, especially
with Baroness Philippine de Rothschild pouring, but almost as many
eager fans jostled for a chance to sample Ridge Vineyards' Monte
Bello cabernet sauvignon from the Santa Cruz Mountains, the premier
cru Puligny-Montrachet of the Domaine Leflaive in Burgundy and
Unico, the legendary wine of Vega Sicilia in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Though guests who attended only the two Grand Tastings paid $165
each, and showed determination by waiting in long lines, they were
able to taste wines worth considerably more than they paid. Besides
Mouton-Rothschild, Bordeaux was represented by Chateaux d'Yquem,
Margaux, Lynch-Bages and Rauzan-Segla, and Vieux-Chateau-Certan,
among many others.
</P>
<P>
   Rare Italian wines like Angelo Gaja's Alteni di Brassica
sauvignon blanc and Montevertine's Pergole Torte, from Tuscany,
were available.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the Wine Experience, many exhibitors were
content to show their less expensive wines. Now the Wine Experience
audience demands the best and, in most cases, they got it. Instead
of pouring its regular brut Champagne, Veuve Clicquot poured its
top-of-the-list Grande Dame. Instead of a tawny or some lesser
port, the Quinta do Noval poured its vint5. Each exhibitor
paid $1,200 to participate and was required to bring six cases, 72
bottles, of a single wine.
</P>
<P>
   One enticing tasting was on Saturday morning, when guests were
offered samples of wines from some of California's smallest and
most sought-after producers, including Patz &AMP; Hall, Testarossa
Vineyard, Flowers Vineyards and Winery, David Arthur Vineyards and
Howell Mountain Vineyards. Virtually unknown to the public, these
``cult'' wines are the ultimate goal of wealthy collectors.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, the cult wines are beautifully crafted and
long-lived. But their high prices reflect their scarcity as much as
their quality. Some of these wineries are so small that they had to
part with almost half a year's production to cover the Wine
Experience's needs.
</P>
<P>
   A tasting on Saturday afternoon featured wine from five of the
so-called super seconds, Bordeaux chateaus that match or better the
wines of some of the famous first- growth chateaus like Margaux and
Latour. Featured were the quite expensive wines of Chateaux Palmer,
Leoville-Barton, Pichon-Baron, Pichon-Lalande and Cos-d'Estournel.
</P>
<P>
   The Wine Experience is a nonprofit event. Income goes to a
scholarship fund to assist people studying for careers in the wine
industry. Beginning next year, the California Wine Experience will
begin moving from city to city nationwide. Its first stop will be
New York. Bringing the California event to the East will give the
New York wine lovers a chance to experience some 150 California
wines not normally poured at the New York Experience.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Wine Experience's biggest fans are the exhibitors. The
show gives them a chance to meet many of their competitors and
taste their wines, and to visit New York restaurants and perhaps
drum up some trade.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of the sommeliers, most of whom work for
well-known restaurants. Saskia Schuit, who has served as a
sommelier at every Wine Experience for 12 years, flies in from
Amsterdam, where she is an importer and brings in many California
and Washington State wines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I find out what's going on in my trade,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Wine Experience worth $950? The heat and the crowds can
be oppressive in the Grand Tastings and the long corridors of the
Marriott Marquis bear little resemblance to the Robert Mondavi
Winery or Chateau Lynch-Bages, but there is probably no better way
to sample so many of the world's best wines in one location.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day program was sold out by last May and the evening
tastings by September. Once $950 would buy a cellarful of wine.
Today it barely buys a case of good Bordeaux. Which probably makes
the Wine Experience a pretty good deal.

&HT;    WALL STREET JOURNAL   FLEXES ITS POLITICAL MUSCLE 
</HEADLINE>
 LEAD WRITETHROUGH-BOS  
 (Eds: Corrects spelling of disdained in 5th paragraph) (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   There is at least one ominous cloud beginning to threaten the
sunny candidacy of popular Republican frontrunner George W. Bush:
The editorial page of The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the staunchly conservative Journal has
belittled Bush's supposed lack of ideas, mocked his ``compassionate
conservative'' mantra, and in a piece headlined ``From Oil to
Baseball to the Governor's Mansion,'' portrayed him as a stumblebum
businessman who made his fortune trading off family ties and shady
insider connections.
</P>
<P>
   Given its moral certainty, energy, and combativeness, the
paper's opinion page is not simply a repository of lively
commentary. It is a serious journalistic mover and shaker that
likes to change the course of history.
</P>
<P>
   It is a page that helped invent supply-side economics years
before Ronald Reagan made it the cornerstone of US economic policy.
It is from there that editorial board member Dorothy Rabinowitz
launched the crusade that helped reopen the Fells Acres child
sex-abuse case in Massachusetts, and earlier this year, broke the
news that Juanita Broaddrick was accusing President Clinton of a
1978 sexual assault _ a story the paper's news side didn't deem
worthy of pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal was an early and vocal opponent of the now
widely-disdained Independent Counsel statute, frequently calling
for the scalp of Iran-Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh. Yet
its animus toward Clinton led the paper to treat Kenneth Starr as a
hero. A furious White House officially charged the ediorial page
with being a conduit of right-wing ``fringe stories,'' and in some
quarters, the Journal's bruising treatment of deputy White House
Counsel Vincent Foster is still blamed for Foster's suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Journal is not only the keeper of the conservative
flame, or what CNN senior political analyst William Schneider calls
``the enforcer of right wing political correctness,'' it is also a
major force in Republican national politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, when it comes to the Journal's editorial page, may be
battling both history and ideology. The paper never thought much of
his father's brand of moderate Republicanism, and so far, it seems
to believe that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokesman would say only that ``we look forward to
discussing the details of our economic and tax policy with them.''
Fred Barnes, executive editor of the conservative magazine, The
Weekly Standard, says an angry Journal might not derail the Bush
freight train. But he warns: ``It's powerful enough that he needs
to worry about it. If I were George W. Bush, I'd want to go and sit
down with Bob Bartley.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley, the shy, retiring 62-year-old Iowan who has run the
Journal's editorial page for 27 years, is far from a household
name, nor is he a member of TV's talking head circuit. He wouldn't
catch your eye at a cocktail party, but his stature at the nation's
largest circulation daily is obvious. Even though he has no
involvement in the news operation, he holds the paper's top title _
editor.
</P>
<P>
   Bartley loves nothing better than a good fight, and his
aggressive reporting ethos, wrecking ball rhetoric and polarizing
views make him one of the most powerful _ and controversial _
journalists in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 PBS piece _ ``Thunder From the Right'' _ called the
Journal's editorial page ``perhaps the most influential, the most
articulate, the most ferocious opinion page in the country.''
Writing in The Weekly Standard, former Journal editorial staffer
David Brooks declared that ``more than any other journalist,
Bartley takes risks, staking out wildly audacious positions and
launching wildly unconventional attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He does stand as a kind of icon to a couple of generations of
young . . . conservatives who really do see the Journal editorial
page as the ultimate source of wisdom on a number of issues,'' adds
Journal publisher and Dow Jones chairman Peter Kann.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Critics accuse Bartley of running the most
lopsided and mean-spirited editorial page in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are very talented polemicists, but for them,
journalism is just an instrument for political ax grinding,'' says
Newsweek senior editor Jonathan Alter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were only a shade removed from Richard Mellon Scaife,''
adds former White House press secretary Mike McCurry, referring to
the conservative billionaire who White House allies view as a
leading fomentor of bizarre anti-Clinton tales. ``There were . . .
times that (their stuff) was just so kooky.''
</P>
<P>
   Revere him or revile him, Bartley is a man whose mystery is his
split personality. There is the mild and quiet soul who is
worshiped by his colleagues: At a party marking his 25th
anniversary running the editorial page, former staffer Seth Lipsky
declared that Bartley ``is probably more loved by those who worked
for him than any editor in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is the relentless assassin at the keyboard who
imparted his core philosophy _ ``all you need is arrogance to write
editorials'' _ to his very first editorial page hire, and who uses
the term ``muzzle velocity'' to describe the bone-shattering impact
he strives to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Kann offers the best theory for reconciling the two
Bartleys. ``He takes delight in controversy,'' the publisher says.
But ``if Bob wants to piss people off, he might as well piss the
country off instead of you, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Journal's editorial philosophy is ``free markets
and free people,'' although Bartley likes to think of his staff as
``18th century liberals.'' (In the 20th century, he explains, big
government has replaced King George as the enemy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's editorial page advocates a muscular foreign policy
that harkens back to the Cold War. It abhors taxes, opposes
increasing the minimum wage, doesn't like unions and rails against
government regulation of the private sector. It's led a tireless
campaign against product liability litigation, decrying lawsuits
against the tobacco, gun and automobile industries and
characterizing trial lawyers as ``the plaintiff bar mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley's minions leave no doubt where they stand in the culture
wars. After the 1993 murder of an abortion doctor, a Journal
editorial dug back a quarter century to blame the 60's, saying
America ``began to tip off the emotional tracks'' during the
anti-war protests at the 1968 Democratic national convention. When
American women captured the World Cup in soccer earlier this year,
the Journal scolded those who saw the win as a victory for gender
equity as ``professional ax-grinders.'' And after hearing that the
Miss America pageant might accept contestants who had been married
or had an abortion, the Journal suggested ``leaving the freak shows
to Atlantic City and moving Miss America to Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Bartley's overarching passion has been a fierce
assault on the occupant of the White House. As proof, the Journal
has published a five-volume collection _ totalling 2,784 pages _ of
Clinton and Whitewater commentary taken from its editorial pages.
</P>
<P>
   The drumbeat never stops, even in these days of ``Clinton
fatigue.'' Hillary Clinton's presumptive Senate candidacy in New
York has already been dismissed as a doomed enterprise. And a
Journal editorial can still muster up the disdain to compare the
president to O.J. Simpson, or blame Clinton for Dan Quayle's
withdrawal as a presidential candidate, claiming the president has
elevated ``money and biography above ideas in our politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley's most explosive scrutiny of Clinton came last February,
just a week after the draining impeachment drama drew to a close,
when Rabinowitz broke the news of Broaddrick's allegations.
Rabinowitz didn't want the Broaddrick assignment. ``I resisted the
idea,'' she says. ``I don't break down doors.'' But Bartley
persisted and the Journal's expose forced the dramatic charges,
which the White House denied, into the headlines. (NBC, which had
conducted the first interview with Broaddrick but delayed airing
it, broadcast the story five days after the Journal piece.)

A TRIBUTE TO ITALY'S FARM COOKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy)  (Eds: Recipe appears at end of review.) (DW) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lynne Rosetto Kasper's impeccable first book, ``The Splendid
Table'' (William Morrow, 1992), finely captured the cooking of
Emilia-Romagna in north-central Italy. So I was disappointed at
first to see that in her latest book, ``The Italian Country Table''
(Scribner, $35), Ms. Kasper decided to explore the farmhouse
cooking of the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   Italy is well known for the distinct culinary traditions of its
regions. Why would Ms. Kasper, a scholarly writer, think that she
could distill the rustic cooking of all of them in a single volume?
She answers this question in the very first lines of the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I drive down country roads in Italy,'' she writes,
``I wonder what people are cooking in the those farmhouses I pass,
what their lives are like, what stories they have to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kasper is more than merely curious, though. She is keenly
aware of the fragility of this way of life _ of people living close
to the land, trying to preserve centuries-old cooking methods.
Without sentiment, she tells short tales from remote corners, and
together, they give you a strong sense of what is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kasper can take you to a place, have you smell it, hear its
voices and teach you something _ all in the space of a paragraph.
Mostly, though, she makes you want to cook.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes in this book lack an obvious cohesiveness. On one
page there may be a potato recipe from northern Italy with
mushrooms, butter and cheese, and on the next page one from Naples
with bread, peas and mozzarella. The ingredients have little
relation to one another, but the rustic, wholesome style of cooking
makes them work well together.
</P>
<P>
   I began with Margherita's crushed buttermilk potatoes. They are
named for a farm woman in the Alto Adige region who simmers
potatoes in the buttermilk left from churning butter. Only salt,
pepper and a little butter are added at the end. The dish is
fortifying and pure in flavor, as country food should be.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kasper's recipes are authentic, but she knows when to
compensate for the failings of some American ingredients. For
example, in a recipe for linguine dressed with a pesto made of
almonds, mint and fine olive oil, she added pistachios to make up
for any lack of flavor in American almonds.
</P>
<P>
   Every aspect of a dish, even a simple one, is well thought out.
In a salad of tart greens, red onion and dried basil, the onions
are first soaked in ice water to crisp them and mellow their bite.
The salad is dressed at the very last minute, at the table.
</P>
<P>
   A potato pizza with parsley, orange zest, dried oregano and red
onion is roasted at 500 degrees, which produces a crisped sheet of
sliced potatoes tangled with the aromatics. A rosemary pear pizza
was the only recipe I was disappointed with. There was too much
cinnamon, and I could not taste the rosemary, basil and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kasper wants you to cook the Italian way and do it
correctly. She helps you do this, but she also sets some things
straight. ``Pasta snobbery aside, fresh and dried pastas are not
better or worse than each other, only different,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   It seems as though she were watching over your shoulder as you
cook. In the last step of a pasta recipe, she firmly notes, ``No
cheese is used here.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the book Ms. Kasper introduces the reader to people
she has met throughout Italy and tells their stories. This makes
for interesting reading and gives you a sense of the wealth of
information to be discovered, if, like Ms. Kasper, you simply knock
on the right doors.

LEAVING SYDNEY TO DINE IN PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKHEATH, New South Wales _ For more than a century,
Sydneysiders have sought relief from urban woes in the magnificent
Blue Mountains just two hours to the west, and in recent years some
of the city's best chefs have joined them.
</P>
<P>
   This is an area of striking beauty. Escarpments of sedimentary
rock tower above blue-green eucalyptus forests filled with
brilliantly colored birds _ black and white currawongs, whose
early-morning jabber renders alarm clocks redundant; Australian
king parrots, whose scarlet plumage must be the most vivid in the
natural world, and greedy little pink and gray galahs.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours, yes, but the city seems a million miles away. There
is nothing but the occasional soulful whistle of a train to intrude
upon the calm, silent nights.
</P>
<P>
   The widely spaced villages are cheerfully stuck in the 1930s.
The atmosphere, though not, of course, the food or the culture,reminded me of the hill stations that the British built in India
and Malaya. Each September, with the arrival of the antipodean
spring, streets blaze with camellias and cherry blossoms. Each
November, there is a rhododendron festival.
</P>
<P>
   Two utterly different places, Cleopatra and Vulcan's, lead the
restaurant pack here.
</P>
<P>
   Cleopatra _ 118 Cleopatra Street, Blackheath, (011)
61-2-4787-8456 _ is the domain of Dany Chouet, who comes from
Bergerac in the Dordogne, and her front-of-house partner, Trish
Hobbs, who worked in advertising. They have turned a 19th-century
bungalow surrounded by a cast-iron veranda and a cosseting garden
into a paradisiacal restaurant with five bedrooms attached.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chouet's dishes bear the unmistakable stamp of southwestern
France, with bold, memory-stirring flavors. One cool night, she
served a tenderloin of venison napped with a bracing poivrade sauce
(with chestnuts, mushrooms and apple slices for garnish) and an
absolutely authentic cassoulet, chock-full of meaty bits, including
duck confit, pork belly and Toulouse-style sausage. To finish,
there were French cheeses in prime condition and a little cylinder
of cakelike chocolate with molten chocolate inside.
</P>
<P>
   This is deceptively simple, unashamedly old-fashioned French
provincial cooking, real Elizabeth David stuff, the kind that was
once the gold standard of good eating. Sadly, it is disappearing.
When is the last time you saw braised endive on a menu? Or rabbit
pie? Or mouclade, a gratin of mussels with just a touch of curry?
You see them on Ms. Chouet's. If you order them, they taste as they
used to, as they ought to.
</P>
<P>
   Poivrade sauce for the venison was made from a richly flavored,
perfectly clarified meat stock (perhaps from the venison bones and
trimmings?). The menu sang no songs about the pate with which I
started, but it was all that anyone could have asked: rough
textured and peppery, just the thing to stir the appetite for the
joys to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to Australia in 1970, there was not a leek in
sight,'' Ms. Chouet told us. ``You went to the market and found
big, tough cabbages, oranges, iceberg lettuce. `Where are the
Italians?' I finally asked. Of course, they had leeks, but nobody
else did. Things have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Vulcan's _ 33 Govetts Leap Road, Blackheath, (011)
61-2-4787-6899 _ is a tiny place built around an ancient,
wood-fired baker's oven, which Phillip Searle, a self-taught cook
who started as a dishwasher, uses to brilliant effect. Brick walls,
a concrete floor, moody landscapes by the chef, a pair of huge
mirrors and sleek modern chairs from Finland create a warming mood.
</P>
<P>
   Open only on weekends, Vulcan's offers only three choices at
each stage. But what imagination lies behind the choices! One
starter was a duck sausage atop a slaw of sorts, made from savoy
cabbage and mint, with daikon strips adding punch and variety of
texture. Another was a plate of noodles in a spicy broth with crab
meat, chopped scallion greens and the scooped-out flesh of a small
Japanese eggplant, smoke-roasted in the oven's firebox.
</P>
<P>
   Two main courses reminded us of English Sunday lunch,
transformed by Asian spices: pot-roasted blade of beef subtly
flavored with star anise, and gingered, oven-roasted pork on
shredded vegetables. Searle is famous all over Australia (rightly
so) for his checkerboard ice cream, a kind of semifreddo with
flavor squares of vanilla, pineapple and licorice. But the baked
quince is nothing to sneeze at, when it is in season.
</P>
<P>
   Other dishes, lovingly described by Vulcan's fans who eat there
a lot, suggest the range of Searle's talents. Some days, he makes
what he calls an Atlantic salmon pie, which is just a down-home
name for coulibiac. Other days, he roasts a leg of lamb marinated
in hoisin sauce, then fans out slices on wilted Chinese cabbage.
For dessert, the repertory includes pear tarts and slow-baked
Bilpin apples with thick cream.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, immense care is lavished on coffee, brewed
with a whoosh in an old Pavoni machine. Sourdough bread from the
Blackheath Bakery and the sublimely yellow butter are discerningly
chosen.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like most spots in the mountains, both of these are BYOB. Stop
at Ian Cook's splendid Five Ways Cellars to stock up before leaving
Sydney, or shop at Barmans in Leura, one of the main towns in the
mountains. My wife, Betsey, and I found some superb bottles at Five
Ways, including a 1990 Yarra Yering Pinot Noir, a big, barnyardy
brute of a wine made by the droll Dr. Bailey Carrodus, a wine
pioneer of the Yarra Valley near Melbourne. It went well with Ms.
Chouet's venison and cassoulet.
</P>
<P>
   If toting your own wine seems too much trouble, the answer is
Darley's _ Lillianfels Avenue, Echo Point, Katoomba, (011)
61-2-4780-1200 _ the dining room of the rather starchy Lillianfels
hotel. It overlooks one of the grander sights in the region, the
weatherbeaten rocks called the Three Sisters.
</P>
<P>
   No place for serious eaters, you might guess, but you would be
wrong. Ralph Potter, the chef, another refugee from Sydney, has
turned to local streams, forests and farmers for brook trout, wild
mushrooms, squab, pheasant and lamb. (Try it smoked and corned with
poached vegetables.) The wine list features choices from nearby
areas like Mudgee, Cowra and Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Potter's specialty is long, slow cooking, which produces a dark,
unctuous dish of pork cheeks, often on the menu, and what Terry
Durack, a Sydney food critic, recently celebrated as ``a casserole
of lush, louche, fall-apart braised duck in a red-wine jus that's
as sticky as treacle.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his foreword to the new ``Second Avenue Deli
Cookbook: Recipes and Memories From Abe Lebewohl's Legendary
Kitchen,'' Jack Lebewohl writes of his brother's murder:
</P>
<P>
   ``After he was shot, when the family was sitting shiva, one of
his regular dining companions came up to me and said: `I had lunch
with Abe the day before he died. It's such a pity; he was on a
diet, and he hardly ate anything. I know he would have wanted his
last meals to be spectacular.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him not to feel too bad. He was the fourth person to
tell me he had had lunch with Abe that day. And I believe every one
of them was telling me the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lebewohl, 51, sat down to talk recently during a hectic
lunch hour at the deli on Second Avenue at 10th Street with Abe
Lebewohl's daughter Sharon, 40, who wrote the book with Rena
Bulkin. It is a tribute to the man who inspired it, a man who gave
away almost as much food as he sold _ to homeless people, people in
between jobs, people who just loved to eat as much as he did. He
understood the joy of food better than almost anyone. On St.
Patrick's Day, he made green matzoh balls.
</P>
<P>
   The cookbook, published by Villard ($24.95), includes all the
deli's specialties: the decadent chopped liver, homey chicken soup
with matzoh balls (the white kind), kasha varnishkes and cholent,
which Lebewohl was fond of calling ``the Jewish cassoulet.'' The
book also includes favorite recipes from some of Lebewohl's
favorite people (and customers), which is why you can find Bobby
Flay's yellow corn pancakes with smoked salmon and mango-serrano
creme fraiche next to the deli's own potato latkes.
</P>
<P>
   Since Abe Lebewohl was killed on the morning of March 4, 1996,
on his way to the bank with a $13,000 deposit, his family has
adopted its own time line to measure their lives. For Jack Lebewohl
it is, ``before (or after) my brother was shot.'' For Sharon
Lebewohl it is ``before (or after) my father was shot.'' Before,
Jack Lebewohl worked as a lawyer in private practice. After, he
took over the deli. Before, Sharon Lebewohl worked as a nurse and
raised three children, first in Israel, then on Long Island. After,
she made her job ``keeping his spirit alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wanted to be at the deli,'' she said. ``This is where
I feel my father, where I talk to him. After he was shot, I had a
dream that he was standing at the register, talking on the phone.
And I said: `What are you doing here? You got shot.' I showed him
all the newspaper clippings. And he got angry with me and said:
`Leave me alone, Sharon. I've got a business to run.' It was a
message. It shook me up so.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is understandable. But for a brother who achieved the
immigrant dream of becoming a lawyer, a professional, to abandon
that to run a deli? Indeed, at Abe Lebewohl's funeral, Sharon
Lebewohl read from a letter she had written to her father, which
said in part: ``As a kid, I was ashamed. So many of my friends'
fathers were lawyers and doctors, and you were a deli man. Then it
changed 360 degrees. You were my hero.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Jack Lebewohl, there was no question about continuing
his brother's work. ``My brother and I were unusually close,'' he
said. ``If this had happened to me, no one would have had to worry.
My brother would have taken care of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The deli has also been a part of his life since childhood. When
the family arrived in New York in 1950 from a displaced-persons
camp in Italy, Abe Lebewohl was 19 years old, and Jack was 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 6 years old when the deli started in 1954,'' he
recalled. ``And always _ when I was in high school, college and law
school _ I delivered orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Lebewohl came to the deli every day to do her homework.
Thanksgiving was a day ``of delivering orders,'' she said, ``and
then we would have dinner in the deli _ we were too tired to
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``And my father always talked about having a
cookbook.'' When she wrote it, Ms. Lebewohl decided to emphasize
her father's twin passions for food and friends by adding
reminiscences from many of the people whose lives he touched.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Nieporent, an owner of Nobu and Montrachet, writes about a
party he gave for the French chef Paul Bocuse. He had asked New
York celebrity chefs to bring their signature dishes, none of which
impressed Bocuse as much as a bust of him that Lebewohl had
sculptured from chopped liver _ complete with a ribbon around the
neck made of red pepper strips and a lemon slice to represent the
Legion of Honor medal he always wore.
</P>
<P>
   Memories like these, of course, only intensify the frustration
that Lebewohl's killers have never been found, though the family
says it is satisfied with the Police Department's efforts. Lt.
Arthur Monahan said the investigation is still active and that
three detectives are assigned to the case. ``There is a $100,000
reward for any information,'' he said, ``but I'm not going to
mislead you. We're not closer.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The reward sign hangs on the deli's front door, marring the new
facade by Adam Tihany, better known for his work on places like
Remi and Le Cirque 2000. He and Abe Lebewohl met in 1993 when
Lebewohl recruited him for a mission: to open the first kosher
restaurant in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lebewohl's enthusiasm never flagged, he was no match for
the corruption he encountered in the Russian government, his family
says. The restaurant never opened. But he had also discussed
renovating the deli with Tihany; after his death, the family went
ahead with his plans.
</P>
<P>
   The charm of Tihany's changes is that they didn't change much.
Just as the charm of the deli remains the combination of
traditional kosher food served with a family touch. Ms. Lebewohl
and her uncle laugh about a waitress who chooses the menu each
night for a regular customer. ``She'll say: `No, you had meat last
night _ tonight you have chicken,''' Lebewohl said. ``And he
listens to her!''
</P>
<P>
   The staff also tells customers why ordering pastrami or corned
beef extra-lean is a mistake: the fat adds taste, and removing it
is as heinous a crime as eating the meat on white bread with
mayonnaise. But some people, especially tourists, don't listen.
``The customer is always right, even when he's wrong,'' Lebewohl
said, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Lebewohl's widow, Eleanor, comes to the deli nightly. ``My
mother's an amazing woman,'' Ms. Lebewohl said. ``I couldn't
imagine how she would survive, because her whole life was around my
father. But she joined bereavement groups, goes out with friends
and gets to the deli around 9.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lebewohl's younger sister, Felicia, a lawyer, lives in New
Rochelle. Have Ms. Lebewohl and her uncle thought about succession?
Granted, at the ages of 40 and 51, it may be unnecessary, but if
life has taught this family anything, it is to expect the
unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 17-year-old son, Tzvi, loves the deli,'' she said. ``He
worked here with my father, went with him every morning to the fish
market at 5 a.m. Last summer, he worked at a deli on Long Island as
a counterman and waiter. My father had taught him how to cut meat.
The owner was impressed. `You have it in the blood,' he said.''
</P>
<P>
   On cue, Lebewohl chimed in. ``He should get an education first.
I'm a better deli man today because I'm a lawyer.'' What do his
peers think of his life decision? He grinned. ``They're all
jealous, actually,'' he said. ``Many lawyers think the grass is
always greener somewhere else. But I still have a hand in. I have
an office upstairs. And everyone wants to have a closing here
because I serve food.''
</P>
<P>
   So, life goes on. A small park at St. Mark's Church
in-the-Bowery, across the street from the deli, has been renamed
Abe Lebewohl Park. It is the memorial complement to the Yiddish
Theater Walk of Fame that adorns the sidewalk outside the deli, a
favorite project of Lebewohl's during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, even at almost 3 p.m., the counter was jammed. Lebewohl
ran his eye over boxes filled for delivery, swatted by the door
every time someone else came in. His brother would be pleased that
his deli is still such a destination. Lebewohl nodded and recalled
a favorite family story.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time Abe went to Le Cirque,'' he said. ``Some people came
over and asked, `Abe, what are you doing here?' He told them he
didn't like the food. They laughed and said, `Let's get out of here

VICTIMS' FAMILIES WILL SUE MOTEL IN YOSEMITE WHERE MURDERER
WORKED

<P>
   EUREKA, Calif. _ Contending there are issues at stake that a
criminal case can't address, attorneys for the Sund and Pelosso
families say they will file wrongful death lawsuits against the
confessed killer of three family members and the Yosemite motel
that employed him.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suits, which seek unspecified damages from Cary
Stayner and the Cedar Lodge motel, are to be filed Wednesday in
Fresno County Superior Court on behalf of Jens Sund and his three
minor children, and the Argentine family of Silvina Pelosso.
Stayner has confessed to killing Carole and Juli Sund, and Pelosso,
a Sund family friend, after encountering the three sightseers Feb.
15 at the Cedar Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money isn't really the issue. It's about accountability,''
said Eureka lawyer Zachary Zwerdling, who represents Jens Sund and
his children.
</P>
<P>
   Zwerdling on Monday said Jens Sund, who has maintained a low
profile since his wife's and daughter's killings, was somewhat
reluctant about filing a civil lawsuit because of the further
attention it might draw to his family. ``But this is one way for
the family to deal with its grief, and make some good happen out of
these terrible deaths,'' said Zwerdling.
</P>
<P>
   Zwerdling said Jens Sund had concerns that he feels could go
largely unnoticed during Stayner's criminal trial on state and
federal murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   These concerns involve motel policies on background checks for
employees, why the three women were put in a remote wing of the
motel where few other rooms were occupied, and whether the room
itself had proper locks.
</P>
<P>
   By filing the lawsuits, Zwerdling said, Jens Sund wants ``to
send a message to the community that motels and other places that
offer lodging to the public need to be held to the highest standard
of care as far as protection of their patrons.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Zwerdling said Sund questioned why the three women
were not in a room closer to the lodge office rather than in a
nearly empty wing out of sight of motel workers. He's worried that
motels catering to unsuspecting tourists from around the world do
not probe deeply enough into the background of their employees,
said Zwerdling.
</P>
<P>
   ``At issue for us is whether the motel checked into Stayner's
background at all,'' said Zwerdling.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Rankin, a spokesman for the Cedar Lodge, declined Monday
to address the issues raised by Jens Sund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to comment on something that we haven't
seen,'' said Rankin. Rankin said the Fischer family of Mariposa
County, which owns the lodge and five other motels in the Yosemite
area, might issue a statement when the lawsuits are filed.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner, 38, lived and worked at the lodge where Carole and Juli
Sund and Silvina Pelosso were last seen alive. Although questioned
by the FBI, Stayner was not a suspect in their killings until he
confessed to the July 21 murder of Yosemite naturalist Joie
Armstrong. He has since confessed to killing all four women.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, state charges were filed against Stayner in
connection with the three women's deaths. Stayner already faced the
death penalty as the result of murder charges filed by federal
prosecutors in connection with Armstrong's death.

DROP IN CRIME ATTRIBUTED TO DRUG TREATMENT, COUNSELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ New York City may get all the attention for its
noticeably lower crime rate, but San Francisco has had a larger
statistical drop in crime, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, violent crime in San Francisco has fallen by 33
percent, compared with 26 percent for New York. At the same time,
San Francisco also has had a decline in the number of
incarcerations, from 2,136 in 1993 to 703 in 1998, according to the
study conducted by the Justice Policy Institute, a project of the
Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The study acknowledged a concurrent downward spiral in crime
nationwide, pointing to tougher laws that have led to longer
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But it argued that those were not the only solutions to crime,
saying San Francisco has had success using an array of programs
that provide an alternative to serving jail time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study debunks the notion that longer and more punitive
sentences are the most effective ways to fight crime,'' said Khaled
Taqi-Eddin, an analyst for the Center on Juvenile and Criminal
Justice and co-author of the report. ``If you think sending more
people to prison for longer sentences is what's behind the drop in
crime, how can you explain San Francisco?''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco District Attorney Terence Hallinan cited as
contributing factors his office's array of diversion programs,
including drug treatment, job training and counseling. He also
acknowledged that other factors played a role, including a healthy
economy, which offers more job opportunities, an aging population
and the ``three-strikes'' law, which has taken some of the more
dangerous career criminals off the streets by threatening repeat
offenders with harsher prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The study contrasted San Francisco's approach to crime to that
of New York, where there has been a crackdown on even low-level
crimes such as jaywalking and public intoxication.
</P>
<P>
   The study drew on the latest available data compiled by the FBI,
the Census Bureau, the California Criminal Justice Statistics
Center, the California Youth Authority and the California
Department of Corrections.

TUTORING IS FOUND TO HELP BOTH PARTIES

 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl)

   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Tutoring can help the tutor as much as the
tutored.
</P>
<P>
   A program developed by University of Florida researchers sends
high school students into elementary and middle schools with the
aim of improving the skills of both the high schoolers and the
youngsters they tutor. And according to a new study, the effort is
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even high school students, given instruction and the proper
educational environment, can improve their reading skills,'' said
Jeanette Schiffbauer, a researcher and teacher at UF's P.K. Yonge
Developmental Research School and one of the developers of the
ongoing study. ``To me, the message is, there is a way to help all
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The program is now in its second full year at P.K. Yonge, where
there are 52 student tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Students who scored lower than 300 on a scale of 100 to 500 on
the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, a statewide measure of
reading skills and comprehension, were selected to participate last
year. Researchers expanded the program this year to include all
students.
</P>
<P>
   To become tutors, the students take a special class that offers
an English elective credit, said researcher Nancy Dean, who also
helped develop the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we learn in the class is put into practice,'' she
said. ``It's very satisfying to kids that they're not just learning
something that they have to wait years from now to see the reward.
They see it tomorrow when they're tutoring their children.''
</P>
<P>
   To assess how much the students' reading abilities changed
during the study, Schiffbauer and Dean administered a reading test
in the fall, before the program began, and again in the spring.
Student tutors' test scores improved significantly over that period
of time.
</P>
<P>
   Tutors become more sensitive to what reading is, how it's taught
and the strategies that go into it, Dean said. Their
self-confidence grows and they become leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know they're making a significant difference in someone's
life,'' she said. ``That's very powerful.''

either side of her without bother, as though she were just a shadow
cast on the water by billowy clouds. If it weren't for a small
historical marker a half-mile away on the edge of Pelican Island,
curious ferryboat riders and saltwater fishermen could only guess
at the identity of the aged gray, ghostlike ruin. The constant wash
of the bay has dulled her once sharp definition. She is the SS

YOUNG'S FUTURE WITH 49ERS STILL UNCERTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE ADAMS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ San Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve
Young will be taking some time this week to consult with at least
one more neurologist on his future in football, amid indications
that he has already been told to stop playing.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that Young, 38, would be visiting with a least
one other doctor follows indications that Dr. Gary Steinberg,
Young's neurologist, has apparently given the quarterback a
discouraging prognosis on the risk of playing again in the wake of
repeated concussions.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Mariucci, saying he couldn't violate the
confidentiality of talks between Young and Steinberg, did indicate
that Young wasn't happy with the diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't completely excited about what he's learned so far,''
Mariucci said Monday at his weekly news conference. ``He wasn't
excited about playing in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci's comments were significant in that they were the
closest anyone in authority has come to saying that Young has been
told to retire. They also marked a departure in the official 49er
line, coming just one week after Mariucci declined to discuss
Young's condition at his weekly conference.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback hasn't played since the Sept. 27 win over the
Arizona Cardinals, when he left the game with a concussion. The
concussion was at least his fourth in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Young has conceded that Steinberg had not given him an
encouraging medical report.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers do not have a game this week and Mariucci said Young,
who has remained with the team although he hasn't been in uniform
the last four games, would take advantage of the bye week to seek
``at least one more, if not two'' medical opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Even with medical clearances, Mariucci would not specifically
say that Young would be put back in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be something we'd think real hard about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci downplayed suggestions that Young was shopping around
for a favorable medical opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is very thorough in whatever he does,'' Mariucci said.
``He is in the evaluation process. ... He's been determined to play
again from the start. But he's also gathering information. He's not
going to make a quick decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Young has played with the 49ers since 1987. He has been a
perennial All-Pro, owns a bevy of NFL records and is considered a
certain inductee into the Hall of Fame.

 &HT;    GORE-BRADLEY MEET TONIGHT AT CRITICAL POINT IN THEIR CAMPAIGNS
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and Political (p) categories
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic presidential candidates Al Gore and Bill
Bradley are set for a high-stakes confrontation at a Dartmouth
College town meeting tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Their joint appearance in a nationally televised meeting with
voters comes at a critical point in both of their campaigns for the
party's 2000 nomination.
</P>
<P>
   They are virtually tied in public opinion polls in New
Hampshire, the first state that will host a presidential primary
next year. And their side-by-side appearance tonight is likely to
create impressions that will linger with the state's notoriously
independent minded voters.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the stakes in tonight's event are especially high. It
is the primetime premiere of his retooled campaign and one of his
last chances to connect with voters on a personal level.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has spent several days in New Hampshire rehearsing, not
with Bradley stand-ins, but in his own meetings with uncommitted
voters. His objective has been to make people realize he is
something more than a loyal vice president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about the best kind of preparation you can do,'' said
Kiki Moore, Gore's campaign press secretary. ``It's a chance for
him to connect with voters, a chance to show them who he is and
what he believes in.''
</P>
<P>
   The rehearsals have also given Gore a chance to harness the
potentially disastrous killer instincts that can surface when he
finds himself in the role of the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president likes to campaign this way,'' White House
adviser James Carville noted in a recent discussion with reporters
about Gore's new aggressiveness in campaigning against Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Turque, a Newsweek correspondent and the author of an
upcoming biography of Gore, said the vice president is following
the instincts that have made him a winner in five congressional
campaigns, two Senate races and two as President Clinton's running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has an instinct for the jugular, his Boy Scout demeanor
notwithstanding,'' said Turque. ``There was none of this talk about
him being stiff in 1988. It was all about how hard charging and
nasty he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's current stump speech includes criticism of Bradley for
voting for Reagan tax cuts, voting against welfare reform, voting
for an experiment with school vouchers and quitting the Senate
after the Newt Gingrich-led takeover of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia, noted Gore's tendency to be strident in campaigns. Such
an approach against Bradley could reinforce impressions among
voters that Gore lacks a presidential demeanor, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe stridency is vice presidential but not presidential,''
Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took no prisoners in 1988, his first campaign for
president. In debates, he was especially harsh in his criticism of
Dick Gephardt, now the Democratic leader in the House. It took Gore
years to mend fences.
</P>
<P>
   Start Optional Trim
</P>
<P>
   Gore's hard-charging campaign style in 1988 also inadvertently
led Republicans to Willie Horton, the rapist-murderer who was
furloughed in Massachusetts during the governorship of Michael
Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   In the final Democratic debate in New York that year, Gore
commented on the Massachusetts furlough program, but without
mentioning Horton by name. He then asked Dukakis, ``If you were
elected president, would you advocate a similar program for federal
penitentiaries?''
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis evaded the issue with Gore and eventually won the 1988
Democratic nomination. But Republicans tracked down the details of
the Horton case and used them effectively in TV ads that questioned
Dukakis' commitment against crime.
</P>
<P>
   End Optional Trim
</P>
<P>
   Gore strategists had hoped that tonight's event would allow for
more give-and-take between the two candidates, an opportunity for
the vice president to contrast himself with Bradley the way he did
with Dukakis nearly a dozen years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But tonight's format calls for Gore and Bradley to share the
stage in fielding questions from an audience that has been screened
to represent a cross section of New Hampshire voters. Under the
guidelines, moderators Bernard Shaw of CNN and Karen Brown of
WMUR-TV of Manchester can cut off any response deemed a personal
attack.
</P>
<P>
   There may be little in the way of contrast between Gore and
Bradley, however. During the years they spent together in the
Senate, they voted together about 80 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic difficulty is a lack of ammunition,'' said Dick
Morris, the former Clinton White House political adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong town meeting, sponsored by CNN and WMUR-TV, New
Hampshire's largest TV station, is scheduled to be broadcast
tonight at 8 EST.
</P>
<P>
   endit
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is going to be about change, and the vice
president has to persuade people that he represents change,'' said
Stan Greenberg, the former White House pollster. ``It can be done,
but it's not going to be easy.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley will put their struggle for the Democratic
presidential nomination on display Wednesday night when they engage
in their first of seven scheduled debates on nationwide television.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats will appear before an audience of New
Hampshire voters in a town meeting-style question-and-answer
session at Dartmouth College that was designed to avoid any direct
exchanges between Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are sharpening their criticism of their rival.
</P>
<P>
   Gore accused Bradley of pursuing ``an old-style approach'' with
a $65 billion plan to expand health insurance coverage to millions
of uninsured and a $10 billion blueprint to combat child poverty.
Gore favors reserving much of the federal budget surplus to
shore-up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people have the time to analyze what he is actually
proposing, they're in for a real surprise,'' Gore said in an
interview with Time magazine published Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to Gore's rhetorical jabs, Bradley explained: ``You can
only take the elbows so many times.'' But Bradley continues to
portray himself as above the messy political fray, insisting that
he wants to give voters ``someone to vote for'' rather than
alienating them with bitter personal exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Shaw, a broadcaster for the Cable News Network, and

   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley will put their struggle for the Democratic
presidential nomination on display Wednesday night when they engage
in their first of seven scheduled debates on nationwide television.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats will appear before an audience of New
Hampshire voters in a town meeting-style question-and-answer
session at Dartmouth College that was designed to avoid any direct
exchanges between Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are sharpening their criticism of their rival.
</P>
<P>
   Gore accused Bradley of pursuing ``an old-style approach'' with
a $65 billion plan to expand health insurance coverage to millions
of uninsured and a $10 billion blueprint to combat child poverty.
Gore favors reserving much of the federal budget surplus to
shore-up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people have the time to analyze what he is actually
proposing, they're in for a real surprise,'' Gore said in an
interview with Time magazine published Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to Gore's rhetorical jabs, Bradley explained: ``You can
only take the elbows so many times.'' But Bradley continues to
portray himself as above the messy political fray, insisting that
he wants to give voters ``someone to vote for'' rather than
alienating them with bitter personal exchanges.
</P>

RAIDERS STARS RARING TO GO DESPITE INJURIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRIAN MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. _ If the Oakland Raiders' last quarterback had
the public image of a whiny malcontent, consider Rich Gannon the
emblem of this year's new Raider attitude, everything anti-Jeff
George.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon is a tough Irish guy from Philadelphia. He led a comeback
win over the Jets with tons of guile on Sunday. And he just wants
to play as soon as this Sunday against the 5-1 Miami Dolphins at
the Coliseum, despite a broken bone in his left, non-throwing,
wrist suffered on his game-winning touchdown throw.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he didn't even let on that a bone was broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sprained my wrist,'' Gannon said, as a splint held the
left wrist in place.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jon Gruden had spilled the beans earlier Monday, talking
of Gannon's ``very questionable,'' in Gruden's words, status for
the Dolphins game, about the Raiders' hope to somehow fit Gannon
with a soft cast that will allow him to play and take the jolting
sensation of a snapped football some 77 times a game.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon seemed unconcerned by the talk. He said to plan on seeing
him on Sunday, and pointed out that he took a snap after the
injury, on the Raiders' final play of the game, a kneel-down with
11 seconds left after Oakland had intercepted the Jets' final
attempt at a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a snap after it happened, so I can take a snap without
any support,'' Gannon said. ``I felt some pain, but I didn't feel
any noise or crack. ... I think I'm going to be OK. I don't think
it's anything that needs to be casted. I want to play and that's my
goal, to play every game this season.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, for now, is that.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing thing is, Gruden sounded more concerned about Gannon
than he did running back Tyrone Wheatley, the AFC's eighth-leading
rusher. Wheatley spent Sunday night in a hospital with a back
injury so scary the Raiders carted him off the field, an injury
suffered when Wheatley was crunched by Jets defenders Jason
Ferguson and Roman Phifer on a third-quarter fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``All indications are positive right now,'' Gruden said of
Wheatley's injury. ``If the evaluations are (OK) and he's able to
play, he'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, two major scares dissipated at Raiders
headquarters. The euphoria of a comeback win over the Jets stood a
very good chance of being wiped out by serious injuries to the two
biggest reasons the Raiders feature the NFL's No. 3-rated offense
and the NFL's No. 1-rated rushing attack. Instead, the Raiders
aren't ruling out Wheatley for Sunday and aren't ruling out Gannon,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be hard for (Gannon) to do the normal things he's
accustomed to doing, and if we had known it was broken, we
obviously would have inserted somebody else (on the final
kneel-down),'' Gruden said. ``He'll be sore for a while ... (but)
deep down in my heart, I think Rich Gannon will find a way to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gannon's wrist somehow worsens, Gruden said he would start
Bobby Hoying against the Dolphins. Hoying hasn't thrown a pass as a
Raider yet, but Gruden coached him while the two were in
Philadelphia during Gruden's stint as offensive coordinator for the
Eagles. Hoying was in and out of the starting job in Philadelphia,
starting 13 games in three seasons after he was drafted out of Ohio
State in the third round in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And if Wheatley's back prevents him from playing, the duty of
upholding the Raiders' title of top rushing team in the league
falls on a combination of speedster Napoleon Kaufman (4.9 yards per
carry), inside man Zack Crockett (32 yards this year) and
short-yardage blocker Randy Jordan (just six carries this year).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to make wholesale changes,'' Gruden said.
``We're going to keep doing what we're doing. It's been pretty
effective the first seven weeks. It's just somebody else's turn.
That's the approach we'll take.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Too much information.
</P>
<P>
   There's no other way to describe the tea service that ends a
meal at Local. A waiter approaches, offering a large glass tray
topped with smaller glass trays in his trembling hands. He sets it
on the table and invites the diner to inhale the eight varieties of
loose leaves like so many illicit substances.
</P>
<P>
   Each bears a handwritten label: Keemun, Lapsang Souchong, Ceylon
Fop. He promises to match their ``vanilla essences'' and ``smoky
finishes'' to the desserts, as if they were fine wines, and answers
questions with eye-popping candor.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamomile Lavender? ``It's exquisite,'' he replies. ``I want
to (italics)bathe(end italics) in it!''
</P>
<P>
   Tea at a restaurant used to be a simple business: an anonymous
bag hanging limply out of some lukewarm water, the ordering of
which marked you as an invalid or New Age health nut.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, ordering tea has ascended into another realm, a
ritualistic ceremony with enough bowing and scraping to transport
the diner to the days of the Raj. Entire sub-menus are devoted to
tea, cataloging exotic varieties with long, florid descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese Colonille at Union Pacific has a ``sumptuous,
beautiful bouquet with a distinct chocolatey taste,'' and the
Darjeeling at C3, in Greenwich Village, a ``nutty note and strong
character.'' Restaurants retain tea sommeliers, who conduct
``cuppings'' for would-be connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   It has become possible to pay $10 for a cup of tea.
</P>
<P>
   Heartbeat, home of the $10 Bao Jong oolong from Taiwan, was way
ahead of the tea curve. Last year, the chef, Michel Nischan, hired
James Labe as the city's first _ or at least first well-publicized
_ tea sommelier. Labe now has two apprentices to help make sure
customers don't order the wrong dessert with this newly sacred
beverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tea and food take turns leading in the environment we're
in,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   At Heartbeat, in the W Hotel, tea is not merely an accessory to
the meal. It's a player: 11 types of loose leaves in little finger
bowls arrayed in a circle on a slate tray are delivered by Labe or
one of his assistants. As at Local, diners are invited to sniff the
notes of honey and sherry in the Hao Ya Keemun and experience the
full-bodied brown liquor of the Gold-Tipped Assam before making
their selections.
</P>
<P>
   The menu at Ruby Foo's Dim Sum and Sushi Palace lists 19 blends,
including an exotic-sounding ``Monkey Picked'' Chinese oolong with
``hints of coconuts and pineapple,'' suggesting a Golden Triangle
plantation so remote that humans do not even labor there.
</P>
<P>
   At Union Pacific, few dishes can compete with the theatrics of
the Dragon's Eyeball. A plum-size ball of green Chinese tea leaves
is deposited into a glass, then explodes like a sea monkey into
something resembling a surreal underwater coral _ a trick that even
the chef, Rocco Di Spirito, called ``a bit of a novelty item.''
</P>
<P>
   The business of supplying these high-end teas has become
correspondingly lucrative and exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Cello, despite its three-star rating, had to audition for the
privilege of selling teas from Mariage Freres on its menu. It took
three months to convince this French company that Cello was worthy
of its Darjeeling Master, Jasmine Mandarin and Ruschka teas,
others, said Jacques Le Magueresse, the restaurant's owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very specific about the way they present their
teas,'' he said. ``I had to send pictures, the menu; send them
reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Serendipitea _ the supplier to Local, Lutece, Vong, Babbo, C3,
Chanterelle _ is less demanding, but just as serious. A wholesaler
based in Ridgefield, Conn., Serendipitea also schools these
restaurants in the rites and lingo of haute tea service. It sells
teas from India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Japan, Taiwan and Europe, and
organizes restaurants' tea programs and ``cuppings,'' as the
tastings are called.
</P>
<P>
   Some hard pitching goes into persuading chefs to make a
commitment to tea, said Thomas Podreka, who founded Serendipitea
five years ago. ``The first reaction I get is, `It's too hard for
us and my staff's too stupid.'''
</P>
<P>
   An Australian who came to the United States as a ballroom
dancing instructor, Podreka had no tea experience beyond drinking
it. ``I got here and I was being served tea bags at good
restaurants and I thought this is not going to do,'' he said.
``Everything else was magnificent, but this was an insult.''
</P>
<P>
   Tea may be at the core of America's patriotic mythology, but
there is still a feeling that Americans don't quite know how to
deal with it. The 226 years since the Boston Tea Party is a trice
in the history of this revered beverage, which was first drunk,
according to one legend, almost 5,000 years ago in what is now the
Chinese province of Sichuan when a leaf dropped into the emperor
Shen Nung's cup of hot water as he walked in his garden.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans' cultural memory of tea, on the other hand, was
formed by Lipton's. And doing it right can be complicated: tea
experts recommend boiling water for black teas, but not for green,
which is more delicate. Steeping times range from one to five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the high-end places haven't quite mastered it yet.
During a recent lunch at Aquavit, the waiter brought over the Assam
Blend, which the menu describes as a ``bold Indian black tea with a
slightly malty flavor, perfect with a dash of milk.'' The requisite
miniature cast-iron tea kettle arrived, but no milk did.
</P>
<P>
   More tea is consumed than any other beverage in the world except
water. But at New York restaurants, it is still second to coffee in
both preference and status. The Italian restaurateurs in the city
are ``the most resistant'' to accepting tea into their culinary
lives, Podreka said.
</P>
<P>
   French resistance may have been weakened now that Alain Ducasse,
the chef's chef, has started complex table-side infusions at his
restaurant in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Max Bernard, the French-born owner of Park Bistro, on Park
Avenue, started serving six loose teas last year, in little teapots
with strainers. But that's as far as he's willing to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go with a 15-tea list,'' he said. ``I'm a
bistro. That would be a little too complex.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be another factor at play, too. Asked what the French
really think of tea, Bernard did not hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea is for sissies,'' he said.

<P>
   LANDISVILLE, Pa. _ Starlings were swirling overhead, searching
for a last nip from the grapevines. Their prospects did not look
hopeful; for miles around this rise in the hills, everything looked
gray, vacant, bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Except what was at my feet. Sprouting through the cold, damp
soil were sprightly purple flowers _ half an acre of them popping
up in tight lavender clusters.
</P>
<P>
   It was striking enough that the flowers managed to bloom under
such conditions, but even more so that here in southeastern
Pennsylvania _ an area known for chickens, mushrooms and a simple
way of life _ these were not just any flowers but saffron crocuses.
</P>
<P>
   From this flower comes the threadlike saffron spice, the exotic
filament that makes paella throb with flavor, the mysteriously
potent aromatic that defines risotto Milanese and gives Swedish
holiday bread its egg-yolk color. And the precious commodity that
inventive New York chefs have begun to infuse into a surprising
range of dishes like panna cottas, salad dressings, souffles and
even rice crackers.
</P>
<P>
   For ages, saffron has been associated with Spain, though most of
the 300,000 pounds of saffron produced worldwide each year is grown
in Iran. No matter where it comes from, saffron has always been
expensive _ even now a mere one-ounce tin can cost as much as $55 _
making it all the more daunting to use. But for Martin Keen, a
seventh-generation farmer here who may be the only commercial
grower in the United States, saffron is neither foreign nor exotic.
It is a backyard harvest that has been reaped in the area for more
than two centuries. For him and other local cooks, it is a
seasoning as natural in the kitchen as cinnamon or pepper.
</P>
<P>
   The spice is believed to have first been cultivated in Persia,
but it established roots here through the spice trade. William Woys
Weaver, the author of ``Pennsylvania Dutch Country Cooking''
(Abbeville, 1993), writes that German Jews in Pennsylvania in the
1790s were merchants who had taken control over trade in the
Caribbean from Spain and England. Saffron was one of the goods. In
the Philadelphia exchange, saffron cost the same as gold until the
beginning of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, saffron eventually became more a staple of kitchen
gardens than a commercial crop. Keen's family was tobacco and wheat
farmers, but as the land was divided over the generations, they
needed to rely on more-expensive crops, like wine grapes. Saffron,
being both traditional and valuable, also made sense. Keen first
began growing it in 1985. Today, virtually none of Keen's crop,
which is sold under the Greider's label, will make it into stores
any farther away than Philadelphia. What he grows is saffron in
microcosm.
</P>
<P>
   Saffron has a curiously distinctive flavor, but fresh from the
fall flower it smells sweet, of freshly cut hay, and feels like
waxed thread. Dried, it has a round penetrating scent, like the
pulp of roasted tomatoes with hints of clay and eucalyptus. It is
rich, it is bitter, it is medicinal, and its dye is so intense that
it can turn a white potato the color of ripe papaya.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most crocuses, saffron is a fall flower raised from a
corm, like a gladiolus. Most of the year, the plant remains
dormant, but come mid-October, its green leaves begin to shoot up
above ground, and soon after, the bright purple flowers. They
lushly carpet the field, and then die off in a matter of two to
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For Keen, these are a frantic few weeks. Each day, new flowers
appear, so every inch of his plot must be combed. The work is
painful just to watch. To harvest, he straddles the three-foot-wide
row and bends all the way to the ground to pick off the crocus
buds. He shuffles along inches at a time, snapping the flowers off
their stems.
</P>
<P>
   Keen pinched a frail purple blossom between two fingers, and
then pointed to the three pomegranate-red threads dangling between
the petals. ``These are the stigmas,'' he said. ``You just pull
them out.'' It was a simple explanation for one of the world's most
labor-intensive crops.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he finishes picking, he rushes the flowers home,
where friends and family members help to separate them. For every
hour of picking, it takes two to three hours to separate the
flowers, and yields a mere handful of stigmas. The stigmas are then
dried in a dehydrator. It's not as evocative as the classic images
of Spanish women toasting the saffron over coal fires.
</P>
<P>
   Keen keeps his saffron in sealed Tupperware containers, marked
simply by year: 98 or 99. He does not lock them up. But he does
keep a close eye on them. Saffron must mature for several months
before selling, and humidity levels change often.
</P>
<P>
   Keen's labors produce all of about two and a half pounds of
saffron a year. Although he appears to be the only commercial
grower in the United States, there may soon be others. Ellen Szita,
a saffron expert from San Francisco, says she has heard of a grower
beginning production near Austin, Texas, and her Web site,
www.saffroninfo.com, has received numerous requests for growing
information from people with several acres to plant.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 years ago, Spain produced 70 percent of the world's
saffron. But as younger generations have moved away from the farms
to take jobs in the city, its production has dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite has occurred in Iran. Since the 1979
revolution, there has been a movement back to farming, and 85
percent of the world crop is now harvested there each year. Iranian
saffron, often called Persian, cannot be imported directly into the
United States, so many growers send it to Europe to be processed,
after which it is sold here.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As more saffron from other countries has become available,
opinions about what is the best are changing. Spanish saffron,
particularly Coupe and La Mancha grades, was once considered the
most desirable. Paula Wolfert, the author of several books on
Mediterranean cooking, remembered the day when Richard Olney, who
was a food writer in France, introduced her to Greek saffron. ``I
went wild,'' she said. ``You needed one-third the saffron to get
the color and the taste.'' More recently, she discovered Persian
saffron, which she described as ``potent beyond belief.''
</P>
<P>
   I had a similar reaction to Persian saffron when I tested it
against La Mancha saffron, Keen's and a Spanish variety from a
supermarket. Steeped in hot water, the Persian, which like Coupe
had the flavorless base of its stigmas removed, was darker, a blood
red, and its aroma was thick, pure and intense, much more so than
La Mancha. That variety was pale, its fragrance weak. The
supermarket saffron had very little color and tasted flat. Keen's
saffron was terrific, as intense as the Persian, but much
different. The filaments stained the water a deep orange, and the
aroma was full and minerally, more austere than the Persian.
Kalustyan's, an Eastern food store in Manhattan on Lexington
Avenue, sells Spanish saffron from La Mancha for $35 an ounce and
Persian saffron for $55 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   With prices that astronomical, it's no wonder that adulteration
is rampant in the industry. Those red threads can be duplicated in
many ways: the silks off corn on the cob, horse hair, dyed grass,
marigold leaves, newspaper _ you name it, and it has probably been
used. Sometimes, the yellow stamens and some petals are added, or
extra moisture is left in to increase the weight.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the false saffrons, like the safflower, from the
plant used for oil. The threads on it are short, tightly clustered
and more flame-colored than deep red. They color food but have no
taste. They are often sold _ legally _ as ``Turkish saffron,''
``American saffron'' or ``Mexican saffron.''
</P>
<P>
   As precious as saffron is, a cook will soon realize it is
important to extract as much flavor as possible from the threads.
Generally they should be soaked in some form of liquid, but first
they should be pounded with a mortar and pestle, as garlic is
crushed to release its aroma. Saffron dissolves in water, so fats
like cream and oils work less effectively than water and acids. I
have found the best way to deal with it, regardless of the recipe,
is to steep the threads in a few teaspoons of hot water for about
20 minutes. Then you can evaluate the strength of the saffron
before using it in a dish.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring saffron is not like scooping allspice or chopped
basil. Recipes often call for teaspoon measurements or by the
pinch, neither of which is much help. A half teaspoon is about 25
to 30 full-size threads. A pinch is more like 45. It is best to
begin conservatively, and then add more later.
</P>
<P>
   For all its potency, saffron is actually quite the delicate
flower in the kitchen. If too much is added, a dish can turn
bitter. If cooked at a high temperature for too long, it loses its
nuance. And its flavor takes time to bloom. Sauces and creams
containing saffron, for instance, are better the next day.
</P>
<P>
   In classic dishes like couscous and paella, the saffron flavor
is unmistakable. But it is also a marvelous background component,
in dishes like fresh marinated sardines with quinoa and saffron at
Sono, a new restaurant in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   At Aquavit, saffron becomes one of dozens of flavors layered
through a curry granita with bay scallop ceviche and caviar. Marcus
Samuelsson, the chef there, also infuses saffron in a potato foam
served over a warm salad of arugula, artichokes, goat cheese and
fingerling potatoes. Its smooth egg yolk color fools the eye: you
think it is mayonnaise until you taste it. In another dish, he
kneads saffron into a dough of cooked arborio rice and rice flour
to make crackers that look like strands of eggy fettuccine and
crack in your mouth like ice.
</P>
<P>
   The red threads weave through a butter-yellow, lightly sugared
souffle at La Caravelle.
</P>
<P>
   Saffron in ice cream shows up on many menus. It is as natural an
idea as any spiced ice cream like cardamom or star anise, except
that saffron's bitterness surfaces in a pleasant way.
</P>
<P>
   At Babbo, saffron is infused with a little lemon zest into a
straightforward panna cotta. It is divine. It is beguiling. And
saffron's musky aroma lingers, like no other spice, in your mouth,
your nose, your head.

   Curious Yellow
</P>
<P>
   Quality in saffron is difficult for a consumer to discern. When
sold in tins, it gives no clues whatsoever. Even if the packaging
is clear, make sure the store has a lot of turnover so that the
saffron is not old. Once home, transfer it to a dark, airtight
container for storage for as long as two years.
</P>
<P>
   Just as tasting helps you find a wine you like, it takes
experimentation to evaluate saffron. It's best to buy it in ounce
(or half-ounce, if available) quantities through a spice importer
or a high-quality ethnic or specialty grocer, not the grocery
store.

   ELECTRIC _ Legislation that would deregulate the nation's
electric utility industry goes before a House subcommittee
Wednesday. The ``markup'' is the farthest such legislaiton has
gotten in years of discussion and deliberation on Capitol Hill.
Southern Co. and other investor-owned utilities are generally
pleased with the proposal up for discussion. But it's still
unlikely to be enacted before the presidential election. (Quinn,

   HOLSENDOLPH-WIRELESS _ There are believers, and there are true

devoted fully to the proposition that the most powerful

of wireless communication. Earlier this month, Amazon.com bought
Convergence in a $20 million stock deal to bring into its own tent
the Norcross company's know-how in wireless communication.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Morning at Innsbruck: A steady rain doesn't deter skiers and
snowboarders from gathering for a free bus ride to Stubai Glacier.
Most give a quick dog shake to dispel water as they hop aboard and
nod silent greetings to other passengers. The bus departs and is
quiet until it reaches the village of Igls, where the sun suddenly
appears over the Alps and sparks a crescendo of enthusiasm among
the passengers. When the bus pulls into Stubai, new friends spill
into parking lot, plotting the day's first run.
</P>
<P>
   _ Midday at St. Anton: Hundreds of skiers slide down Valluga
Mountain like marbles in a pachinko machine. When you are standing
at 9,220 feet, the world is a cathedral and the snow-packed peaks
its parishioners. Music is the sound of the wind scuffing your
ears. You want to stay, to give thanks for such a glorious view,
but the devil pulls you downhill.
</P>
<P>
   _ Evening in Kitzbuhel: The skiers haven't strayed far from the
gondola station. Around a tent-covered bar, dozens of revelers are
locked arm and arm, braying a drinking song. Closer to the center
of town, an outdoor patio is packed with vacationers, wind-chaffed,
smiling and quaffing potent fruit-flavored liquors. You pass on
both scenes, slipping back to the hotel where a warming fire and
wine await.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scenes from a European ski holiday _ in Austria _ at once
foreign and familiar. For many U.S. skiers and snowboarders, this
adventure represents a fantasy trip. Alpine vistas, strange tongues
and foreign food, and, of course, the apres ski.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising aspect is that a ski vacation across
the Atlantic can be very affordable. Companies such as
Houston-based Ski Europe and Central Holidays offer weeklong
holidays that include transatlantic air fare from New York, lodging
with breakfast and a rental car for prices starting at $639.
</P>
<P>
   But if you need more of a push than price, here is a primer for
European skiing:
</P>
<P>
   Why go to Europe to ski?
</P>
<P>
   For the challenge, for the sightseeing and for the food.
</P>
<P>
   The Alps are magical, craggy creatures to be topped and tamed.
Sophisticated lift systems allow skiers to literally glide from one
country to another. And if nothing else, you will be challenged by
the much-maligned T-bar (a T-shaped metal bar suspended from a
power-driven cable used to pull skiers uphill as they stand on
their skis) which Europeans take to unparalleled heights and
lengths.
</P>
<P>
   You think Vail, Colo., is picturesque? Wait until you see
Zermatt, Switzerland, or Kitzbuhel, Austria. These historic hamlets
_ and others _ inspired the American version of a ski resort. Most
were established hundreds of years before the first daredevils
strapped boards to their feet and skidded down mountains. Huge
churches, architectural treasures that still welcome the faithful
each day, dominate tiny towns and old inns that once catered to
miners and pilgrims but now favor families and couples headed to
the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, you do go to Europe for the cuisine. From the piquant
aromas that waft from mountaintop grills to the last golden crumb
of strudel, food consumes. At U.S. resorts there is little to
compare with the terrific meals served atop mountains in Europe:
deer stew with bread dumplings; true French onion soup; perfectly
grilled trout; chocolate mousse; and pizza that deserves a more
lofty name.
</P>
<P>
   How do you pick a destination?
</P>
<P>
   That may be one of the hardest decisions you'll make after
deciding to take the European plunge. Each country has its own
charms and quirks.
</P>
<P>
   We dislike stereotypes, but:
</P>
<P>
   _ Austria: An ideal introduction to European skiing with
friendly natives who all seem to speak English. Expert skiers may
want more challenge.
</P>
<P>
   _ France: The skiing is great, and a commitment to growth keeps
resorts well-equipped with all the bells and whistles. But
ooh-la-la, the prices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Germany: Culturally rich villages, Wiener schnitzel and fine
intermediate skiing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Italy: If you don't take life or skiing too seriously, this is
the place to be. Never early to bed, and certainly not early to
rise. Good snow and even better vistas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Switzerland: Outstanding skiing in a laid-back setting.
Terrific destination if you have nonskiers in your party.
</P>
<P>
   Several other nations _ from Norway to Poland _ offer skiing,
too. And because the continent is so compact, it's possible to
enjoy a multicultural ski vacation, although first-timers may want
to focus on one country.
</P>
<P>
   _ What are significant differences between the European and the
U.S. ski scene?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Europeans don't do weekend ski trips. Most resorts
and hotels package ski weeks. And it's not surprising to meet
European vacationers who are spending two or three weeks in one
village.
</P>
<P>
   And we mentioned the T-bars. Regulated to bunny slopes and
cash-challenged resorts in the United States, T-bars are widely
used in Europe. You must learn to use them if you want to reach
some of the more intimate trails. Also, be ready for lift lines
that resemble rugby scrums. Just keep your cool when folks get
pushy.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian and other European ski areas label their runs as
blue, red and black in terms of difficulty. Just as in the United
States, black represents expert terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Don't hesitate to hire a guide. Much less expensive than their
American counterparts, they will introduce you to European ski
customs while matching your ability with the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to dining, the European skier enjoys long lunches
and late dinners. You can beat 'em or join `em.
</P>
<P>
   Many American visitors ski through the traditional lunch hours,
capitalizing on the lack of lift lines and empty trails. At night,
even the most popular restaurants will be empty during Americans'
preferred dining time. Eateries don't get busy until after 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bank on your credit cards. While most major cards are
accepted in hotels and restaurants, you still find places _
particularly at mountaintop shops and eateries _ that won't accept
American Express or any of the other handful of credit cards in
your wallet. Keep some cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where do you start?
</P>
<P>
   For your first European ski trip, go to a travel agent or a
travel company that specializes in ski vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Ski Europe has been sending skiers to the Alps for
nearly 15 years. Its specialty is the ``SuperSki Week,'' available
on select dates in Austria, Italy, Switzerland and France. The
vacation package includes transatlantic air fare from New York,
seven nights of lodging, breakfast daily (and often dinner) and use
of a rental car. Accommodations are located with easy access to
lift stations or ski bus stops. Lift passes cost extra but are
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of holidays includes a mid-February week at
Switzerland's famed St. Moritz for prices starting at $898 per
person (double occupany); a mid-March trip to Italy's Courmayeur
for $869; and a late January stay in Austria's Zell am See for
$639. Add-on air fares from Houston are available.
</P>
<P>
   Call Ski Europe at 713-960-0900; or access www.ski-europe.com on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Another European expert is Central Holidays, based in New
Jersey. The company packages tours to Italy, Austria, France,
Germany and Spain's Sierra Nevada range.
</P>
<P>
   Central Holidays offers an elaborate Ski Safari this season that
provides skiers access to more than 700 miles of trails in the
Italian Dolomites. The ``safari'' includes air fare from New York, nights of lodging in Moena, Italy, breakfast and dinner daily
and a ski pass good at six ski areas. Prices start at $1,103 per
person (double occupancy).

CRUSH COURSE IN WINEMAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By TIM TESCONI   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Each morning, twin sisters Marie-Laure and
Cecile Gery hop in their clunky 1984 Mercury, proudly purchased
with $900 in pooled savings, and drive from Windsor to a winery in
Forestville, where they work long hours learning the secrets of the
cellar.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters, who come from the Limousin region of France, are
proud of their cracked, work-worn hands, stained with the juice of
red wine grapes crushed at Hartford Court Winery near Forestville.
</P>
<P>
   The wine-stained hands are a badge of honor for the 23-year-old
identical twins who dream of being winemakers, ideally together at
a chateau in the Bordeaux region of their native country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clean hands do little work,'' Cecile says. The sisters, with
personalities as effervescent as champagne, aren't afraid of
getting their hands dirty in their quest to learn the art of
winemaking so they can one day craft signature vintages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work very hard but in life you have to work hard if you
really want something,'' said Marie-Laure as she adds some
Montrachet yeast to an experimental batch of chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   The Gery sisters are wine interns.
</P>
<P>
   They are among 140 interns from around the world who have come
to the northern California this season to work the crush and learn
the skills that will make them winemakers. They not only gain
experience but wineries get a skilled labor force during harvest, a
time of year when there is a shortage of trained cellar workers.
The interns are paid $10 an hour. Some, like the Gery twins, live
with host families; others live at residences provided by wineries
or find their own housing.
</P>
<P>
   The future winemakers come not only from well-known winemaking
countries such as France, Chile, Australia and New Zealand but also
places like Scotland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Korea. Interns from
Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, South Africa, Argentina and
Spain also are among the international crew soaking up color _ and
valuable knowledge _ in winery cellars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic. You get to experience the full range of skills
needed for winemaking,'' said Jason Clancy, 27, of Australia.
Clancy and Tibor Konter, 23, of Hungary are interns at Mantanzas
Creek Winery in Bennett Valley. Both want to be winemakers at
family wineries in their native countries.
</P>
<P>
   Call them cellar rats or winery workers, the interns do a lot of
the unglamorous drudgery that goes into a bottle of fine wine. They
top tanks, pull hoses, wash barrels and clean floors. They tug and
shovel, lift and push. They are spattered with juice and stung by
yellow jackets in the pursuit of their vinous profession.
</P>
<P>
   Sanitation is a cornerstone in winemaking, becoming a mantra for
winery workers who spend much of their time keeping the cellar
clean. Interns say California's sanitation standards are much
stricter than in their own countries. Consequently they quickly
learn how to handle high-powered water hoses and become versed in
the etiquette of scrubbing tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are some of the cleanest wineries I've ever seen,'' said
Leon Duckworth, a 26-year-old New Zealander who works at Hartford
Court. ``It's like they have a guy walking around polishing tanks
all day. You have to shade your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter if they speak Swiss or Spanish, the interns quickly
learn the meaning of ``crush,'' particularly, during seasons like
this one, when the harvest was concentrated following a surge of
very hot weather. Many grapes ripened at once, putting out the call
for all hands on the crushing deck.
</P>
<P>
   The grape crush is a time of hard work, little sleep, haphazard
meals and perennial wet feet. The interns love it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can learn a great deal in a short time doing all the
jobs,'' said Marie-Laure. ``And nobody tells you there is a job you
can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   The wine grape harvest, which started in August, is winding to a
finish, said Rhonda Wallace, executive director of the California
North Coast Grape Growers Association. She said most grape growers
in Sonoma and Napa counties will finish picking this week. The
harvest is about two-thirds finished in Mendocino County, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most winery interns will stay on their jobs until December and
then spend a month or so traveling around the United States before
heading home.
</P>
<P>
   This year Hadyn Petricevich, 28, won't be going home to New
Zealand when the crush is finished. Petricevich has landed a
full-time job as assistant winemaker at Sebastopol Vineyards, owned
by Traci and Joe Dutton. The small winery produces hand-crafted
pinot noir and chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Petricevich was an intern at Lambert Bridge Winery in
Healdsburg. He's also worked at wineries in New Zealand and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every winemaker has their own idiosyncrasies. Basically,
winemaking is the same all over the world, it's the winemaker's
style that gives the wines a different slant,'' said Petricevich.
</P>
<P>
   The migration of foreign winemaking talent is coordinated by a
Minnesota-based program called Communicating for Agriculture
Exchange Program.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Gilmartin is the coordinator of the exchange program,
which this year brought 300 interns to the United States to work in
wineries, with two-thirds of them working the crush in California.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmartin said Santa Rosa vintner Jess Jackson holds the title
for hiring the most interns for the '99 crush. Jackson has 52
interns working at Kendall-Jackson and at his wineries in Artisans
&AMP; Estates, a group of ultra-premium wineries that include Hartford
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sullivan, the winemaker at Hartford Court, said he enjoys
working with the interns, who are bright, enthusiastic and deeply
committed to making wine. He said it gives the crush an
international flavor. ``There is an incredible exchange of ideas
and learning between all of us,'' he said.
</P>

   This is the Gery twins' second year working the crush in Sonoma
County. They plan to do some touring in the 1984 Mercury and then
sell it before they return to France later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Gery twins said California vintners and winemakers treat
women who work in wineries with more professional respect than
French winemakers, who regard their craft as a male bastion.
</P>
<P>
   Marie-Laure and Cecile have worked at wineries in France and
said they were given menial tasks _ jobs that didn't allow them to
think and utilize their wine know-how.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stupid. Women can do anything in a wine cellar that a man
can do,'' said Marie-Laure.

SAVVY PLANNING REAPS WINTER SPORTS BARGAINS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Photo available on NYT database) 
 
By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cheap is not a four-letter word.
</P>
<P>
   And while cheap is rarely associated with a winter sports
vacation, its cousins affordable, inexpensive and bargain-priced
are increasingly well-known at North American resorts.
</P>
<P>
   With that is mind, here are our B.E. C.H.E.A.P. tips for a
budget-minded ski or snowboard holiday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
B IS FOR `BE FLEXIBLE' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flexibility is the bargain hunter's best tool.
</P>
<P>
   Insist on being on the slopes on New Year's Eve, and you'll pay
dearly. Wait until Jan. 4, and even ritzy resorts such as Aspen,
Colo., will cut a deal. An Aspen Value Deal, good Jan. 4-30,
packages a six-day lift ticket and seven nights at the St. Moritz
Lodge for $714 per person (double occupancy).
</P>
<P>
   Be flexible, too, in your choice of destinations.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, skiing costs significantly more at Vail ($59 for a
one-day lift ticket) than at Loveland ($29 per day). But the
resorts are close enough together that a vacation in the Loveland
area can include a day of skiing at a pricier resort such as Vail,
Copper Mountain ($55 per day) or Breckenridge ($53 per day).
</P>
<P>
   You will almost always pay less for a midweek stay. At Vail, for
example, you'll save at least 15 percent if you book a
Sunday-through-Thursday vacation via the resort's central
reservations office.
</P>
<P>
   And don't overlook the Canadian Rockies, where our neighbors'
dollar has been at an all-time low for the past couple of years. A
seven-night early-season package that covers lodging and a five-day
lift ticket starts at $290 per person (double occupancy) at Alberta
resorts. This Ski Banff/Lake Louise Super Save deal is good Nov.
11-Dec. 18, and the lift ticket is welcome at three ski areas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
E IS FOR `EARLY OR LATE' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best deals are offered early and late in the snow season.
</P>
<P>
   The early season starts on opening day (generally mid-November)
and lasts until about Dec. 17. The late season varies by resort,
but most bargains will be found from the last week of March through
closing day. Traditionally, closing day for most resorts has been
mid-April, but with Easter falling on April 23, expect some resorts
to remain open through the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Late season can be particularly enjoyable, with its long, sunny
days and nonexistent lift lines.
</P>
<P>
   Crested Butte, Colo., unabashedly calls its early- and
late-season bargains ``the greatest ski deal on Earth.'' Free lift
tickets (no asterisks or fine print here) are available for six
weeks, Nov. 19-Dec. 18 and April 2-16. The rest of the season, a
daylong pass will set you back $52.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
C IS FOR `COMPARE PACKAGES' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Packaging your vacation can prove especially economical.
Packages can include air fare, ground transportation, lodging,
equipment rental, lift tickets, meals and more.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find ski/snowboard packages through a variety of outlets:
in newspaper and magazine ads, via resorts' central reservations
services, through area hotels, and from travel agents and
reservationist specialists, both traditional and online.
</P>
<P>
   Compare prices and amenities carefully. Condominium
accommodations may cost more than a hotel room, but access to a
kitchen can save money on meals. Ask about the location of lodging,
shuttle availability and distance from nightlife and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be enticed by amenities such as hot tubs and fireplaces if
you won't be using them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
H IS FOR `HOUSING MATTERS' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vacationers shell out a lot of bucks for ski-in, ski-out,
slope-side lodging. Instead, look for accommodations away from the
ski/snowboard areas. Large hotels and resorts often have shuttle
services to the slopes, making a rental car unnecessary. And many
towns cater to tourists with free transportation on buses equipped
with ski racks.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't mind a commute, terrific lodging deals are
available in towns near the slopes. Many come with discounts on
lift tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City has scores of hotels in all prices ranges and
lies within 35 miles of 10 ski and snowboard areas. Public buses
run to Alta, Snowbird, Solitude and Brighton; private shuttles make
regular stops at the Park City-area resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Another city embraced by budget skiers and snowboarders is
Carson City, Nev., which is within 30 miles of more than a dozen
Lake Tahoe ski areas. If you're headed to the resorts along
Colorado's Interstate 70, consider Frisco, Dillon and Silverthorne
for budget lodging.
</P>
<P>
   For those who really want to save on lodging, check out the
hostels in places such as Aspen, Vail, Purgatory and Breckenridge,
Colo.; Taos, N.M.; and Salt Lake City. Prices at the Glenwood
Springs Hostel, near the Colorado resorts of Ski Sunlight, Aspen,
Vail and Snowmass, start at $12, or $39 for four nights.
</P>
<P>
   Most Hostelling International-American Youth Hostel
accommodations are priced at less than $25. All offer separate
dormitory-style lodging for men and women of all ages. Some hostels
have rooms for couples and families.
</P>
<P>
   Prices quoted are for HI-AYH members; nonmembers pay about $3
more. Membership, good at more than 4,000 hostels worldwide, costs
$25 (free for ages 17 and younger). For a list of ski-area hostels,
call 202-783-6161 or access www.hiayh.org.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
E IS FOR `EMBRACE FRIENDS' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A crowd is good if you bring your own. Renting a large
condominium or house can cut costs when you're vacationing with
family or friends. And many packages offer big discounts for those
staying four to a hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   At Big Sky Resort in Montana, a five-night package with
accommodations and four-day lift tickets costs $401 per person when
six share a three-bedroom, slope-side condominium with full
kitchen, dining room and living area.
</P>
<P>
   In Telluride, Colo., a similar Bargain Blitz package offers five
nights' lodging and four days' skiing starting at $440 per person
based on four people sharing a hotel room or condo.
</P>
<P>
   Telemark Lodge at Copper Mountain resort in Colorado markets to
families with a deal that includes four nights' lodging,
continental breakfast and four-day lift tickets for a family of
four starting at $215 per day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A IS FOR `AGE MATTERS' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It pays not to be middle-aged when you're headed for the slopes.
Many ski area offer discounts or free skiing for youngsters and
older skiers.
</P>
<P>
   At Squaw Valley USA in California, children ages 12 and younger
ski or snowboard for $5 a day. In Utah, Park City Mountain Resort
has teamed with Southwest Airlines for a Kids Fly and Ski Free
Vacation. Good for ages 2-11, the deal features one free child's
round-trip airline ticket with each paid adult fare; a free child's
lift ticket with each paid adult lift ticket; free lodging for
children staying in parents' rooms; and free lunch at the Summit
House restaurant with the purchase of an adult lunch (minimum $10).
The deal is good Nov. 13-April 16; some blackout dates apply.
</P>
<P>
   Skiers ages 70 and older ski free in places such as Taos, N.M.,
and Telluride, Beaver Creek and Winter Park, Colo., while Sun
Valley in Idaho courts septuagenarians and octogenarians with its
Prime Time Weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Time packages are good Jan. 15-29 and offer seven nights'
lodging, a five-of-six-days lift ticket, a welcome party, a ski
race, a mountain tour, discount coupons, door prizes and a souvenir
pin. For skiers ages 60 and older, prices start at $453 per person
(double occupancy).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
P IS FOR `PAY ATTENTION' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keep your eyes peeled for bargains. Your first stops in town
should be the visitors center and the ski area's ticket office. Ask
about retail discount coupons, seasonal specials, and entertainment
and attractions that may be bargain-priced or free.
</P>
<P>
   Watch where the locals gather for apres-ski and meals. They know
where the tastiest food, coldest beer and best dealsrved.
</P>
<P>
   Among dining bargains from the locals in Aspen: all-you-can-eat
$8 salad at the Steak Pit, $1.90 crepes at the Popcorn Wagon, free
bean dip in the bar at La Cocina (to be washed down with the town's
best margaritas), free appetizers during happy hour at Mountain
Dragon Chinese Restaurant, and $5 gourmet pizzas 3-5 p.m. daily at
Mezzaluna.
</P>
<P>
   Bon appetit to those who appreciate a good bargain.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ Eric Rudolph may be hiding in a cave just up the
hill from this western North Carolina town that cherishes how far
out in the wilderness it is. Or he may be thousands of miles away.
There are about as many theories to the bombing suspect's
whereabouts as there are potential hiding places.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement agents have searched for Rudolph since
shortly after the Jan. 29, 1998 bombing of a Birmingham, Ala.,
abortion clinic. They think he's still somewhere around here,
probably in an old mine within the 500,000-acre Nantahala National
Forest. A few dozen agents live and work in Andrews, continuing
what is one of the nation's longest and most chronicled manhunts.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thinks Rudolph, an experienced backwoodsman who
would have just celebrated his 33rd birthday, is still hidden in
these woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's been long gone for awhile. He's not around
here,'' said George Nordmann, during a recent interview in his
Better Way Health Foods store in downtown Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann said he has no inside knowledge about Rudolph, but the
72-year-old navy veteran and former citrus farmer may be the last
person to have seen Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, Rudolph took about six months' worth of supplies
and a pickup truck from Nordmann. The encounter happened on a
Thursday, but Nordmann did not report it to authorities for two
days. The truck was found two days later near the entrance to a
campground just east of here in Macon County.
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann gave authorities a detailed description of Rudolph. The
suspect had apparently added a beard and a ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   The information did not lead to a quick capture. Instead,
Rudolph, who is a suspect not just in the Birmingham bombing but
also in three Atlanta-area bombings in 1996 and 1997 including a
fatal blast at Centennial Park in Atlanta during the 1996 Olympics,
remains at large. He has survived one winter on the run, despite
predictions a year ago at this time that once the leaves fell and
the temperature dropped, he would be caught.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Rudolph's connection with Nordmann and the discovery
of buried trash with the suspect's fingerprints on it, federal
agents have not disclosed much about their search. With winter
approaching, officials familiar with the search said that federal
agents will continue to focus on the mountainous, rugged area
around Macon County.
</P>
<P>
   The task force heading up the search has had a change in
leadership in recent months. A spokesman in Atlanta said no
briefings are planned to discuss any new events in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Will Eric Rudolph be caught?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question that many people here say they once were
preoccupied with but now just don't care about. Rudolph, a native
of the area who attended Nantahala High School, has become as much
a living part of folklore as a suspect on the run.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Andrews was engulfed by a national media circus as
satellite TV trucks lined the streets, Hundreds of law enforcement
agents saturated the area. The TV trucks are gone and so is the
ostensible federal presence.
</P>
<P>
   Around Andrews and the small communities that lead into the
mountains, the talk has turned to foliage ( a fairly spectacular
season), high school football (the Brevard Blue Devils are ranked
No. 2 in the state) and the tourists, who are the economic
lifeblood of the region.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, residents said they occasionally see agents
buying fuel for their trucks. Otherwise, life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to come in here and buy the fancy fanny packs and
all the other stuff they could find. We haven't seen any of them in
awhile,'' said Mary Kelley, a clerk at the popular Nantahala
Outdoor Center, which stands along the Appalachian Trail.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see how Rudolph might still be around. Drive a few
hundred feet into the woods, look to your left or right, and you
could be lost in an instant. Natives talk about hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of underground caves and mines and the ability of an
experienced outdoorsman to elude capture.
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant near Nantahala Lake, about nine miles east of
Andrews, declares ``Rudolph Eats Here'' on its marquee. Inside, the
signs proclaiming ``We Survived the Rudolph Manhunt 1998. 1999?
2000?'' appear likely to still apply when the calendar changes in a
few months.
</P>
<P>
   The deer hunting season is under way. Sitting under a tree
silently waiting for a target, Eric Farley said he suspected
Rudolph is in the forest, maybe even close by. But Farley said he
doubted searchers would find him. It makes sense for Rudolph to
stay in the area, Farley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know Mexico, he doesn't know the beach. He knows
here, and here is a big, big place,'' said Farley, a Graham County
resident.
</P>
<P>
   When Rudolph first escaped into the forest, some cheered his
elusiveness and saw it as an indictment of the FBI and other
federal agencies. Anti-abortion sentiment and distrust of
government is native to the mountains of western North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But sharing a political view only goes so far. An off-duty
police officer died in the Alabama clinic bombing and a nurse was
permanently maimed, and to many people, those human losses should
not be forgotten in the saga of Eric Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm against abortion too _ it's just wrong _ but that's the
wrong way to get there,'' Farley said. ``To me, he's just a
criminal, and he broke the law, and they should catch him.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has posted a $1 million reward for Rudolph's capture,
and he has been placed on the agency's 10-most-wanted list. The FBI
will stay in Andrews until they find Rudolph, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments aren't all that pleasing to some in Andrews,
who want to turn the corner. Nordmann, who operates the health food
store and knew Rudolph, said he suspected the federal agents
actually came to Andrews ``so they could do surveillance on the
militia folks out here.''
</P>
<P>
   He's skeptical that several hundred law enforcement types would
be dispatched to find just one person.
</P>
<P>
   The area has had recent economic setbacks and hopes are high for
a strong fall tourist season. A Levi's jeans factory in Murphy just
closed, and a Baker furniture plant in Andrews is leaving next
summer, said Jackie Lancaster, Andrews Chamber of Commerce
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is on our economic development and getting people to
take a look at us to come here. At least, more so than `We have a
suspected bomber in the mountains','' said Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke in the chamber headquarters, the five-car yellow
and red Great Smoky Mountains Railroad train pulled up. Lancaster
also gives out train schedules and helps with reservations. The
four-hour round-trips from Andrews to the Nantahala Gorge end this
month for the year, and the remaining trips are nearly filled.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, a group from Georgia boarded the 10:30 a.m.
train. Most seemed intent on snapping pictures of downtown Andrews
before the Great Smoky train pulled away and scribbling a few
postcards. A few said they were aware of the manhunt, but several
expressed no knowledge of Rudolph. Their charter bus driver, Dean
Gilstrap of Gainesville, Ga., couldn't resist a bit of teasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told 'em not to wander off too far or he may get 'em,''
drawled Gilstrap.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Living folklore legend, fugitive and mountain man, Eric Rudolph
may fit all those roles. But if he is indeed in the Nantahala
forest somewhere, he probably won't be spotted in downtown Andrews.
He may be more likely by a creek where there's plenty of water and
the trout are hefty.
</P>
<P>
   Contemplating the situation, Sylva resident Steve Webb said he
could see how the isolation of the forest would appeal to a man on
the run. Webb said he suspected Rudolph was either dead or in
another country, but he keeps his eyes open _ just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, I'd turn him in in a heartbeat even if there wasn't a
reward, but for what he did in those bombings,'' Webb said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Windswept rain will lash portions of the Pacific Northwest
Wednesday as a powerful low pressure system grinds toward the
British Columbia coast. The day will begin dry across western
Washington and Oregon, with gusty winds from the south developing.
By midday, rain will arrive accompanied by 20 mph to 35 mph
southwesterly gales. Along the coast, gusts will exceed 50 miles an
hour. Surf as high as 20 feet will pound exposed beaches, which
will lead to minor erosion. Rain is expected as far south as
northern California.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the nation will generally be dry and tranquil
as high pressure covers an expansive area from the Dakotas to the
Eastern Seaboard. Cooler air will arrive in the Northeast Wednesday
behind a departing cold front. Skies will be partly cloudy over the
interior. Northwesterly breezes descending over the Appalachians
will cause clouds to crumble near the coast, producing mainly sunny
skies.
</P>
<P>
   After a cool start, abundant sun will propel temperatures to
near seasonal levels over the Southeast. The circulation around a
disturbance over the Bahamas will direct limited moisture into
eastern Florida, bringing intervals of clouds and spotty showers.
</P>
<P>
   Very warm air will cover the southern Plains Wednesday as
readings reach the 80's in many areas. Sunny skies will cover the
region, though filaments of cirrus clouds will dim the sun at times
across New Mexico and western Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest will remain sunny and seasonally hot. Gentle
onshore breezes will bring patches of low clouds to the southern
California coast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Seasonal Forecasts
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the National Weather Service issued its forecast for
the winter ahead. Seasonal forecasts are still experimental with
results that are only a bit better than flipping a coin. These
long-range predictions rely heavily on a mix of two forecasting
techniques. One method, called persistence, assumes that global
weather patterns that have been occurring in recent weeks will tend
to continue. The other, called the analog method, matches weather
patterns of years gone by with current patterns and assumes that
the weather that followed in the past will again come to pass. &QL;

BILLS SEEK TO RAISE HIGH-TECH VISA CAP TO MEET WORKER SHORTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 
(DUPLICATION ALERT: Story also moving in ``f'' financial category) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses
yearning to write programs in C++ and create Internet sites using
HTML.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a year since Congress nearly doubled the number of
immigration visas allowed for high-tech workers, but already
Washington lawmakers and technology companies are clamoring to
raise the limit again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase has proven insufficient due to the tight labor
market, increasing globalization, the rapid pace of the high-tech
sector, and the backlog of visas that developed from the prior
year,'' said Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., who held hearings on
the issue last week in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham said that although Congress raised the number of
so-called H-1B visas allowed from 65,000 to 115,000 in 1999, the
cap was reached by June, well ahead of the Sept. 30 end of the
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   And by some estimates, this year's allotment could be gone by
the end of January, a prediction that has lawmakers and high-tech
lobbyists scrambling to persuade Congress to bolster H-1B, a move
opposed by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has also been clouded by a recent acknowledgment by
the Immigration and Naturalization Service that a computer error
had caused it to exceed the 1999 H-1B visa cap by as many as
20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is as high-stakes as it is high-tech, with the
economy burgeoning from growth in e-commerce, the Internet, the
software industry and PC manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   For Texas, the issue is an important one.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1997, Texas added 102,000 high-tech jobs, more
than any other state, and it is home to some of the industry's
giants, including Texas Instruments in Dallas and Dell Computer in
Round Rock near Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The industry fears that it won't be able to meet demand for its
products without a healthy supply of skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Computer Technology Industry Association found
that the shortage of information technology, IT, professionals is
costing the U.S. economy $105 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Tech companies warn that not allowing them to recruit more
workers from abroad will stifle growth in an industry that now
employs 4.8 million workers nationwide and has added 852,000 jobs
to the economy since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing ground to other countries in key areas because
their companies have access to professionals with highly
specialized math and science skills when, very often, American
companies don't,'' said Sandy Boyd, assistant vice president for
human resource policy at the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply can't afford to wait to streamline our visa process,
which often leads to delayed projects, lost business opportunities
and limited job creation.''
</P>
<P>
   His cry has been heard on Capitol Hill, where no fewer than five
bills are making their way through Congress in an attempt to solve
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``With record low unemployment, many U.S. companies have been
forced to slow their expansion, or cancel projects, and may be
forced to move their operations overseas because of an inability to
find qualified individuals to fill job vacancies,'' said Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, who has introduced legislation seeking to raise the
H-1B limit.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's bill, and one from Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., would
raise the number of high-tech visas allowed from 115,000 to
200,000. A similar bill from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a
presidential candidate, would increase the cap to 175,000.
</P>
<P>
   But they face opposition from key Democrats and President
Clinton, who believe that boosting the temporary visas for educated
workers can cost American workers their jobs. Clinton also believes
that the industry needs to focus more on training people at home to
meet employment needs, focusing on the poor and on older workers.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that more must be done to interest students in
high-tech careers. Despite the promise of high wages and
near-certain employment, the number of U.S. students graduating
with high-tech degrees dropped from 219,000 in 1990 to 207,000 by
the end of 1996, the year of the latest data available.
</P>
<P>
   And engineering degrees, key to creation of the technologies
that have bolstered the growth of the American computer industry,
are down from 50,000 in 1990 to 44,800 by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Texas Instruments officials say they are as
interested in boosting the number of high-tech degrees as visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome an increase in the cap,'' said Dan Larson, a TI
spokesman in Washington, but he acknowledged that boosting the
number of visas every year is an ``imperfect solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see the whole issue of education addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   TI employs about 12,000 people in Texas, most in facilities
around Fort Worth-Dallas. It has 120 employees with H-1B visas.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats believe there is another solution.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., proposed a new class of
immigration visas, the T-Visa, for foreign-born technology workers
who have gained degrees on American campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Robb bill would grant visas to foreign workers with advanced
degrees in mathematics, science, engineering or computer science. A
worker must also have a job offer that pays at least $60,000 a year
to qualify. Recipients would be limited to recent graduates of U.S.
master's or doctoral programs, currently in the country on student
visas.
</P>
<P>
   Robb said the pool of such students nationwide is about 17,000,
a number small enough to sneak under the White House radar. Rep.
Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California's Silicon Valley,
introduced a similar measure in the House. Studies show Silicon
Valley is losing $4 billion a year because of the worker shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, said he has yet to see a
legislative remedy he is willing to endorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need to address the legitimate needs of high-tech
companies,'' he said. ``But we need to do so in a way that does not
disadvantage American workers.''

HOW DID HALLOWEEN BEGIN?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The history of Halloween goes back to ancient times, before
Christianity. For the Celtic people who lived in parts of Europe,
the date we know as Nov. 1 was the beginning of the new year. So
the evening before Nov. 1, there was a celebration, sort of like
celebrating New Year's Eve today.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, called Samhain, was the Celts' biggest holiday of
the year. It marked the beginning of winter _ by this time, the
crops should have been harvested and the animals moved to closer
pastures.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds normal enough, right? Here's where the ghosts come in:
The Celts believed that all the people who had died that year made
their journey to the ``otherworld'' during Samhain _ and in this
period of transition, the spirits of the dead were able to mingle
on earth with the living. People made sacrifices in honor of the
dead, and they believed spirits were wandering the streets at this
time, so they built bonfires to give them light.
</P>
<P>
   The Samhain festival changed when Christian missionaries came _
the Christians wanted to change Celtic practices, which they said
were against God. So they set the Christian feast All Saints at the
same time as Samhain, hoping the Celts would eventually accept it
as a substitute for their own pagan festival.
</P>
<P>
   All Saints' Day, Nov. 1, was a day set aside to honor Christian
saints. The following day was All Souls' Day, a day for the living
to pray for the souls of the dead. Despite the missionaries'
efforts, many of the Celtic traditions held firm, and the idea of
the wandering dead remained (the night before All Saints' Day was
considered a time of high supernatural activity). People would set
out food and drink for the spirits they still believed were walking
the streets that night _ and by that time, plenty of living people
were walking around, too, wearing masks and impersonating the dead.
In Old England, living people went ``a'soulin''' for ``soul cakes''
that were put out for the wandering spirits. Sounds a little like
trick-or-treating, right?
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where did the name Halloween come from?
</P>
<P>
   That spirit-filled night before All Saints' Day was called the
Eve of All Saints, the Eve of All Hallows or Hallow Even. The name
Hallow Even was shortened to become Hallowe'en.
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where did costumes and trick-or-treating come from?
</P>
<P>
   Trick-or-treating and dressing in costumes are our modern
imitations of the Celtic Samhain festival. Dressed as spirits (or
today, dressed as just about anything), we wander the streets _
just as the Celts believed their dead wandered during Samhain. Back
then, people put out food and drink for the spirits and the living
people masquerading as spirits; our version of this tradition is
passing out candy.
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is Halloween observed in other countries?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of similar celebrations can be found worldwide. In
England, for example, Nov. 5 is Guy Fawkes Day; the observance
commemorates the day in 1605 when a man named Guy Fawkes was
accused of attempting to bloe Houses of Parliament. The
night before Nov. 5 is known as Mischief Night, a time when
children play pranks on adults. On Nov. 5, dummies representing
Fawkes are burned in bonfires.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin American countries, El Dia de los Muertos, the Day of
the Dead, is Nov. 1. The skull is the symbol of death, and that
symbol can be seen everywhere, from candy to toys to decorations. A
festival gives people a chance to remember those who have died.
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why do some people not participate in Halloween events?
</P>
<P>
   Many conservative Christian groups in America consider the
celebration of Halloween sinful and us. They say Halloween
activities are done in honor of false or pagan gods, even if they
aren't done seriously. These groups give biblical examples of pagan
festivals bringing God's wrath, and they say Halloween is a
modern-day pagan festival. Satan isn't someone to be played with,
they say, and there is no harmless way to celebrate the underworld.

REGULATOR SAYS U.S. NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS Y2K READY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior government nuclear regulator said Tuesday
that America's nuclear power plants are prepared for the millennium
computer bug but warned that their Soviet-era counterparts in
Russia and Ukraine were vulnerable to potential computer failure.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Miraglia, deputy executive director of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, told Congress that 99 of the 103 U.S.
nuclear power plants are prepared for the so-called year 2000, or
Y2K, problem. The remaining four, he said, are being tested and
will be ready by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we can never give 100 percent guarantees, we can say
that probability of anything going wrong at a U.S. nuclear power
plant are extremely, extremely low,'' Miraglia said.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC, located in Rockville, Md., regulates the nation's
nuclear industry. Nuclear power provides about 20 percent of the
nation's electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., said the industry had done a ``good
job'' of preparing for possible computer complications but that it
should keep working ``until the final minutes on Dec. 31, 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts fear that computers originally programmed to recognize
only the last two digits of a year will fail or malfunction on Jan.
1, 2000, when the machines will assume it is 1900. The government
and businesses have responded to the potential problem by replacing
older computer systems and other vulnerable equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Miraglia said that the U.S. nuclear sites also were prepared for
other emergencies, such as power grid failures that could cut off
the flow of electricity to the plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the plants will be able to safely operate on their
own in case any outside problem comes up,'' he told members of the
House committees on Government Reform and Science, which are
monitoring the possibility of the computer bug causing a nuclear
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Miraglia warned that the nuclear power industry in the former
Soviet Union was far behind schedule in its Y2K efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These countries are more or less in the `awareness' stage
instead of solving the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Rhodes, director of the Office of Computer and Information
Technology Assessment at the General Accounting Office, a
government investigative agency, said the Chernobyl-type reactors
have poor back-up systems to deal with outside emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   On April 26, 1986, the worst accident in the history of the
nuclear power industry occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant near Kiev, Ukraine. An estimated 135,000 people were
evacuated from the area after an unauthorized experiment caused
fires and explosions at the plant, resulting in the release of
radiation into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes said the chance of a computer problem arising at one of
the Soviet-designed reactors in Russia and Ukraine was ``very
low.'' He warned, however, that the greater risk was that a power
grid supplying electricity to a plant would fail and that the
facility's back-up generator also would fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the Russians don't maintain these back-up
generators very well,'' Rhodes told members of the congressional
panels. ``We've even heard reports that in some of the plants,
employees have stolen the diesel fuel that the generators run on to
sell on the black market.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes said the worst-case scenario would be a meltdown,
accompanied by the release of radioactive gases that would cause
localized contamination. Rhodes stressed that the chances of that
happening were ``extraordinarily low.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Russian nor Ukrainian embassy officials could be reached
for comment on the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Russian officials agreed to allow American
experts to conduct computer tests on some of Russia's strategic
facilities, including nuclear power plant reactors. The tests will
begin in November. The two countries also decided to establish a
crisis center to monitor and safeguard nuclear materials.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and Ukraine have a combined 45 nuclear power plants.
There are 252 nuclear power plants worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes said the rest of the world's plants, while not as tested
as those in the United States, should be ready. ``Everybody's done
a good job getting prepared for this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes added that the year 2000 bug would not affect the U.S.
nuclear arsenal. ``Thankfully, nuclear weapons run on different
types of clocks that don't take into account what year it is,'' he
said.

 &HT;    ICE CREAM MAGNATE OFFERS TO REPAY GRANT IF DEFENSE BUDGET CUT
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You could call it ice cream wars.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom Delay lobbed the first, well, scoop
Sunday by ridiculing ways that the federal government spends money.
Among them: ``$850,000 to Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream to distribute
ice cream in the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   But Delay wasn't picking just any target.
</P>
<P>
   He was aiming at Ben Cohen, who not only co-founded the high-end
ice cream company Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade, but who also formed a
group of corporate executives who want to cut the defense budget
and spend more on children and education.
</P>
<P>
   So Cohen fired back Tuesday, offering to give back the grant
money if Delay would cut out the ``pork'' that Congress added to
this year's Pentagon budget.
</P>
<P>
   The ice cream magnate defended the 1994-1996 program in Russia,
in which his company provided business expertise to a local ice
cream company by training employees and working with farmers. Ben &AMP;
Jerry's pulled out of the partnership in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``That grant to help the Soviet Union develop a market economy
was appropriately awarded,'' Cohen said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm willing to personally repay the $800,000 when
Congressman Delay takes back the $3.3 billion in unrequested funds
Congress gave the Pentagon and allocates that money to our nation's
schools instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Charging that the ``billions in pork'' for defense projects was
a repayment for campaign donations by defense contractors, Cohen
said: ``But that doesn't reflect the spending priorities of the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to help Delay get that right.''
</P>
<P>
   The House majority whip flipped back this response:
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Cohen would rather send Chunky-Monkey (ice cream) to
people in Siberia than to get our men and women in uniform a good
quality of life and off of food stamps, then he's the one who
doesn't understand the nation's priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Delay's spokeswoman, Emily Miller, added of the pork-barrel
charge: ``What Mr. Cohen calls 'pork' could be a base that employs
thousands of people in someone's district or a (ship built by a)
factory that could keep an entire town economically sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's organization, Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities,
some 500 corporate executives and former defense officials, has
proposed a reduction of 15 percent in the Pentagon budget and a
transfer of $40 billion this year into health and education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, whose Vermont-based company sold $209 million worth of
ice cream last year, is not a major donor to political campaigns.
He donated $3,000 to Democratic congressional candidates in the
1998 elections but has not given to President Clinton, his
spokesman said.

BUDGET BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In politics, the more things change, the more they
stay the same _ especially at the end of a fiscal year when federal
budget negotiations between the White House and Congress are in
their final stages.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable clash of political priorities translates into
chaotic last-minute maneuvering, partisan grandstanding and dire
threats of disaster. Until a deal is actually struck, we hear
plaintive cries that shutting down the government again is not a
realistic option.
</P>
<P>
   We are watching this week a replay of the budget arguments that
have bedeviled the Clinton administration and its ideological
opposites in the Republican-controlled Congress for what seems like
an eternity. It always boils down to who gets which money to do
what.
</P>
<P>
   Now the drama is evolving rapidly, with the president winning
some, the Republicans winning some and neither side conceding that
the other is getting a scrap. Voters cannot be blamed for tuning
out.
</P>
<P>
   This is a ritual danced in secret, with plenty of exaggeration,
unfounded economic assumptions and downright lying. Protecting
Social Security is everybody's mantra, but it isn't really about
that. Oratory aside, neither side can afford to muck around much
with the retirement security of senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is outrageously partisan as usual. So are the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   They have even dusted off that old chestnut _ eliminating
``waste, fraud and abuse'' in government programs _ to make their
fallback proposal for a 1.4 percent across-the-board federal
spending cut sound painless. Ronald Reagan popularized the phrase
in his 1980 campaign as a way to avoid naming the specific program
cuts that would be required to reach his impossible goals of
reducing taxes, raising military spending and balancing the budget.
</P>
<P>
   It was a vague fantasy that worked as a campaign slogan but did
nothing to solve the inherent fiscal contradictions in his economic
triangle. Instead we got the spectacular Reagan era deficits.
</P>
<P>
   And the ploy won't work to reach the current Republican goal of
making the numbers look good enough to support a tax cut either.
</P>
<P>
   But House Whip Tom DeLay, the real behind-the-scenes power in
that body today, insists that the party's permanent dream of
slashing spending and taxes and is alive and well. In a television
interview Sunday he said Congress will pass all the contested
appropriations bills this week because the Senate leadership has
agreed to a House demand for a ``waste, fraud and abuse
amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why a penny-pinching Congress didn't take back the recent
pay raise members gave themselves instead, DeLay huffed: ``This
isn't about salaries. This is about waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Aha. His own financial support is essential, not a waste. But
the financial support that goes to others may not be essential, and
therefore a waste. This man has his eye on his own comfort level
but not on that of the country.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that the lack of major legislative achievement
this year makes congressional salaries of any size a waste. But
politicians are better at imposing budget constraints on others
than on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The new pay raise puts congressional salaries at $141,300, a
hike of $4,600 a year. (The next president also gets a raise in the
new measure that will double his salary to $400,000, but it will
not apply to Clinton.)
</P>
<P>
   But back to ``waste, fraud and abuse.'' It's easy to point to
examples of waste _ from aircraft carriers nobody wants except the
senators in whose state they will be built to the salaries of
federal inspectors who check on pepperoni pizza. But one person's
``waste'' is another's cherished project.
</P>
<P>
   To defend the concept of federal excess, Reagan appointed a
special private sector commission on cost control headed by J.
Peter Grace, a shipping magnate. The group's survey concluded that
``one third of all taxes are consumed by waste and inefficiency in
the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1984 Grace report found $424 billion that it said could be
saved with a more businesslike approach. The proposed crackdown
included reductions in contributions to food stamp, Medicaid, and
child nutrition programs; elimination of duplicative military
bases; tougher disability payment standards and decreased
contributions for health research. There was more, but you get the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was written by accountants, not politicians. The
politicians ignored it, although over the years some minor
recommendations have been enacted in the always-frantic search for
a way to cut the budget while handing out financial treats to as
many campaign contributors as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The DeLay spending cut is in the grand tradition of political
fakery. But it won't get past Clinton. Too stale, too stupid. Too
desperate.

 &HT;    FEMA director wants enhancement of N.C. town's levy, but
relocation urged
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ The nation's emergency management director
questioned Tuesday whether an eastern North Carolina town founded
by former slaves can protect itself from disastrous flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually submerged by Hurricane Floyd's historic flooding five
weeks ago, Princeville is wrecked and abandoned. The earth levy
which failed to hold back the rising Tar River remains unrepaired
where flooding breached it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The levy did not work,'' Federal Emergency Management Agency
Director James Lee Witt told officials of flood-ravaged towns
attending a meeting of the North Carolina League of Municipalities.
''Can they build the levy back up to protect Princeville?''
</P>
<P>
   As part of Princeville officials' determination to rebuild in
the flood plain, Mayor Delia Perkins told Witt that town officials
were talking to the U.S. Corps of Engineers about repairing and
''enhancing'' the levy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very important that we build back in a way that is
safe,'' said Witt, on his fifth visit to North Carolina to assess
damage from three hurricanes _ Dennis, Floyd and Irene _ over two
months.
</P>
<P>
   While federal and state officials have refrained from telling
Princeville officials how to proceed, they made it clear Tuesday
their top priority is urging eastern North Carolinians who live in
the 100-year-flood plain to relocate elsewhere. As emotionally
wrenching as moving can be _ particularly from historic places such
as Princeville _ officials said town leaders need to prepare for
storms as devastating as Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today by planning communities to address the oldest of threats
_ natural disasters _ we can also plan to embrace the newest of
opportunities,'' Witt said. ''We can make them more attractive to
business, better manage sprawl and protect their natural
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is a silver lining, it's the chance to start fresh,
to rebuild, to help people be safe from future harm,'' North
Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt said. ''We can't control the forces of
nature, but we can control what happens after that.''
</P>
<P>
   So far in Princeville, leaders have rejected the idea of
relocating from the flood plain all but the historic buildings,
such as the town hall. Those buildings, state and federal officials
said, could be refurbished as part of a plan to promote tourism in
the community, originally named Freedom Hill by freed slaves in
1865.
</P>
<P>
   But an unofficial body composed of the town's former mayors, the
Princeville Blue Ribbon Commission, has taken over the task of
rebuilding the town. It is asking Hunt for $75 million and
presenting a five-year redevelopment plan that needs approval from
town leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our purpose is to rebuild the oldest chartered black
municipality in America,'' Asbury Batchelor, a former town mayor
and commission member, said Monday during a town meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But some residents whose homes were destroyed want state and
federal agencies to buy their property, part of what Witt said
would be the largest government buyout of homes in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Across eastern North Carolina, 6,000 to 10,000 flood-destroyed
homes might qualify for government buyouts, said Eric Tolbert, the
state's emergency management director. The pricetag would range
from $350 million to $500 million in federal and state funds.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's meeting, Princeville residents jeered town officials
over their unwillingness to ask the state for money to buy homes
and relocate residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why all this ducking and dodging?'' asked Glennie Matthewson,
a former mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday in Greensboro, Perkins said town officials ''have not
had time to talk about buyouts.''
</P>
<P>
   They've been consumed by restoring services, such as water and
sewer, Perkins said. She expects some residents who are living in a
government trailer park in Rocky Mount to begin moving the campers
onto their Princeville property, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Town Manager Sandra White said only 16 of Princeville's 2,100
residents signed a list Monday night asking for a buyout of their
property.
</P>
<P>
   Witt and Hunt met privately in Greensboro to discuss expediting
government buyouts of eastern North Carolina property.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not want to see this thing in North Carolina take three
or four years,'' Hunt said.

   CLINTON-PRIVACY (Washington) _ Exclusive: President Clinton will
soon propose sweeping new federal regulations to protect the
privacy of billions of medical records and will assail Congress for
failing to enact any safeguards, administration officials said
Tuesday. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   SPEND-CONGRESS (Washington) _ The latest Republican strategy for
passing a budget, an across-the-board spending cut, was under
attack even from Republicans on Tuesday, and the House majority
whip, Tom DeLay of Texas, implicitly threatened to shut the
government down if President Clinton did not find a way to match
the spending cuts Congress is backing. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-BOMBING (Undated) _ A close look at the U.S. decision to
attack pharmaceutical plan in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, in
response to the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania. A Special Report by James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OBESITY-HORMONE (Undated) _ In 1994, researchers discovered
leptin, a hormone that seemed to make fat mice slim. The following
year, to much fanfare, it was announced that humans made leptin
too, raising hopes that the hormone might do the same thing for
people that it did for the mice. But Tuesday, the first published
clinical study of leptin finds that the substance is not the weight
loss panacea that obesity researchers had hoped for. By Gina
Kolata.

<P>
   ABORTION-BAN (Undated) _ A court has delivered the first ruling
upholding a state ban, Wisconsin's, on partial-birth abortion. By
Jo Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-TONE (Washington) _ For the first time in more than a
decade, the fight for the Democratic presidential nomination has
triggered a fierce competition for the loyalties of its once
embattled liberal wing. And the catalyst for the struggle is
clearly Bill Bradley, who has consistently positioned himself to
the left of his lone rival, Vice President Al Gore, on a wide range
of issues, from gay rights to health care to child poverty to
criminal justice. By James Dao.

</P>
<P>
   THE-SOPRANOS-TV (Undated) _ ``The Sopranos,'' shown earlier this
year as what was, in effect, a mini-series, was produced in the
hope that it would become a continuing HBO series if successful,
which it was. Thirteen new episodes have already been filmed, to be
broadcast starting in January, after a possible rerun of the
original show the last week in December. ``Berlin Alexanderplatz,''
``The Singing Detective'' and ``The Sopranos'' are something more
than miniseries. Packed with characters and events of Dickensian
dimension and color, their time and place observed with satiric
exactitude, each has the kind of cohesive dramatic arc that defines
a work complete unto itself. No matter what they are labeled or
what they become, they are not open-ended series, or even
mini-series. They are megamovies. By Vincent Canby.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-THEATER (Undated) _ Steven Drukman, who is writing a
history of American avant-garde theater, earlier this month, asked
nine American playwrights gathered in Provincetown, Mass., to
discuss the future of American theater.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HARRELSON-THEATER (New York) _ Woody Harrelson, 38, is in many
ways the boyish, free-wheeling bartender _ the role that made him
famous on the successful sitcom ``Cheers.'' In a recent interview
he admitted to a long-running problem with punctuality (``I was
born two months early and have never been early since'') and
clearly has a strong carpe diem streak. Even more resonant,
Starbuck, Harrelson's character in ``The Rainmaker,'' is a rootless
wanderer, a dreamer who charms people into believing he can bring
rain, then cuts out with their cash. So it is tempting to see all
sorts of links between the actor and his latest acting job. ``The
Rainmaker,'' N. Richard Nash's 1954 comic drama, will open at the
Brooks Atkinson Theater on Nov. 11. By Robin Pogrebin. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   HEART-ART-THEATER (New York) _ A look at Michael Weller's new
satirical comedy, ``The Heart of Art.'' Weller, 57, best known for
his 1970s plays ``Moonchildren'' and ``Loose Ends'' and his
screenplays for ``Hair'' and ``Ragtime,'' had three other works
produced in the 1970s and '80s by Joseph Papp, the short,
mercurial, cigar-smoking impresario of the Public Theater, a home
to challenging drama and provocative playwrights. By Mervyn
Rothstein. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PINA-BAUSCH-DANCE (New York) _ The reports from Germany confirm
it: Pina Bausch has mellowed. ``Gone are the days of the
all-too-ugly battle of the sexes,'' announced one critic. Another
wrote that the artistic director of the Pina Bausch Tanztheater
Wuppertal ``has become gentle,'' displaying a ``new and almost
old-fashioned tenderness.'' Kissing couples abound, as do scenic
projections of erotically bursting petals and shivering stamens.
The Pina Bausch Tanztheater Wuppertal returns to the Brooklyn
Academy for its seventh appearance this week (Tuesday and Thursday
through next Sunday), after a monthlong tour in California, Arizona
and Texas. This time, the company brings the 1995 production,
``Danzon,'' one of only two dances in the repertory that feature
Ms. Bausch onstage. By Ann Daly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHILD-OF-TIME-MUSIC (New York) _ The New York Philharmonic will
present Sir Michael Tippett's oratorio ``A Chld of Our Time'' on
Thursday at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City. Those performances
will be the orchestra's first of the work. But they are by no means
the first for its principal guest conductor, Sir Colin Davis, who
has been a fervent champion of Tippett's music since the 1960s, and
who conducted a performance of ``A Child of Our Time'' in London
during the summer to honor the composer, who died in January of
last year. By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   CARMINA-BURANA-MUSIC (Undated) _ Even amid the dizzying
heterogeneity of 20th-century musical styles, ``Carmina Burana,''
by the German composer Carl Orff, remains one of a kind. Written in
1936, this ``profane cantata'' sets medieval Latin texts depicting
the pleasures of drink, gambling and diverse country matters.
Christian Thielemann's new version with the Chorus and Orchestra of
the Deutsche Oper Berlin (Deutsche Grammophon 453 587-2; CD) finds
an admirable balance between refinement and expressive intensity,
avoiding the standard-issue garrulity too common in performances of
this work. By Lawrence A. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GILLESPIE-ART (Cambridge, Mass.) _ Gregory Gillespie's
``Self-Portrait in a Black Shirt'' (1968-69) is one of those
remarkable paintings that, if known only in reproduction, creates a
startling effect when seen in person. For one thing it is
surprisingly small, less than one foot square. For another, even at
this scale it packs a wallop. When Gillespie made this painting,
included in his traveling retrospective of 39 works on view through
Jan. 2 at the List Visual Arts Center at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, it offered a challenge to both prevailing
abstract movements and to Pop irony. By Miles Unger.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-RADIO-SHRINKS (Undated) _ Analyze this. Radio psychologists,
who used to go couch to couch only on the AM-FM dials, are breaking
into television. Dr. Joy Browne, who is based in New York on WOR
(710-AM) and syndicated throughout the nation, began broadcasting
last month on CBS. Her biggest rival, Dr. Laura Schlessinger, who
is based in Los Angeles on KFI (640-AM) and also nationally
syndicated, has just made a deal with Paramount for her own
television show next fall. By Andrea Higbie. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   TV-WOMEN-SUFFRAGETTES (Undated) _ Ken Burns usually prides
himself on the wide scope of his historical knowledge. But it
wasn't long ago that the director of ``The Civil War'' made a
humbling discovery: He knew next to nothing about Elizabeth Cady
Stanton and only slightly more about Susan B. Anthony, the two
19th-century women who campaigned longest and hardest for a
constitutional amendment that would give women the right to vote.
He now regards them as, hands down, ``the two most important women
in American history.'' After three years of working on his new
two-part documentary, ``Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony,'' will premiere next
Sunday and Monday nights on PBS. By Suzanne MacNeille.

GINGRICH ON FOX NEWS; BLACK FRIDAY FOR FOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich on Fox News
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich has answered the question of where he will draw a
salary now that he now longer receives his pay from the government.
Fox News is to announce Wednesday that it has hired Gingrich in an
exclusive deal to provide political commentary.
</P>
<P>
   The terms were not announced. John Moody, the vice president for
news for Fox's all-news cable network, said Tuesday, ``He's a man
of some reputation and he will be compensated well.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said through a spokesman: ``I'm thrilled to have this
opportunity to present my views. I look forward to the challenge.
This should be great fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich resigned as speaker of the House in January after
drawing criticism from members of his own party for the the poor
Republican showing in last fall's House elections.
</P>
<P>
   With a presidential election year soon to begin, several
networks had pursued Gingrich to provide political commentary,
Moody said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has a long personal relationship with Fox News
president Roger Ailes, noted one executive close to Gingrich noted.
As speaker of the House, Gingrich was criticized for a deal with
the publishing house HarperCollins to write a book based on his
political views. Both HarperCollins and the Fox News Network are
owned by News Corp., which is owned by Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment is effective immediately, Moody said. He said
Gingrich would not make regularly scheduled appearances on Fox News
shows but would be called upon to comment on specific political
events.
</P>
<P>
   Moody said that Gingrich would also serve as host of occasional
programs on topics that interest him. ``These will not necessarily
be about politics,'' Moody said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox announced earlier this week that former Rep. Geraldine
Ferraro was joining the network as a regular political commentator,
and Moody said there might be occasions when Fox would ask Gingrich
and Ms. Ferraro to comment on the same events.
</P>
<P>
   Fox News also calls upon Dick Morris, former political
consultant to President Clinton, and former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
for political commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's main cable news competitor, CNN, will serve as the host
network for a meeting Wednesday night between Vice President Al
Gore and his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bill
Bradley, at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The format is t a town meeting rather than a formal debate, but
it will allow the two men to comment on each other's stands.
Bernard Shaw of CNN is to serve as the moderator.
</P>
<P>
   A Black Friday
</P>
<P>
   The bleak fall season for the Fox broadcast network has turned
into one of the most sweeping setbacks in network television with
Fox's decision to cancel its entire Friday night lineup.
</P>
<P>
   That means a shockingly quick demise for ``Harsh Realm,'' the
new science fiction series from Chris Carter, creator of ``The
X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   The extent of Fox's problems is perhaps reflected in the fact
that the network would dispatch a new show from so respected a
producer after just three weeks and on such short notice that the
network couldn't notify listings services of the specials that will
fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
   The other Friday show being killed off, a police series called
``Ryan Caulfield, Year One,'' had only two weeks to prove its
worthiness. Last week the combination produced the lowest results
ever for Fox on a Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it surprised many in the television industry that Fox
would make the call so quickly, especially after canceling Carter's
other series, ``Millennium,'' last spring. Usually a producer as
important as Carter at least gets a chance to move a show to
another night.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Harsh Realm'' was among the most expensive new shows, and
pulling it out of production now is certain to save Fox some money.
</P>
<P>
   More crucial for Fox right now may be what happens with ``The
X-Files.'' New episodes of that longtime Fox hit will begin Nov. 7.
But its future in the longer term remains in doubt. Neither Carter
nor the show's star David Duchovny have contracts beyond this
season, and Duchovny is already suing Fox, charging that his
profits from the show have been unfairly limited.
</P>
<P>
   Carter had said he wanted to work out some arrangement to
continue the show beyond this year, but that was before his new
series was dropped. One senior Fox executive said the decision to
drop ``Harsh Realm'' made it more likely that Fox would try to
extend ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this gloomy news, Fox got its first burst of sunshine
in a long time Tuesday when the ratings for the season premiere of
``Ally McBeal'' arrived. The show looked as strong as ever, even
beating ``Monday Night Football'' among many younger adults.

NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY RECEIVES NUREYEV FILM COLLECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Public Library announced Tuesday that
the world's largest archive of film, video and audiotapes of Rudolf
Nureyev has been given to the Dance Collection of the New York
Public Library for the Performing Arts. Called the Rudolf Nureyev
Collection, the archives range from film clips of Nureyev as a
student at the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad to documentaries made
after his death in 1993 at the age of 54.
</P>
<P>
   The donors are the Rudolf Nureyev Foundation of Liechtenstein
and the Rudolf Nureyev Dance Foundation of Chicago, established by
the dancer to support ballet performances and events, archival
preservation, the training of gifted young dancers, particularly
from Russia, and medical research. The collection, which includes
many films and videos never seen in the United States, was
assembled over six years, in part from Nureyev's own extensive
archives, by Wallace Potts, the film archivist at the Rudolf
Nureyev Foundation and a longtime friend of the dancer who filmed
his performances throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The foundations have also given the library $107,000 for the
cataloguing and processing of the archives, which is expected to
take two years. To date 370 titles have been cataloged. The
material will then be open to the public at the Dance Collection,
which is to return to renovated quarters at Lincoln Center in the
spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Nureyev collection includes professional recordings of
complete ballets and television appearances by a ``wild prince
destined to become king,'' as Lynn Seymour, the English ballerina
and a friend and partner of Nureyev, put it at the news conference
announcing the acquisition. There are also newsreels, tapes of
scholarly symposiums and music tapes made for ballets in which
Nureyev danced.
</P>
<P>
   Among the holdings are a 35-millimeter print of the ``Corsair''
solo he performed on his graduation from the Kirov school, films of
him dancing with the Kirov, and newsreel clips of him defecting in
1961 and being arrested with Margot Fonteyn in a drug raid in San
Francisco in 1967. Also in the collection are 16-millimeter films
of Nureyev and Erick Bruhn, his companion at the time, working at
the ballet barre in the early 1960s and of Nureyev relaxing on a
day off in Buenos Aires in 1972. He is also seen in an amateur
recording of ``The King and I,'' in which he toured the United
States in the title role in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   From early in his career Nureyev studied films and tapes for
clues to improving his performances. ``By watching an 8-millimeter
film of his early performances with the Kirov Ballet, he realized
how terrible his curtain calls were and he set about to improve
them,'' Wallace Potts said. Potts is the film archivist for the
Rudolf Nureyev Foundation and his tapes of Nureyev performances
throughout Europe are included in the collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to create a permanent archive that preserved
Nureyev's legacy on film and video, which is the best way to
preserve his art,'' said Sir John Tooley, chief of the Rudolf
Nureyev Foundation and the former general director of the Royal
Opera House Covent Garden. ``The Dance Collection of The New York
Public Library is the world's pre-eminent archive of dance related
material, and is therefore a perfect home for these treasures.''

`PASSIONATE NOMAD': TRIUMPHS AND FAILINGS OF A WANDERING WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.)  
(js) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For lovers of travelers' tales, the English of the early to
mid-20th century are hard to beat. There is Robert Byron's
marvelous ``Road to Oxiana,'' Peter Fleming's ``News From Tartary''
and Lawrence Durrell's ``Prospero's Cell.'' Among the minor
classics are the books of Freya Stark, including ``The Valley of
the Assassins,'' ``A Winter in Arabia,'' ``Perseus in the Wind''
and some 20 others. Her books make Stark a remarkable figure under
any circumstances. Having been a woman whose roamings through
Middle Eastern deserts and mountains put her in the top ranks of
the fabled Royal Geographical Society makes her more so.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Fletcher Geniesse's ``Passionate Nomad'' is a solid,
judicious, highly readable biography of Stark. Ms. Geniesse, a
magazine writer and former reporter for The New York Times, tells
Stark's story straightforwardly and without fuss, allowing her
eventful life, rather than a lot of commentary on it, to produce a
lively and flavorful narrative. Ms. Geniesse clearly sympathizes
with her subject, but she is far from unaware of Stark's faults,
which included a tendency toward romantic self-delusion and
self-pity. Ms. Geniesse has a minor tendency to gush, and she
glosses over what would seem now to be Stark's infatuation with the
exotic, which, among other things, led her to underestimate the
radical and extremist potential in Arabic and Islamic politics.
Still, the woman who emerges from these pages is a complex figure _
heroic, driven, lonely and entirely human, a person whose active
life combined the need for a kind of personal consolation with an
underlying self-consciously Nietzschean drive to live dangerously.
</P>
<P>
   Stark was born in Paris in 1893 and seemed destined at the
outset for an unusual life. Her flamboyant, beautiful and
domineering mother, Flora, whom Freya worshiped, had grown up in
Italy. Her father, Robert Stark, her mother's first cousin, was the
wealthy scion of a landholding family who became an expatriate
painter. The marriage was not good, nor was Freya's childhood
happy. Robert and Flora separated; Freya and her younger sister
Vera lived with their mother in Asola, a pretty Italian hill town
northwest of Venice. An accident in a factory owned by a strangely
autocratic Italian who was the special friend of her mother left
Freya physically scarred. She became engaged to a young Italian
doctor and was shattered when he left her for a former sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   But Freya had great personal magnetism and attracted the
interest of an impressive circle of friends. She climbed mountains
in the Italian Alps. She knew several European languages. In 1927,
when she was already 33, she managed to escape, going to Lebanon to
study Arabic. The adventure, which was to last the rest of her life
and make her one of the most famous women in the world, had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Geniesse recounts that adventure with a sensible kind of
verve. She reliably fills in the historical backgrounds of the
places Stark went; she cites bright passages from Stark's letters
and books; she never loses sight of Stark's bravery or of her
neediness. Stark's first move into the world of geographical and
ethnographic exploration was a trip on donkey to the Jebel Druze,
the mountainous stronghold of the Druze in southern Syria, then a
French mandate. Traveling in the company of an English friend named
Venetia Buddicom, Freya showed amazing sang-froid when the two were
arrested by French troops suspicious of English women wandering
about in territory closed to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Her next destination was Baghdad and the ruined fortress castles
of the Assassins, the mysterious Muslim sect that waged a deadly
terrorist war against the majority Sunni population of the
13th-century Abbasid Empire. Her writings, which included
corrections of existing maps, earned her a prize from the very
exclusive and very male Royal Geographical Society, and that led to
a book contract with a leading London publisher and the support of
a group of powerful and influential friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last seven years she had endured all kinds of physical
discomfort, from hunger and thirst to being crawled over by fleas
and flies, and there had been more than one occasion to agree with
Baudelaire that `the Orient without sun is nothing but a heap of
filth,''' Ms. Geniesse writes. Stark, she continues, ``had been
deeply moved by sweeping vistas in uncharted territory, awed by the
fading footprints of history on ruined cities and especially
impressed by the wisdom she found in cultures vastly different from
her own.'' She was happy, but she also sensed that among her deeper
motivations was a kind of desperate need to cover up an emptiness
within.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I should really have liked,'' she once confided to a
friend, ``is to be very pretty.'' When she was 37 and feeling the
imminence of middle age, she wrote to her mother: ``If only I could
eventually find some work that would make me feel settled and
interested . . . but no one seems to want women very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark's success brought her such renown that after her Baghdad
period, her travels had a kind of celebrity glamour to them, as did
her lectures and books. Ms. Geniesse introduces a large supporting
cast _ British soldier-diplomats at such places as Baghdad and
Yemen; a dashing French businessman with whom Freya fell in love in
Aden; her publisher, Jock Murray, the art connoisseur Bernard
Berenson and others. During the war Stark became a propagandist for
England in Cairo, but she was present for the 1941 siege of
Baghdad, when a pro-German, anti-British group of Iraqi military
officers briefly seized power and barricaded much of the foreign
community inside the British legation. The episode makes for
exciting reading.
</P>
<P>
   After the war Stark became a kind of grande dame, writing
several travel books, especially about Turkey. She became a friend
of the queen mother. At the age of 54 she married one of the
dashing army officers she had met on her exotic travels years
before, and only after the marriage discovered that he was
homosexual. She died in 1993 in Italy at the age of 100. That
entire century of fascinating life is encapsulated in Ms.
Geniesse's commendable book.

   NEW YORK _ Over the last two years, a quiet, bloodless
revolution has taken place at Orpheus, the conductorless chamber
orchestra that will play at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday. In the
spring, the group's founder, president and executive director,
Julian Fifer, gave up his position and handed the reins to Harvey
Seifter, a tough, experienced administrator who came to Orpheus
from the theater world.
</P>
<P>
   Seifter has been addressing the complaints that the musicians
have been raising over the last few years _ not the least being
that no one was addressing their complaints _ and reconsidering
everything Orpheus does, from the balance between its New York
concerts and its tours to the ratio of rehearsal hours to stage
time.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, when Orpheus' internal shake-up began, a casual
observer would have thought that all was well with the orchestra.
Fifer, a cellist, had started the musical collective in 1972 with a
handful of friends, most of them recent graduates of the Juilliard
School and Columbia University. Tapping into the antiauthoritarian
spirit of their student years, the players jettisoned the
conventional structure in which an orchestra's players do a
conductor's bidding in favor of a democratic method in which they
would shape their performances as a group. And they made it work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people see it as a stunt,'' said Melissa Meell, one of
the orchestra's cellists. ``We see it as chamber music.''
</P>
<P>
   By giving performances that are remarkably polished but also
rich in interpretive niceties, Orpheus has faced down skeptics who
believe that personality and insight trickle down from the
conductor's baton. And the players have continually pushed their
limits, taking on contemporary works like Lee Hyla's ``Trans'' or
the Elliott Carter Clarinet Concerto, both of which are so
rhythmically complex that cuing tasks have to be divided among
several players.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus has won a loyal following that has kept its annual
concerts at Carnegie Hall and Riverside Church well attended, and
critics in New York continue to find the orchestra's performances
fresh and full of surprises. Because Orpheus is one of many
freelance ensembles in the city _ only the New York Philharmonic
and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra pay year-round salaries _ its
musicians have also gained exposure through their outside work with
new music groups and other chamber orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious series of recordings on the Deutsche Grammophon and
Nonesuch labels have won Orpheus an audience abroad as well, and by
the mid-1980s the group was touring regularly in the United States
and Europe as well as more exotic places in South America and Asia.
Last year it became the first American professional orchestra to
perform in Hanoi since the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Offstage, though, Orpheus was in turmoil. One problem was what
many of the players perceived as a widening gulf between their view
of the orchestra's career and that of Fifer, who had put down his
cello in 1989 to devote himself full time to the orchestra's
administration. One of the major points of contention was touring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from being 20-somethings to 40-somethings,'' said Ms.
Meell, the cellist. ``We have families and kids, and some of us
have teaching jobs. We can't just pick up and go to India for two
weeks. We all grew up and the focus needed to change. Julian was
arranging these tours, but he was no longer getting on the buses
and the planes with us, and that makes a difference. He became a
suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Resentment of the touring schedule was not just a morale issue.
Because players are required to perform in only 35 percent of the
group's concerts to maintain their membership, many regulars were
ceding their tour places to substitutes. This meant a change in the
orchestra's chemistry and sound, and European critics, particularly
in Germany, complained of a drop in quality. The tours taxed the
budget as well: Orpheus' deficit had grown to around $500,000, a
significant amount for an ensemble with an annual budget of $4
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were stagnating,'' said Nardo Poy, a violist with Orpheus
since 1978. ``And there was tension between Julian's vision and the
rest of the orchestra's. It was a complicated relationship. Thanks
to Julian, the group took off in the 1980s and he made some very
smart moves on Orpheus' behalf. But we began to feel that with
touring as a focus, we had become invisible in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also the orchestra felt that a lot had been taken out of our
control,'' he continued. ``Orpheus was founded with the idea that
the players would have a say, not just on musical matters but on
career and business matters as well.''
</P>
<P>
   For Fifer, the truth is more nuanced. ``There were on-and-off
tensions and frictions,'' he said. ``A lot of that is the normal
course of being an executive director. I'm an internationalist,
generally. I felt it was important to keep up the orchestra's
international career, to keep it on an even keel and to support the
recording contracts we had. At the same time, I saw the needs of
the members as they got older and had families and other
responsibilities. So it's true, there was a growing difference
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he considered resigning the directorship of Orpheus
several times during the last decade. Just after the
25th-anniversary season he broached the subject formally with some
of the players and the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that I wanted to leave for another job,'' Fifer
said, ``but I felt I wanted to be on my own, to find my voice
again. And as the differences about touring and other issues arose,
I felt that perhaps they could be grappled with more successfully
by someone new, someone who didn't come to the job with the
accretion of a quarter century of attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifer was not ready to discuss his post-Orpheus projects, but he
said he would keep his ties to the ensemble. Last year he joined
the orchestra's 18-member board, and he said he would remain a
member. Three musicians, elected by the orchestra, were also given
seats on the board, and because they participate in all the major
committees, including finance, the players are likely to have a
greater hand in the way Orpheus is run than at any time since its
earliest days.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His successor, Seifter, studied the violin as a child, but his
professional experience has not been primarily musical. In 1996 and
1997 he was the associate director of Early Stages, an educational
program partly sponsored by the City of New York, and artistic
director of the Gretna Theater in southern Pennsylvania. Before
that he had been the executive director of Circle in the Square and
the Theater for a New City in New York, and general director of the
Magic Theater in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Seifter, who works with Orpheus' small staff in a set of
decidedly unglamorous offices in the bell tower of Riverside
Church, joined the organization as its development director in
February 1998. He was immediately invited by the board to consider
the orchestra's future in broader terms.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of Seifter's plan is a change in the orchestra's
freelance status. Next season the musicians would get their first
raises since 1994, and by 2003 they would have a contract
guaranteeing them 16 weeks of work every season, a substantial
gain. Seifter said that this would be ``a dramatic increase'' over
the players' current salaries of $25,000 to $30,000. It may not
satisfy everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the challenges we face is that the contracts may mean
an attendance requirement,'' said Frank Morelli, a bassoonist.
``That has an obvious artistic rationale, but given our commitments
to other parts of our lives, it may be difficult to accomplish. We
may lose some people in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Seifter doesn't think so. ``There's no question that this
represents a change in the Orpheus players' lives,'' he said. ``And
choices will have to be made. But the impetus for this has come
from the musicians.''
</P>
<P>
   The new administrator is also rethinking the ensemble's approach
to touring. Instead of Orpheus members' flying to Europe, piling on
a bus and traveling from city to city, Seifter is exploring the
possibility of residencies. A first is scheduled for the Cite de la
Musique in Paris in November 2000, when Orpheus will give a series
of concerts, open rehearsals and chamber music performances with
the two Viennese schools, Classicism and Serialism, as a unifying
musical theme. Discussions of teaching possibilities are under way
with the Paris Conservatoire. Other cities might include Madrid and
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have also been very successful in Japan, which is the
world's fastest growing market for classical music,'' Seifter said,
``and where we have something very unusual, a kind of friendship
council of American and Japanese corporate supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to limit our touring to one big tour a year,''
he continued, ``but if we can establish a few bases we can put down
marketing and development roots in those communities and maybe do
some run-out performances to nearby cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Another new emphasis is enhancing the group's presence in New
York City. A series of recent focus groups bore out the players'
contention that they had lost their New York identity. ``We
discovered,'' Seifter said, ``that many classical music lovers
thought that Orpheus was a German orchestra, probably because of
the Deutsche Grammophon recordings.''
</P>
<P>
   This season nearly half of Orpheus' concerts are to be given in
New York, up from an average of 10 to 15 percent over the last
decade. Besides the Carnegie Hall and Riverside Church series, the
orchestra is to perform in a centenary tribute to Kurt Weill at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music and in a series at the Ethical Culture
Society devoted to composers who have worked at Yaddo. A ``Live
from Lincoln Center'' performance with Itzhak Perlman is scheduled
for January. And Orpheus is about to begin a residency at Baruch
College in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Together these changes are expected to help Orpheus work more
efficiently. Under the current arrangement, the orchestra is hired
and rehearsed for each performance: if Orpheus plays a Mozart
symphony at Carnegie Hall in October and at Suntory Hall in Tokyo
six months later, the Tokyo performance must be rehearsed anew
because the ensemble is likely to be different. Seifter is hoping
to rework the orchestra's calendar to avoid that duplication of
effort. ``We're paid fees for our performances,'' he said, ``not
for our rehearsals.''
</P>

<P>
   DEMOCRACY AND ANARCHY IN CONCERT &QC;  By ALLAN KOZINN &QC;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra's labor-intensive
rehearsal process has not changed in recent years, although it has
been greatly streamlined since the ensemble's early days in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rehearsals used to be free-for-alls,'' said Nardo Poy, a
violist. ``We'd argue for an hour about one measure and then take a
vote on how to play it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, a three-member artistic committee from the orchestra
chooses the repertory. A core group _ the principal players from
each section, who change from piece to piece _ is responsible for
the interpretation of each work. When they first convene, the core
musicians play through the work as a chamber ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing together so long that we can read each
other with a movement of an eyebrow,'' Melissa Meell, a cellist,
said of the core group rehearsals. ``We might discuss clinical
things like tempos, breathing, what kind of sound we want and what
kind of character we'd like for the piece. Then we try to get into
the composer's head to figure out what he was getting at. That's
where there will be a lot of discussion and disagreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The core players convey their ideas to their sections, but at
the first full orchestra rehearsal everything can change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can say anything they want and generally they do,''
said Mathew Dine, an oboist.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the discussions the interpretation forms itself. That
doesn't mean we have control over everything. Spontaneous things
happen onstage, and sometimes after a performance we're saying,
`How did we do that?' But we go out knowing we're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus' method has made it a model of cooperation well beyond
the music world. Corporations like Novartis, a pharmaceutical
company, have hired Orpheus to give seminars in how performance
decisions are negotiated, and the orchestra plans to give seminars
in conflict resolution at Baruch College. Given that several
players have said that the final rehearsals can be tempestuous to
the point that chairs have been thrown, this might seem an unduly
ambitious sideline for the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' said Harvey Seifter, executive director of the
ensemble since the spring. ``The fact that a thrown chair is always
a possible option is an interesting part of the process. The bottom
line is that you have no choice but to reach a harmonious
conclusion. Otherwise you'll have chaos onstage at 8 o'clock that
night.''

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T's gamble in Atlanta cable markeBy Michael E. Kanell and
Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AT&AMP;T has a special challenge in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The huge company has made a $60 billion bet in buying MediaOne,
which has cable franchises across the country and is the dominant
provider in Atlanta. That move is part of AT&AMP;T's massive gamble on
cable, and despite MediaOne's pre-eminence here, Atlanta is one
place where AT&AMP;T could come up a loser.
</P>
<P>
   Competition to offer a range of telecom services _ phone,
entertainment and high-speed Internet access _ will likely be
fierce in the next few years. Customers will have choices they have
not had in picking cable providers. Already, national satellite
companies offer digital television, as does BellSouth in parts of
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Choice can be fatal to the unpopular provider, and in Atlanta,
MediaOne is fighting a lousy reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company argues that its improvement has been
dramatic, neither MediaOne nor AT&AMP;T denies that a potentially
deadly taint lingers on. ``There is a kind of residual
resentment,'' glumly acknowledged AT&AMP;T spokesman Bryant Steele.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne blames its Atlanta troubles on the deep past. In other
cities, the company bought respected and well-run Continental
properties. In Atlanta, the company bought problematic franchises
from Wometco and GCTV, then rapidly merged them. MediaOne, then a
unit of phone company US West, quickly stamped its name on the
franchises in metro Atlanta and launched a public relations blitz
touting _ and perhaps over promising _ its ambitions. More
recently, MediaOne barraged viewers with slogans about broadband,
although many customers are still beyond the reach of the estimated
$300 million in system improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The ambition was out of whack with customers' reality, but
things are improving, insists MediaOne spokesman Reg Griffin. ``As
homes are upgraded, we see the number of complaints go down. And by
the end of next year, that upgrade will be complete.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no way for outsiders to precisely measure MediaOne's
customer service, and no way for any unhappy individual to know how
typical his or her bad experience is. But Griffin said the company
acknowledges its problems and is spending money to hire more
employees and give them better training.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Pearl, manager of the center's in-bound sales group, said
MediaOne customer service in Atlanta revolves around a call center
where about 450 people work, staffing phones 24 hours a day with
more employees scheduled for peak times. Those workers have, of
late, been part of an in-the-company campaign parodying the ``got
milk?'' advertisements. Company executives appear on posters with
milk mustaches and the words, ``got service?''
</P>
<P>
   Internal ratings of how customers are handled shows a seven
percent improvement from late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Callers to MediaOne hear a recording that offers a menu of
choices. The company's goal is to have a human being handling calls
within an average of 30 seconds after they are picked up. ``Right
now, we are closer to 90 to 120 seconds,'' Pearl said.
</P>
<P>
   Those goals and results do not include times there is an outage
of service in a town or neighborhood which sends a sudden shock
wave of customer calls to MediaOne. But it may also not be in the
power of the company to satisfy all customers: Nearly one caller in
ten hears the recording start and simply hangs up.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne spokesman Griffin denied that the company has
deliberately ignored customer complaints to focus on the upgrade to
high-speed service. He said the company has hired about 100 new
technicians, an effort to lessen complaints about contractors, who
now do 30 percent of cable installations. ``Our goal is to bring
installation completely in back in-house.''
</P>
<P>
   With AT&AMP;T's looming presence comes the promise of still higher
standards _ and higher stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, AT&AMP;T and MediaOne are not alone in offering Atlantans
new digital services. In Chamblee, Comcast is offering high-speed
access to the Internet via its At Home service operators
offering similar services in metro Atlanta include Charter
Communications in Newnan and Smyrna Cable in Smyrna.
</P>
<P>
   High-speed Internet access is only one of the many services now
available through cable because of the new digital networks the
industry is building.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne and Atlanta-based Cox Communications also want to offer
their own branded telephone service. In fact, MediaOne has been
doing so in Atlanta for the past two years. And Cox Communications
does the same in various cities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Equipping digital networks to carry telephone signals has proven
expensive, and many other cable operators have backed off from
offering this service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telephone service costs a lot of money up-front,'' says
Spencer Grimes, a media analyst with investment bank Soloman Smith
Barney in New York. ``My hat is off to Cox for trying to do this on
its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, other operators, such as Time Warner and Comcast, have
decided only to offer telephone service through a third party such
as AT&AMP;T. But AT&AMP;T has been unable to reach a definite agreement
with these operators, although it does have a tentative deal with
Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Cox Communications leads the cable industry in
telephony. It has some 81,000 customers. That represents a big
chunk of the estimated 150,000-200,000 cable telephone customers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes doubts, however, that this service is yet profitable. He
says an operator needs at least a 20 percent penetration to make
money.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications' penetration is reportedly in the double
digits in some of its bigger markets, such as Southern California.
In Omaha, Nebraska, the company provides about 40 percent of its
cable subscribers with telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cox Communications, AT&AMP;T also wants to do it all _ cable
television and high-speed Internet access along with phone. AT&AMP;T's
entre into cable is essentially an end-around, a high-stakes race
to detour around the regional phone companies, gaining a line to
customer homes. Buying cable connections _ and often rebuilding
them _ is, on the surface, vastly redundant. But it has several
potentially key advantages.
</P>
<P>
   First, AT&AMP;T can avoid the need to pay billions of dollars in
connection fees. But more important is the chance to link directly
with customers, a bond that could include all manner of new,
high-margin services without interference from a local phone
company like BellSouth. That ``second wire'' to the home could give
the cable company the benefit of customer inertia, in addition to
thicker profit margins. That is, once the customer is off phone
company copper, it will take no effort to stay off.
</P>
<P>
   But first, customers must be moved away from the current status
quo.
</P>
<P>
   And that means spending billions of dollars upgrading cable
systems and convincing customers to switch away from what may be
the only phone company they have ever known. And that could ride on
reputation. An unknown carrier must make a compelling case, perhaps
by steep discounted prices. For the giant once known as Ma Bell,
the route may be somewhat easier.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest long-distance company, is also one of
the world's best-known brands. Through various surveys, the name
has consistently scored high in consumer respect. Were AT&AMP;T to
simply slap its name on MediaOne, the company would likely see an
immediate improvement in customer ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But what if service falls short of the rep?
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity to change customer perceptions is right with
the merger,'' said Jaimie Hardin, AT&AMP;T director for Georgia. ``But
if you don't provide the highest level of service, that halo will
wear off pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means that MediaOne must satisfy AT&AMP;T before it receives
the AT&AMP;T corporate tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   It took six months after TCI's acquisition for its customers to
be told they were now receiving service from AT&AMP;T. It will likely
take at least that long after the deal closes for MediaOne to win
the AT&AMP;T seal, Hardin said.

INDONESIA'S NEW CABINET IS LONG ON DIVERSITY, SHORT ON EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Like a political conjuror, Indonesia's new
president produced a Cabinet on Tuesday that satisfied a dazzling
range of constituencies in this fractured country while lowering
the profile of the military and addressing the immediate need for
stability.
</P>
<P>
   In his most striking move, President Abdurrahman Wahid named a
civilian as Defense Minister and shifted command of the armed
forces from the politically aggressive and tainted army to the
navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think that the military are crazy,'' Wahid told
reporters. ``They are responsible. They know that the whole society
is changing now.''
</P>
<P>
   In what he called a ``national unity Cabinet,'' the president
mixed political affiliations but avoided any figures publicly
linked to the corrupt practices of the past. The Cabinet appeared
to reflect public demands for reform and, the president put new
emphasis on human rights by creating a special ministry on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some compromises,'' he said, relaxed and sometimes
joking as he presented his new government in a televised ceremony.
But he said he expected the public to find his new team ``very
satisfactory.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors and political analysts said they were not sure
if the new government lineup heralded the stability they have been
waiting for. They cited the mixmaster nature of the Cabinet, the
critical nature of Indonesia's political and economic problems and
the continuing questions about Wahid's health and leadership
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, there seemed to be agreement that Wahid's first
steps since taking office last Wednesday had been positive ones.
</P>
<P>
   Moving quickly on another sensitive issue, Wahid said that the
leader of newly independent East Timor, Jose Alexandre Gusmao,
would be welcome to visit Jakarta and that he would go to meet him
at the airport if he comes.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan formally notifying him that Indonesia accepts the results of
the territory's vote for independence on Aug. 30. The United
Nations is preparing to form an interim administration there.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet displays the emerging inclusive style of Wahid,
whose first act as president was to select his chief rival,
Megawati Sukarnoputri, as vice president. She sat beside him
Tuesday during his televised announcement and then, because he is
partly blind, read the Cabinet list on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In a seemingly spontaneous give-and-take with reporters later,
Wahid said economic recovery and territorial integrity were the
first priorities of his new government.
</P>
<P>
   Local and foreign analysts said the Cabinet was strong on talent
but shallow in political experience. Its diversity was a short-term
plus, they said, but raised the possibility of longer-term
conflicts and paralysis. This is particularly so because Wahid, 59,
who is in poor health, is not known as an aggressive day-to-day
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does look like an all-things-to-all-people Cabinet,'' said
Eric Bjornlund, the director of the Jakarta office of the Carter
Center, based in Atlanta. ``It's an attempt at what has been called
a national unity government that in the long term might not be
either viable or good for democracy, but perhaps is the right thing
to have at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, who won the presidency in an electoral assembly through a
tortured coalition of competing parties, paid his political debts
deftly while including members from a variety of geographical
regions, ethnic groups and religions in the broadest-based Cabinet

   He said the Cabinet was a joint production that included rival
political leaders who now hold prominent government positions as
well as the outgoing defense minister and armed forces chief, Gen.
Wiranto. All share the responsibility for the performance of his
government, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts said the new economic team appeared to be
competent but added that it has little choice but to follow the
guidelines of the International Monetary Fund and to work to
attract foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There were some questions about the commitment to these
guidelines of the economic coordinating minister, Kwik Kian Gie.
The finance minister, Bambang Sudibyo, is a professor with a low
political and academic profile and appeared to have been named as
part of a political deal.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of the military from its strong role in politics
is one of the president's most difficult challenges in creating a
more democratic society. He appeared to bend over backward to
satisfy the army even as he reduced its prominence.
</P>
<P>
   The new defense minister, Juwono Sudarsono, the former education
minister, is a well respected scholar and manager who was once the
deputy head of an elite military policy institute.
</P>
<P>
   The new chief of the armed forces, Adm. Widodo Adisutjipto, was
Wiranto's second-in-command, potentially easing the blow to top
army officers who might otherwise have been promoted. Indonesia's
relatively small navy has not been as politically aggressive as its
army and is less tainted by corruption and brutality.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wahid also softened his moves by giving Wiranto a vaguely
defined role as a coordinating minister, while removing him from
direct political and military control. The general has been
identified with the military's measured withdrawal from politics
and it is possible that he could remain highly influential in his
new job.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the president moved two of the army's most
reform-minded generals into civilian ministerial jobs, also
balancing the appointment of Juwono as defense minister.

 &HT;    29 charged in Atlanta theft ring
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Store managers knew thousands of items were
disappearing off their shelves. But it took them months before
realizing they were victims of an alleged shoplifting ring of
immense proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Federal indictments unsealed Tuesday in Atlanta charged 29
defendants in a multistate shoplifting scheme that brought in an
estimated $10 million. A former Atlanta police officer also was
charged with extortion for shielding the crime ring.
</P>
<P>
   The ring operated out of a non-descript storefront office on
Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in south Atlanta, federal
prosecutors said. The stolen items were then repackaged at nearby
warehouses and sent to discount stores in New York and Maryland for
resale, the federal indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged shoplifters did not go after luxury items. Instead,
they pilfered small-sized goods, such as over-the-counter
pharmaceuticals, cigarettes, razors, film and pain relievers,
according to court records. The ring began operating in 1994 and
continued through this past summer, the indictment said. The
shoplifters, called ``boosters,'' brought stolen goods by the
garbage bag-full to the storefront office, U.S. Attorney Richard
Deane said. The enterprise generated as much as $50,000 in stolen
merchandise a day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit us pretty hard, as well as other retailers, and
consumers in general,'' said Brenda McNamara, manager of national
investigations for Dayton Hudson Corp., which owns Target and
Mervyn's.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is continuing, FBI Special Agent In Charge
Theodore Jackson said. ``The people who suffer the most are not
only the retailers, but the customer as well,'' he said, noting
that higher insurance rates mean higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton Hudson investigators first alerted federal officials to
the ring. Investigators from the FBI, Atlanta police, Internal
Revenue Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service were
then brought in. The defendants face charges including conspiracy,
money laundering and interstate transportation of stolen goods.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the storefront office was operated
by Rakesh Patel. Another lead defendant, Mahir Desai, then sent the
stolen goods to warehouses in nearby Decatur and Tucker, where they
were ``cleaned'' by removing price and alarm tags.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandise was then shipped to discount stores in New York
and Maryland, the indictment said. These store owners also were
indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Patel and Desai are among 13 defendants in the case who
illegally immigrated here from Pakistan, INS assistant district
director Bart Szafmicki said.
</P>
<P>
   The former Atlanta police officer, Ellis Lane, accepted three
cash payments totalling $1,100 between July 22 and Aug. 4, the
indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, a 19-year veteran, was fired from the department for
unrelated reasons, Chief Beverly Harvard said. The department made
that decision after a partner of Lane's came forward and complained
about Lane's improper work habits, such as sleeping on duty,
Harvard said.

DISPUTE OVER BEEF IMPORTS HAS BRITAIN AND FRANCE IN A FOOD FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Just say non,'' said one sign outside a British supermarket
urging customers to avoid French food products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get caught with a frog in your throat,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the French refused to import British beef _ even
after the European Commission called it safe and removed the ban
imposed because of mad cow disease _ the two countries have been
engaged in an increasingly bitter food fight.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's agricultural minister has publicly refused to buy any
French food and his stance has been followed by several big
supermarket chains that have been taking French bread, fruit and
cheese off the shelves. Meanwhile English farmers have been
picketing supermarkets urging customers to ``Buy British Eat
British.''
</P>
<P>
   In a tit-for-tat move, French farmers have threatened to block
British products arriving at French ports if the British government
decides to make the boycott official. (So far, Prime Minister Tony
Blair has refused to do so despite pressure from Conservatives in
Parliament.)
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear that France's stand has unleashed a wave of fury
in Britain. Anger rose even more last week, when the European
Commission criticized the French for using sewage sludge in their
animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, the French _ who have become ultra
aware of food safety after a series of health scares in Europe not
only over beef but also dioxin-laced chickens, eggs and pork _ say
they have no intention of backing down.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the French handed the European Union a 600-page
report that they said contained new evidence to justify their fear
of mad cow disease, which can cause a fatal disease in humans, in
British beef.
</P>
<P>
   A swift review was expected. But when the commission scientists
met on Oct. 14, they announced they could not reach a verdict on
the report. The same group met again Monday and it is to forward
its findings to a more senior group of scientists at the commission
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's fury is not just over the possible loss of the French
market, which accounted for 40 percent of its European beef sales
before the discovery of mad cow disease. France is also a gateway
to many other markets in the Mediterranean and its stand on the
beef will make the meat that much harder to market elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Until their current difficulties, relations between the British
and the French have been on the upswing in recent years, as the two
countries were relatively united in their stands on Kosovo, Bosnia
and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   It is France that may actually have the most to lose if the
dispute grows into a full-blown agricultural war. Britain bought
about $4 billion worth of food from France last year, while selling
only about half that much back to France.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the potential damage, government officials have been
keeping their comments tame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to bring up anti-French sentiment in England,''
said Jean Glavany, France's farm minister. ``And I can also bring
out anti-English feeling in France.''
</P>
<P>
   If the European Commission rules against the French, it will
either have to accept the beef or face action in the European Court
of Justice.

 &HT;    No big, fat lie: Americans losing battle with obesity
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (l) Lifestyle categories.)
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's official: We're fat _ all over America, and
particularly in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of all adults in the United States _ 54.9 percent
_ are now overweight or obese, according to research being
published today by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   And of all the states surveyed each year by the Atlanta-based
agency, Georgia has had the most dramatic increase in the percent
of adults who are obese, CDC said. From 1991 to 1998, the
proportion of Georgians who are at least 30 pounds over their ideal
body weight doubled.
</P>
<P>
   That means, according to state public health experts, that
almost 900,000 Georgians are so overweight that they have gravely
increased their risks of heart disease, gallbladder disease, type 2
diabetes, osteoarthritis and high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, overweight and obesity have increased so
dramatically, and will prove so costly to the health care system as
the population ages, that they should be combatted as intensely as
smoking has been, the CDC's director said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obesity is a serious health condition, and it is occurring at
an epidemic level,'' Dr. Jeffrey Koplan said. ``Overweight and
physical inactivity account for more than 300,000 premature deaths
each year, second only to tobacco-related deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Excess weight is increasing as rapidly in the population as an
infectious disease might spread, and should be treated as seriously
as an epidemic, Koplan said. He presented new research by CDC
scientists at a Los Angeles conference hosted by the American
Medical Association. The Journal of the American Medical
Association publishes a special issue today devoted to obesity and
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute in Georgia. Although rates of
obesity increased in 33 states between 1991 and 1998, they rose the
most in Georgia, according to CDC's research. In 1991, 9.2 percent
of the state's adults were obese; in 1998, 18.2 percent were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware that obesity and overweight have been increasing
in Georgia over the past 10 to 15 years,'' said Dr. Kenneth Powell,
an epidemiologist with the state Division of Public Health. ``We're
also aware that the proportion of Georgians who get no regular
physical activity has been increasing every year, probably 2
percent every year for the past 15 years. The combination of eating
too much and not getting enough physical activity sends our
overweight and obesity levels up.''
</P>
<P>
   A statewide information campaign titled ``Take Charge of Your
Health'' has been in preparation for two years and is scheduled to
debut in November with billboards, public service announcements and
community forums, according to Alice Trainer in the state's Office
of Nutrition and Physical Activity.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will urge residents to ``Take five a day, take down
fat, take action'' _ that is, increase fruits and vegetable
servings to five a day, reduce fat in the diet and get regular
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers evaluate overweight and obesity using a measure
called body mass index (BMI), which divides weight in kilograms by
the square of height in meters. BMIs of 30 and above are considered
obese. BMIs of 25 to 29.9 are considered to be overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the National Institutes of Health set the standard
for overweight lower _ in effect, reclassifying as overweight an
additional 29 million Americans. Under the old guidelines, men with
a BMI of 28 and women with a BMI of 27 were considered overweight.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions by researchers from CDC and from Tufts
University near Boston were based on two national telephone surveys
conducted by the CDC: the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System, which surveys up to 100,000 American adults each year, and
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which talked
to more than 33,000 Americans between 1988 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found:
</P>
<P>
   _ Almost 55 percent of U.S. adults are overweight or obese,
compared to 43 percent in 1962. (Both percentages reflect the new
weight guidelines; researchers recalculated weight data gathered
over the past 30 years to make sure they were delivering an
apples-to-apples comparison. )
</P>
<P>
   _ Almost one-fifth of all adults are now obese, defined as being
more than 30 percent above ideal weight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rates of obesity are rising fastest among young adults,
college graduates and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the trend of putting on weight cannot be reversed, the
side-effects of overweight will become the greatest single cost on
the U.S. health care system.
</P>
<P>
   To reverse the trend, CDC's Koplan called for an information and
prevention campaign with as much funding and energy as the nation
has directed against tobacco in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both smoking and excess weight are risk factors for serious
diseases, and both have behavioral components,'' he said. ``For
both, we have to be very careful not to blame the victims of these
conditions. (But) it wasn't that long ago that smoking was
considered a social issue, not a health issue. Similarly, we need
to move our society's concept of obesity from a cosmetic issue to a
health issue.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some good news on the weight front, according to JAMA.
Researchers reported that leptin, a hormone whose influence on
weight loss made front-page news when it was discovered in mice in
1995, shows signs of working equally well in humans.
</P>
<P>
   According to researchers from St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in
New York, both lean and obese subjects who were injected with
leptin lost significant amounts of weight during the trial of the
hormone, compared to other participants injected with an inert
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the longer the study went on, the more weight the 100
participants lost. The weight lost was almost entirely fat, as
opposed to muscle tissue. There appeared to be no adverse effects
on major organs in the body over the 24 weeks of the study, which
was partially supported by Amgen, Inc., a pharmaceutical company
that synthesizes leptin.

SAN FRANCISCO _  &UR; LEARN-Cream &LR;  _ Italian  &LR; panna cotta &LR;  (cooked
cream) is just the type of recipe we home cooks look for _ it's
versatile, simple and, of course, very good. Top it with sliced
fruit, berries or with some caramel or chocolate sauce. It's also
perfect as is, accompanied by a crisp wafer cookie.

SAN FRANCISCO _  &UR; POTPOURRI &LR;  _ Change sometimes occurs in the
California wine industry in subtle ways. One of the most
talked-about shifts is from the emphasis on wine defined by a
specific grape to wine that reflects a certain piece of land.
</P>
<P>
   One of the proponents of this single-vineyard concept is Andy
Beckstoffer, a Napa Valley grape grower who has, since 1973,
acquired choice vineyards in the Napa Valley, Napa-Carneros;
Mendocino and Lake counties.

SAN FRANCISCO _  &UR; COOK'S BOOKS &LR;  _ Long gone, thankfully, are the
days when ``salad'' meant a watery conglomeration of iceberg
lettuce, carrot scrapings and mealy tomato wedges all bathed in an
uncomfortably pink Thousand Island dressing. In ``A Good Day for
Salad,'' Bay Area food writers Louise Fiszer and Jeannette Ferrary
further erase those memories by offering more than 100 recipes that
elevate salads to the level of sublime.

 Chefs in the Pumpkin Patch: Bay Area professionals work magic on  a
humble gourd   By Tilde Herrera 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; As the days get shorter and colder, the most
famous member of the squash family seems to pop out of nowhere.
Suddenly it's pumpkin a go-go and not just in pies.
<P>
   Pumpkins have grown up, peeking from omelets and souffles and
serving as stylish vessels to hold soups and risottos.
Increasingly, Bay Area chefs are using unique combinations and
preparations to showcase this traditional pie ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Donia Bijan of L'Amie Donia in Palo Alto curries risotto and
serves it in a hollowed-out sugar pumpkin. At Bistro Viola in
Berkeley, Mark Zeitouni cleverly pairs pumpkin with sage, goat
cheese and toasted pecans in a stunning omelet. He also features a
combination of pomegranate, pumpkin and duck, focusing on bold
flavors that stand up to pumpkin's straightforward nature.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Cox of Montage in Sony's Metreon firmly believes in
using pumpkin in savory dishes. ``Roasting or grilling pumpkin
brings out the natural sugars in a more interesting way, instead of
masking the natural flavor with all of the standard pie spices,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkins are the perfect fall precursor and allow chefs to coax
diners away from a summer frame of mind by putting pumpkins on the
menu _ even though recent weeks have been the warmest of the year.
``Pumpkins remind me of fall just as tomatoes remind me of
summer,'' muses Donia Bijan.
</P>
<P>
   Rabah Abusbaitan, executive chef of One Market Restaurant, likes
pumpkin because of its seasonality. ``If you use a product when it
is in season, the flavor is at its best because we're eating it
when it's &LR;  supposed &LR;  to be eaten. And cost-wise, there is so much
of it when it is in season that the price goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Abusbaitan recalls his mother pureeing one large pumpkin with
rice to feed his family of 11 when he was a child in Jordan. But
for today's chefs, it's pumpkin's taste and texture that are most
attractive. Underneath the sweet spices it's generally cloaked in _
cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, allspice _ lies a distinctive flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Some chefs admit to using pumpkin to appease customers. Heather
Ho of Boulevard put pumpkin desserts on her fall menu in response
to demand. ``People expect a pumpkin dessert at this time of
year,'' she says, ``Not necessarily in a pie but in a pudding or
creme brulee.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox agrees. ``People are ready to see pumpkins on menus after
the summer tomato season when their bodies yearn for heartier foods
like squash, potatoes and quince.''
</P>
<P>
   Diners tend to veer toward familiar and comforting ingredients
like pumpkin. Alex Ong of Xanadu in Berkeley is banking on his
customers' familiarity with pumpkins to lead them to try unexpected
dishes. ``Americans don't usually like jook. They hate jook. I've
got to do something so I add Cal Riso, a risotto-style rice, and
serve it in a pumpkin with the traditional jook ingredients like
dates and lily blossoms.'' And it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Abusbaitan cannot believe how well it sells. ``At lunch, we sell
at least 35 orders of pumpkin ravioli every time I feature it as a
lunch special,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs also are attracted to another part of the pumpkin _ the
seeds. Richard Sandoval of Maya in San Francisco, who grew up
eating baked pumpkin wedges with cinnamon and sugar in his native
Mexico, purees the seeds with tomatillo, cilantro and jalapeno for
a classic Latin pipian sauce and ladles it over pork. Heidi
Insalata Krahling of Insalata's in San Anselmo claims her halibut
with Turkish tarator sauce, a blend of pumpkin seeds, pine nuts,
tahini, garlic and cayenne pepper, is one of her most popular
entrees.
</P>
<P>
   And XYZ's Alison Richman's pumpkin pancakes get their
distinctiveness from a smattering of toasted pumpkin seeds.
Richman's pancakes are a simple, seasonal recipe that make a lovely
brunch option.

INSALATA'S HALIBUT WITH TURKISH PUMPKIN SEED TARATOR
</P>
<P>
   Tarator is a delicious Middle Eastern sauce for fish such as
halibut or sea bass, or for crudites or warm pita bread. This
recipe calls for toasted pumpkin seeds and pine nuts but is equally
delicious with walnuts, almonds or hazelnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup raw pumpkin seeds, toasted
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup pine nuts, toasted
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch cilantro (leaves and tender stems only), coarsely
chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cayenne
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons tahini (sesame seed paste)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup + 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   6 halibut or sea bass fillets, 5 to 6 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the sauce:  &LR; Place the seeds, nuts, cilantro, garlic,
paprika, salt and cayenne in a food processor and pulse until
finely chopped. Add the tahini and lemon juice. Pulse again until
combined. While the food processor is running, slowly add the
water, pureeing until the sauce is the consistency of thick
mayonnaise. Season with pepper and more salt, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the fish:  &LR; Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Season the
fillets with salt and pepper and place on a nonstick or
parchment-lined baking sheet, being careful not to let the fillets
touch each other. Spread about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the tarator
over each fillet.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for about 8 minutes, estimating about 8 to 10 minutes for
each 1-inch of thickness of the fillets. The fish is done when the
flesh is opaque and flakes easily.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Nice served with bulgur pilaf or rice and sauteed greens.

 &LR; L'AMIE DONIA'S CURRIED RISOTTO IN A PUMPKIN SHELL
</P>
<P>
   Although this dish is a little time-consuming to make, the
pumpkins and the risotto may be prepared 1 day in advance, then
assembled and baked just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Pumpkins
</P>
<P>
   4 small pumpkins (such as Sugar Pie pumpkins), approximately
31/2-4 pounds each
</P>
<P>
   8 garlic cloves, cut in half
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   The Risotto
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup finely diced yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely diced carrot
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely diced celery
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   3/4 to 1 tablespoon (to taste) Madras curry powder
</P>
<P>
   3/4 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 cups Arborio rice
</P>
<P>
   11/2 quarts chicken or vegetable broth, brought to a simmer
</P>
<P>
   1 cup slivered almonds, toasted
</P>
<P>
   1 cup currants, soaked in warm water (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The pumpkins:  &LR; Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Wash and dry
the pumpkins, then cut off the tops and reserve. Scoop out the
seeds and rub the inside of the pumpkins with cut garlic cloves and
half of the softened butter. Season the inside of each pumpkin with
salt and pepper, then replace the tops.
</P>
<P>
   Rub the remaining 2 tablespoons butter over each pumpkin and
sprinkle with salt. Place the pumpkins on a jelly-roll pan or in a
roasting pan. Sprinkle about 4 tablespoons water in the pan and
loosely cover the pumpkins with foil.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for about 40 minutes, until a toothpick can pierce the
flesh. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The pumpkins may be prepared 1 day ahead. Wrap and store in &LR; 
 &LR; the refrigerator. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The risotto:  &LR; Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large
saucepan. Add the onion, carrot and celery and saute over medium
heat until the vegetables begin to soften. Add the garlic and saute
until the vegetables are completely softened.
</P>
<P>
   Add the curry, salt and rice. Cook, stirring with a wooden
spoon, until the rice is coated with butter and lightly toasted.
Add enough of the simmering broth to barely cover the rice. Cook
over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the rice absorbs
the broth. Continue to cook and stir, gradually adding more broth,
a little at a time, until the rice is almost tender. After about 15
minutes of cooking, test a grain of rice for doneness. When it is
just tender but still firm, add the almonds and optional currants,
which have been drained. Stir and adjust seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the risotto to a bowl or flat baking sheet to cool.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The risotto may be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and &LR; 
 &LR; refrigerate. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To assemble and bake: &LR;  If the pumpkins and risotto have been
prepared the day before, take them out of the refrigerator 2 to 3
hours before continuing with the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Drop 1/2 tablespoon butter into the cavity of each baked
pumpkin. Spoon the risotto into the pumpkins to within 1/4 inch of
the rim. Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons water or broth over each
(depending on doneness of the risotto), and top with another 1/2
tablespoon butter. Sprinkle with Parmesan, and replace the reserved
tops.
</P>
<P>
   Place the filled pumpkins on a baking sheet or in a roasting
pan, allowing at least 1 inch of space between them.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for approximately 35 to 45 minutes, or until the pumpkins
are golden brown, easily pierced with a toothpick and the risotto
is heated through and fully cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully remove the pumpkins with a spatula and serve
immediately.

PUMPKIN WEDGES
</P>
<P>

<P>
   1/4 pound butter, at room temperature

<P>
   Cut the pumpkin in half and scoop out the seeds. Cut one of the
halves into wedges. Rub a little of the butter on the pumpkin
wedges and place on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with cinnamon and
brown sugar, then bake until soft and golden brown, about 20-25
minutes. Remove and set aside. Rewarm when assembling the omelet.
</P>
<P>
   Rub the remaining pumpkin half with oil and season with salt and
pepper. Place cut-side down on a baking sheet and bake until soft,
about 25-30 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool. Scoop out the
flesh and puree in a food processor or by hand with a potato
masher.
</P>

   Melt a quarter of the remaining the butter in a 10-inch nonstick
pan over medium heat. Add one quarter of the eggs. Stir with a
rubber spatula, season with salt and pepper, and cook until the
eggs start to solidify. Remove from heat. Top with 2 tablespoons of
the pumpkin puree and one quarter of the cheese, pecans and sage.
Place in the oven or broiler until the cheese is warm and the eggs
finish setting, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Tip the omelet onto a
warmed plate, folding sides over middle. Cover loosely and keep
warm while preparing the remaining 3 omelets.

 &LR; BOULEVARD'S PUMPKIN BRIOCHE PUDDING WITH CARAMELIZED APPLES &AMP;
CINNAMON BRICKLE
</P>
<P>
   This is rich and delicious and totally wonderful, but it is
fussy to make and assemble. So, for the home cook, we have offered
an optional garnish and presentation, and do-ahead notes.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Pudding
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 vanilla bean, split and scraped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup egg yolks (about 3 extra-large)
</P>
<P>
   1 whole egg
</P>
<P>
   1 cup pumpkin puree (plain, unseasoned)
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup pure maple syrup
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced candied ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/2 tablespoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces day-old brioche or challah, crusts removed, cut into
1/8- to 1/4-inch cubes (about 8 slices yielding 6 ounces of
finished croutons)(see note)
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon Brickle
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup light corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon (or to taste) cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   Caramelized Apples
</P>
<P>
   8 medium Gravenstein apples (about 3 pounds) peeled, cored and
very thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/8 stick)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Garnish
</P>
<P>
   Whipped cream, sweetened to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the pudding: &LR;  Spray a 10 x 15-inch rimmed baking sheet with
nonstick spray. Line the sheet with parchment paper and spray
again.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the cream, milk and vanilla bean (including its scraped
insides) in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from heat;
set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the egg yolks, whole egg, pumpkin puree, maple syrup,
candied ginger, dried spices and salt in a mixing bowl; whisk until
well blended. Whisking constantly, slowly pour the hot cream
mixture into the egg mixture. Continue whisking until fully
combined. Fold in the brioche cubes. Cover and let sit for about 30
minutes, stirring occasionally until the brioche absorbs the
custard. Remove the vanilla bean.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the pudding mixture into the prepared baking sheet and
spread evenly. Place a flat roasting pan or an extra-large rimmed
baking sheet in the oven. Set the pudding-filled pan in the larger
pan and fill the larger pan with very hot water almost to the rim
of the pudding pan, creating a water bath.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for about 25-30 minutes, or until just firm to the touch.
The pudding will just begin to pull away from the sides of the
baking sheet. Remove the pudding from the water bath and let cool
to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The pudding may be made up to 2 days in advance. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Cinnamon Brickle: &LR;  (May omit this step and substitute
toasted pecan pieces.) Spray a large, rimmed baking sheet with
nonstick spray.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the corn syrup and butter in a small, heavy saucepan.
Add the sugar and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally,
until the mixture liquefies. Increase heat to high and bring to a
boil without further stirring. Continue boiling until the sugar
mixture takes on a medium-amber color. Remove from heat and
immediately stir in the vanilla, salt and cinnamon. Then stir in
the baking soda.
</P>
<P>
   Working quickly, pour the brickle onto the prepared baking sheet
and spread it out as thinly as possible (use a spatula that has
been sprayed with nonstick spray). Set aside to cool and harden.
</P>
<P>
   Using the bottom of a pot or other heavy implement, crush the
brickle into small, irregular pieces.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Brickle may be made up to 1 week in advance. Store in tightly &LR; 
 &LR; covered container. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Sauteed Apples: &LR;  (TIP: Keep the sliced apples in water that
has lemon juice in it to prevent them from turing brown. Drain well
before using.)
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle the sugar into a large, heavy saute pan and cook over
medium heat until it liquefies. Once liquid, increase heat to high
and cook, swirling the pan until the sugar caramelizes to a dark
amber. Remove pan from heat and carefully add the butter and cream,
swirling to combine. Gentle stirring may be needed to fully
incorporate the butter and cream into the sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Add the drained apples to the pan, stir well and continue to
cook until the apple juices are released. Then continue stirring
often until the liquid from the apples has evaporated, about 15
minutes. Once the liquid has evaporated, continue cooking over high
heat until the apples become browned and caramelized, about 10
minutes. Remove from heat and set aside until the apples are cool
enough to handle.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The apples may be completed the day before serving and &LR; 
 &LR; refrigerated. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To assemble and serve: &LR;  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Unmold the cold pudding onto a flat surface. Peel off the
parchment paper and cut the pudding into 24 equal rectangles.
Arrange 8 pudding rectangles in a large, buttered, ovenproof dish;
do not let them touch each other. Top each rectangle with some of
the apples and repeat alternately layering pudding and apples until
all are used. End with a pudding rectangle on top.
</P>
<P>
   Place the puddings in the oven and bake until warmed through.
Remove puddings to serving plates, top with whipped cream and
sprinkle generously with the brickle. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alternate assembly: &LR;  Divide the 10 x 15-inch pudding into 3
equal rectangles. Butter an ovenproof baking dish and layer in the
rectangles alternately with the apples, ending with pudding on top.
Bake until warmed through. Divide into equal portions and transfer
to serving plates. Top with whipped cream, and garnish with brickle
or toasted pecans.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; Fresh brioche cubes may be air-dried for about 6 hours,
or lightly dried in the oven for 15 minutes at 250 degrees.

A BRAVE NEW BREED
</P>
<P>
   The quality of pumpkins has improved over the years, mostly due
to improved growing methods and selective breeding on the part of
seed companies _ many of which are responding to consumer demand
for a sweeter pumpkin with a higher yield and less stringy flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Next spring will see the availability of seeds for a new pumpkin
hybrid, says Jim Waltherp, director of sales for Seminas Garden, a
wholesale division of Seminas Seed Company. Called the
``Snackjack,'' it will weigh about two pounds with paper-thin
walls, edible seeds and a sweet flesh perfect for pies.
</P>
<P>
   It will also yield ``a whole lot of pumpkin,'' Waltherp says,
and may be in stores next fall.

   &QL; 
VARIETIES OF PUMPKINS &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pumpkins are just a small variety within the huge gourd family.
Most of us grew up with the familiar Jack-o'-Lantern pumpkins that
we carved as kids. Their walls are thin and the flesh is watery and
fibrous, making them ideal for carving, but less than desirable in
the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Here are four varieties that are readily available and are bred
specifically for eating. They may be used interchangeably with
other squash, like butternut and acorn, with success in most
recipes.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Sugar Pie or Sugar Loaf.  &LR; These popular pumpkins look like
Jack-o'-Lanterns but are smaller, usually 4-7 pounds, with thicker
walls and a sweeter, smoother flesh. They are commonly used pureed
for baking, soups, gratins, etc.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _  &UR; Baby Bear.  &LR; These pumpkins are small, weighing just a few
pounds. Becoming popular in recent years, Baby Bears have very
sweet flesh but low yield. They commonly are used as vessels for
soup.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _  &UR; French Red (Rouge vif d'Etampes). &LR;  This flat-shaped variety is
medium to large (10-40 pounds), and has a striking
deep-orange-reddish skin. The flesh is smooth and has a great
flavor, though not especially sweet. This variety sometimes is
called the ``Cinderella'' pumpkin because it was the inspiration
for the fairy-tale heroine's carriage.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _  &UR; Australian Blue &LR; . These light blue-gray pumpkins are
flat-shaped, medium to large in size (15-20 pounds), and have thick
walls and flavorful flesh.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; How to Choose and Use a Pumpkin &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Select a pumpkin with smooth unblemished flesh without any soft
spots. Regardless of shape, the pumpkin should be heavy for its
size. The stem should be a few inches long. Pumpkins can decay
quickly if the stem is cut too short.
</P>
<P>
   In recipes that call for pumpkin puree, count on one pound of
untrimmed raw pumpkin to yield about 11/2 to 2 cups of puree.
</P>
<P>
   To make pumpkin puree, remove the stem or cap from the pumpkin
with a sharp knife. Cut the pumpkin in half and remove the seeds
and pulp. Rinse. Either bake or boil.
</P>
<P>
   To bake: Oil and season the pumpkin halves and place cut-side
down on a large baking sheet. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 25-30
minutes, or until soft.
</P>
<P>
   To boil: Cut the pumpkin into large chunks. Rinse. Place in a
pot and cover with boiling water. Boil for 15-20 minutes, or until
tender. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   When the pumpkin is cool, remove the peel using a small, sharp
knife. Puree the flesh in a food processor or food mill, or mash
with a potato masher or fork.
</P>
<P>
   If you have leftover puree, pack it into freezer bags or
containers in convenient one-cup portions. It freezes well for up
to six months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Don't Toss the Seeds! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Wash seeds thoroughly in warm water (if seeds are very tough,
soak in warm salted water before roasting), spread out on a baking
sheet and coat with a little oil, then season with salt. Roast in a
350 degree oven for 45 minutes, or until crisp, tossing from time
to time.
</P>
<P>
   Or take a tip from chef Mark Zeitouni, who tosses them with
minced garlic and chili powder, roasts them and serves them as a
snack. They also may be used as toppings for salads, soups and
desserts.

 COOK'S BOOKS: Refreshing Salads Brighten Any Meal   By Sean Forsha  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Long gone, thankfully, are the days when ``salad''
meant a watery conglomeration of iceberg lettuce, carrot scrapings
and mealy tomato wedges all bathed in an uncomfortably pink
Thousand Island dressing.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In their new book, ``A Good Day for Salad,'' Bay Area food
writers Louise Fiszer and Jeannette Ferrary further erase those
memories by offering more than 100 recipes that elevate salads to
the level of sublime.
</P>
<P>
   As in their last dual effort, ``A Good Day for Soup,'' Fiszer
and Ferrary have created a book that is as good a read as it is a
kitchen guide. The recipes in ``A Good Day for Salad'' let the
ingredients play off each other to ``capture the sparkle and
excitement of contemporary salads in a practical, helpful format
tailored to today's lifestyles,'' as the authors so eloquently put
it.
</P>
<P>
   In recipes like Spring Greens and Strawberry Salad; and Melon,
Jicama and Shrimp Salad, simplicity is the key without sacrificing
flavor. The latter recipe gets a nice kick from a lime-jalapeno
chile vinaigrette and fresh mint.
</P>
<P>
   While the book contains many calorie-conscious recipes, those
looking to indulge with something richer will not be let down. A
hearty Lamb, White Bean and Arugula Salad with Cherry Tomato and
Rosemary Dressing makes a satisfying entree, and a smoky chipotle
vinaigrette made the Southwest-inspired Red Snapper and Black Bean
Salad an instant Food Department favorite. The authors also show
their Bay Area colors by updating the traditional crab Louis with
Snapper Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Chapters include recipes for meal-in-hand Wrapped Salads and
hors d'oeuvres Bite-Sized Salads.
</P>
<P>
   However, the book sorely needs photographs to illustrate the
recipes. Novice cooks, especially, would benefit from pictures
showing the lesser-known greens and how to present the finished
salads.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that caveat, Fiszer and Ferrary have succeeded again in
providing a solid collection of recipes.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Kraft Knocks Out Cheezy Competition   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Macaroni and cheese is the ultimate comfort food,
and with the help of food manufacturers, it's also become quick and
easy.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted 11 different macaroni and cheese made from
a mix. This included mixes made with powder and those made with
cheese sauce in cans or pouches. We did not include any mixes
labeled white cheddar. All of the mixes were made according to
package directions.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the panel preferred the mixes made with
cheese sauce as opposed to powder. These mixes are also easier to
use because consumers do not need to add milk or butter.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionally, the powdered mixes are higher in calories, but
the mixes made with cheese sauce are far higher in fat.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming favorite was  &UR; Kraft Deluxe &LR;  (14 ounces,
$2.59-$2.89 at many supermarkets). Panelists liked the creamy
texture, and three noted that it evoked memories of childhood.
However, one panelist thought it had a harsh finish, and another
found it too salty. Four would buy it; one might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Velveeta Shells &AMP; Cheese &LR;  (12 ounces,
$2.59 at Safeway). Three panelists commented on how well the shells
held the cheese sauce. Two liked the sharp cheesy flavor, but
another thought it tasted overly processed. Another described it as
``too goopy.'' Three would buy it, one might buy it, and one would
not.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings dropped significantly after second place, but the best
of the rest was  &UR; Kraft &LR;  (7.25 ounces, $.99-$1.29 at many
supermarkets), the only mix made with powder that made the
rankings. One panelist liked the cheese flavor and the color of the
sauce, but another thought the cheese flavor was too light and two
described the sauce as too sweet. Two would buy it, one might buy
it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Safeway Shells &AMP; Cheese &LR;  (12 ounces, $2.05 at Safeway) came in
fourth, scoring just five points below Kraft. All of the panelists
commented on the color, describing it as ``nuclear orange'' and
``weird.'' One thought the dish tasted like it looked. Three others
liked the cheesy flavor, but one of them did not like the
plasticlike texture. One would buy it, two might buy it, and two
would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Lucky, Golden Grain, Field Harvest,
Springfield, Safeway, Deboles Homestyle and Deboles Organic, but
they ranked too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Shelley Handler,
consultant and food writer; Lesli Neilson, Chronicle staff writer;
Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner,
Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are tasted blind. &QL;

larders.  AT THE SOURCE: His Fuzziness Reigns: Pescadero farmer grows 
 kiwis bursting with flavor.  
   
 By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 PESCADERO, Calif. _  ``I'm sure sales will continue to skyrocket as
the public discovers them,'' predicted Joe Carcione, writing about
kiwifruit in 1972.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The late produce expert had a good crystal ball. In those days,
the funny-looking fruit with the fuzz was still a novelty in the
United States. Looking like a new potato with three days' worth of
beard growth, as Carcione described it, the fruit didn't seduce
customers easily.
</P>
<P>
   But drawn by its dramatic green flesh flecked with black seeds,
nouvelle cuisine chefs adopted it in the mid-1970s. Admired for its
inner beauty, the fruit eventually won fans for its taste _ a
tangy, tropical flavor with hints of strawberry, banana and melon.
Today, California farmers grow more than 30 tons of kiwis a year.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hudson's brother John was one of the pioneers, planting kiwi
vines in Pescadero in 1973. Those vines still produce, says Tim,
who now runs the farm. But he acknowledges that his kiwis would
probably be happier in the warm San Joaquin Valley than they are on
his windy, cool Coastways Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   A deciduous vine that can produce 100 pounds of fruit a year,
the kiwi is trained on a high, sturdy trellis that a harvester can
walk underneath. The egg-shaped fruits hang down, waiting to be
plucked off their stems in the fall by the ranch's U-Pick
customers.
</P>
<P>
   To produce any fruit, a grower needs one male plant for every
eight female plants. The vines typically flower in May and develop
their crop slowly over the summer; by late October or early
November, the fruit is ready to harvest. You can tell, says Hudson,
because the pale seeds turn black.
</P>
<P>
   Kiwis are perhaps eight percent sugar at that point, still
unpleasantly sour and not fully ripe. ``I've never heard of anyone
munching one right off the tree,'' Hudson says. ``You don't want to
bite into one that's ripening.''
</P>
<P>
   Left on the vines until frost, perhaps into December, the fruit
will continue to develop sugar but won't truly be palatable until
it has undergone a chilling and ripening period off the tree.
Hudson tells his U-Pick customers to chill the fruit for 10 days in
the refrigerator vegetable bin, then bring them to room
temperature. They will soften over the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson's kiwis will last for six months in a refrigerator, three
months in a cool area. Supermarket fruit may have a shorter shelf
life because it has likely been treated with ethylene gas to speed
ripening. But the kiwi's ability to survive cold storage means
markets can offer it virtually year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, growers are touting a Rutgers University study
that found kiwi fruit to be the most nutrient-dense of 27 common
fruits. Ounce for ounce, it has almost twice the vitamin C of an
orange and is considered a good source of potassium, vitamin E and
dietary fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it tastes good, sometimes too good. Consumers who have
made the mistake of eating too many kiwis at one sitting may
experience the effects of actinidin, an enzyme that can irritate
the inside of the mouth. Hudson says he discovered this first-hand
when he would slice and dry his fruit and take it on long car trips
for a snack.
</P>
<P>
   The actinidin also explains kiwi's reputation as a meat
tenderizer. Some recipes call for rubbing a halved kiwi over the
surface of meat 30 minutes before cooking; others call for pureeing
the fruit and using it in a marinade.
</P>
<P>
   At the market, look for kiwis that give slightly to pressure. If
they are firm, they will soften at home at room temperature; to
speed the process, put them in a bag with an apple, which gives off
ethylene gas.
</P>
<P>
   No longer an exotic or specialty item, as they were in
Carcione's day, kiwis have earned a place on the California table.
Look for the new crop to arrive at farmers' markets and produce
markets over the next several weeks.

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, wine editor Gerald Boyd discusses a
variety of wine topics.  WINE POTPOURRI: A Little Piece of Land in a Bottle  
   
 By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Change sometimes occurs in the California wine
industry in subtle ways. One of the most talked-about shifts is
from the emphasis on a specific grape to define a wine to a wine
that reflects a certain piece of land.
<TEXT>
<P>
   These single-vineyard wines, as they are called, usually are
seen in super-premium and ultra-premium wines, especially red, in
the $50-and-up price range. Blending from a number of vineyards,
usually with a broader appellation, is still used for wines in the
lower priced range.
</P>
<P>
   One of the proponents of this single-vineyard concept is Andy
Beckstoffer, a Napa Valley grape grower who has, since 1973,
acquired choice vineyards in the Napa Valley, Napa-Carneros;
Mendocino and Lake counties.
</P>
<P>
   Among Beckstoffer's holdings is the 221-acre Georges III
Vineyard, formerly Beaulieu Vineyard No. 3, the source of some of
Beaulieu's best Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon. He sells his grapes
only to wineries that agree to bottle the wine as a single
vineyard, or what Beckstoffer calls a ``single-site expression,''
such as Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Beckstoffer Vineyard Chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Beckstoffer traces the origins of single-site expression to
years ago when the emphasis was on estate bottlings that often were
blends. Then, in 1983, the Napa Valley got its own AVA (American
Appellation Area), and other sub-appellations, like Rutherford,
soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These moves were involved more with politics than grape
growing then, but now the emphasis is more on the land defining the
appellation.'' Beckstoffer says that a piece of land is not
political and if the consumer can understand the concept of
terroir, he can understand the idea of single-site expressions and
how they relate to appellations. Terroir is a French term that
means the total grape-growing environment; soil, climate and more.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Beckstoffer invited a few people to an educational
tasting at Fort Mason to illustrate his point that the defining
element of certain high-end wines is land, not grape. The tasting
began with seven vintages of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Beckstoffer
Vineyard Chardonnay. The 1996, 1993 and 1992 were my favorites.
They were an elegant group of Chardonnays with nicely focused fruit
flavors and a flinty-mineral quality that emerged more in the older
vintages.
</P>
<P>
   Next came four vintages of Acacia Beckstoffer Vineyard Pinot
Noir, with the characteristic Carneros black cherry and spice
flavors. The 1997 and 1995 vintages stood out for me.
</P>
<P>
   Capping the extensive tasting were nine vintages of Guenoc
Beckstoffer Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon, two vintages of Merryvale
Beckstoffer Cabernet Sauvignon and one Clos du Val Georges III
Cabernet Sauvignon.
</P>
<P>
   Guenoc's 1996, 1995, 1995 and 1989 Cabernets showed
concentrated, luscious fruit, fine tannins and great length. Clos
du Val 1997 Georges III Cabernet Sauvignon was elegant, minty with
yummy chocolate-cherry flavors, while the Merryvale 1997
Beckstoffer Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon was more concentrated with
bigger tannins.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of site and soil is sometimes difficult to
separate from winemaking and vintage variations. For me, the
influence of land was more evident in the red wines than the
whites. But the key for the wine consumer is to look for a flavor
thread that evokes a style you like.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stags Leap Collection &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of the sub-appellations of the Napa Valley that produces
distinctive concentrated berry-rich Cabernet Sauvignons is the
Stags Leap District, a 3-mile-long area bordering the Silverado
Trail. The 12 vintner members of the Stags Leap District
Winegrowers (SLDW) are offering consumers an opportunity to sample
the Cabernets of the district in the 1999 Appellation Collection
Case.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the case are Cabernets and Cabernet-based blends
from members such as Pine Ridge, Robert Mondavi, Chimney Rock,
Silverado Vineyards and Shafer Vineyards. Only 300 cases are
available and the cost is $475 (plus tax and shipping) per case.
For more information, call Nancy Bialek, executive director of the
SLDW, at (707) 255-1720.cq &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Q &AMP; A &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Kathleen O'Keefe asked by e-mail if there are other options
for ``de-alcoholized'' wines other than Ariel and Sutter Home Fre.
</P>
<P>
   A: The nonalcohol wine field is limited, but another choice you
might look for is Inglenook St. Regis. Other alcohol-free options
are grape juices from wineries like Navarro (verjus) and sparkling
apple cider from Martinelli.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Suzanne Ellen Thompson of San Francisco has come into
possession of a 1970 W &AMP; J Graham port and wants to know its value
and whether or not it will age.
</P>
<P>
   A: The 1970 vintage for port was considered one of the best in
years with rich, ripe fruit and great concentration. Your wine is
drinking at its best now. The last price I saw on the 1970 Graham
was $75.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; French Paradox Revisited &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, French scientists told the world that, based on
their studies, moderate wine consumption reduces the risk of
coronary heart disease. The report became known as the French
Paradox because the French consume more fat, yet have less heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Now, new studies from the University of Bordeaux, as reported in
the Archives of Internal Medicine, reinforce the earlier studies
about the benefits of moderate wine consumption, adding that the
new study also shows a significant risk reduction for overall
mortality.

EDITORS NOTE: The Chronicle regularly features ``Best Way'', a
column in which the Food staff tries to establish the most reliable
way to cook many of our favorite foods.  BEST WAY: Morning Oatmeal  
   
 By Nicholas Bundy  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Oatmeal can be one of those breakfasts that can
make or break your day. You want oatmeal warm and creamy, but it
can easily end up dry and mealy. Many enhance oatmeal with favorite
additions like brown sugar, currants, butter, cream, fruit and
freshly ground nutmeg or cinnamon.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food Department tested several batches of instant oatmeal to
find out which method _ stovetop or microwave _ made for the best
texture and whether nonfat, low-fat or regular milk or water
provided the best flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT TO ADD
</P>
<P>
   We prepared regular instant Quaker Oats in four separate
batches, each with a pinch of salt, adding either a 1/2 cup of
nonfat, low-fat or regular milk or water to one package of instant
oatmeal. Each liquid was brought to a rolling boil in a small
nonstick pan. The oatmeal was then added and cooked until half the
liquid evaporated or until the oats were cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Tasters preferred the oatmeal made with low-fat milk, describing
the texture as a little loose, not too sticky and slightly sweet,
with a good oat flavor. The oatmeal with nonfat milk was dry and
gluey. The oatmeal made with water was slimy and lacked flavor.
Regular milk created a very wet, milky, smooth texture that made
the oatmeal taste more like milk.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the microwave method. Again, four batches were
prepared. This time we added 2/3 cup of milk or water. The results
were less than spectacular. Each batch was considerably less
appealing, both in taste and texture, than the comparative version
made on the stovetop. The microwaved versions with nonfat milk and
water had watery textures with little or no flavor. Some said the
version with regular milk had the same taste as the stovetop, but
in a much more liquefied state. The low-fat microwaved version was
considered almost as creamy as the stovetop, but with less flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; THE BEST WAY
</P>
<P>
   Regular instant Quaker Oats mixed with 1/2 cup of simmering
low-fat milk produced the creamiest texture and the best overall
taste.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; AN APPEALING ALTERNATIVE
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer to use water only, boiling it on the stovetop
produces a creamier oatmeal. But we also agreed that when it comes
to oatmeal much depends on personal preference.

 LEARNING TO COOK: Creamy Italian Dessert Is Simpler Than Pie   By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Italian  &LR; panna cotta &LR;  (cooked cream) is just the
type of recipe we home cooks look for _ it's versatile, simple and,
of course, very good. This delicate, silky cream is as easy to make
as a piece of toast.
<P>
   Give it a try, and serve it with sliced fruit, berries or with
some caramel or chocolate sauce. It's also perfect as is,
accompanied by a crisp wafer cookie.
</P>
<P>
   I have tested this recipe several times to get the texture,
flavor and sweetness level that I like, but you can change these
amounts to suit your palate. That's what is great about cooking at
home.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; PANNA COTTA
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup cold water
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar (4 tablespoons)
</P>
<P>
   21/2 teaspoons vanilla (add 2 teaspoons, then taste and add the
remaining 1/2 teaspoon if the vanilla flavor is faint)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Pour the cold water into a small cup and stir in the gelatin.
Let stand for 5 minutes. It will become firm.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the milk, cream, salt and sugar in a small pan. Turn the
heat to medium and stir occasionally. Let the mixture heat until a
small ring of bubbles appears around the inside edge of the pan.
You need to stand right there and watch carefully. This process
only takes a couple of minutes, and sometimes you will notice a
little steam rising from the milk mixture. Do not let it boil.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the pan from the heat. Add the gelatin and vanilla, stir
until the gelatin completely dissolves. Pour the custard into
serving cups (I use 1-cup Pyrex containers; each holds 2/3 cup
custard). Let the custard cool a little, then cover each cup with
plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed.
</P>
<P>
   The custards may be served directly from the cups. If you want
to unmold the Panna Cotta, spread a little oil on the bottom of
each cup before you pour in the custard. When ready to serve, run a
knife around the edges of each cup, put the serving plate on top
and, holding the two together tightly, invert and give both a quick
shake.

   Serves 5.

for an outstanding dish at a Bay Area restaurant, plus the chef's
secrets for making it a success. Tips and recipe follow in optional
trim.  SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Fall Weather Calls for Hearty Dishes  
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Just about every restaurant in the Bay Area makes
some kind of pasta, but the best effort always comes from Donna
Scala who, with her husband, Giovanni, owns Bistro Don Giovanni in
Napa.
<TEXT>
<P>
   My favorite dish is the Trenne with Braised Lamb Shoulder,
Artichokes and Roasted Tomatoes. The sauce is incredibly
flavor-packed, a feat achieved by reducing the stock even before
it's added to browned cubes of meat. Then the mixture is baked, the
remaining ingredients added and the sauce is reduced again until
it's as thick as gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Scala uses trenne, triangular-shaped pasta tubes. If you can't
find trenne, substitute another substantial pasta such as rigatoni
or penne.
</P>
<P>
   Scala believes in slow-cooking sauces, extracting and melding
the components _ just the opposite of the quick, toss-together
combinations favored by most restaurants. It's time consuming, but
these deeply satisfying flavors can't be produced any other way.
</P>
<P>
   These hearty dishes are served in a modern building with a
peaked roof, an open kitchen visible behind glass and a profusion
of fresh flowers. One of the most coveted seats, however, is on the
outdoor patio, which wraps around two sides of the building and
includes a fireplace on one end and views of the vineyards on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Bistro Don Giovanni, 4110 St. Helena Highway, Napa; (707) &LR;

<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the tomatoes:  &LR; Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Oil a
baking sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Place the tomatoes cut-sides down on the prepared baking sheet.
Brush with oil, season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with sugar.

   &UR; To make the lamb sauce:  &LR; Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Combine the stocks in a large saucepan. Cook over high heat until
reduced by three quarters, about 30 to 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Working
in batches, add the lamb and brown on all sides. Using a slotted
spoon, transfer the meat to a roasting pan. Add the fennel seeds to
the roasting pan. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the
reduced stock, the basil and bay leaves. Cover and bake until the
meat is tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.

BLUEGRASS, ONE BIG PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Bluegrass musicians have a few distinct
advantages over those in other genres. They have a strong, genuine
link to their past and respect for their elders. They still rely
heavily on the oral tradition, getting together frequently to
exchange licks and tunes. Their ranks are constantly swelling: for
most people it is not enough to be a fan of bluegrass, one must
also buy an instrument and learn to pick a little. And, as the
International Bluegrass Music Association convention and fan fest
held in Louisville last week proved, they know how to party.
</P>
<P>
   More than any hotel that has been home to any rock, hip-hop,
country or other music convention recently, the Galt House in
downtown Louisville seemed to be exploding from the inside.
Clusters of musicians fanned out every few feet in the lobby,
picking away around the clock. Stepping into the elevator, one
might encounter anywhere from one to four musicians jamming, and on
any floor there were usually a handful of picking parties in
process. In each hallway, a dozen doors were propped open to reveal
parties in full swing, many offering beer or varieties of moonshine
stored in mason jars with fruit and poured into blenders with
margarita ingredients, or even refrigerated as jello shots.
</P>
<P>
   The week was proof that bluegrass _ a string-band variant of
country first popularized by Bill Monroe nearly 60 years ago _ is
alive and thriving, thanks in part to the following of Bela Fleck
and Alison Krauss, jam bands like Leftover Salmon and the String
Cheese Incident, and the Dixie Chicks' bringing the banjo back to
country radio. Recently many prominent country musicians have
turned to or returned to bluegrass, including Dolly Parton, Ricky
Scaggs, Jim Lauderdale, Steve Earle and Tom T. Hall.
</P>
<P>
   For many at the convention, bluegrass is the only real folk
music left for them and the only place where country still lives,
unco-opted by the slick pop sentimentalism of commercial Nashville.
As bluegrass guitarist and singer Larry Cordle sings on his new CD,
``Someone killed country music, cut out its heart and soul/They got
away with murder down on Music Row.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, bluegrass, with its focus on technical proficiency
and the gathering of tunes and techniques, is an obsessive hobby
like train spotting or computer hacking. At times, the convention
felt like a computer programming seminar, with participants
feverishly exchanging codes and programming tips for an acoustic
operating system. There were scientists and doctors picking at the
convention alongside farmers and mechanics. Other types of
bluegrass fans were hippies and Deadheads for whom picking parties
have replaced drum circles, and university and music school
graduates, some of whom wore overalls and floppy felt hats and sang
bumpkin style as if it were hip to be hillbilly.
</P>
<P>
   Although the convention and fan fest, bluegrass' biggest,
officially consisted of panels, workshops and performances, the
real action took place in the hotel rooms. These were not
necessarily amateurs jamming. In one suite, banjo players Earl
Scruggs and J.D. Crowe sat picking for some four hours, echoed
elsewhere in the hotel by musicians like Tim O'Brien, Ronnie
McCoury, Hall, Skaggs and members of Blue Highway and Nickel Creek.
Near the end of their marathon, Scruggs and Crowe were joined by
the guitarist and singer Jimmy Martin. When they finished, Martin
moved to another suite, leading the room in a boisterous sing-along
of ``Will the Circle Be Unbroken.''
</P>
<P>
   If one credits Bill Monroe with putting all the ingredients for
bluegrass together, and Lester Flatt and Scruggs for bringing the
pot to a boil as members of Monroe's band and later on their own,
then Jimmy Martin added the cayenne pepper. A former member of Bill
Monroe's Blue Grass Boys and a robust performer in his own right,
his presence loomed over the festival like a blimp that might crash
to the ground at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than renting a booth in the convention hall, Martin
(wearing a red cowboy hat and black boots with rhinestone crosses
on the toes) simply set up his own booth just inside the entrance
to the hotel and draped a cloth over the table reading ``Jimmy
Martin _ The King of Bluegrass,'' a title that may be
self-proclaimed but is also undisputed. He held court tirelessly
for the duration of the festival, a tour de force that one
participant noted would be the equivalent of James Brown's
personally greeting fans as they walked into a funk convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm semi-retired,'' Martin said, explaining that he spends his
winters hunting with dogs named mostly after country stars. ``I go
coon hunting with my coon dogs and rabbit hunting with my rabbit
dogs. Their names are Tom T., Turbo, George Jones, Marty Stuart,
Little Jimmy Dickens (or Tater), Eddie Stubbs and Dolly Parton. And
you can tell everybody that Jimmy Martin said that Dolly has
beautiful big blue eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike country music, where a barrier has been rising between
the forebears and the current practitioners, bluegrass' has roots
that continue to nourish its newest musicians, despite the many
branches (newgrass, retrograss, groovegrass) the genre has grown.
Proof of this was a performance Saturday afternoon by a 7-year-old
banjo player named Ryan Holladay. Accompanied by O'Brien on the
tune ``Jimmy Martin Songs for Dinner,'' he sang, `` Jimmy Martin is
the king/He keeps our home together with the way he picks and
sings.''  &QL;

HOW FIVE GUNSHOTS INSPIRED AN ORATORIO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What did you do in the war, Daddy? Sir Michael
Tippett was nobody's daddy; a lively homosexual existence kept him
from that. But his oratorio ``A Child of Our Time'' was the answer
he could have given to any children of his time, or later.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Philharmonic presents the oratorio beginning on
Thursday at Avery Fisher Hall, and astonishingly, those
performances will be the orchestra's first of the work. But they
are by no means the first for its principal guest conductor, Sir
Colin Davis, who has been a fervent champion of Tippett's music
since the 1960s. He conducted a performance of ``A Child of Our
Time'' in London during the summer to honor the composer, who died
in January of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tippett began the score on Sept. 4, 1939, the day after Britain
and France declared war on Germany, and he finished it two years
later. Although it is probably the most direct and forceful protest
any composer managed to voice against the treatment of Jews in Nazi
Germany, it was not performed until 1944, perhaps because its
message of understanding was unwanted.
</P>
<P>
   What those in authority required of citizens at that time was
action, not oratorios, and paradoxically, Tippett was imprisoned
for three months in 1943 for refusing to take part in the war
effort, when he had already taken part, as yet unheard, in the
effort for peace. More than half a century later, ``A Child of Our
Time'' remains a challenge in its insistence that the answer to
violence is not more violence.
</P>
<P>
   Like many composers of his generation on both sides of the
Atlantic, Tippett, who was born in 1905, saw music as a social art,
an art that could even help change society. In the 1930s he
arranged concerts for and with unemployed people and searched for a
topic through which he could create an appeal for regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   That topic arrived in 1938. On Nov. 7, Herschel Grynszpan, a
Jewish student of 17 living with an uncle and aunt in Paris,
entered the German Embassy there and was shown into the office of a
minor functionary, Ernst vom Rath. Grynszpan fired five shots at
point-blank range with the revolver he had just bought, hitting vom
Rath twice. Two days later, vom Rath died.
</P>
<P>
   And that death of a ``martyr'' at the hands of ``international
Jewry,'' as the Nazis put it, prompted the terrible reprisals
wreaked on Jewish buildings, property and people the same night:
the night that immediately became known as Kristallnacht.
</P>
<P>
   Much in the Grynszpan case became clouded as time went on.
Trials in France and then in Germany, where the young man was taken
in 1940, were abandoned or indefinitely postponed; in the end, he
scotched Goebbels's hopes for a show trial by claiming he had been
vom Rath's kept boy. Then he disappeared from the record.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, having become an embarrassment rather than a propaganda
opportunity, he was killed. Perhaps he killed himself. Perhaps he
survived the war and knew, from his experiences, that he had better
keep his head down. Perhaps he is still doing so, at 78.
</P>
<P>
   But the immediate facts, which Tippett would have learned from
newspapers and radio broadcasts, were clear. Grynszpan, who had not
seen his parents, brother or sister for two years, was distraught
to learn that they, along with 17,000 other Jews of Polish origin
living in Germany, had been deported to Poland with almost no
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   A postcard from his sister relating all of this arrived on Nov.
3 and was in his coat pocket when he shot vom Rath four days later.
So a desperate, unconsidered, ill-directed act of revenge became
the pretext for the Nazis to move from one phase of oppression
(deportation) to another (terrorism). Grynszpan's finger on the
trigger was the small, human link between two turns of the wheel
that led to the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   That was what caught Tippett's attention: the cascade of
violence bringing about more violence. And it seems that Grynszpan
learned the same lesson, and wanted to frustrate a public trial in
Berlin not to save his own skin but rather to prevent unleashing
another wave of anti-Jewish atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Tippett, who earlier in the '30s had been as impressed by
Jungian analysis as by socialism, the young Jew who shot the German
diplomat was killing ``his dark brother.'' The solo tenor, who has
played the part of the Boy earlier in the oratorio, introduces the
final ensemble with the words ``I would know my shadow and my
light, so shall I at last be whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Individuals and nations, as Tippett saw it, create enemies by
finding other people to be trash cans for their own unacceptable
qualities; if that truth could be acknowledged, then the dialogue
of warfare could be turned into a dialogue of acceptance and even
love.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some naivete here. Though it is entirely plausible
that the Nazis blamed the Jews for their own personal failings and
those of German society between the wars, recognition of that
evasion was surely beyond most of them. Also, Hitler and his team
were set squarely on their course. Grynszpan's shots did not bring
about Kristallnacht; they were merely an excuse, and somewhere an
excuse would have been found.
</P>
<P>
   Tippett had to exaggerate the importance of Grynszpan's action
to suit not only his psychological program but also his musical
model, which he took from Handel's oratorios and Bach's Passions.
(The allied imitation of the English of the King James Bible is one
of the work's weakest features; Tippett had sought T.S. Eliot as
his librettist, but the poet, on seeing his draft, advised him to
set his own words.) Grynszpan, simply called the Boy, becomes a
tragic hero, motivated by the persecution of his people and, most
particularly, the suffering of his Mother.
</P>
<P>
   In the manner of Bach's Passions, the story is presented with
copious commentary. The two scenes involving the Boy and his Mother
_ one leading up to the murder, the other a pair of laments
afterward _ occupy only about a tenth of the hourlong piece. Most
of the action is narrated, including the murder, with the chorus
acting the part of the crowd, again as in Bach.
</P>
<P>
   It is nice that Tippett does not spare his British audience, for
the depiction of persecution is followed by a Chorus of the
Self-Righteous singing, ``We cannot have them in our Empire.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bach and Handel were by no means the work's only sources.
Tippett took his title from that of a novel by Odon von Horvath,
and his formal idea _ of focusing in on the story from a more
philosophical prologue, then withdrawing again to point the moral _
came from a movie, ``The Green Pastures.''
</P>
<P>
   That film, based on Bible stories and played by a black cast,
also stimulated a decision that gave Tippett a way to convey his
message far beyond the specifics of the Grynszpan story or the
awkwardness of his text. Five great choruses, moving and glorious,
he made as arrangements of black American spirituals.
</P>
<P>
   Music from white Europe reaches a warm arm across to another
race on another continent, and the outcry against anti-Semitism
finds deep, true expression in the outcry of another oppressed
people.
</P>
<P>
   These are the moments that make ``A Child of Our Time'' not only
a humane work but also a stirring one.

   LE CHAMBON-SUR-LIGNON, France _ The petite gray-haired woman in
her 60s happened to be walking past a plaque commemorating the
triumph of good over evil, but she needed no prompting to recall
what happened here more than half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gestapo came looking for Jews,'' she said. ``They came
with three buses, and the buses left empty. We told them there were
no Jews here.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Daley, the American writer best known for his police
thrillers, listened intently, but he already knew the story. He
includes a similar scene in his new novel, ``The Innocents Within''
(Villard Books). Indeed, the entire book is inspired by events in
and around this small town in Massif Central from 1940 to 1944,
when local Protestants shielded thousands of Jews from arrest and
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone participated,'' the woman said, waving away an
invitation to give her name. ``Everyone agreed they had a moral
obligation to help. The Protestant pastors, about a dozen of them,
played a very important role. They had a network. They used a code.
They'd call each other up and say, `I'm sending you three Old
Testaments.'''
</P>
<P>
   And yet the story of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon is relatively unknown
in France. For a long time after World War II, with paeans to the
Resistance in vogue, little recognition was given to those French
who helped 250,000 Jews survive the occupation, perhaps because to
do so would draw attention to those other French who were involved
in deporting 76,000 Jews to death camps. In fact, the first book
about Le Chambon, ``Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed'' (Harper
Perennial, 1989), was written by an American, Philip P. Hallie.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the end of the Cold War reawakening interest in the
horrors of the Nazi era, the sins of France's collaborationist
Vichy government and the courage of righteous French citizens are
being revisited. One recent book, ``Your Name Is Renee'' (Oxford
University Press), by Stacy Cretzmeyer, recounts how Ruth Kapp
Hartz, a young Jewish girl in occupied France, was hidden by a
French family and later in a Roman Catholic orphanage. When Daley
discovered the story of Le Chambon, he felt moved to retell it as
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was researching a different book in the library of Fordham
University when I found references to Le Chambon and its pastor,
Andre Trocme,'' said Daley, the author of such best sellers as
``Prince of the City,'' ``Year of the Dragon'' and ``Nowhere to
Run.'' ``I first thought of making Trocme a Roman Catholic, but
then I thought it better to have a Protestant in a Roman Catholic
country.''
</P>
<P>
   His interest in France was not accidental. Now 69, the tall,
slim New Yorker first came here as an aspiring writer in 1954,
arriving in Nice, where he promptly met the young Frenchwoman who
became his wife, Peggy Ernest. Soon fluent in French, he worked for
The New York Times as a foreign correspondent in the Paris bureau
in the early 1960s. He later made his name in New York with
thrillers spinning out of a brief spell as deputy police
commissioner of New York City in 1971, but he never lost touch with
France, where he has long kept a second home.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1996, having researched the broad picture of the
occupation, Daley turned to Le Chambon. He read ``Lest Innocent
Blood Be Shed,'' and he also spent a week here getting a feel for
the town and its surrounding hamlets and hearing for himself what
happened during the dark days of war. He then went away to write a
novel about a young American airman who crash-lands near here and
is hidden in the Protestant presbytery, where he falls in love with
a young Jewish woman who is living there under a Christian name.
</P>
<P>
   To give himself leeway, Daley turned Le Chambon-sur-Lignon into
Le Lignon, while Trocme became Andre Favert; his wife, Magda,
became Norma, and a few other real characters, including a talented
Jewish document forger, were given different names. But the
background to the novel, including both failed and successful
Gestapo searches for Jews and Trocme's arrest, mysterious release
and subsequent flight, is factual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it important to be faithful to the spirit of what
happened,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having taken reality and turned it into a novel, he had
returned to Le Chambon at the suggestion of a reporter for the
first time since completing ``The Innocents Within.'' No one here
was aware of the book, which has not been translated into French,
while Daley himself seemed reluctant to announce himself as the
author of a fictionalized version of the town's proud history. In
truth, in Le Chambon, the novel seemed more real than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Daley went first to the wall opposite the town's Protestant
church where a bronze plaque dated 1979 reads: ``To the Protestant
community of this Cevenole region, and to all those who followed
its example, believers of all faiths and nonbelievers who, during
the 1939-1945 war, under the occupation, stood up against the Nazi
crimes and at the risk of their own lives hid, protected, saved by
the thousands those who were persecuted.'' It is signed by ``The
Jewish refugees of Le Chambon and neighboring communes.''
</P>
<P>
   The early 19th-century church, dominated by the wooden pulpit
where both Trocme and the novel's Favert preached to the faithful
about their duty to hide Jews from persecution, seems to have
changed little in decades. ``The church was again full to
overflowing, and the pastor mounted to the pulpit and looked over
the congregation,'' Daley wrote in his novel after attending
religious services here in 1996. Behind the church lies the
cemetery where the grave of Trocme (he died in 1971), his wife and
various relatives is marked by a tombstone bereft of
grandiloquence.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The town's railroad station, where Jewish fugitives carrying old
suitcases arrived, is closed. But the rusty tracks of the
narrow-gauge steam engine that once linked Le Chambon to Le Puy
still wind through nearby woods. At one point the tracks pass the
House of the Rocks, a stone mansion that was a hostel for some 30
Jewish children until they were rounded up and deported by the
Gestapo in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   In Daley's book and in reality, the hostel was run by the
pastor's cousin, who was also taken away by the Germans. The house,
which is for sale, carries no plaque recalling the tragedy of that
day when, Daley wrote, the pastor ``recognized his failure and
wept.'' Yet the past has not been forgotten. Beside a bouquet of
dried flowers, a faded ribbon attached to an outside fence reads:
``29 June 1943, To my companions, never forgotten. Antonio Plaza.''
Plaza, a young Spanish refugee, was the only boy in the hostel who
escaped deportation that day.
</P>
<P>
   Daley's central love story between Davey Gannon and Rachel Weiss
is, of course, fictional, but he said it too could have happened:
the raid in which Gannon is shot down did take place, and a young
Jewish girl was hidden in one of the presbyteries of the area.
There is even a touch of autobiography in Gannon, Daley admitted.
Having served in the United States Air Force in the early 1950s,
the experience helped him create the character of the love-struck
young airman.
</P>
<P>
   That said, he insisted that he approached his story as fiction.
``With nonfiction writing, you're trying to organize something
you've seen or heard so that it strikes the reader the same way it
strikes you,'' he said. ``When writing a novel, the author should
stay out of it. Each day you wake up and put yourself in a trance,
and the characters start speaking in ways you don't expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as with his police thrillers, this story's success depends
on its being credible. And in that sense, ``The Innocents Within''
inevitably blurs the line between fable and fact: it is the
characters who drive the plot, but it is history that makes them
real.

INTERNATIONAL WATCHDOG GROUP RATES GOVERNMENTS ON CORRUPTION

<P>
   Transparency International, an independent organization that
tracks corruption among government officials around the world,
announced Tuesday that it has added a new index ranking nations
that appear to condone the paying of bribes by their companies
doing business abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin-based organization, which released both reports _ the
Corruption Perceptions Index and the Bribe Payers Index _ in
Washington, found that once again, officials in North European
countries were perceived to have the cleanest hands, while the
highest levels of bribe-taking officials appeared to be in Africa,
Asia, Latin America and the former Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to countries whose companies pay bribes abroad,
China was perceived to be the worst offender, followed by South
Korea, Taiwan, Italy and Malaysia. No country's corporations were
regarded as innocent of bribe-paying, but the Europeans, Australia
and Canada came out best.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The idea that corruption is a Third World phenomenon raises
tempers in developing countries every year when the Corruption
Perceptions Index is published. This year's is the fifth and
largest survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense in some countries that we were a group from
the richer North that was singling out the poor countries'' said
Frank Vogl, a former World Bank official and now vice chairman of
Transparency International, which he helped found in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said that basically there is a conspiracy of corruption
between the takers of bribes and the givers of bribes, and it
should be recognized'' he said. ``We thought we would create a
Bribe Payers Index.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Both indices plot perceptions, not concrete evidence, though in
different ways. The Corruption Perception Index is a ``poll of
polls,'' based on data from 17 surveys from 10 independent
institutions that analyze business conditions around the world. The
1999 index includes 99 countries, up from 85 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bribe Payers Index was based on a survey done for
Transparency International by Gallup International in 14 leading
emerging-market countries. These were: India, Indonesia, the
Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia,
Hungary, Poland, Russia, Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa. Gallup
International, which is based in London, interviewed 770 senior
executives in those nations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Vogl said in an interview in New York on Friday that the two
indices are ``two sides of the same coin.'' He said that it is
fashionable now to be against corruption, and to demand that
developing countries clean house before aid is granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is hypocrisy,'' he added. ``Many major industrial
countries do quite well on the CPI yet they are not discouraging
their own firms from corrupting foreign governments.'' Although the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of
industrial countries, has adopted a convention making bribery of
foreign officials a criminal offense, member nations have not
stopped the practice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   No country scored a perfect 10 on the Bribe Payers scale, where
a low score indicates corrupt practices. The best rating was
Sweden's at 8.3, followed by 8.1 for Australia and Canada. The
United States, which has had a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act on the
books for 22 years, scored only 6.2. At the bottom, China's score
was 3.1.
</P>
<P>
   On the Corruption Perceptions Index _ the ranking of countries
by the perceived honesty of their officials _ there was one perfect
score. Denmark scored 10. The United States had 7.5 points, behind
the North European nations, Singapore and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Transparency International, founded six years ago by a small
group of people who had seen development aid fail to achieve its
goals as corruption flourished, now has 77 national chapters world
wide.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vogl says he is impressed less by the organization's own growth
as by the explosion of public demand in diverse nations that
government and business stop corrupting each other. Concerns about
corruption are finally becoming part of policy-making, he said,
pointing to the questions now in Washington about how to deal with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, we couldn't get into the World Bank _ we were
told that this was politics,'' he said. Now, he said, there is a
``vast civil society movement'' asking questions in many capitals
about why health care or other services get no money while
officials buy airplanes.

   Analyze this: Radio psychologists, who used to go couch to couch
only on the AM-FM dials, are breaking into television. Dr. Joy

   With the film ``Mumford,'' about a ``psychologist'' who cures a
town's psychic ills, and ``The Shrink,'' a sitcom in the works at
ABC about a therapist more disturbed than his patients, the
psychoanalyzed Mafia dons of ``The Sopranos'' on HBO and last
spring's film ``Analyze This,'' media versions of shrinks are hot.
Anyone who thinks otherwise is in denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologists on radio and TV shows are now part of pop
culture,'' said Sheenah Hankin, a Manhattan psychotherapist who
treats media personalities. ``And these days we also live with a
ridiculous amount of self-pity, with catastrophizing and
histrionics.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling a radio therapist under the cloak of anonymity, with a
fake name and even a muffled voice, is one thing, but to go on
television and discuss your sexual problems or your failing
marriage or how you're disappointed by your life is another thing
entirely. Or is it? Is it an attempt to live in celebrity land,
revealing one's deepest, darkest secrets for those 15 minutes that
have become the right of every man, woman and child in America?
</P>
<P>
   ``TV is less safe than radio,'' Dr. Browne acknowledged. ``But I
knew people would come on the show as guests because I give
speeches, and people tell their stories, even in small towns. It's
like an old-fashioned revival meeting, where you go to feel you're
less alone. That you're acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere at ``Dr. Joy Browne'' (CBS, weekdays at 3 P.M.)
is several decibels calmer than that of talk shows like ``The Jenny
Jones Show'' or ``Ricki Lake.'' Members of the studio audience
don't hoot and holler or shout out opinions; they listen,
respectfully. And unlike the audience and guests at ``The Jerry
Springer Show,'' they don't throw chairs. Approving applause and
disapproving murmurs are as rowdy as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   It's more like Phil Donahue's gentle talk show of the 1970s, but
with specific problems and solutions, not just an airing of
emotions and opinions without a resolution and plan of action.
</P>
<P>
   Take Dave and Becky, two of Dr. Browne's recent guests. High
school sweethearts in the '70s, both grew up, grew apart, married
others and became parents. Dave is hoping to rekindle their lost
love. This interests Becky. Becky is still married, however, yet
says this is a ``rocky marriage''; Dave is in the throes of a
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the two of you to be judicious about this,'' Dr.
Browne, a lanky Carol Burnett type who admits to being in her late
40s, prescribes as the three sit in comfy chairs on the tastefully
muted set. ``You don't start dating until a year after you're
divorced. Don't view each other as romantic attachments until
sometime in the future. Go slow.'' She speaks in no-nonsense tones,
often punctuated by sweetly anachronistic expressions (among them,
``honey buns,'' ``kiddo'' and ``patootie'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Joy Browne'' is like seeing a therapist, but with an
audience and much shorter sessions. It is to deep psychoanalysis
what a teeth cleaning is to root canal. ``It's a start,'' allows
Dr. Browne. ``It clarifies things and moves people in a new
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   With longtime slogans like ``There's no trying, only doing and
not doing'' and ``Life is daring risk or it's nothing at all,'' Dr.
Browne has been a sympathetic yet firm presence on radio for 20
years, the last 7 of them on WOR, which broadcasts her show from 9
a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 10 p.m. to midnight on weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition of the radio shrink began a few years earlier, in
1975, when Dr. Toni Grant tested the neurotic waters in Los Angeles
(KABC-AM) as the nation's first broadcast therapist. If Dr. Joyce
Brothers is the grande dame of all psychologists represented in the
media, with her syndicated newspaper column and her jokey walk-ons
in sitcoms and movies, then Dr. Grant (``Life is not a dress
rehearsal'') is the true mother of all radio shrinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The format was copied all over the country,'' Dr. Grant said
of her show, which ran from midnight to 5 a.m. in the beginning.
``My show was the prototype.''
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual daughters of Ann and Abby (not to mention Miss
Lonelyhearts) also include Sonya Friedman, former radio
psychologist and author of the best seller ``Men Are Just
Desserts'' who was most recently in private practice in Detroit,
and Dr. Judy (``I love you so you love you'') Kuriansky, who has
offered guidance on her nationally syndicated call-in shows,
including ``Love Phones,'' for the last 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   There have been men, too, including Dr. David (``I'm glad you
decided to start the journey'') Viscott, who died three years ago,
a tough-love therapist who went on the air in Los Angeles in 1980
and was nationally syndicated in the 1990s. Dr. Susan Forward's
radio show also began in Los Angeles in 1980 and was syndicated to
70 stations two years later, she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Forward (``And remember, you are the most important person
in the world'') ended her radio show in 1988, when she was ``in
preproduction for a TV show that didn't happen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Browne's biggest rival, Dr. Laura Schlessinger, of KFI-AM
(640) in Los Angeles and national syndication, has had better luck.
Dr. Laura, as she is known, has just made a deal with Paramount
Television for her own syndicated television show next fall. Dr.
Laura, 52, is infamous for scolding her radio callers and imposing
her own moral framework on their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Callers often approach her with understandable trepidation.
(``Your kids have a really bad role model,'' she tells Shawna, an
unmarried mother. ``Are you ever going to develop a backbone?'')
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Browne, on the other hand, is a sworn enemy of the blame and
guilt school of personal interaction. She is a cross between Dr.
Frasier Crane, Kelsey Grammer's radio talk show psychiatrist on
NBC's sitcom ``Frasier,'' who tells his callers, ``I'm listening,''
and Heloise, but with hints for the head, not the house.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's scolding or supportive, can broadcast therapy
really be effective? Dr. Hankin, the psychotherapist, says such
psychological quick fixes can be therapeutically valid, within
reason. ``I think it can have a lot of value if the people doing it
are competent,'' she said. ``It can be quite useful to people who
are not deeply troubled. Certainly the demand is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Farley, president of the media psychology division of
the American Psychological Association, says such shows represent
the beginning of a new era, and he is less than thrilled. ``There
is a controversy here, no doubt about it,'' he said. ``Basically
we're against it; there is definitely a sentiment against it.
Longer term, face-to-face encounters are crucial. This ain't
therapy. The association is now working up a code of ethics on the
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting your problems on television ``can be a great leveler,''
however, Dr. Hankin said, for the guest as well as the viewer.
``You hear other people have the same problems and then you know
you're not alone,'' she said. ``It's also voyeuristic. Like having
invisible walls to our neighbor's apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Browne agrees. ``There is a voyeuristic component,'' she
said. ``And television has to be entertaining. If I'm not
entertaining, I have no business doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Browne reveals herself regularly, on both radio and
television. Her audience knows that she is divorced, the mother of
a grown-up daughter (a 22-year-old marine biologist), the eldest of
six children born in New Orleans and brought up in Denver (she now
lives in Chelsea, she said in an interview). And she seems to truly
like her problem-plagued flock. ``How can you not?'' she said.
``They're so brave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a do-gooder at heart,'' she added. ``I may be a horse's
patootie but I'm a sincere horse's patootie. I really am trying to
help.''
</P>
<P>
   With that goal in mind, Dr. Browne has her rules: No dating for
a year after a divorce or breakup. (It clears your head and lets
you experience life on your own.) Married couples need to go on
dates with each other. (To improve intimacy, have fun and remember
why you're together in the first place.) If you love him and either
of you has children, marry him; if not, get out of the
relationship. (It's disruptive, for younger children, who will
become attached, and for teen-agers, who have to deal with their
own sexuality.)
</P>
<P>
   She even has one big rule for herself: chocolate, her favorite
substance on earth, is off limits during Lent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That keeps me humble,'' Dr. Browne said. ``I'm always telling
people to do things to change. This is my yearly reminder to myself
that change is really hard.''

FORBES CALLS BUSH CAMPAIGN AD `MISLEADING' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Even as it debuted Tuesday, one of Republican
front-runner George W. Bush's first television ads of the
presidential campaign was attacked as ``misleading'' by the
campaign of rival GOP candidate Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Blackwell, Forbes' national chairman, disputed an ad in
which the Texas governor claims to have reduced spending growth in
Texas. He challenged the Bush campaign to either ``fix'' the ad or
pull it off the air.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spot is one of four Bush TV commercials that began
airing Tuesday in the key nominating states of Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign defended the accuracy of the ad, in which an
announcer says that Bush ``reduced the growth of state government
spending to the lowest in 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell, in a statement from Forbes' campaign headquarters in
Alexandria, Va., called the ad a ``misrepresentation of his
(Bush's) state spending record.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell said that state spending under Bush has risen
``significantly more'' than the 21 percent federal spending
increase recorded under President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As reported last week by the Houston Chr the two-year
Texas budget has increased from $72.8 billion to $98.1 billion _ a
35 percent increase _ while Bush has been governor.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's budget experts say the growth has only been 2.7
percent, when budgetary figures are adjusted for inflation,
population growth and the extra education funds that the state has
transferred to local school districts for property tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   The adjusted Bush budget growth compares to a 31 percent growth
under the previous three budgets, the governor's office says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ad claims that Bush's spending record is somehow
exemplary. Actually it is more of a Clintonian record than
conservative. In fact, George Bush makes Bill Clinton look like a
fiscal conservative,'' Blackwell said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The ad is clearly misleading, and the Bush campaign
should fix it or pull it off the air altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Blackwell's statement, the Bush campaign produced
charts purporting to show that the rate of growth in state spending
under Bush was the lowest since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Forbes, a wealthy magazine
publisher who trails Bush by a wide margin in voter preference
polls, was the candidate who was trying to mislead voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush actually has a record of fiscal responsibility
that includes setting clear priorities, increasing funding for
public education, passing the two largest tax cuts in Texas history
and bringing about a dramatic reduction in the growth of state
spending,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Forbes would not confirm speculation that
he will soon attack Bush as a ``big spender'' in a paid TV campaign
of his own.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Bush's record ``raises very serious questions about
his ability to control spending.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Forbes' main campaign issues is a proposal to replace the
federal income tax with a flat tax that, he said, would cut taxes
for millions of Americans.

COMMENTARY: THE WAR OVER PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to make sense of the current foreign policy debate
in America, think of it like this: The key to the 20th century is
not the three world wars (I, II and the Cold War) that punctuated
it, but rather how we designed the peace that followed these wars.
The peace of Versailles was mishandled. The peace after World War
II was well managed. Remarkably, what Republicans and Democrats are
still debating today is how, and how much, America should shape the
post-Cold War peace.
</P>
<P>
   In 1919 and 1945, notes Fareed Zakaria, managing editor of
Foreign Affairs, ``America wanted to change the world, and the
world was reluctant. But in 1999, the world is eager to change _
along the lines being defined by America _ but now America is
reluctant.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if you look at the world that has developed since the
end of the Cold War, ``it is based in many ways on our ideas, our
values and our products _ yet we are ambivalent about recognizing
this world as our child, so we behave at times like deadbeat
dads,'' argues the political scientist Robert Pastor, whose new
volume, ``A Century's Journey: How the Great Powers Shape the
World,'' is an extremely thoughtful examination of great-power
politics.
</P>
<P>
   This U.S. ambivalence derives from the fact that while America's
victory in the Cold War was decisive _ it eliminated any
ideological alternative to free-market capitalism and any
superpower alternative to U.S. power _ it was not complete. America
did not occupy the countries it defeated in the Cold War, a la
Germany and Japan. Therefore our ability to reshape Russia or China
is limited, and their ability to obstruct us _ either by their
weakness or their strength _ still exists.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, you can see three schools forming in the U.S.
debate. First are the ``Nutty and Energetic Republicans.'' This is
an unholy alliance of old Cold Warriors, extreme isolationists and
unilateralists, and outright fools. What binds them is a belief
that America today is overwhelmingly powerful, therefore it can
preserve a post-Cold War peace either by ignoring the world or
acting unilaterally upon it. Because they are so focused inward,
these people spurn the United Nations, even though it is ready to
do our bidding and share our burdens.
</P>
<P>
   The second school is the ``Serious but Timid Republicans,'' who
actually offer an intelligent critique of the Clinton approach to
post-Cold War peace. They agree the United States should spread
trade and free-market capitalism, engage China and confront tyrants
like Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic. But this group's
critique of the Clinton team is that it has relied too heavily on
multilateral approaches and treaties, rather than on hard-headed
U.S. power; and it has focused far too much on smaller problems _
Haiti, Ireland and the Balkans _ and mismanaged the big ones _
Russia, China and arms control.
</P>
<P>
   The third school is the ``Serious but Lazy Democrats.'' These
are the Clintonites. They have the right instinct _ that the
post-Cold War peace should be focused on sustainable globalization.
They understand that today's system of globalization greatly
benefits the United States, because it is our ideas, products and
people that are being most globalized. Therefore, the way to build
a post-Cold War peace is by using U.S. power to keep this system
stable, by using U.S. leverage to widen the circle of democracies,
and by using U.S. prosperity to widen the group of people who
benefit from globalization. They also understand that we can't
manage such an integrated system alone, and if we try we will
stimulate a coalition against us.
</P>
<P>
   But while they have all the right convictions, the Lazy
Democrats have the courage of those convictions only about half the
time. In Kosovo, they stuck to their guns; they did the same with
Nafta. But in April, when a deal to bring China into the WTO was
possible, they walked away because they didn't want to fight with
congressional Democrats and had not prepared the ground in advance.
Same with the Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Test Ban Treaty, WTO, U.N. dues, all failed,'' said
Pastor, ``because the nutty Republicans and the serious ones came
together. Unless the President forms a new coalition between the
serious Republicans and serious Democrats, America will not be able
to forge a post-Cold War peace.''

LEPTINSTUDY FINDS IT IS PROMISING, BUT NOT AN INSTANT CURE-ALL FOR
OBESITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Calif., Mass.)   By GINA KOLATA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new clinical study of the hormone leptin finds that
it is not the weight-loss panacea that obesity researchers had
hoped for. But researchers say the hormone remains important
because it is opening the door to a new era of precise
pharmacological manipulation of body weight.
</P>
<P>
   Leptin was discovered five years ago, to great fanfare. A strain
of monumentally obese mice turned out to lack the hormone. When
they were given it, the animals lost their appetites and wasted
away to normal weights virtually overnight. Researchers soon
discovered that humans made leptin, too, raising hopes that the
hormone might do the same thing for people that it did for the
mice.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen, a biotechnology company in Thousand Oaks, Calif., quickly
began moving rapidly from research with animals to research with
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of excitement and everyone thought, `Wow, this
could be the new panacea,''' said Dr. Andrew S. Greenberg, who
directs the program in obesity metabolism at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts
University in Boston, New England Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But in a company-supported study, researchers led by Dr. Steven
B. Heymsfeld of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital and Greenberg found
that when volunteers injected themselves with leptin, they lost
moderate amounts of weight at best. Most of the people taking the
highest _ and most effective _ dose of the hormone dropped out of
the study because they found it too unpleasant to inject themselves
daily with large volumes of the substance.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, involved 54 people who were of normal weight
and 73 who were obese. To assess the drug's safety, all injected
themselves daily with leptin _ or, as a control, with saltwater _
for one month. Then the study continued with the obese subjects to
assess leptin's ability to induce weight loss. The obese patients
were given a weight-loss diet.
</P>
<P>
   There was little effect of leptin except at the highest dose
tested, when two out of eight patients lost about 35 pounds in 24
weeks. The others lost much less, and one gained nearly 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The eight people taking the highest dose were the remnants of a
group of 18 patients who had been assigned to take it; the rest
dropped out after a month of taking leptin, complaining that they
could not stand to inject themselves with several tablespoons a day
of a substance that irritated their skin and was painful to
administer.
</P>
<P>
   Some leptin experts say the study shows that leptin failed as a
weight-loss drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have to look at it and say there has not yet been
any convincing evidence that this is a therapeutic benefit in
anything other than a minor fraction of patients,'' said Dr.
Jeffrey S. Flier, the chief of endocrinology at the Beth Israel
Deaconness Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jules Hirsch, an obesity research at Rockefeller University,
agreed. ``The great hope for leptin has not held up,'' he said.
``It doesn't look to me like what's wrong with human beings is a
deficit of leptin.''
</P>
<P>
   Amgen responded cautiously to the findings, saying it was
starting research with a new formulation of the hormone that
remained in the body for a longer period of time, in hopes that it
might be more effective. A spokesman, David Kaye, said the new
study ``demonstrates that providing injections of endogenous leptin
did indeed produce weight loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Obesity researchers note that leptin does seem to play a role in
regulating body fat, although perhaps not quite the role that was
originally envisioned for it.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have found about a half-dozen people around the world
who are unable to make any leptin at all. One, a little girl who
lives in England, weighed 207 pounds by age 9; at 6, doctors
performed liposuction on her legs because she could hardly walk,
according to a recent paper in The New England Journal of Medicine.
At mealtimes, she would eat everything on her plate as quickly as
possible and demand more, hiding food to eat between meals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen O'Rahilly, a professor of metabolic medicine at
Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England, began giving the girl
injections of leptin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredibly dramatic,'' O'Rahilly said. ``This was a
child who had never lost weight in her life.'' All of a sudden, she
lost most of her appetite, eating slowly at meals and ceasing to
hide food for forbidden gorging between meals. Her weight
plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rahilly is now treating another child who makes no leptin, a
3-year-old girl who would eat 2,000 calories at a sitting. That
changed when she received leptin.
</P>
<P>
   ``She reduced what she ate by 80 to 90 percent,'' O'Rahilly
said. ``Within a week of leptin treatment she was eating normal
kid's food.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question is, what does the effect of leptin on the
handful of children who lack it entirely say about its effects on
most obese people, who seem to make it in abundance?
</P>
<P>
   Flier, of Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center, proposes that
leptin is not a signal to lose weight, as originally thought, but
instead a way for the brain to know that there is fat on the body.
Children who do not make leptin would have no such signals _ their
brain would think they had no fat and would spur them to eat more
and more in a futile effort to get the leptin signal that fat was
present.
</P>
<P>
   Flier reasoned that if he was correct, leptin levels should go
down if animals or people were starved. In mice, and now in people,
he and others found that leptin levels did drop with starvation. At
the same time, subjects become infertile and their thyroid hormone
levels sink, slowing the metabolic rate. But Flier found that if he
gave mice leptin while he starved them, their brains never knew
they were being starved; the animals remained fertile and their
metabolisms did not slow.
</P>
<P>
   If leptin's role is to maintain body fat, then the hormone might
be valuable in helping people who have lost large amounts of weight
to avoid regaining it, Flier said. When very fat people get down to
the desired weight, they look normal but are physiologically the
equivalent of a person who is starving to death: their metabolic
rates are low, they are infertile, they crave food. Most gain back
every pound they lost. But perhaps if they took leptin, they might
be able to stay thin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their disappointment in the first leptin studies,
investigators said they were confident that leptin would lead them
to the complete molecular pathway that the body uses to control
eating, and weight, with the result that companies could find drugs
to effectively intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it is true that leptin as an overall panacea for obesity
has been disappointing,'' O'Rahilly said. ``But that doesn't mean
that leptin hasn't been one of the most fascinating discoveries in
the 20th century.''

   GOLDMAN-NETWORKING (Undated) _ Janet Tiebout Hanson had been one
of just a few women professionals at Goldman, Sachs, where her male
colleagues had honed networking over the decades into a science.
But women like her who left, staying at home with their children
for a few years, later found their Rolodexes out of date and their
skills rusty. Why not, Ms. Hanson mused, jump-start the networking
process for them? So Ms. Hanson created an organization two years
ago called 85 Broads, a playful reference to the firm's location on
85 Broad Street. ``The reason I can do this is that I made it out
of Goldman into a successful entrepreneurial experience,'' Ms.
Hanson said. By Reed Abelson. (With photo.)

companies are expanding programs and policies intended to help
harried workers balance their personal lives and the demands of
work. A greater use of flexible hours, part-time work, day care,
sabbaticals and longer vacations are all part of that effort. By

   &UR; _ Cindy Crawford &LR;  refused to pose for Vogue's millennium cover
_ which features 13 supermodels from the last 30 years _ because
it's a fold out and the magazine wouldn't promise she'd be on the
outermost fold. ``There was no way of deeming who would end up on
the cover,'' Crawford's publicist told the New York Post. ``It was
Cindy's decision.''

announce that when  &UR; Ed Norton &LR; 's refrigerator is opened in the
movie ``Fight Club,'' ``a 30-foot-tall close-up of two jars of
Mendocino Mustard, my mustard, my baby'' is revealed. This is no
paid product placement, she writes, ``but some gofer faxed me a

Silicon Valley, writes  &UR; Lisa Margonelli &LR; , there are lots of smart
young people launching companies based on great ideas and technical

thing; steering a company from two people to 40 and crashing the
market ... is another.''
</P>
<P>
   The person such a company is looking for is ``someone who's been
there and done that,'' a person with gray hair. ``VCs, angels,
boards of directors, even founders themselves: Ee &LR; veryone wants
someone with the real-time experience to stay cool when the
kid-founders are all stoned on startup dope, working day and night
toward launch.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine estimates that there may be 400 CEO searches going

STREEP TAKES A BOW FOR ROLE AS VIOLIN TEACHER IN `MUSIC OF THE
HEART' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: With FILM-MUSIC-CRAVEN, also note italics below) 
 
 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everybody knows Meryl Streep can do accents, but
it's a safe bet (without asking her) that she doesn't sit at home
in Connecticut conversing with her husband and four kids with
British, Danish, German, Irish, Australian or even Oklahoman
inflections.
</P>
<P>
   But recently the two-time Oscar winner picked up a very
different skill for a film role _ playing violin for ``Music of the
Heart'' _ and although the shoot is long behind her, she's still
practicing the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, because I live pretty far out of New York,'' Streep
said. ``I found a teacher for the summer, and then she was at the
Tanglewood (Music Festival), but she went back to the BSO (Boston
Symphony Orchestra). I'm looking for another person to keep me
current.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going by the book now. I'm sight-reading,'' she added with
a touch of self-satisfaction in her voice.
</P>
<P>
   In the true story, Streep plays Roberta Guaspari, a Navy wife
abandoned by her husband. Guaspari, a violinist with scant teaching
experience, is desperate for work, so she takes on the challenge of
teaching streetwise Harlem children to play the very genteel
instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Streep initially declined the role because she feared she
wouldn't have enough preparation time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Wes (Craven) wrote me a really wonderful letter _ unlike
anything I'd ever gotten from a director _ just basically putting
his heart on his sleeve about what he felt about the project, about
being a teacher and coming to this material after a long time doing
other sorts of things and how much it meant to him,'' she said.
``And, oh man, it was just everything you want to hear from a
director. The passion is in place. It meant so much to him to
follow it through, and he wanted me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I begged for some more time, because I don't play an
instrument and I didn't know to what extent I could fake it,''
Streep said. ``I imagined they would digitally realize my fingers,
but it turns out they couldn't do that, so they gave me an extra
four weeks. I had a couple of months before we started shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   That's eight weeks to learn not just ``Twinkle, Twinkle Little
Star'' and other beginner's tunes, but the intricate Concerto in D
Minor for Two Violins by Johann Sebastian Bach (a k a ``the Bach
Double'') as well. And she couldn't merely play the violin; she had
to handle it with authority and extreme confidence, always in the
character of the gutsy woman she was playing and sometimes while
delivering lines. (She once told Craven it's like patting your
head, rubbing your stomach and doing the tango all at once.)
</P>
<P>
   A violinist with the New York Philharmonic gave her private
instruction last year while Streep traveled to publicize ``One True
Thing'' and ``Dancing at Lughnasa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was intense, and my neck hurt all the time, but other than
that I have no complaints,'' she said. ``This is what I had to do
to play a violin teacher, but I'm not a great violinist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure loved her story. And I didn't want to do her dishonor
not to really pay respect to this instrument she loves and she
teaches such respect for in her classes. I looked at it as
preparation for the role.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the film, Roberta finds herself organizing a
fund-raiser, Fiddlefest, in which she and her students would play
historic Carnegie Hall with Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Arnold
Steinhardt and other amazing musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Streep struggled to find the words to describe how that concert
scene felt for her, and at the same time, tried (BEGIN ITAL)not(END
ITAL) to describe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``(BEGIN ITAL)That(END ITAL) was a thrill,'' she said. ``It
really was one of the great moments of my life, and so I don't want
to blab about it all the time. It's like showing the video of your
wedding 50 times in a row, and suddenly you feel like, I don't
remember what it was like to be at my wedding. I don't want the
memory to be robbed from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was magic,'' she said, then abruptly broke her wistful mood
and laughed, ``but I'm not going to tell (BEGIN ITAL)you(END ITAL)
about it!''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the concert, Roberta goes to Carnegie Hall to
familiarize herself with the backstage area and the legendary
stage.
</P>
<P>
   In that scene, Stern approaches Roberta and bids her welcome to
one of the world's most prestigious concert halls, saying the
spirits of such musicians as Pyotr Il'yich Tchaikovsky, Vladimir
Horowitz and Jascha Heifetz welcome her, too.
</P>
<P>
   Streep said the exchange wasn't in the script, but a
conversation Stern had with the actress right before shooting the
concert scene. She told Craven about it, and he decided to add it
to the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did give me goose bumps. It made the hair stand up on my
arms when (Stern) first did it,'' Streep added. ``I look at
Carnegie Hall in a very romantic way. I was born in New Jersey and
came into New York, and that was the temple of musical art.''
</P>
<P>
   The concert scene was pressure of one kind, but working with
truly gifted children, some of them actual Guaspari students, was
another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``As nervous as I was for Carnegie Hall, I was much more nervous
the first day I had to play for the 6-year-old group,'' she said.
``I was just beside myself with nerves. I played really, really
badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first week of rehearsals. My fingers were
wiggling with fear. You don't have vibrato in the bow hand. (BEGIN
ITAL)I(END ITAL) had vibrato in the bow hand. They were laughing _
they loved that I sucked at it,'' Streep recalled with amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got very good very quickly and that made them mad. They
said, `You're skipping books. You're supposed to go to Book 3. You
went right from (Book) 2 to 5. That's not fair,''' she said,
mimicking a childish whine.
</P>
<P>
   She said in a matter of a few days they were treating her as
their teacher, awarding her the respect due a person of authority.
``They were so sweet. I really got why people love to teach,
because kids give you so much love, and it's an amazing
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Streep began acting in high school theater, mentored by her
music teacher, Claire Callahan. Now the 50-year-old actress _
mother of three daughters ages 8, 13 and 16 and a son who is 19,
and the wife of sculptor Don Gummer _ is a passionate advocate for
the arts in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the arts in public and private
education are the poor sisters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the worth of a culture is measured in its legacies, in
its art, what it leaves the world. I think we need more poets,
artists, musicians, not less. How are we going to fill up all that
software? We'll have lots of people who can write (computer)
programs, but nobody's going to know what to put in them.''

IN SECOND DAY OF PROTESTS, FOLLOWERS IN CHINESE RELIGIOUS GROUP
ARRESTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ For the second straight day, scores of followers of
the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual movement appeared in Tiananmen
Square on Tuesday and were immediately taken away by police.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, numerous protesters sat quietly together and were
detained without a struggle, witnesses said. Other Falun Gong
adherents were accosted by uniformed or plainclothes police as they
entered the square and taken to vans when they readily admitted
their purpose. In and around the huge, crowded square, it was
impossible for observers to determine exactly how many were
arrested over the day.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the spiritual movement say they are especially
incensed this week by moves in the parliament to pass a law aimed
at curbing so-called religious cults, and by public charges that
Falun Gong leaders had obtained and distributed 59 classified
government documents about the official crackdown, which began in
July.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that Falun Gong leaders have disseminated state
secrets appeared to be an effort to lay the groundwork for serious
criminal charges against them. In recent years, millions of Chinese
have been attracted to the movement's blend of Buddhism, Taoism and
traditional Chinese cosmic theories and exercises. Most ordinary
followers have simply received warnings to disassociate themselves
from the group, but some organizers have been jailed and will face
subversion charges, which could bring prison sentences ranging from
five years to life.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the crackdown, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang
Qiyue said Tuesday that the group was ``anti-science, anti-society
and anti-humanity,'' and that it had ``upset social order and
damaged the health of practitioners.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong proponents say its exercises bring health and
spiritual benefits and that the group has no political ambitions.
In April, more than 10,000 members held a surprise vigil near the
Chinese leadership's compound in Beijing, calling for legal
recognition and an end to official harassment. But this display of
organizational power frightened authorities, and the group was
banned in July.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the defiance by hundreds of members this week in Beijing,
the continued official efforts to vilify the group and its founder,
Li Hongzhi, who now lives in New York, suggests that the government
is far from wiping it out.

D-Mich., the panel's top Democrat, sharply escalated the political
maneuvering over the future of the Vieques target range that has
been closed since a bombing mishap in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee is going to inject itself into that process
(and) if necessary have a special hearing _ even though the
Congress may not be session,'' Warner warned. ``The Congress is not
going to sit by because we have a co-equal responsibility under the
Constitution for the safety and the welfare of the men and women in
the armed forces,'' added Warner, a former secretary of the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D.
Eisenhower is scheduled to conduct live fire combat training on
Vieques in early December before leaving Feb. 18 for the
Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. This timetable puts pressure on
President Clinton to decide whether to end a moratorium on combat
training on Vieques in the face of adamant Puerto Rican opposition
to any resumption of combat training there.
</P>
<P>
   Warner spoke after hearing members of the Joint Chief of Staff
testify on the combat readiness of American armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told
the panel that live-fire combat training on Vieques was ``critical
to our readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly would not want to see our troops sent into an area
where there was going to be combat, without having had this type of
an experience. We should not deploy them under those conditions,''
Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Adm. Jay Johnson, chief of naval operations, warned that
the lives of American forces might be jeopardized without the
realistic live-fire combat training that the Navy has carried out
on Vieques since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question in my mind that without Vieques, we will
knowingly increase the risk to our men and women out forward, and I
believe we should not do that, sir,'' Johnson told Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Inhofe, D-Okla., chairman of the panel's subcommittee
on readiness, said he visited the Eisenhower in the Caribbean last
weekend and heard Navy officers complain that pilots were getting
only ``about 50 percent'' of the training that they normally got
when they used Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   James Fallin, a spokesman for the National Security Council at
the White House, said that Clinton recognizes the implications of
the moratorium on combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president fully appreciates and understands the national
security issues at stake in the Vieques dispute,'' Fallin said.
</P>

<P>
   The Pentagon is working on a recommendation to Clinton about the
future use of Vieques, an island off Puerto Rico where more than
9,300 civilian residents live on a swathe of land sandwiched
between two large tracts of Navy-owned land that includes a bombing
range.
</P>
<P>
   The target range has been closed since April 19 when a Marine
pilot mistakenly bombed a range observation post and killed a
Puerto Rican security guard working for the Navy and injured four
other civilians working on the range.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon review panel appointed at Clinton's request
recommended on Oct. 19 that the Navy reduce live-fire training on
Vieques from 180 days a year to 130 days a year during a five-year
phase out.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says the target range, centered on an 899-acre live
impact area at the eastern end of Vieques, is the only place along
the Atlantic Coast where Atlantic-based forces can practice the
air, land and sea assaults that the Navy requires for certification
as combat ready.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen is still mulling what to do
with the review panel's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican protesters are occupying the site in a bid to
thwart resumption of bombing. Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello has
vowed to go to federal court to stop any resumption of target
practice.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a blow to Puerto Rico's campaign to expel the Navy from the
bombing range, Warner and Levin announced that the Senate Armed
Services Committee would exercise jurisdiction over legislation
that would force the Navy out.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Committee that has jurisdiction over U.S.
territories such as Puerto Rico, introduced legislation on Sept. 15
that would transfer all Navy-owned land on Vieques to the
government of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, co-sponsored by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has
the support of Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Armed Service committee is responsible for military
readiness, the panel is likely to prove unsympathetic to Puerto
Rico's demand that the Navy get out of Vieques.

CRAVEN MAKES `MUSIC OF THE HEART' WITH STRINGS ATTACHED

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If it's Halloween weekend, it must be time for a
Wes Craven movie.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   Craven, a nearly 30-year veteran of slice-and-dice horror
flicks, is opening his latest project Friday, but it's no ``Wes
Craven movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music of the Heart'' is a feel-good underdog triumph story
with an A-list cast _ Meryl Streep, Angela Bassett, Aidan Quinn and
Gloria Estefan _ and not a single corpse.
</P>
<P>
   Craven, a gentle-looking bearded man who just turned 60, comes
across more as the philosophy student and humanities professor he
used to be than the ``slashmeister'' _ his term _ that he has since
become. His Hollywood Hills home clearly is a haven for a lover of
art, music, literature and peaceful reflection in its Japanese
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Will the real Wes Craven please stand up?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were given my druthers, I would probably stop doing
horror films _ not that I regret for a minute any of those,'' said
Craven, whose most famous titles are ``Nightmare on Elm Street''
and the very hot ``Scream'' franchise. ``They have a mythic
quality, and children and teen-agers have a lot of fears, and I
think it helps them deal with those fears when they see some young
person overcoming the worst things imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with a film like `Music of the Heart,' more people are
willing to join you,'' he said. ``It's nice to do a film nobody
(BEGIN ITAL)can't(END ITAL) like. True, some may say it's too
sentimental, but it's not like someone's going to say, `I just
can't look at that on the screen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Craven had been wanting for years to break away, at least once,
from the horror genre that has made him so well-known that, he
notes with a smile, his name has cropped up five times in The New
York Times crossword puzzle. But his successes with Freddie Krueger
and all those shrieking victims kept getting in the way.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``Scream'' in 1996 that finally paved the way for this
very non-Craven film. ``Scream'' was a big hit at a test screening,
and Craven was dining out that night with his longtime producer,
Marianne Maddalena, when in walked the Weinstein brothers of
Miramax Films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there celebrating, and it must have been a quarter to
one in the morning, and Bob and Harvey came in and said, `Excuse
the interruption, but we have something we want to talk to you
about.' And basically they offered a three-picture deal, including
one outside the genre.''
</P>
<P>
   (The others in the package turned out to be the quickly made
``Scream 2'' and ``Scream 3,'' the latter now being edited for a
Feb. 4 release.)
</P>
<P>
   The Weinsteins offered several choices for the mainstream movie,
various projects they already owned rights to, but Craven says none
captured his attention like the true story of Roberta Guaspari, a
former Navy wife who, on the heels of her marriage collapse, moved
with her sons to Harlem and launched a program to teach violin to
elementary school students. She had been the subject of ``Small
Wonders,'' an Oscar-nominated documentary that impressed the
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so close to some of the strongest things in my own
life,'' he said. ``I come from a working-class family. When I first
started listening to classical music, I was very moved by its
beauty, if that doesn't sound overly sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   ``I taught myself how to play classical guitar. I'm divorced
from the mother of my children, so I knew the pain of that process.
My father died when I was 4, so I knew what it was like to have a
father leave and really wish he could come back. I taught high
school and college before I got into the business. God, I thought,
I know all of those things well.''
</P>
<P>
   It should have been relatively easy to get the film rolling,
what with an experienced director and producer, a good story, the
strong support of Miramax and the cooperation of Guaspari, but the
project nearly fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Back when its title was ``50 Violins,'' Madonna had signed to
play the lead. She was three months into violin lessons, and Craven
was knee-deep in pre-production, when ``creative differences''
caused a professional rift.
</P>
<P>
   As Craven explains it, Madonna was adamant about focusing more
on Guaspari's adult life and less on the time she spent with her
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that if I were going to change a script significantly
at an actress's request _ not just Madonna's but any actress's _
that it would be less my movie, and I would not be able to get up
in the morning and be happy to be working on it,'' Craven said.
``There was never a raised voice or anything. We just had different
opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   So Craven pursued Streep, whom he wanted for Roberta in the
first place. When he first tried to get her, she had been busy
working on two other films. Now she was getting set to promote
those films and was concerned there wouldn't be enough time to
prepare for the role, so she declined. Meanwhile, Craven was
feeling the movie slipping away from him. The pre-production staff
had all but disappeared, and the rest of the cast was on standby
but couldn't remain that way indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   After some strong persuasion, Streep agreed to make the film,
and the director arranged for the actress and Guaspari to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went off (to the wardrobe department) and started trying
on clothes, and I heard all this laughter as they talked and tried
things on,'' he recalled. ``About three hours later, Roberta came
out flushed with meeting this great woman, and Meryl came out
walking and talking like Roberta. I think she downloaded Roberta.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Music of the Heart,'' Craven has made a film that
features _ and could be enjoyed by _ grade-schoolers. It deals with
overcoming adversity, aiming high, finding self-worth through hard
work and appreciating the arts.
</P>
<P>
   How will the legion of Craven's usual fans take it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown it to test audiences in the (horror) genre age,
and by and far they've loved it, although some say, `Please don't
stop doing horror movies,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   People in the industry took notice of the project long ago. The
fact that Craven was working on a non-genre movie already has had
an impact on the nature of some of the scripts and treatments that
hit his desk. ``It's changed some, and I think it will change even
more after the movie opens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It also seems to be changing the public's perception of Craven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been invited to the White House,'' he said. ``They're not
going to be thinking of me as the `slashmeister' after I have my
picture taken with Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Craven says even his mother will see ``Music of the Heart'' _
``and she hasn't watched (BEGIN ITAL)any(END ITAL) of my movies.''

INDONESIA'S NEW CABINET IS LONG ON DIVERSITY, SHORT ON EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Like a political conjuror, Indonesia's new
president produced a Cabinet on Tuesday that satisfied a dazzling
range of constituencies in this fractured country while lowering
the profile of the military and addressing the immediate need for
stability.
</P>
<P>
   In his most striking move, President Abdurrahman Wahid named a
civilian as defense minister and shifted command of the armed
forces from the politically aggressive and tainted army to the
navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think that the military are crazy,'' Wahid told
reporters. ``They are responsible. They know that the whole society
is changing now.''
</P>
<P>
   In what he called a ``national unity Cabinet,'' the president
mixed political affiliations but avoided any figures publicly
linked to the corrupt practices of the past. The Cabinet appeared
to reflect public demands for reform and, the president put new
emphasis on human rights by creating a special ministry on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some compromises,'' he said, relaxed and sometimes
joking as he presented his new government in a televised ceremony.
But he said he expected the public to find his new team ``very
satisfactory.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors and political analysts said they were not sure
if the new government lineup heralded the stability they have been
waiting for. They cited the mixmaster nature of the Cabinet, the
critical nature of Indonesia's political and economic problems and
the continuing questions about Wahid's health and leadership
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, there seemed to be agreement that Wahid's first
steps since taking office last Wednesday had been positive ones.
</P>
<P>
   Moving quickly on another sensitive issue, Wahid said that the
leader of newly independent East Timor, Jose Alexandre Gusmao,
would be welcome to visit Jakarta and that he would go to meet him
at the airport if he comes.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan formally notifying him that Indonesia accepts the results of
the territory's vote for independence on Aug. 30. The United
Nations is preparing to form an interim administration there.

YOUR FAVORITE MUSICIANS ... TALKING POLITICS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Talk about a lineup of musicians: Jane's
Addiction/Porno for Pyros frontman Perry Farrell, rap/thrash star
Ice-T, ex-X singer Exene Cervenka, Dead Kennedy Jello Biafra,
Spearhead/Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy spearhead Michael Franti.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, all these great musicians are gathering Thursday at Los
Angeles' El Rey Theatre. And they're going to ... talk?
</P>
<P>
   It's the Spitfire Tour, the brainchild of yet another musician,
Rage Against the Machine's lead singer Zack de la Rocha, who has
pursued a decidedly leftist political agenda every bit as ardently
as he has a musical career.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on de la Rocha to show up for this show, what with
the recent release of his band's third album. But his idea for this
tour _ musicians and other performers such as Andy Dick and Woody
Harrelson talking about political ideas _ isn't so far-fetched,
when you ponder the people involved, said tour organizer Sarah
Haynes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at most of these speakers, they would probably
consider themselves as activists before they would consider
themselves musicians,'' Haynes said. ``They just use music to speak
about the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour lineup changes from date to date, and the subject
matter and style of each performer's 15-minute presentation varies
wildly, Haynes said.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Harrelson, for instance, made a movie on environmental
issues, while Franti raps his entire speech about racism, Haynes
said. Biafra _ ever the provocateur _ talks about ``the non-violent
extermination of the rich,'' while Dick _ fresh off a
pharmaceutically addled series of run-ins with the law _ will speak
about ``drug abuse and life experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Other issues _ such as the Jubilee 2000 campaign for forgiveness
of Third World debt, medical use of marijuana, gay and lesbian
rights _ also are among performers' topics liable to come up in any
given show, Haynes said.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell DJs during each performance, and there are other musical
elements, though the show is not really musical in nature, Haynes
said. Also, count on activist groups setting up tables with their
literature and maybe even some protesters, if previous shows are
any indication.
</P>
<P>
   This year's tour has 20 dates scheduled, mostly in college towns
such as Springfield, Mo., and Clemson, S.C., and attendance so far
has been pretty good, Haynes said.
</P>
<P>
   But this lefty political tour wouldn't break even without
support from, yes, a corporation. The Web site Colleges.com is
sponsoring the tour and has created a special section devoted
entirely to the tour's topics (at www.colleges.com/spitfire),
Haynes said.
</P>
<P>
   There, you can find MP-3 audio tracks and text files of
speeches, videos of presentations, still photos, chat rooms with
the artists, a ``free speech forum'' to chew on the subjects and
more. Maybe they'll leave you spitting fire, too.
 &QL; 
What: Spitfire '99 with Perry Farrell, Ice-T, Andy Dick, Exene
Cervenka and Jello Biafra. Moderated by Michael Franti. &QL; 
Where: El Rey Theatre, 5515 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles. &QL; 
When: 8 p.m. Thursday. &QL; 
Tickets: $17.50 and $20. &QL;

AS BRADLEY AND GORE WOO THE LEFT, THE `L-WORD' MAKES A COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time in more than a decade, the fight
for the Democratic presidential nomination has triggered a fierce
competition for the loyalties of the party's once embattled liberal
wing.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for the struggle clearly has been former Sen. Bill
Bradley. Though known as a moderate-to-liberal lawmaker during his
three terms from New Jersey, Bradley as a presidential candidate
has consistently positioned himself to the left of his lone rival,
Vice President Al Gore, on a wide range of issues, from gay rights
to health care to child poverty to criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that these issues are being addressed and
they are front and center,'' said Robert Reich, a former labor
secretary in the Clinton administration who teaches at Brandeis
College. ``For a number of years now, there has been precious
little debate about what to do legislatively for the poor and
working poor. And quite small, incremental steps on health care.
The more vigorous the debate among Democrats, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that Bradley would try to differentiate
himself from Gore, also a relatively centrist politician, by
courting progressive voters, a large and active bloc in Democratic
primaries. But Bradley's position is unique in recent presidential
elections for two reasons: He has enough money to pose a viable
challenge to Gore through the entire primary schedule _ more than
$10 million in the bank _ and he has the party's left flank
virtually to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Sen. Edward Kennedy briefly challenged President
Carter in 1980 has an insurgent candidate on the left posed a
significant threat to the party's presumptive favorite, historians
and political analysts say. But while Kennedy's campaign folded
rather quickly, Bradley is widely thought to have the resources,
name-recognition and organization to remain a powerful liberal
alternative to Gore deep into next year's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley is clearly sounding liberal themes, clearly calling
for a different role for government, clearly addressing the kinds
of issues liberals care about,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, the editor
of a nonpartisan political newsletter. ``Yet he is a credible
alternative to the front-runner. We haven't seen that for many
years.''
</P>
<P>
   But a number of liberals who support Gore said they are deeply
skeptical about the depth of Bradley's progressive sentiments. ``I
personally am delighted that he has raised these issues,'' said
former Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York. ``But the truth is, if he had
been more liberal on the issues, it would have manifested himself
while he was in the Senate. It didn't. No one has accused him of
being more liberal than Clinton-Gore. So when did he become more
liberal? As a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, courting liberal voters is an outgrowth of his
political beliefs But to his advisers it was the only realistic
strategy he could employ, because Gore is so firmly entrenched in
the party's center.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican and Democratic strategists also see serious
risks in Bradley's strategy, arguing that if he wins the
nomination, or pushes Gore well to the left, the Democrats may
become vulnerable to Republican attacks as being out of the
mainstream. Indeed, the Republican Leadership Council, a centrist
group, has already begun running television advertisements in New
Hampshire portraying the two candidates as indistinguishable
tax-and-spend liberals.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the leading Republican candidate, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, has been so far ahead of the Republican field that
he has been able to avoid making direct appeals to his party's
right wing, focusing instead on moderate swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bradley is properly shifting himself to the left in a
Democratic primary,'' said Kieran Mahoney, a Republican strategist.
``But under the scrutiny of a general election, his ideas will
scare people.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of concerns that Bradley may be pulling the debate too far
left, Gore himself recently branded Bradley a ``left-of-center''
insurgent, calling his proposal to extend health insurance to
almost all Americans ``a throwback to an earlier generation of
policy analysis.'' The vice president, who will debate Bradley for
the first time on Wednesday night, asserts that Bradley's heath
care plan is so expensive that it would eat up most of the
non-Social Security federal surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley bristles at the label ``liberal,'' perhaps a reflection
of how it has become a political dirty word over the past two
decades. Instead, he often calls himself a progressive, and more
commonly insisting that he is simply proposing ``big solutions for
big problems.'' His aides also assert that Gore has tried to have
it both ways, sometimes attacking Bradley for supporting budget
cuts in the 1980s, at other times accusing him of being a big
spender.
</P>
<P>
   On one issue, global trade, both Democrats firmly support the
North American Free Trade Agreement, to the dismay of liberals. But
liberals say that on an array of other matters, Bradley has
consistently offered a blueprint for a more active, expansive and
expensive role for federal government than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He has called for government subsidies and tax breaks to help 95
percent of the country buy health insurance. He has vowed to cut
child poverty in half over the coming decade. He has said the
Justice Department should be more aggressive in investigating and
preventing racial profiling by law enforcement agencies. He has
proposed expanding the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect gays and
lesbians, and wants to allow gay people to serve openly in the
military. He has said he wants to repeal mandatory sentencing laws.
And he has proposed licensing all handgun owners, registering all
handguns and outlawing so-called Saturday Night Special handguns.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONALTRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley has done more than Gore in his health plan and poverty
speeches,'' said Robert Borosage, co-director of the Campaign for
America's Future, a progressive policy organization. ``Gore seems
intent on repeating the Clintonesque strategy that you can
substitute gestures for real programs and real investments.''
</P>
<P>
   None of Bradley's current positions seem to conflict
significantly with his record in the Senate, where he received
relatively high ratings from traditional liberal groups, including
labor unions, abortion-right supporters and environmental
organizations. But his proposals as a presidential candidate have
generally been bigger and bolder than his Senate positions. During
the 1993-1994 health care debate, for instance, Bradley barely
played a role.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For liberals, who have often felt shunted aside by the party
during the Clinton administration, the battle for the left has been
a delightful change. Just a few months ago, when Bradley did not
seem a viable threat, many political analysts thought the vice
president would be free to focus his efforts on wooing centrist
suburban voters by talking about issues like preventing sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the two men have been wrestling for the support of just
about every left-leaning Democratic group, including labor unions,
abortion rights activists, environmentalists, blacks and Upper West
Side Manhattan political clubs. Though Gore has won a few key
endorsements, including one from the AFL-CIO, Bradley has battled
him to a draw with most of the others.
</P>
<P>
   And their struggle has triggered a sort of one-upmanship on
progressive issues. When Bradley was preparing to give a major
speech on child poverty last week, Gore hastily released his own
poverty plan the day before. Both have been courting prominent
black leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who remains
uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another black leader, the Rev. Al Sharpton, who is popular among
blacks but reviled by many mainstream Democrats, said he received a
call from Gore's campaign manager, Donna Brazile, a few weeks after
Bradley had spoken before Sharpton's Harlem organization. She
warned him to think twice about endorsing Bradley and urged him to
meet with the vice president, Sharpton said. He remains
uncommitted, but says he likes Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates met last week privately with the
Congressional Progressive Caucus, most of whose 50 members remain
uncommitted. The group sharply questioned both about their views,
but was wonderfully flattered by the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of these guys would be part of the Progressive Caucus
if they were still in the Senate,'' said the caucus chairman, Rep.
Peter A. DeFazio, D-Ore. ``But what is important is both are
talking about issues like health care that matter to
progressives.''

FRIARS CLUB STILL KICKING _ AND KICKING JERRY STILLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: fact box below)  
Our rating:   3 stars  
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Friars Club was a gangbusters idea whose time
has seemingly long departed. For those who haven't been to the
Friars Club in Beverly Hills, let's just say it didn't capitalize
enough on the release of ``Swingers'' a few years back. Think the
Dresden Room in Los Feliz, where you can sit in plush white art
deco booths and chew on rubbery shrimp scampi while lounge acts
from the Mesozoic era warble tunes you never knew you never wanted
to hear again.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that separates the Friars Club from the Dresden
is its steep monthly membership fee and the titillating promise of
seeing Red Buttons in the flesh gnawing on some gristly steak. The
Friars Club is the living embodiment of the word ``swanky,'' which
hasn't been in common usage for _ jeez, help me out here, how many
decades?
</P>
<P>
   What keeps it alive is its history _ the fact that it once
numbered among its members the likes of Irving Berlin, George M.
Cohan and the entire Rat Pack. That blessing is also its curse _
most comics today have disavowed the sense of grandiose entitlement
that defined the original Friars Club, although some wallow in its
sense of recherche reverence. In other words, it's so uncool, it's
cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let Me In: I Hear the Laughter,'' which premiered Tuesday on
Cinemax and will be repeated in November, is a by-the-numbers
documentary of this Boys Club to end all Boys Clubs. We get the
history of the organization, established nearly a century back as a
private watering hole for entertainment's elite. The film dutifully
dispenses all the dish any good show-biz fan has heard before.
</P>
<P>
   There's Parkyerkarkus' (Albert Brooks' father, Harry Einstein)
fatal heart attack seconds after a killer performance at a fete for
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the corrupt card-playing scandal of
the '60s, Gloria Allred's quest to become the first full-time
female member, and Ted Danson's blackface misadventure at Whoopi
Goldberg's roast.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous luminaries (Milton Berle, Buddy Hackett, et al.) make
it clear that the comics who make up the club's creme de la creme
do their best and naughtiest work in these hermetically sealed
surroundings, though the few clips director Dean Ward has unearthed
suggest more often than not a you-hadda-have-been-there quality.
</P>
<P>
   One gets a better sense of the camaraderie/competition in the
inelegantly titled ``Comedy Central Presents The New York Friars
Club Roast of Jerry Stiller,'' which airs Wednesday night. There,
love in the guise of hostility (or is it hostility in the guise of
love?) _ and the bald-faced begging of comics for work, and
criticism of others' work _ comes to the fore as the assemblage
``honors'' the man best-known today as George Costanza's dad, and
currently seen as Kevin James' father-in-law on ``The King of
Queens.''
</P>
<P>
   George himself, Jason Alexander, emcees the proceedings, losing
points with a belabored song in a ``tribute'' to Stiller, but
gaining them back with some choice digs, including one at his
former boss _ that other Jerry _ and his propensity for dating
``teen-agers and newlyweds.'' Old-school comics work too hard to be
naughty, while fresher talents such as Suzy Essman and Jeffrey Ross
(who is mocked for embracing the Friars' ideal and who hilariously
slags fellow-member Janeane Garofalo's movie career) suggest that
the caustic art of the roast could survive into the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   One comic observes that Stiller's son Ben (who delivers a fond,
touching monologue) is the arbiter of hip, while Jerry just had his
replaced _ ba-dum-bump, a rimshot a lot of the gags cry out for.
Most impressively, the congregated comics seem to have rendered
Stiller _ a staggeringly loquacious fellow (I interviewed him once,
and don't recall having to ask more than three questions the entire
time) _ almost utterly mute.
</P>
<P>
   One imagines that in his documentary, Ward could've dug a little
deeper in terms of divining the psyche of the club's most esteemed
members _ comics, as any comic will tell you, are a most neurotic,
passive-aggressive bunch, living and dying by each reception to
every performance. ``Seinfeld'' creator Larry David's recent HBO
special showed that in a sublime moment in which David's manager
and wife squabbled over the effectiveness of the comic's most dirty
jokes. Instead, Ward is satisfied to leave viewers with that
hackneyed illusion that all of show biz is a mutual admiration
society.
</P>
<P>
   The film's biggest drawback is that Ward scarcely hints at what
the Friars Club has become today _ a retro-tacky, pseudo-posh
restaurant that feels fairly musty, particularly that besmirched
card-playing room, which nowadays boasts all the glamour and
redolence of a slightly tony rest home with an ever-present cash
bar. &QL;

POPE WRITES A LETTER TO HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS, THE ELDERLY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Pope John Paul II has described his own intimations of
mortality in an unusually personal letter addressed to ``my elderly
brothers and sisters,'' which was released Tuesday by the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this letter I wish simply to express my spiritual closeness
to you as someone who, with the passing of years, has come to a
deeper personal understanding of this phase of life,'' the
79-year-old pope wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic leader, an indefatigable writer of
encyclicals, pastoral letters and books, also writes frequent
letters to members of his flock, from artists to rebellious German
bishops.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy See has addressed the issue of old people before. Last
year, the Vatican published a document entitled ``The Dignity of
Older People and Their Mission in the Church and in the World,''
but that address was drier and more horatory. Then, the Vatican
used the word ``we'' to refer to younger people, while describing
the elderly as ``they,'' as in ``they are persons who become locked
into themselves and self-marginalized.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in Tuesday's letter the frail pope, who suffers
from a series of ailments, including the symptoms of Parkinson's
disease, used the term ``we'' when discussing the elderly. He made
frequent mention of his own feelings, which he said he shares with
most other older people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is natural that, as the years pass, we should increasingly
consider our `twilight,''' he wrote. ``If nothing else, we are
reminded of it by the very fact that the ranks of our family
members, friends and acquaintances grow ever thinner.'' He noted
that ``the line separating life and death runs through our
communities and moves inexorably nearer to each of us,'' adding,
``Even we elderly people find it hard to resign ourselves to the
prospect of making this passage.''
</P>
<P>
   But he explained that while he enjoys life, his faith allows him
to contemplate his own death without fear. ``I find great peace,''
he said, ``in thinking of the time when the Lord will call me: from
life to life!''
</P>
<P>
   The pope reflected on some of the most momentous events of his
generation, citing World War II and the Nazi death camps, ``which
truly remain the Golgothas of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   He also referred to the Cold War, totalitarian governments and
``the insane arms race,'' as among the darker episodes. As
achievements, he cited human rights, ecological awareness and ``an
increasing recognition of the dignity of women.''
</P>
<P>
   He condemned the practice of euthanasia as ``an intrinsically
evil act'' but reminded his readers that church law allows the
rejection of ``aggressive medical treatment'' for the terminally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   The pope did not refer directly to his own physical sufferings,
but addressed the issue in the first person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear elderly friends who feel insecure because of ill health
or other circumstances, I assure you of my closeness and
affection,'' he said. ``When God permits us to suffer because of
illness, loneliness or other reasons associated with old age, He
always gives us the grace and strength to unite ourselves with
greater love to the sacrifice of His Son and to share ever more
fully in His plan for salvation.''

THE PHILOSOPHER AND THE WARRIOR OF SUFFRAGE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.H., Mass.)   (af)  
 By SUZANNE MACNEILLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ken Burns usually prides himself on the wide scope of his
historical knowledge. But it wasn't long ago that the director of
``The Civil War'' made a humbling discovery: He knew next to
nothing about Elizabeth Cady Stanton and only slightly more about
Susan B. Anthony, the two 19th-century women who campaigned longest
and hardest for a constitutional amendment that would give women
the right to vote. He now regards them as, hands down, ``the two
most important women in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years of working on his new two-part documentary,
``Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and
Susan B. Anthony,'' which has its premiere next Sunday and Monday
nights on PBS, Burns's interest in women's rights, far from
quenched, has become a full-fledged passion.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from his office in southwestern New
Hampshire, he explained why. As the father of two teen-age
daughters, he's more than a little unnerved by what he sees as the
recent ``wholesale abandonment'' of the women's movement. This, he
believes, has something to do with the ``unconscionable idea'' that
active involvement in women's rights is ``unsexy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living,'' he said, ``in the age of Victoria's Secret.''
</P>
<P>
   As a history buff, he is outraged that what he calls ``the
largest social movement in the United States, affecting half the
country's population'' is relegated to no more than a few
paragraphs in most history textbooks. Why? Because, whether we
admit or not, ``there is aive belief that if women did it,
it's lesser.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns's introduction to Stanton and Anthony began 10 years ago
when Paul Barnes, the co-producer of the documentary, borrowed a
biography of Stanton from a friend. Barnes was as astounded as
Burns that he had barely heard of this outspoken woman from upstate
New York, who, with her houseful of children, headful of curls and
deep appreciation of the accouterments of her upper-middle-class
life, was the unlikely philosopher behind the 19th-century women's
movement.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1850s, she teamed up with Anthony, who was, Burns
said, ``the arms and legs of the movement,'' tirelessly
disseminating the eloquent rhetoric that sprang from Stanton's pen.
(``I forged the fireworks,'' wrote Stanton, ``and she fired
them.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``We were editing `Civil War,' and every day at lunch, Paul
would regale us with stories from the Stanton biography,'' said
Burns. ``I was humiliated. I knew nothing.'' It wasn't long before
they decided to make a documentary on Stanton and Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers familiar with Burns's work won't be surprised that ``Not
for Ourselves Alone'' relies on his usual mix of historic
photographs, authentic locations, dramatic voice-overs and a panel
of informed, impassioned commentators. Julie Harris is the
determined voice of Susan B. Anthony and Ronnie Gilbert is the
ebullient Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Sally Kellerman narrates.
</P>
<P>
   The talking heads are an all-female group of historians and
biographers. Try as they did, Burns's team couldn't come up with a
single male historian who knew the nuts and bolts of the movement.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning and end of the documentary, Burns uses some
familiar images from the suffrage movement: black-and-white news
clips of sign-carrying women in early-20th-century attire marching
up and down city streets. These images, said Burns, are merely the
brackets around a story that began 70 years before. It is a story
of loyalty and betrayal, of partial victories and profound
setbacks, of a 50-year friendship between two women who couldn't
have been more different.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a better writer, she the better critic,'' Stanton wrote.
``She supplied the facts and statistics, I the philosophy. And
together we have supplied arguments that have stood unshaken.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, unmarried, the picture of sobriety (just take a look at
the $1 coin that bears her likeness), was the product of a strict
Quaker upbringing that proved to be ideal training for her role as
political strategist. She was the traveling lecturer, the collector
of signatures, the born reformer who ``had to find a spark, and
that spark was Stanton,'' Burns said. Stanton, on the other hand,
``was the bomb thrower who needed Anthony's pragmatism to sell her
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though not always in agreement, the two women built an alliance
that helped women gain the right to keep their earnings, attend
colleges and even, in some states, serve as jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they would have accomplished so much if they
hadn't been so different,'' said Burns. ``That's what makes the
story so good.''
</P>
<P>
   But the passage of a constitutional amendment supporting the
rights of women to vote _ their holy grail _ eluded them, coming as
it did some time after their deaths. (Stanton died in 1902 at the
age of 86. Anthony died four years later; she was also 86.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the mother of seven children, Stanton was often unable to
leave home to spread her own message. Later, poor health and a
desire not to have to hold her tongue (``for fear of offending
someone,'' she once said) kept her off the lecture route. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the people she occasionally alienated was Anthony, who was
unwilling to wholeheartedly support Stanton's more controversial
ideas on divorce and women's role in the Bible. In Anthony's eyes,
those issues were distractions from the immediate cause: getting
women the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony's single-minded pursuit of the vote doesn't always rest
well with Burns. In the 1890s, when local chapters of the women's
suffrage organization she helped found decided to exclude black
women from the movement, Anthony _ who had fought hard against
slavery _ looked the other way. She reasoned that the race issue
was, in this instance, just another distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know in our hearts that our country's fault line has always
been race,'' said Burns, noting that the early women's rights
movement and the fight against slavery were as inextricably
connected as the civil rights and women's liberation movements were
in the 1960s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, women's suffrage grew out of the abolition campaign. It
was in 1840, at an antislavery convention in London, that Stanton
first became acutely aware of the depths of the male-female divide.
Stanton and the other women in attendance were segregated behind a
screen and denied the right to speak.
</P>
<P>
   She sat fuming next to the equally outraged Lucretia Mott, with
whom, eight years later, she organized the first women's rights
convention in Seneca Falls, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1860s, Stanton came to a bitter disagreement with
Frederick Douglass, the former slave and abolitionist who had
backed Stanton's call for women's rights in Seneca Falls. But with
the passage of the 15th Amendment _ which guaranteed the vote only
to black men _ Stanton, hurt and angry that Douglass had supported
the exclusion of women from the amendment, lashed out with some
shockingly racist remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Burns was as troubled by Stanton's intemperate words as he was
by Anthony's agreement to exclude black women, but he wasn't about
to leave the controversy out of his film. This, he said, is
``history running on all cylinders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want propaganda,'' he explained. ``I wanted a
clear-eyed story.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is a story that he hopes will eventually make its way into
the mainstream, noting that General Motors, the underwriter of the
program, plans to distribute educational materials to more than
25,000 high schools.
</P>
<P>
   He has also heard that women's groups around the country are
organizing viewing parties. He plans to attend one himself in
Boston. And he's planning to take his daughters with him.

SIDES REMAIN AT ODDS OVER ACROSS-THE-BOARD SPENDING PROPOSAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House outlined as ``devastating'' the
impact of a Republican plan to reduce federal agencies' budgets by
1.4 percent while GOP leaders Tuesday contended every agency should
be able to find a wasteful penny in savings for every dollar spent.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and the Republican majority in Congress
remained at loggerheads _ and Republicans remained at odds among
themselves _ as the budgetary clock continued to tick into the 2000
fiscal year. The impasse stems from an effort by all sides to avoid
spending the Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans this week will consider their plan to reduce
agency budgets by an across-the-board 1.4 percent, a move Clinton
already has pledged to veto. The Senate GOP has balked at any
reduction above 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking the federal agencies to find one penny out of
every dollar that they spend. And I don't think that's asking too
much. One little Abraham Lincoln copper penny is what we are asking
them to find,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the
Republican Conference, rounding off the House number.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by Democratic criticism, Republicans did agree to trim the
3.4 percent pay raise Congress voted for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a sign of how serious we are, we will ask more of ourselves
than we are asking of any government employees,'' House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said in a statement. ``While we ask
every government agency to root out waste from its budget, members
of Congress will not only root out an equal percentage of waste
from Congress' budget, but we will also cut our own pay.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House, defending Clinton's spending priorities,
said Republicans wanted to spend money for pork barrel projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've put together a budget that is full of pork; boats that
the Pentagon didn't request, planes the Pentagon didn't request,
other kinds of pork projects that are in this budget,'' said John
Podesta, the president's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta referred to a Navy ``mini-carrier'' that Senate Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., wants built in his home town and to the
purchase of five F-15 fighter jets, projects that together cost
more than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we start cutting Meals on Wheels, and veterans, and
education, et cetera, they ought to go back and take a look at the
things they've already put into the budget that have fattened this
thing up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House brought out the military chief, Cabinet
secretaries and other key officials to try to fend off the
Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told
a Senate hearing that the Republican plan ``would strip away the
gains that we have made or what we've just done to start readiness
moving back in the right direction. In other words, Mr. Chairman,
if applied to this program, it would be devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the military would have to
cut 39,000 to 70,000 military personnel, depending on their ranks
and pay levels. He said the 1.4 percent Republican proposal
actually would translate into 2.8 percent because the reductions
likely would not take place until six months into the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley, Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt and Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder echoed a similar
theme.
</P>
<P>
   They said the Republican plan would mean an end to Clinton's
plan to reduce classroom size to under 18 students by hiring
100,000 new teachers, and also his plans to bolster environmental
protection and to hire 50,000 new police officers. Holder said the
FBI would not be able to fill 520 positions for agents and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service would have to reduce Border
Patrol agents by 562 positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a disaster of a budget,'' Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   But House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, pointed to the
Pentagon as a source of wasteful spending. He accused the Pentagon
of misplacing two $850,000 tugboats, a $1 million missile launcher
and two $4 million aircraft engines. He said a defense contractor
also charged the Pentagon $714 for an electric bell worth $46.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you lose a tugboat. They are the size of a
house. But the government has managed to lose two of them,'' DeLay
said. ``Across the board, at least 1.4 percent of government
spending is prone to waste, fraud and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the Pentagon's estimate of layoffs as ``an
outrageous claim.'' He said Republicans ``are delivering on our
party's promise to balance the budget without raising taxes or
raiding the Social Security surpluses.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called DeLay's remarks
``offensive'' and suggested the American people would listen to
Gen. Shelton on military matters, not DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the president met for the first time with the
congressional leadership and both sides agreed they should make a
breakthrough by Tuesday, a day that passed with the two sides
swapping accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, trying to press Congress on Social Security reform in
addition to setting aside the surplus, formally sent to Capitol
Hill his reform proposal. His plan calls for devoting the entire
Social Security surplus to paying down the national debt until 2010
and then using the savings from a reduced interest rate (a
by-product of a reduced debt) along with future surpluses to extend
the life of Social Security until 2050.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 fiscal year began Oct. 1 but Congress and Clinton have
enacted two stopgap spending measures. A third temporary spending
bill likely will be necessary because funding for government
operations expires Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart indicated Clinton will continue to sign stopgap
spending measures to keep government operating but would
increasingly ask Congress to take action on other pending issues,
such as gun control, if it was going to stay in session.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has yet to pass the largest of the 13 appropriations
bills, the $300 billion-plus bill for the departments of labor,
health and human services and education. Clinton also has vetoed
three spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue to try to work with them
(Republicans),'' Lockhart said. ``But at some point, Republicans
have to take responsibility; they are the majority party, and they
need to get their work done.''

 &HT;    Bradley's wife his subtle strength in campaign
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having skillfully summarized her husband's positions
on China and gender politics, Ernestine Schlant seemed stumped by a
much simpler question Tuesday from a student at Spelman College.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would your platform be if you are elected first lady?''
the student asked Schlant, the wife of Democratic presidential
hopeful Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Schlant, who taught French at Spelman in the early 1960s while
she was a graduate student at Emory University, paused a moment
over what should have been a predictable query.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer it at this point,'' she said from behind the
lectern. ``I'm sure if we should get there _ and you know people
say, 'Don't say if, say when,' _ I will have no dearth of
activities that I could pick. But as you know, right now I have
always been a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   As her husband travels the country to campaign for president,
Schlant, 64, now finds herself negotiating new terrain, the
peculiar role in American politics known as the political spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Having been married to a man who spent 18 years in the Senate,
Schlant is of course no stranger to politics. But theirs was always
a different marriage.
</P>
<P>
   She pursued her career in writing and teaching, while he pursued
his career, first on the basketball court and then in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After Bradley's election in 1978, Schlant remained in New Jersey
to raise the couple's daughter, Theresa Anne. When Theresa Anne
moved to Washington at the age of 10 to live with Bradley, and
attend private school, Schlant kept her teaching job in New Jersey
and commuted to Washington over the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Senate wives, it was kind of unusual,'' said Colleen Nunn,
wife of former Georgia senator Sam Nunn. ``He would look after the
daughter and she continued with her career. Everyone admired the
way she managed her family and career.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley, 56, wins the White House, Schlant would come into
the job of first lady with a long list of academic honors and an
unusual resume. Born in Germany, she would be only the second
foreign-born first lady after Louisa Adams, wife of John Quincy
Adams, the sixth U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   An author and college professor, Schlant would also become the
second first lady after Hillary Rodham Clinton who came of age
during the 1960s, part of a generation of professional women whose
careers put them on equal footing with their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton, however, whose career as a power lawyer in
Arkansas seemed to complement her husband's political ambitions,
Schlant has never sought to intrude into her husband's domain. Her
passion is literature, and her realm has been Montclair State
University in Upper Montclair, N.J., where she teaches German and
comparative literature.
</P>
<P>
   The couple met through Schlant's work. In 1970, Schlant was
working on a film project involving the poet Marianne Moore and her
love of sports. Someone suggested she interview Bradley, the brainy
New York Knick star.
</P>
<P>
   Schlant never finished the project, but Bradley was besotted.
They married in 1974 during the NBA all-star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always had these two very involved careers,'' she
said. ``Part of our being together has always been being apart. So
far, it has worked very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now amid the presidential campaign, Schlant still devotes
part of her time to her husband and part to promoting her new book,
``The Language of Silence: West German Literature and the
Holocaust,'' which argues that German writers have been unable to
come to terms with the atrocities of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   While she was in Atlanta Tuesday, Schlant breakfasted with a
dozen woman on behalf of her husband, and then appeared at
Atlanta's Goethe-Institut to talk about her book, the fifth that
she has either written, edited or translated. She speaks five
languages, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Emory. Schlant, who
also holds a Ph.D. from Emory in comparative literature, hadn't
returned to Atlanta since the 1988 Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she still has fond and vivid memories of the city.
For the Spelman students, she recalled that she had been on campus
at the college library watching the unfolding drama of President
Kennedy's assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Schlant's influence on her husband is subtle. Unlike Hillary
Clinton, Schlant doesn't have a passion for public policy, although
she has campaigned on behalf of breast cancer research. (She was
diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992, but combated the disease with
early treatment.)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to students at Spelman, Schlant summarized the goals of
her husband's campaign _ improving race relations, providing
affordable health care and ending child poverty _ but begged off
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Anthony, author of ``First Ladies: The Saga of the
Presidents' Wives and their Power, 1789 to 1990,'' says it's wrong
to assume that first ladies don't influence an administration
simply because they don't do policy. Nancy Reagan, Anthony notes,
wasn't active in policy until she launched her anti-drug campaign,
but she was protective of her husband and wielded tremendous power
over his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Schlant said she keeps a careful eye on her husband's wardrobe,
but said her greatest contribution to Bradley is simply to provide
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I giving him ra, ra, ra?'' she said. ``No. I think I'm
giving him strength and support and criticism some times. But this
is then a bond, so that when he goes out into public life, he knows
that I am completely with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, Schlant disarms visitors with her warmth. She
gestures freely with her hands. Even her face muscles move
animatedly as she speaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She smiles with her whole face,'' noted Anna Ponder, a staff
assistant who introduced Schlant to Spelman students. ``The most
remarkable thing about her is her complete lack of pretense. She is
exactly as she appears.''

ALICE COOPER GROUP'S REQUIEM FOR A ROCK CASUALTY  
 (ADV: PHOTO HAS BEEN MOVED TO NYTNS CLIENTS)
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY RODGERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Glen Buxton never really had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Once the wisecracking loner from Phoenix's Cortez High School
was thrust into the no-holds-barred world of rock-and-roll stardom,
his fate was sealed.
</P>
<P>
   A founding member of the Alice Cooper group, Buxton was cursed
with a double whammy: a penchant for alcohol, cigarettes and
switchblades as well as a disdain for authority figures _ including
the doctors who struggled to keep him alive.
</P>
<P>
   But he was blessed with a magnetic personality and musical
talent that helped produce rock classics such as ``I'm Eighteen,''
``Under My Wheels,'' ``No More Mister Nice Guy ``and ``Billion
Dollar Babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Half a lifetime after he fired off some of rock's most memorable
guitar riffs _ including the opening to ``School's Out,'' which now
graces his tombstone _ Buxton's battered body wore out.
</P>
<P>
   Pneumonia was the official cause of death, but those close to
Buxton agree that the satin-clad guitar hero who once played to
stadiums of 60,000 fans had been felled by the demons of drink and
drugs, along with a stubborn streak that made him ignore his
doctors' warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after his death in relative obscurity in Iowa, those
who performed with and loved Buxton gathered in Phoenix to pay
tribute in words and music to the man whom Cooper calls ``our main
musical force.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was not a certainty until show time, Cooper joined
the three other surviving band members _ guitarist Michael Bruce,
bassist Dennis Dunaway and drummer Neal Smith _ at his Alice
Cooper'stown restaurant/nightclub recently to perform six hits in
Buxton's memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be no Alice Cooper without Glen,'' Cooper said in
a recent phone interview from Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came to the music, we'd look at Glen and say, `Glen,
what do we do here?' ... I think that people didn't realize that
about him _ he was our main musical force in the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The beginning was at Cortez High in northwest Phoenix in the
mid-1960s. Buxton, Dunaway and Cooper, then known as Vincent
Furnier, met through the school newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen was in photography class and I was in the journalism
class,'' recalls Dunaway, who now sells antiques in Connecticut.
``As the sports editor ... when I'd do a story, I'd call on Glen to
go take the picture for the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   When the future Alice and Dunaway decided to do a Beatles spoof
for a talent show, they turned to Buxton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen was the only person we knew who played guitar,'' Dunaway
recalls. ``Since none of us played any instruments, we asked him if
he would play guitar while we mimed and pretended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the audience thought it was a joke _ ha ha _ but
we were thinking, `Wow, this is great. Let's do it some more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And did these guys ever do it some more _ and more and more.
</P>
<P>
   With Buxton helping Dunaway and later addition Bruce with their
musical chops _ first as the Earwigs, then the Spiders and the Nazz
_ the group honed its cutting-edge act at local clubs such as the
V.I.P., the Dunes and the Beau Brummell.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those bars were a bit on the rough side, recalls Smith,
a Camelback High graduate who joined up in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen and I used to get in fights in Arizona all the time,'' he
says. ``They just thought we were two long-haired hippies. But they
didn't realize we were two punks from Akron.''
</P>
<P>
   Buxton was born in Ohio but spent his teenage years in Arizona.
His parents still live in Glendale and his sister, Janice Davison,
is a teacher in Bullhead City.
</P>
<P>
   Davison recalls her brother as a ``normal rebellious teenage kid
_ didn't want to mow the lawn and do the chores.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't that interested in school. He didn't like to study,
didn't like the authority. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``He got glasses freshman year and just hated them. After the
band started playing, he would never wear them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his mother nagged him to attend Glendale Community
College, Buxton's parents were supportive of his musical career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a close family,'' says Davison, adding that she and her
parents saw Alice Cooper perform several times.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how her family reacted to the staged hangings and
beheadings of Cooper, the hatchet attacks on dolls and other
shock-rock mayhem that brought the band notoriety, Davison replies,
``We all just laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   However, life was hardly a laugh for Buxton after the Alice
Cooper group gained national popularity in the early '70s, with the
albums ``Love It to Death,'' ``Killer'' and the monster hit
``School's Out.''
</P>
<P>
   The success brought money and adoring females, but it also
brought pressure to continue recording and performing to fuel a
machine that included a private jet, an expensive stage set and a
growing entourage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were either touring or recording or writing all the time,
every single day from 1967, when I joined the band, till when the
band stopped playing in '74 and '75,'' drummer Smith recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The constant travel and pursuit by rabid fans was a thrill
initially but a burden later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an assault on your ability to keep your wits about you,''
bassist Dunaway says.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of pressure, the band members turned to alcohol
and d varying degrees to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the party that never ended,'' Smith says. ``We weren't
really sleeping as much as passing out and getting up and doing it
all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Buxton, who had developed a fondness for alcohol in high school,
carried the partying to extremes as the group stormed through tours
such as ``Billion Dollar Babies'' (``Seventy cities in ninety
days,'' guitarist Bruce sighs).
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said Glen made (Rolling Stone) Keith Richards look
like a Boy Scout,'' Smith says. ``Glen just partied hard all the
time ... and I guess he became more of a rock and roll casualty
than anybody else in the group.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain why Buxton pushed himself to the point of
abuse, Cooper _ who successfully underwent alcohol rehabilitation
17 years ago _ replies, ``Glen and I were drinking buddies. I spent
more time drinking than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I became an alcoholic, let alone I couldn't
tell you why Glen drank so much. ... It was just something that
happened when you spent that much time on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was a personality flaw or anything, because
Glen never missed a show. ... And none of us _ we never missed a
show because of abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the relative sanity of the recording studio, Buxton's
eclectic guitar work was a key ingredient of the Cooper band's
sound _ an eerie mix of hard rock, twisted ballads and larger
productions such as ``Elected,'' ``Gutter Cats vs. The Jets'' and
``Muscle of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen was not a songwriter,'' Cooper says. ``He would write
riffs, though. ... They would show up on the album and even great
guitar players would say, `What is that line? It's so weird, but
it's catchy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike (Bruce) was much more into chord structure. So, Glen was
always sort of our icing on the cake. ... When everything was done,
we'd bring Glen in to put on the little details and oddities.''
</P>
<P>
   In Smith's view, the breakthrough ``School's Out'' ``was Glen's
album _ he played all the lead guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Cooper and the others sought a broader sound in the next
two discs, Buxton seemed to resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the problems that Glen was having with the demons
of rock and roll at that particular time _ really, ``Billion Dollar
Babies'' and ``Muscle of Love,'' Glen didn't really play on the
(latter) album _ by hook or by crook, the albums had to be put
out,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the band brought in other guitarists to fill the
gaps and augment its sound, including Camelback High School alumnus
Mick Mashbir, who also toured with the group in its later days.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters at this point, Buxton was hospitalized for
two weeks with pancreatitis and was told to clean up his act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor told him, `I opened up your stomach and I was
thoroughly disgusted!' '' Davison recalls with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the hospital, and we sent tapes out to him so we
could learn the (``Billion Dollar Babies'') material,'' Bruce says.
``When he came back, he hadn't spent any time learning the
material. At that point, we brought in Mick Mashbir and
(keyboardist) Bob Dolin.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, Glen never seemed to catch up _ a day late and a
dollar short, sort of.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk with the former members of this close-knit band (band
members lived under the same roof in locales from California to
Detroit to Connecticut throughout their run at the top of the
charts) and you'll hear differing versions of their breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper says there was disagreement over how much money to sink
back into the stage show. Smith says the members simply took a year
off for solo projects and never reunited.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bruce says a confrontation with Buxton over his
substance abuse _ which included one incident in which Buxton
pulled his ever-present switchblade on the group's tour manager,
according to Bruce _ may have sown the seeds of the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neal and Alice and I went over to Glen's house and said,
`Listen, you need to get help ... we're gonna put you on a
temporary leave with pay,' '' Bruce recalls. ``He (Buxton) goes,
`No, I'm not gonna do it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we said, `OK, we're doing solo projects.' ... When it
came time to get back together, Alice didn't want to because of the
situation with Glen.''
</P>
<P>
   When the band's end officially came, in 1975, Buxton was living
in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   He chose not to record a solo project, instead spending his time
buying antiques and going to yard sales, his sister says.
</P>
<P>
   Left on his own to handle his finances, Buxton got into money
trouble. When he failed to pay taxes on proceeds from a mutual fund
set up and later sold by the band, the IRS came calling. By 1979,
``he had lost his house,'' Davison says. ``Then he went to an
apartment in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   He played in a band called Shrapnel and frequented punk hot spot
CBGB's. Later, Davison says, ``he lived with friends (in New York).
The money was going.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents talked Buxton into moving back to the Valley, and he
lived at their house in the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, according to Davison, Buxton had ``a guitar _
that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davison hooked her brother up with an old high-school pal and
they formed Virgin, which took Buxton full circle _ back to playing
radio hits, as well as some of his songs, in local bars such as the
Mason Jar.
</P>
<P>
   He also had his first day job in years, soldering transistors
for Goodyear Aerospace for five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   To his good fortune, a rock memorabilia dealer found him with
the help of Bruce, who remains a working musician. The dealer, John
Stevenson, saw the tough time Buxton was having and invited him to
move to an Iowa farm.
</P>
<P>
   Buxton worked in a factory near Clarion, but more important, he
met a woman, Lorrie Miller, who ``was great,'' Davison says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I though she was perfect _ a geriatric nurse who could take
care of Glen!'' Davison chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Buxton also was suffering from a bleeding ulcer
and liver problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't go to the doctor when he should,'' Davison
recalls. ``He hated doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Buxton enjoyed a taste of his glory days when he reunited with
Smith and Dunaway for some Houston appearances in the fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After he returned from Houston, Buxton, 49, remarked to his
sister that he had a pain in his side, possibly from lifting
luggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna have to go to the bone crusher,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, trouble arose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt clammy, his pulse was ... not steady,'' Davison says.
``She (Miller) called the ambulance and they went to the closest
hospital. He perked up and was joking with the nurses, being Glen,
being funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Well, I'm kind of tired. I think I'll rest for a
minute.' He looked at her, said, `I love you,' and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buxton never woke from his slumber. An autopsy found viral
pneumonia as the cause of his death on Oct. 19, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But those close to him agree that life in rock and roll's fast
lane, mixed with a stubborn streak, sped his demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a way of me saying, `Glen, you gotta slow
down,' because that was like me talking to the wall,'' Cooper says.
``He would look at me and just laugh and say, `Right.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That was him, and nobody could change him. He was Glen, and
that's why we loved him.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Equant deals with Nintendo, Korean firm latest in a series
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Equant has capped off a busy month with a string of
deals aimed at improving its grip on the high-tech pipes that carry
international data.
</P>
<P>
   The company, registered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, but based in
Atlanta, today is to announce an agreement with JC Hyun Systems of
South Korea, one day after unveiling a deal with Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   Hyun Systems will use Equant's network mainly for Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   Equant on Tuesday announced that its global system will provide
services to Nintendo, the world's largest computer game
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see demonstrates the breadth of our offering and
demand for our offerings around the world,'' said spokesman Marty
Filipowski. ``This is an Atlanta-based company that is helping to
drive the international data revolution, providing high-speed data
services to multinational businesses around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, Equant has announced partners that
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Merck, one of the largest European pharmaceuticals companies,
which signed a four-year contract to let Equant connect its German
headquarters to company sites around the world.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft, which contracted to use Equant to carry data to and
from offices in the United Kingdom, South Africa and the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   _ GE Compunet, which signed an $11 million pact to use Equant
for high-speed transport from its German offices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sonera Corp. of Finland, which agreed to a four-year deal in
which Equant will carry data in Finland, Sweden, Russia and the
Baltics.
</P>
<P>
   Equant this month was also named ``Best New Carrier'' at the
World Communication Awards in Geneva. Among also-rans was UUnet,
the MCI WorldCom unit.
</P>
<P>
   Equant has about 500 employees in Atlanta, including President
and Chief Executive Didier Delepine.
</P>
<P>
   The company's network services unit, based in Atlanta, accounts
for about 80 percent of Equant revenue and has operations in 220
countries. Equant's total revenue for 1998 was $723.7 million. For
the first half of 1999, reported revenue totaled $444.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company's origins date to 1949, when a predecessor company
was formed by airline companies to provide communications and data
processing services.
</P>
<P>
   The company's name was changed to Equant Network Services in
1997. A public offering of stock came last year.

GORE, BRADLEY TO JOIN FOR TOWN MEETING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ They are alike in many ways: moderates in
their party, experts in policy arcana, brainy men who often
struggle to inspire when they rise to speak. But Wednesday night,
in their own version of a World Series, Al Gore and Bill Bradley
will use a precious hour of national television airtime to present
themselves as very different types of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In what many New Hampshirites view as an opening of the
presidential campaign, the two Democrats _ followed Thursday by all
the Republican candidates except George W. Bush _ are joining in a
town meeting on the campus of Dartmouth College. Wednesday night's
event comes as the two Democrats are locked in a statistical tie in
numerous polls in New Hampshire, which historically has an outsized
impact on the national race.
</P>
<P>
   But for many New Hampshire voters, the Democratic race is
between a vaguely known vice president and a former senator still
known largely for his basketball days with the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get the sense that voters are really able to
distinguish between the two yet, on things like education and
social policy,'' said Dean Spiliotes, professor of government at
Dartmouth College. ``Because there are just two of them, there is a
lot more opportunity for clash and conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates are aiming to win over voters such as Angela
Silva, 33. She happened to run into Gore on Monday, while he was
handing out campaign information on Nashua's Lynwood Street, and
quizzed him about a variety of social programs. While impressed
with Gore, she said she didn't know enough about Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really met him yet,'' Silva said of Bradley, in a
statement emblematic of the New Hampshire one-on-one political
tradition. But because the candidates can't hope to meet every
voter, they view televised events such as the one airing Wednesday
night as crucial toward introducing them to a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the candidates, however, the 8 p.m. start puts
the forum in direct conflict with Game 4 of the World Series. Even
the state's Democratic Party chairman, Kathy Sullivan, who plans to
watch the forum ``in an easy chair with a beer,'' acknowledges that
a second television set in her home will be tuned into baseball.
</P>
<P>
   While the forum is not a debate, it could easily turn into one.
Under the rules, each candidate will be given 90 seconds to respond
to questions from the audience, and it is possible that they will
engage one another throughout the event.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, according to his aides, will present himself as a Democrat
who backs significant changes in areas such as education, health
care, and the environment. Bradley, meanwhile, is expected to
elaborate on his positions on health care, handgun registration,
and race relations and argue that Gore is too timid too address the
nation's major challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley officials said Tuesday they were preparing for the event
by trying to anticipate possible lines of attack by Gore. And the
former senator has hinted that he is prepared to respond
aggressively. He recently said he could only take so many
``elbows'' before he will throw one himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley is prepared for anything else that may come
up,'' said Anita Dunn, his communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley practiced this week with Dunn's husband, Bob Bauer, a
Washington lawyer, posing as the vice president, according to one
source. The Bradley campaign refused to confirm or deny Bauer's
participation and made light of any effort to get ready for the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been answering questions from people for the last
ten-and-a-half months,'' said Dunn. ``This is not new for him.
He'll be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on the other hand, holed up at the Wayfarer Inn in
Bedford, with a team of Washington and New Hampshire advisers,
including Senator Caroline McCarley, his political director, Nick
Baldick, his state director, and Douglas Hattaway, his state
spokesman. The group fired questions at Gore on local issues such
as the White Mountain National Forest, the Portsmouth Naval
Shipyard, and special education.
</P>
<P>
   The constrasting styles of the two candidates were on display
Tuesday, as Gore campaigned in Concord and Bradley brought his
caravan to Claremont.
</P>
<P>
   Gore attended an antidrug rally at the State House, urging
children not to try drugs. Bradley appeared with 89-year-old Doris
Haddock, also known as Granny D, to press for campaign-finance
overhaul. Haddock has been walking 10 miles a day across the
country to convince Congress that people do care about how
elections are funded.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that although the public does not consider
campaign-finance overhaul as important as health care or good jobs,
special-interest groups prevent progress in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize how it's related to achieving all of those
things,'' he said. ``If Granny D can walk across America, we ought
to be able to have a clean campaign-financing system.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Gore warmed up for the event by holding a
two-hour town meeting at Fairgrounds Junior High School in Nashua,
during which the vice president displayed an intricate knowledge of
New Hampshire and the issues affecting the state, such as the
impact of the F-22 jet on a local company and the number of
students at an overcrowded high school. He constantly joked with
the audience, at one point urging a student to give an example of
how to ``dis'' someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your accent stinks,'' the student responded.
</P>
<P>
   Gore rarely seemed rattled, although he did mistakenly refer to
the late Senator Barry Goldwater as being alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with him more and more as he moves to the center these
days,'' Gore said of Goldwater. Gore never mentioned Bradley's name
throughout the event, and only referred to having a Democratic
opponent in the last couple of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After the microphones were turned off, Gore stayed to talk
privately with the voters for another hour. A line stretched from
one end of the room to the other as Gore patiently spoke with every
person until there were no more people to talk to.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore's voice was hoarse and his black shirt damp with
sweat, the effort appeared to be paying off, voter by voter.
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Noonan, a nurse in the intensive care unit at Catholic
Medical Center in Manchester, walked into the room leaning toward
Bradley. To her, the vice president never really stood out.
</P>
<P>
   But after listening to Gore, Noonan, an independent voter, said
she was seriously considering voting for him. ``He has a whole lot
of compassion, a whole lot of heart,'' she said. ``You just didn't
see that when he was vice president because President Clinton did
all the talking.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, what was supposed to have been a cakewalk to the
nomination has turned into a battle against Bradley. After cutting
staff, moving his campaign to Nashville, and rededicating himself
to being a candidate rather than a vice president, Gore's effort in
New Hampshire is seeking to regain its early momentum. Gore himself
has been taking Bradley to task on the issues, such as health care.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, on the other hand, has continued his methodical
approach to running for president. His campaign began canvassing
the state over the summer, and officials estimate that volunteers
have hit 60,000 homes since then. Though he has continued to rise
in the polls here, he seems neither to be increasing his visits,
nor decreasing them. His message _ mostly biographical, but also
revolving around a few themes that he calls ``big ideas'' _ is
constant.

SOUTH AFRICAN APPEALED TO NEGOTIATORS TO KEEP TRYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In an 11th-hour appeal, the man who helped negotiate
the end of apartheid for South Africa's white government helped
stave off a breakdown last weekend in the stalemated talks over the
Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Progress in the talks has been stymied over the issue of when
the Irish Republican Army would be required to give up its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf Meyer, who now heads the multiracial United Democratic
Movement in South Africa, flew to Belfast last week at the urging
of Padraig O'Malley, a political scientist at the McCormack
Institute for Public Affairs at the University of Massachusetts at
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer's last-minute intervention offered a rare glimpse inside
the talks being overseen by former US senator George Mitchell, who
has insisted on a news blackout as he seeks to save the political
settlement in Northern Ireland that he brokered on Good Friday
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Meyer said that when he met with
Mitchell on Saturday morning, Mitchell ``had his bags packed and
was ready to leave for good,'' ending the two-month review of the
Good Friday Agreement inconclusively.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley's involvement grew out of a 1997 conference at the
Boston campus, when it hosted political leaders from Northern
Ireland and South Africa. There, the South Africans encouraged the
Belfast delegation to follow their example in finding a solution to
a conflict long considered intractable.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said a series of meetings he held with the various parties
over the weekend seemed to bear fruit when, unexpectedly, the Irish
participants and Mitchell agreed to resume talks Wednesday in
Belfast. Those talks are expected to last at least three days but
could continue even without Mitchell, sources involved in the talks
in Belfast said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the parties that they had to take ownership of the
process, that they could not rely on outsiders, even someone as
respected as George Mitchell, to solve their problems,'' said
Meyer. ``The mood became slightly more optimistic over the
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Meyer insisted that a compromise appears some distance
away, and that Mitchell is essential. ``Mitchell must be the
overseer. He's got the credibility,'' said Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell, who has declined to speak about the ongoing talks
because he views publicity at this stage as a stumbling block, is
just about at the end of his patience, said Meyer. The former
Senate majority leader moved the talks to London two weeks ago,
hoping a change of scenery would infuse the process with some
momentum. He is anxious to get back to his Washington law practice
and his wife and 2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement has been stalled by
a dispute over the fate of IRA weapons. The Ulster Unionists, the
biggest party in Northern Ireland, refuses to form a local
government with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political allies, until the
IRA begins disarming.
</P>
<P>
   But Sinn Fein says there is nothing in the agreement that links
its participation in government with IRA disarmament. The IRA,
meanwhile, has been unwilling to make even a token gesture on
disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said a similar dispute threatened to derail the negotiated
end to apartheid, but the National Party, for which he was chief
negotiator, and the African National Congress put aside their
differences because the dispute threatened the entire transition to
democracy. He said the same could happen in Northern Ireland if
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein president Gerry
Adams could give each other enough room to sell a compromise to
skeptical wings of their party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every situation is different, but certain principles are
universal,'' said Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley said he reached out to Meyer as ``someone who would be
perceived as neutral.'' Meyer met with each of the party leaders
except Trimble, with whom he spoke at length on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley said no one should overestimate what Meyer had done.
``He bought them another week,'' said O'Malley. ``Now it's up to
the parties themselves.''

 &HT;    House panel votes on electricity deregulation
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox New Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A House panel today takes up a bill to deregulate the
nation's $200 billion-a-year electric utility industry.
</P>
<P>
   Few observers expect enactment of any legislation before next
year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   But if the House Energy and Power Subcommittee approves the
hotly contested bill today, as expected, it will be the first time
a comprehensive restructuring proposal has passed that legislative
hurdle since enactment of the National Energy Policy Act in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, proposed by subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton
(R-Texas), does not include a deadline or requirement for states to
deregulate their electric utility monopolies, though it seeks to
promote competition.
</P>
<P>
   But other issues are highly contentious, such as whether the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should gain new powers to
force electric utilities to join regional transmission
organizations or divest major assets.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Southern Co., operator of five electric utilities,
has been closely watching the proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Buddy Eller said the company applauds Barton for
``leaving critical decisions on the future structure of the
industry to state legislators and regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   But Southern opposes any amendments that would ``increase
federal regulatory authority over utilities'' or penalize states
that do not wish to open their markets to competition immediately,
Eller said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) last month, Georgia
Public Service Commission Chairman Stan Wise said the commission
``feels that the people of Georgia would not benefit from a
deregulated market at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Georgia's electricity rates are lower than the
national average, Wise said, ``Any potential national benefit of
deregulation would come at a cost to states such as ours.''

US CARDINAL, JERUSALEM MAYOR CLASH ON FUTURE OF CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston clashed sharply with
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert Tuesday on whether religious
organizations should be involved in negotiating the future of this
ancient capital.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange, which took place one day into a Catholic-Jewish
pilgrimage of reconciliation that Law is leading, followed a
morning visit to Bethlehem, and a few days before the group is to
journey to Nazareth. Religious tensions are running high in both
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is the symbol of everything we pray for . . . of all
the hopes, the prayers, the tears, the dreams of Jewish history,''
Olmert said near the end of a talk to 22 Catholic and 22 Jewish
leaders from greater Boston. ``This city will never be divided.''
</P>
<P>
   Law responded that he hoped ``a satisfactory resolution would be
found by the residents themselves . . . Jews, Arabs, whoever.'' To
that, Olmert retorted, ``I really regret that sometimes church
leaders lend themselves to the political process. It is not in
keeping with the line we must draw between politics and religion.
The mixing up of politics and religion does not help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religious interest is in free access to holy sites and
protection of the churches,'' Olmert said. ``The rest should be
left to politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   But Law flatly rejected that position, saying that ``what is
appropriate is to speak to the rights and aspirations of the people
who are the living church who are here.''
</P>
<P>
   When the United Nations attempted to partition Palestine between
Jews and Arabs in 1947, it declared Jerusalem an international
city. After the state of Israel was proclaimed in 1948 and was
attacked by surrounding Arab nations, Israel captured the west side
of the city and Jordan took the east.
</P>
<P>
   Israel then captured the east in a 1967 war, annexed it, and
declared it the national capital. The future OF Jerusalem remains
the subject of controversy, and Palestinian political leaders
envision East Jerusalem as capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and most other countries do not recognize
Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but both houses of the US Congress
have voted overwhelmingly to move the US Embassy here. The move has
been delayed lest it upset highly sensitive preliminary steps now
taking place toward negotiating final peace arrangements between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Law, in a rare public challenge to Israeli political officials
by a foreign Catholic leader on the status of Jerusalem, initially
confronted the mayor by speaking approvingly of sentiments
expressed at a conference of international Catholic leaders that
was convened here a year ago by Michel Sabbah, the
Vatican-appointed patriarch of Jerusalem, who is a Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I heard there, which I found very encouraging,'' Law
said, ``was great confidence that a satisfactory resolution would
be found by the residents themselves. Was I naive?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the mayor retorted. ``I believe a majority of residents
want Jerusalem to remain one undivided city. If they have to choose
between Israeli sovereignty and Palestinian sovereignty, I believe
I know which they will choose.'' He then began criticizing the
mixing of politics and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Zvi Raviv, an adviser to the mayor, said Olmert has expressed
such sentiments privately to Sabbah. ``The uniqueness of this
situation today was the cardinal challenged him in public,'' Raviv
said. ``The mayor refuses to accept the political participation of
Jewish rabbis in this, too. He wants to see the decision made by
people chosen democratically.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Samuel Chiel of Newton, Mass., co-leader with Law of the
pilgrimage, said he agreed with the cardinal that religious leaders
should make their feelings known on issues that affect people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major religions have a very special stake in Jerusalem,''
Chiel said, ``and it would be a mistake to believe that religious
leaders are going to sit by and simply leave it in the hands of
political leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   John Jennings, an assistant US attorney general who is also on
the pilgrimage, said the mayor offered a very strong viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinal was attempting to engage him in a dialogue to see
if there was any opportunity to open that viewpoint to
discussion,'' Jennings said. ``Ultimately, we learned that there
wasn't.''

ROSE'S SORRY CASE DOESN'T DESERVE YOUR SYMPATHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among all the greats and greatests who are being properly
honored as the first full century of baseball draws to a close,
there is no doubt which of them is the most misunderstood by the
preponderance of the American sports-loving public.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who care, the warts and foibles of the game's greats
are well-documented. Babe Ruth was a world-class carouser. Ty Cobb
was a world-class bully and bigot. Grover Cleveland Alexander was a
world-class drunk. Other Hall of Famers have had monumental human
failings. But no player of great stature has succeeded in charming
and conning the American public anywhere near as well as Peter
Edward Rose, the degenerate gambler and world-class denier who
gives new meaning to the phrase ``own worst enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rose is a reverse alchemist. Everything he touches turns to
excrement. Thanks to his presence at Turner Field last Sunday
evening, millions of Americans now think Jim Gray is a bad guy
while others whose opinions count think commissioner Bud Selig is a
fool for allowing Rose to be a participant in the All-Century
ceremony in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Among those espousing the latter viewpoint is John Dowd, the
Washington attorney whose investigative report on behalf of the
late Bart Giamatti led to Rose's lifetime ban from baseball in
1989. Mr. Dowd has been widely quoted as saying it was a ``sham''
to allow Rose on the field with the other 17 living members of the
so-called ``All-Century Team'' (anyone who doesn't understand that
Honus Wagner remains the greatest shortstop of all-time or who
thinks Nolan Ryan is one of the top six pitchers ever is a baseball
ignoramus). Dowd is furious with Selig for allowing it to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Bud. He was in a lose-lose situation. If he had barred Rose
from participating, he would have been branded by most people as a
heartless Inspector Javert who was denying a persecuted Jean
Valjean his one remaining moment of baseball glory in front of
adoring fans. But by permitting Rose to take part, he is now being
vilified by the hard-nose likes of people like Dowd, who believe
that Rose's presence alongside men who chose not to break
baseball's most sacred law is an obscenity directed toward the game
itself.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Bud was simply trying to be Mr. Nice Guy. He is a
baseball fan to the core who loathes what Rose did, but he was
willing to allow Pete his opportunity to be remembered for his
baseball achievements. Selig never will lift the ban on an
unrepentant Rose. He was saying, ``OK, Pete, I'll let you have this
because you were the fans' choice, but don't ever expect anything
more.'' Selig was also stroking the MasterCard people, who
undoubtedly would not have been pleased had a banning of Rose
become a pre-ceremony cause celebre.
</P>
<P>
   Gray absolutely did the right thing, asking the only proper
opening question of a serial liar. The fact-lacking public, far
more ready to believe Rose's ludicrous denials of clear damaging
evidence than it is to do a little homework, has chosen to besmirch
Gray. Should he have let up when it was obvious Rose wasn't going
to admit culpability? Perhaps. It was a very uncomfortable
interview to watch, and after the second Rose denial, it was going
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Gray has gotten where he is because, unlike 99.9 percent of his
TV brethren, he will ask the tough question. Some of the people
criticizing him for roughing up Rose loved it when that same Jim
Gray conducted an award-winning interview with Don King that was
handled in the exact same vein. But it's one thing to grill one of
America's chosen punching bags, and another to put Pete Rose's feet
to the fire, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Rose is an amazing American phenomenon. He made more out of
himself athletically than he had any right to accomplish by virtue
of his limited physical gifts, and he did as much during the first
four-fifths of his career to promote the game as anyone not named
Babe Ruth ever has done.
</P>
<P>
   And then he ruined it all.
</P>
<P>
   Rose says he loves baseball, and that is undoubtedly the truth.
What's equally and undeniably true is that what he loves more than
baseball, more than his wife, more than his four children, and more
than life itself, is gambling. He is a totally sick gambler who is
so twisted and demented in his ongoing pursuit of his truest love
that he has concocted a fascinating fantasy history for himself
during his tenure as manager of the Cincinnati Reds, in which there
are no betting slips with both his fingerprints and his signature
on them; no lengthy list of eyewitnesses; and no phone records that
were, in Dowd's words, ``totally devastating evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Nope, says Peter Edward Rose. Not true. Never happened. Rose
asked Gray to show him the evidence. How strange. Why would Rose
imply that he never has been confronted with the evidence, when
it's all inside the Dowd Report, and when he, Peter Edward Rose,
has even made money in the recent past by autographing copies of
said report for sums in excess of $250? The reason Rose signed off
on the Dowd Report a decade ago was that he didn't want his public
to become aware of the evidence he now says he's never seen.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in the true story should read Michael
Sokolove's early '90s book on Rose. It's all there, the long
gambling history, the sordid acquaintances, the relentless pursuit
of gambling opportunities and, of course, the requisite obligations
to the Mob. Rose is a pathetic figure. That's is, not was.
</P>
<P>
   What's so very disturbing is that none of this matters to
millions of Americans. ``He didn't murder anybody,'' we are told.
``It's only gambling.'' It doesn't matter to them that Rose bet on
baseball, and on his own team, while managing the Reds. It doesn't
matter to them that on the days he did not bet on his own team, he
was telling the gamblers something. It doesn't matter to them that
the first thing visible inside every baseball clubhouse is a giant
sign warning against gambling. It doesn't matter to them that
gambling by participants is sport's biggest no-no, for very obvious
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that it does matter. Rose is out of baseball for a
very good reason. There is nothing lovable about Rose. Let him stay
in his fantasy world.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball family has a prominent deviant child who did many
great things on the field before revealing his true life's
priority. Fortunately, this isn't the real world. It's OK if love
for the sick child in this particular family is very, very
conditional.

<P>
   WASHINGTON, _ The nation's teen-age birth rate fell again last
year to a near-record low, federal health officials said Tuesday,
continuing an encouraging trend that spans ethnic groups,
geographical areas and ages.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National Center for Health Statistics said high
school girls 15 to 17 years of age had the lowest birth rate in 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   For younger girls, ages 10 to 14, the rate was the lowest level
since 1969. African-American teen-agers recorded the lowest birth
rate since 1960, when such data were first gathered, and the rate
among Hispanic women also dropped precipitously, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has definitely been a decline in sexual activity among
teen-agers, both boys and girls,'' said Stephanie J. Ventura, the
government demographer who wrote the report. ``There is also more
consistent use of birth control _ especially condoms. Finally, you
have to look at the widespread attention this subject has gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   The positive trend showed up across the country, with 10 states
and the recorded the smallest. But even with the lower numbers
across the country, health officials said they still saw far too
many unintended births.
</P>
<P>
   Babies were crying at the Hart Infant Center not far from the
Capitol, and Betty Lightfoot, the director, was not sure she had
heard the news correctly. Teen-age pregnancies were really down for
the seventh straight year? she asked. The teen-age birth rate in
the nation's capital really plummeted 20 percent from 1991 to 1997?
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's so, it's great,'' Ms. Lightfoot said. ``But our day
care for teen mothers is still full. We still have a maximum of 10
here and a maximum of 20 at another site. Girls are still having
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lightfoot cares for three babies who were all born to one
17-year-old girl. The young mother drops her children off at the
center in the morning and goes to high school classes during the
day. She is pregnant with her fourth child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a problem,'' said Ms. Lightfoot, who was herself a
mother at the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials agree. Despite the decline, they said, teen-age
birth rates in the United States still far exceed those in all the
other industrialized countries. The statistics also show that the
proportion of births to teen-agers who are unmarried continued to
increase in 1998, to 78.8 percent from 78.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get to where the rest of the developed world is, we have a
lot of work to do,'' said Kristin Moore of Child Trends, a research
and advocacy group in Washington. ``Our lowest state has a rate
equal to about the highest rate in the developed world.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age birth rate in the United States is in the same
league with that of the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and
Turkey, Ms. Ventura said. Japan, France, Germany and Britain have
teen-age birth rates that are significantly smaller than those in
the United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Brown, director of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen
Pregnancy, an advocacy group based in Washington, was attending a
conference Tuesday on teen-age pregnancy in South Carolina. She
said in a telephone interview that one person at the conference
reported that an 8-year-old girl and a 9-year-old girl had recently
became mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principal challenge among those of us working in the field
is to avoid a sense of complacency,'' Mrs. Brown said. ``This new
data is terrific news, but we still remain the industrialized
country with the highest degree of teen pregnancy and abortion. And
even if we don't compare ourselves to other countries, we still
have too many girls giving birth.''
</P>
<P>
   The birth rates among minority girls are falling particularly
fast, the report found. But the birth rates for Hispanic and
African-American teen-agers were still considerably higher than
those for whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the decreases have been remarkable in our
community, we still have a higher rate of unintended pregnancies
and abortions than white women,'' said Shelia Clark, public policy
associate at the National Black Women's Health Project. ``We still
have to work on issues of poverty. We have to work on education.
This is not a dead issue.''
</P>
<P>
   How to get the numbers to decline ever further remains the
challenge. Miss Clark points to opportunity as one answer. ``When
you give people in general _ and African-Americans in particular _
increased access to education and employment, you increase their
quality of life and reduce the number of unintended pregnancies,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the District's schools, officials have health centers in the
high schools to distribute condoms and educate students on sex.
There are also child care centers to allow teen-age mothers to
continue their studies, and a program called Teen Moms Take Charge
to teach pre-natal care and prevent more births.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lightfoot, who sees the young mothers drop off their
children in her center every day, also tries to use her own
experience as a teen-age mother to educate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard for me,'' said Ms. Lightfoot, who is 42. ``It was
like one minute I had a doll and then the next minute I had a real
baby. I share everything I've gone through. How I had to put
everything in my life off. Maybe one day they'll listen.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian troops continued to move within a few miles of
Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, on Tuesday, and a top federal
military commander said the campaign had entered a new phrase that
would last as long as needed to defeat guerrillas fighting the
Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Gennadi Troshev, a commander in the Chechen campaign,
said in an interview published Tuesday that Russia's military
campaign had entered a second stage that could last ``three months
or two years'' _ however long it takes to crush the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the map, it is clear that the ring of our
`sanitary zone' is tightening up,'' he told the newspaper Moskovsky
Komsomolets. ``The ring will be gradually tightened until the whole
territory is under the full control of federal forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Russian troops poised on the edge of Grozny, it is
still unclear whether they will attack the city itself. Some
military experts say a failure to take the city would leave Russian
forces exposed, while others say another bloody battle for Grozny _
like one staged by Russian troops in 1994 _ could prove politically
costly in a war that has had broad public support in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians invaded Chechnya in 1994 to try to crush
separatists, and withdrew in defeat 21 months later. Russia renewed
military action in recent weeks after Chechnya-based rebels invaded
neighboring Dagestan and after a series of explosions in Moscow and
other cities that the government attributes to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Russian forces moved closer to the northwestern edge of
Grozny, within sight of the city's airport, as planes and artillery
attacked guerrilla positions. Fighting was also reported along the
Chechen border with another neighboring republic, Ingushetia. Last
weekend, Russian forces blocked the border, cutting off an escape
route for refugees fleeing Russian bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Grozny, a Chechen commander said Tuesday that the fighting in
the Tersky ridge about 7 miles from the airport was the
``fiercest'' since Russian troops crossed into Chechnya. The
Russian news agency Interfax reported that the shelling was so
heavy that windowpanes in the city were rattling all day.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One Russian television report said reconnaissance teams had
entered a district on the northern outskirts, but Chechen
commanders said no Russian troops had entered the city.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders have said they will attack the city if
necessary, but Troshev said that seizing Grozny was not a ``goal in
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be easier to go around it,'' he said, suggesting a
plan that would cut off the city, which is being rapidly emptied of
inhabitants. The exodus picked up after bombing attacks Thursday,
which struck a central market, among other targets, killing scores
of people.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Troshev _ a veteran of Russia's last war in Chechnya who was
born in Grozny _ spoke emphatically about a recent decision to
offer a $1 million bounty for the head of Shamil Basayev, the
Chechen warlord accused by Russia of leading armed attacks in
Dagestan in August and of organizing terrorist bombings that killed
almost 300 people in three Russian cities in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever brings it, gets the money,'' Troshev said. ``It
doesn't matter who it is _ Chechens themselves, or our special
forces. It is necessary to destroy this bandit. He has done too
much harm to Russia and his own people.''
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman said later that Troshev's words should not
be taken literally and that the bounty would be awarded for the
capture of Basayev, who should be delivered alive and unharmed. The
spokesman also said the money would not come from the Russian
government's budget, but from ``patriotically minded businessmen.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1 million offer has a special resonance in Chechnya, which
in recent years has been isolated by a wave of kidnappings staged
by warlords, like Basayev, who have used ransom money to build up
their power bases in the unruly region.
</P>
<P>
   And in Moscow on Tuesday, the city's police chief suggested that
Russia's Interior Ministry might consider a swap of prisoners with
the Chechen guerrillas _ exchanging an official Chechen
representative in Moscow who was arrested last week on a charge of
illegal weapons possession for a senior Russian police official
kidnapped last year in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   With 100,000 Russian troops on Chechnya's northern rim and
around its perimeters, the military has signaled its readiness to
sweep the region. It is pursuing an estimated 25,000 to 40,000
guerrillas who, Moscow contends, have received support and
reinforcements from international terrorist organizations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But information about the fighting in Chechnya is scant because
the Russian military closely guards access to its troops and
because the threat of kidnapping dissuades reporters and observers
from stationing themselves inside Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has said about 200 Russian soldiers and
2,000 guerrillas have been killed in the fighting to date. Chechen
commanders contend that Russian troops have suffered far greater
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, whose popularity ratings
have gone up since Russian troops moved into Chechnya, said Tuesday
that the government was satisfied with the military's performance
so far. ``The situation is developing according to plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Troshev said that so far the government was not insisting on a
quick end to the fighting. ``If the operation were to be halted,
then Chechen terrorism would again creep up around the country,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And a hasty effort to achieve victory would also be a mistake,
he said. ``If troops are thrown into an assault in the mountains,''
he said, ``it would lead to big, and countless, losses.''

CONTRACT EXTENSIONS SOUGHT FOR MILLOY, BLEDSOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots, apparently recognizing that
strong safety Lawyer Milloy is a player they can't live without,
have decided to pursue a multiyear contract extension with him
until Nov. 7, the last day teams can apply any in-season signings
toward their 1999 salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Patriots owner Robert Kraft and agent Leigh
Steinberg have had ongoing discussions about a huge contract
extension for Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   The Bledsoe talks likely will not be done before Nov. 8, but the
Patriots need a restructuring of Bledsoe to help their cap
situation for 2000, even though preliminary indications are that
the cap will increase by about $5 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   If the Milloy deal isn't done by Nov. 7, he likely will exercise
his right to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Milloy's agent, Ray Anderson, said the sides had decided in
training camp that they would discuss the situation after the
season, but Anderson has met with the Patriots twice, in what both
sides described as ``social visits.''
</P>
<P>
   The social calls proved to be fruitful for Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides want to get this done,'' said Anderson from his
Atlanta office Tuesday. ``We think the 7th makes sense because it
will be the end of the bye week and that half the season is gone.
We don't want it to drag out to affect Lawyer's play. We don't want
it to be a distraction to Lawyer or the team, so if we can't pull
it together, we forget about it and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson submitted a proposal during training camp, but the
Patriots were not able to act on it because of their heavy-duty
deal with Ty Law. Now that proposal is off the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think both sides would start from scratch,'' said
Anderson. ``Obviously things have changed. We have to be creative
here because of salary cap situations the Patriots may face, but
we're certainly willing to work with them. I think both sides will
be trying to think of ways to get this done in the most equitable
way for the team and for Lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the highest-paid safety in the NFL is Green Bay's
LeRoy Butler, whose recent extension earns him an average of $4.57
million per year. Jacksonville's Carnell Lake is second, averaging
$4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say Milloy won't be getting as much as Law (seven
years, $50 million, including signing bonuses), but Anderson did
say, ``We would certainly want Lawyer paid at the top of his
peers.''
</P>
<P>
   While many teams are going to take the next couple of weeks to
work out extensions, some of them are in a better financial
situation than the Patriots. As of Tuesday, New England was only
$300,000 under the cap number of $57.4 million. That wouldn't even
buy them a veteran linebacker at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots could get creative and issue a big signing
bonus to Milloy that would be pro-rated to include the '99 season.
The Patriots likely would have to fiddle with a contract or two to
get Milloy signed.
</P>
<P>
   Milloy may be the best run-stopping safety in the business right
now. His 14 tackles last week are typical of how he has performed
through seven games.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have other matters to think about, too. Chief
operating officer Andy Wasynczuk has been buried with stadium
issues. His new assistant, Jack Mula, is involved in the stadium
issues from a legal standpoint, but he is also going to assist on
contract negotiations in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft usually leaves the contracts up to Wasynczuk, but in the
case of Bledsoe, his long relationship with Steinberg and Bledsoe
apparently necessitated that he get involved.
</P>
<P>
   High-priced quarterbacks like Bledsoe, Troy Aikman, and Brett
Favre usually wind up renegotiating every couple of years or so to
provide salary cap relief. Bledsoe has one of the highest cap
numbers in the league this season ($7.2 million).

 LUCIANO SOPRANI, 53, DESIGNER WHO WON FASHION FAME IN '80s  
(mcd) 
 By CATHY HORYN  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Luciano Soprani, a proponent of the slouchy, tailored look that
dominated Italian fashion in the early 1980s, died on Saturday at a
hospital in Milan. He was 53.
</P>
<P>
   Beppe Modenese, head of Camera Nazaionale, which organizes
Italy's fashion shows, said Soprani had been ill with throat cancer
for several months. Modenese said he last saw Soprani in September,
when he presented his spring collection at the Italian
ready-to-wear shows.
</P>
<P>
   Like nearly every designer in the hurly-burly fashion business,
Soprani had his moment, and it came during the wide-shouldered
'80s, when Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace were building their
empires. Soprani was often mentioned alongside these older peers.
</P>
<P>
   In a review on Oct. 8, 1982, Bernadine Morris of The New York
Times described Soprani's ``triumphal progress'' through the
collections, with enthusiastic applause for both Soprani's own line
and Basile, another sportswear label he designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those years, when Versace, Armani and Krizia were the big
names, Luciano was the young Turk,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, fashion
director of Bloomingdale's, which carried the Soprani and Basile
labels. ``He made a nice contribution to fine tailoring and the
Milan look.''
</P>
<P>
   Soprani was born in Reggiolo, a small town in central Italy.
From a family of farmers, he studied agriculture in school,
Modenese said, ``but when he graduated, he decided he didn't want
to be an expert in farming; he wanted to be a fashion designer.''
</P>
<P>
   Soprani went to work for Max Mara, where he remained for about
eight years. As someone who favored strong, commercial clothes over
flamboyant theatrics, Soprani seemed to know how to dress the
young, career-minded women who emerged in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   He started his own label in 1982, while continuing to design for
other houses, including Gucci. Joan Kaner, who was then fashion
director of Bergdorf Goodman, recalled some tweed coats that
Soprani designed, with raccoon pelts on the sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really wonderful looking,'' said Ms. Kaner.
</P>
<P>
   Although Soprani continued to be a popular purveyor of colorful,
classic sportswear, his name gradually faded from international
prominence, and Modenese said the designer had business
difficulties with a Japanese partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very quiet person,'' said Modenese. ``Lately, he
started to have some success again.''
</P>
<P>
   Soprani is survived by a son, Lorenzo.

 &HT;    Vision pays off for Convergence
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There are believers, and there are true believers.
</P>
<P>
   Label the team called Convergence among the truest of believers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the company's inception three years ago, under the
leadership of James Harkins, the president, it has been devoted to
the proposition that the most powerful communications idea is the
broad usefulness of wireless communication.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Amazon.com bought Convergence in a $20
million stock deal to bring into its own tent the Norcross, Ga.
company's know-how in wireless communication. That move, by an
action-minded company like Amazon.com, was a vindication of the
Convergence faith in the new technology that until now seemed ahead
of its time.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence and Amazon.com by no means have the corner on
wireless communication between small devices and the Internet, or
among hand-held devices. It is a busy field. But Convergence was
among the first to prove that you can access the Internet with a
hand-held device when it invented its Telebrowser, the wireless
version of programs like Netscape and other browsers that connect
personal computers to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we decided to introduce our `anywhere' service, we turned
to Convergence because they proved they can do the job,'' said
Warren Adams, head of product development for Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence produces two kinds of software that help palm
devices display merchandise and then enable the consumer to place
orders and close the deal. Some of the software is attached to
central computers, and some is downloaded directly to the palm
devices so they may log on and open the door for electronic
business.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia, the hottest producer of cell phones, is especially
interested in making its phones a ``platform'' for various wireless
services in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the consumer will be able to do practically anything she
might do on a personal computer, but ``anywhere, anytime'' on a
hand-held device and with graphics and icons and all the
conveniences. The only thing holding back much of the progress is
the failure so far to agree on world standards so the machines will
be able to work together easily.
</P>
<P>
   Those standards are precisely what Convergence has been
promoting for the past year. And this little company has the
ingenuity and horsepower to make its contribution to the software
needs of wireless communication.
</P>
<P>
   Harkins says his company is ``one of the few in the industry
with expertise across embedded devices, wireless integration and
telephony applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are working in the same vineyard as Convergence,
creating the software for wireless operation. But Convergence's
experience has brought it contracts from various hardware companies
and service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Adams of Amazon.com said Convergence has been assigned the work
of creating software for other small devices that may be able to
connect with the Internet merchant service in the future.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, it was wise to place the sophisticated
software at the heart of the system, thereby allowing people using
affordable personal devices simply to link up at no significant
additional cost.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence also has developed Devicetalk, a set of software
pieces that connect various devices locally, such as one PC to
another, or PCs to hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of innovation that grabbed Amazon.com's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The awareness of the hot marketability of wireless communication
has helped propel manufacturers such as Nokia to the front ranks of
cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of hand devices is bound to grow, and Nokia,
using its own software, is already introducing some phones that can
connect with the Internet. In much the same way Convergence now
helps Amazon.com, Nokia is providing software and aid to other
wireless providers such as AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nokia wisdom, what is making hand devices ever
smaller and more useful and popular are four eager consuming
groups:
</P>
<P>
   1. The Highfliers, mostly career-oriented men.
</P>
<P>
   2. The Trendsetters, mostly technology-oriented men.
</P>
<P>
   3. The Posers, the status-conscious men and women who like to be
seen with the latest. The latest at Nokia, which you'll soon spot
on the television show ``Friends'': a sleek, chrome-plated phone so
small a man could conceal in his hand if he weren't anxious for it
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Social Contact Seekers, the folks who can't quit talking
on phones.
</P>
<P>
   The Convergence team is a mix of young and not so young, but
none is younger than Rob Frederick, 26, so smart and involved in
math he had to take classes at Georgia Tech during his senior year
at Woodward Academy (an Atlanta-area prep school) just to hold his
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Now a graduate of MIT's famed multimedia center _ and a soccer
player and budding rap music producer _ he is a generational
connecting agent and an engineering specialist in the Internet at
Convergence. He has also lured Jason Sugg, another Atlantan and
Woodward grad, to join the team.
</P>

MICROSOFT AMONG FOUR JOINING DOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recognizing the impact of technology on today's stock market,
Dow Jones &AMP; Co. on Tuesday said it would add Microsoft Corp., the
world's biggest software company, and Intel Corp., the largest US
maker of computer chips, to its index of 30 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dow's industrial average was updated just two years
ago, investment specialists said the changes were steps by the
publisher of The Wall Street Journal to yank its widely watched
index out of yesteryear and reshape it to reflect a US economy
increasingly driven by technological change.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft's strong stock showing continues, its inclusion may
improve the performance of the dowdy Dow, which has been outrun by
the technology-heavy Nasdaq for seven of the past 10 years,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Microsoft and Intel, Dow Jones plans to add The
Home Depot Inc. and telecommunications giant SBC Communications
Inc. to its 103-year-old stock index. The changes will become
effective Monday, Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for the new entrants, Chevron Corp., Goodyear Tire
&AMP; Rubber Co., Union Carbide Corp., and Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. will be
removed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, a benchmark tracked by investors on both Main Street
and Wall Street, has had a respectable year, gaining 12.21 percent,
based on Tuesday's closing. While it is impossible to predict the
market's future course, an analysis by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
forecasted that had these changes been adopted on Jan. 1, the Dow
would have added nearly 1.75 percentage points to its return so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, by comparison, has gained 28.22 percent so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   If the changes had been made on Jan. 1, ``The Dow would be a
little more volatile than it is now, and it would have been up a
lot more,'' said William Rhodes, vice president of investment
strategy in the Boston office of Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of two Nasdaq-listed stocks _ Intel and Microsoft _
was also significant, because they are the first names to be
included in the Dow index that are not traded on the New York Stock
Exchange. SBC Communications and Home Depot are listed on the Big
Board.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed with the assessment of Dow Jones executives who
said the index is being updated to better represent changes in the
US economy from its industrial base to one driven by services and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Steiger, managing editor of the Wall Street Journal, said
the changes would make the Dow index ``more representative of the
evolving US economy, as the average _ and the nation _ enter a new
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Home Depot, for example, which will replace Sears in the
index.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, the nation's second-biggest retailer, has wrestled with
slow sales growth and an old-fashioned retail idea _ the department
store _ while superstores, such as Home Depot, have seen sales
explode by offering customers aisles chock full of a more narrow
category of products.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, by selling equipment and products used in home
repairs, has doubled its sales since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The four companies being removed from the Dow have huge global
operations. Goodyear, for example, is still the world's largest
tire company.
</P>
<P>
   But the new entrants better ``reflect the changes in the broader
economy,'' said John Schreiber, an assistant portfolio manager for
the Janus fund, a $33 billion mutual fund that invests in
big-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The themes of the companies being added, Schreiber said, are
``technology and growth,'' while the companies being taken out
represent ``industrialism and obsolescence.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, Dow Jones tried to update its index, adding
Travelers Group (now Citigroup), Hewlett-Packard Co., Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The latest changes in the Dow come at a time when the index has
had a spectacular rise, doubling its value since breaking through
the 5000 mark in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the blockbuster Nasdaq stock index is becoming
the darling index of investors with its holdings in the technology
sector. And, the Nasdaq's fortunes are increasingly being driven by
the fortunes of one company: Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Microsoft's impact on the Dow will be more muted
than its impact on the Nasdaq, due to differences in the way the
indexes are structured.
</P>
<P>
   While the Nasdaq is an index average weighted by each company's
total market capitalization _ Microsoft's capitalization of $475
billion is gargantuan _ each Dow stock carries the same weight in
the index.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Microsoft moves, it makes a huge difference in the
(Nasdaq's) value at the end of the day,'' said Merrill Lynch's
Rhodes. In the Dow, a Microsoft stock price move ``is going to be
the same as if any other Dow component moved, such as Citigroup,
because it's an equally weighted index,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, all stocks _ even many technology giants _
have come under pressure. In constrast, Microsoft has held its own.
Based on Tuesday's closing of 92 3/8, Microsoft is up 33.2 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think that even the latest changes, though
welcome, are not enough to keep up with technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' said Bear Stearns technology analyst Andy
Neff of the changes. ``I guess the next question is: when are they
going to add Yahoo and America Online?''

 &HT;    Spurrier's backup plan: Bench QB if job not done
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Before the season, Florida coach Steve
Spurrier vowed the Gators would not have a quarterback controversy.
Senior Doug Johnson, Spurrier said, would be No. 1 as long as he
was healthy. If all went according to plan, junior Jesse Palmer
would be redshirted.
</P>
<P>
   Seven games into the season, Spurrier has chucked his grand
plan, and the quarterbacks are very much a source of discussion as
the Gators prepare for Saturday's nationally televised game with
No. 10 Georgia (3:30 p.m., CBS).
</P>
<P>
   After watching his offense score one touchdown in six trips
inside Auburn's 20-yard line two weeks ago, Spurrier was more than
a little angry at Johnson. At least twice, Johnson checked out of a
play Spurrier called and into one that did not work. Frustrated
with Johnson's mistakes and poor decisions, Spurrier gave him an
earful, sometimes in front of the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into all of it, but there was some
miscommunication between me and the quarterback,'' Spurrier said.
``Some of it's my fault because I've got to do a better job of
coaching him. Doug's also got to play the way he's been coached.''
</P>
<P>
   So Spurrier has put Johnson on notice: If the quarterback
struggles against Georgia, Spurrier will not hesitate to pull him
and insert Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong to get that upset,'' said Spurrier of his behavior
during the 32-14 victory against Auburn. ``But we went into the
year trying to get one guy through every game, and it's not
working. I'm hoping that this is going to be good for Doug and good
for Jesse. I also think it will be good for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   What Johnson and Palmer think about this is a mystery. On
Monday, Spurrier put both quarterbacks off-limits to the media.
Neither will do interviews until after Saturday's game at
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've noticed around the country, when the quarterbacks talk a
whole bunch on the week of a big game, they usually don't play very
well on Saturday,'' Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has not played poorly all the time. He is second in the
SEC in passing efficiency and has thrown for 1,983 yards and 18
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has thrown nine interceptions, a major reason the
Gators have scored 24 touchdowns in 41 trips inside their
opponents' 20, a conversion percentage of .585. By contrast,
Spurrier's offense scored touchdowns inside the 20, 70 percent of
the time in 1990-97.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my wife (Jeri) that it really does no good to stand
there yelling at Doug,'' Spurrier said. ``So I decided that I can't
just sit back and watch some of those things happen. If they do,
then I have to get the other guy in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was the starter before breaking his collarbone midway
through last season. At the time he was injured, he had thrown for
1,246 yards and five touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   This season he has thrown for 158 yards and one touchdown, but
he has not played since the Central Florida game Sept. 11. Because
Palmer has played, he is not eligible for a redshirt unless he
sustains an injury and is granted a medical hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier said Tuesday that Johnson will start, and he expects
him to finish the game.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier said he wants to have a Plan B in case Johnson starts
making poor decisions again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Doug is going to be fine, but now we feel like we have
to come to the ballpark with Jesse ready to play,'' Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may get in there. He may not. We'll just have to see.''

DEMS GORE, BRADLEY TO DEBATE; GOP FACE-OFF FOCUSES ON BUSH'S
ABSENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H.  &UR; _ &LR;  After weeks of taunts and challenges for
debates, Vice President Al Gore will almost get his way Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   He will be on the same stage with former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey, his surprisingly strong challenger for the Democratic
presidential nomination. For an hour in a Dartmouth College theater
they'll answer questions from New Hampshire voters.
</P>
<P>
   But the seemingly antiseptic ``town hall'' format has little
built-in opportunity for the candidates to mix it up. And the
nationally televised event (8 p.m. EDT on CNN) may not add the
sizzle to the race that Gore wants as Bradley gained on him in
national polls and overtook him in surveys in early voting in New
Hampshire and other key states.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are not good for Gore's naturally confrontational
debating style and plays to Bradley's laid-back, professorial
manner. If the vice president attempts to go outside the format and
engage Bradley directly, Gore advisers as well as outside analysts
believe it could add to an impression of the vice president as a
career politician desperate to hang onto office and power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the format is not designed for candidates to engage
each other directly,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary.
Even if the vice president wanted to, Lehane said, moderators from
sponsors CNN and WMUR-TV of New Hampshire will be on hand ``solely
to make sure that does not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley aides indicated Tuesday they would welcome Gore lashing
out for a national audience _ if only because it would demonstrate
that the vice president acknowledges that he's in a real race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that people perhaps for a while had an expectation
that the vice president was the presumed nominee and are beginning
to pick up that there's a challenger who's had good inroads for
good reasons,'' said Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the Democrats made a brief campaign appearance Tuesday
in New Hampshire _ Gore at an anti-drug event in Concord and
Bradley in Claremont to tout campaign finance reform _ before going
back to prep sessions for the Dartmouth engagement. Except for
brief introductions by moderators, the hour is to be given over to
questions from an audience picked to be representative of New
Hampshire voters.
</P>
<P>
   The format will not be the problem for Republican presidential
contenders who will take the Moore Theater stage for 90 minutes
Thursday night. The bigger issue will be the absence of the
front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has refused to join
his five remaining challengers for the second GOP face-off in less
than a week.
</P>
<P>
   But with Sen. John McCain of Arizona gaining on Bush in the
Granite State, and Bradley and Gore closing the gap with him
nationally, the Texas governor has agreed to go head-to-head with
his Republican opponents Dec. 2 in New Hampshire. Earlier, Bush had
ruled out any debates this year.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore has made clear that he would keep the debate-shy Bush
under the gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am privileged to be the Democratic nominee, the first
thing I will do is propose to whoever is the Republican nominee
that we have a debate every single week on a different issue,''
Gore said Monday night during a town meeting in Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has repeatedly tried the weekly debate ploy against
Bradley, who has refused to take the bait. But the former senator
has signed up for at least six more one-on-ones with the vice
president in the three months before the opening caucuses Jan. 24
in Iowa and the primary Feb. 1 in New Hampshire. At least some of
those engagements will provide the opportunity for the candidates
to challenge each other more directly.
</P>
<P>
   In national campaigns, polling shows that presidential debates
are the single most decisive event for voters, but the role of
joint appearances in primaries is less certain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
There can be dramatic moments, such as the 1988 GOP debate in New
Hampshire when Sen. Bob Dole, fresh from a victory in Iowa, refused
to sign the anti-tax pledge expected of conservative Republicans.
Dole's refusal contributed to his New Hampshire defeat to George
Bush, who went on to win the GOP nomination and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But debates in the primary season can also be desultory affairs
in which listeners need a micrometer to detect candidates'
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Given the format Wednesday night, that is likely to be Gore's
approach as he seeks to accentuate his few ideological and policy
differences with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll ever get tough with Bradley,'' said Bill
Shaheen, Gore's New Hampshire campaign manager and husband of Gov.
Jeanne Shaheen. ``We'll take the issues where they disagree.''
That's a fairly difficult road, as Gore and Bradley voted the same
way about 80 percent of the time during their years together in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen cited ``Reaganomics,'' a reference to Bradley's vote in
1981 for President Reagan's budget cuts. Like Gore in his campaign
speeches, Shaheen did not point out that Bradley voted against
Reagan's tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Gore should decide to go after Bradley, it's uncertain
what line of attack the vice president would take.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has tried two recently.
</P>
<P>
   In one, Gore claims that while he decided to ``stand and fight''
against the Republican majorities in Congress, Bradley bugged out
on the party by refusing to seek re-election in 1996. Conversely,
Gore, while touting his centrist credentials, has argued that
Bradley, with his expense health care plan, is an old-style liberal
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``These attacks don't even fit with each other,'' Bradley
spokesman Hauser argued.

   For younger girls, ages 10 to 14, the rate was the lowest level
since 1969. Black teen-agers recorded the lowest birth rate since
1960, when such data were first gathered, and the rate among
Hispanic women also dropped precipitously, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has definitely been a decline in sexual activity among
teen-agers, both boys and girls,'' said Stephanie J. Ventura, the
government demographer who wrote the report. ``There is also more
consistent use of birth control, especially condoms. Finally, you
have to look at the widespread attention this subject has gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   The positive trend showed up across the country, with 10 states
and the District of Columbia recording declines of more than 20
percent. Vermont and Alaska had the biggest declines, while Rhode
Island, Arkansas and Puerto Rico recorded the smallest. But even
with the lower numbers across the country, health officials said
they still saw far too many unintended births.
</P>
<P>
   Babies were crying at the Hart Infant Center not far from the
Capitol, and Betty Lightfoot, the director, was not sure she had
heard the news correctly. Teen-age pregnancies were really down for
the seventh straight year? she asked. The teen-age birth rate here
really fell 20 percent from 1991 to 1997?
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's so, it's great,'' Ms. Lightfoot said. ``But our day
care for teen mothers is still full. We still have a maximum of 10
here and a maximum of 20 at another site. Girls are still having
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lightfoot cares for three babies who were all born to one
17-year-old girl. The young mother drops her children off at the
center in the morning and goes to high school classes during the
day. She is pregnant with her fourth child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a problem,'' said Ms. Lightfoot, who was herself a
mother at the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials agree. Despite the decline, they said, teen-age
birth rates in the United States still far exceed those in all the
other industrialized countries. The statistics also show that the
proportion of births to teen-agers who are unmarried continued to
increase in 1998, to 78.8 percent from 78.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get to where the rest of the developed world is, we have a
lot of work to do,'' said Kristin Moore of Child Trends, a research
and advocacy group in Washington. ``Our lowest state has a rate
equal to about the highest rate in the developed world.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age birth rate in the United States is in the same
league with that of the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and
Turkey, Ms. Ventura said. Japan, France, Germany and Britain have
teen-age birth rates that are significantly smaller than those in
the United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Brown, director of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen
Pregnancy, an advocacy group in Washington, was attending a
conference Tuesday on teen-age pregnancy in South Carolina. Mrs.
Brown said in a telephone interview that one person at the
conference reported that an 8-year-old girl and a 9-year-old girl
had recently became mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principal challenge among those of us working in the field
is to avoid a sense of complacency,'' Mrs. Brown said. ``This new
data is terrific news, but we still remain the industrialized
country with the highest degree of teen pregnancy and abortion. And
even if we don't compare ourselves to other countries, we still
have too many girls giving birth.''
</P>
<P>
   The birth rates among minority girls are falling particularly
fast, the report found. But the birth rates for Hispanic and black
teen-agers were still considerably higher than those for whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the decreases have been remarkable in our
community, we still have a higher rate of unintended pregnancies
and abortions than white women,'' said Shelia Clark, public policy
associate at the National Black Women's Health Project. ``We still
have to work on issues of poverty. We have to work on education.
This is not a dead issue.''
</P>
<P>
   How to get the numbers to decline ever further remains the
challenge. Miss Clark points to opportunity as one answer. ``When
you give people in general _ and African-Americans in particular _
increased access to education and employment, you increase their
quality of life and reduce the number of unintended pregnancies,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the District's schools, officials have health centers in the
high schools to distribute condoms and educate students on sex.
There are also child care centers to allow teen-age mothers to
continue their studies, and a program called Teen Moms Take Charge
to teach pre-natal care and prevent more births.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lightfoot, who sees the young mothers drop off their
children in her center every day, also tries to use her own
experience as a teen-age mother to educate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard for me,'' said Ms. Lightfoot, who is 42. ``It was
like one minute I had a doll and then the next minute I had a real
baby. I share everything I've gone through. How I had to put
everything in my life off. Maybe one day they'll listen.''

`PRINCESS MONONOKE' LANDING IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: for publication Thursday, Oct. 28 or thereafter) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Princess Mononoke'' will be many Americans'
introduction to anime, the Japanese feature-cartoon cycle that has
developed cult followings all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping the meeting won't be too traumatic.
</P>
<P>
   Anime operates on a somewhat more sophisticated level than the
Disney-dominated, feature-length animation films of our country.
Not that much more sophisticated _ if American cartoon features are
made for a juvenile consciousness, the Japanese versions don't aim
much higher than adolescence _ but anime usually involves much more
blood and thunder and, often, sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's ``Mononoke,'' which opens Friday _ an
ecological allegory filled with complexity and ambiguity. More than
two hours long (the standard animated feature can sustain around 90
minutes), ``Mononoke'' is the biggest Japanese film hit in that
country's history, having grossed some $150 million. Only
``Titanic'' has sold more tickets there.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's director, Hayao Miyazaki, is already the best-known
anime creator outside of Japan. Two of his earlier films, ``My
Neighbor Totoro'' and ``Kiki's Delivery Service,'' have been
released stateside in dubbed versions. But those efforts weren't
nearly as big and elaborate as the work Miramax Films has put into
making ``Mononoke'' accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Gaiman, an acclaimed fantasy novelist and writer of the
popular ``Sandman'' graphic novel series, wrote the screenplay
translation. Top English-language actors who provided voices
include Claire Danes, Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, Billy Bob
Thornton, Gillian Anderson and Jada Pinkett Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very anxious when the film was released in Japan,''
Miyazaki, a white-haired gent in thick black-rimmed glasses and a
sharp gray linen jacket, says through an interpreter. ``So it's
very painful to have to re-experience that anxiety two years after
I made the picture!''
</P>
<P>
   Miyazaki is an incorrigible joker, but there are good reasons to
be apprehensive about ``Princess Mononoke's'' U.S. debut. Perhaps
most obvious is its depiction of horror and violence. Set in the
Middle Ages, the film charts a war between various human factions
and animal gods trying to preserve their encroached-upon forest.
</P>
<P>
   The film has been given a PG-13 rating. There are bloody samurai
decapitations and dismemberments and grotesque monstrosities
throughout _ not images your average preschooler's parents expect
to encounter at the cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Not in North America, anyway. Miyazaki claims to have made a
movie for children, and perhaps he has in the context of Japan's
graphically violent pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely confident that I've never used violence to sell
my picture,'' Miyazaki, 58, contends. ``I'm sure there's a
possibility that some parents will be upset. But one of the things
that I wanted to portray in my film is that violence is, indeed, a
part of human essence. The issue is how to manage it and how to
control it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's foolish to say that the presence of violence in a
film makes it a bad picture for children. The truth is that, in
their daily lives, they encounter violence inside themselves and
around them. The issue is to try to help them address what to do
with it, not to ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miramax, at least officially, is having none of that line. The
Disney subsidiary is making every effort to present ``Mononoke'' as
an art film, not a family entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't market this as fun for kids of all ages,'' notes
Mark Gill, president of Miramax L.A. ``It isn't really for
families, it's for teen-agers and adults. This makes it a novelty
in America. But the good news is, if you're going to be different
enough to not be for kids, you ought to be a lot different. And
this film, thankfully, is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're treating it a lot more like you would treat a
director-driven art film, like a Jane Campion movie, for example,''
Gill continues. ``What is customarily done with animated films here
_ the huge wide release, the multimillion-dollar ad campaigns, the
fast-food tie-ins _ none of that will apply here.''
</P>
<P>
   The art-film approach certainly resonated for script-adapter
Gaiman, who had no intention of writing a translation but was so
impressed by what he saw that he agreed to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was busy, I planned to say no when I was asked to write it,
but I agreed to go to a screening,'' Gaiman recalls. ``I came out
of that screening two hours and 13 minutes later thinking it was an
important and magnificent film. I would treat it with respect and
love. And if I said no, the next person they asked may not have
treated it with respect and love.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaiman had to bridge another cultural chasm between the Japanese
film and American audiences. ``Mononoke'' presumes viewer
familiarity with Japanese customs and myths. In the English
version, many of the plot turns and actions had to be verbally
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Lyrically, too, whenever possible. And in the exact number of
syllables a given character can be seen mouthing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the time, I'd come up with a beautiful line full of
elegance and power and passion, which captured everything the
Japanese were trying to say, plus, I felt, added an extra spin on
it,'' a frustrated Gaiman reveals. ``And if only the character
moved their mouth one more time, we could've used it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more daunting for U.S. audiences than the graphic
gore and cultural details may be the film's purposely ambiguous
take on its central theme. The people tearing up the forest are
social outcasts merely trying to survive (and under constant attack
from other human factions); the animal gods can't agree on strategy
and can be as cruel as they are noble. The title character herself,
a human girl raised by a wolf goddess, is torn between dual
natures.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it's a far cry from the simple good-guy/bad-guy,
nature-good/civilization-evil plot lines that move American
animated features from Disney's ``Tarzan'' to ``FernGully.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, nature is both rich and brutal,'' Miyazaki
explains. ``Civilization is our effort to overcome disease, and the
issue of civilization vs. ecology is hardly a simple issue to
resolve. Lots of people populate `Princess Mononoke.' I didn't want
to highlight their ugliness and their worst, but I tried to
highlight their best intentions and efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But still, they have to destroy the forest. If you had had a
real estate developer in the movie, it would have been very simple:
Just kill the developer and all of the evil forces go away. But the
kids wouldn't fall for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't guessed by now, Miyazaki is a tough critic
and something of a pessimist, most pronouncedly so when it comes to
the art form he's so thoroughly mastered and, with each new film,
continues to revitalize.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an airplane-parts manufacturer, Miyazaki studied
political science and economics at college (and was reportedly a
dedicated Marxist for many years), but took a job at an animation
studio upon graduating. He made his directing debut with the 1979
``Castle of Cagliostro,'' and in 1984 brought the sci-fi-based
anime form to a new plateau of realism with the dystopian
environmental fable ``Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.'' In
1985, he formed Studio Ghibli with fellow animator Isao Takahata,
where he's been making films ever since.
</P>
<P>
   As with ``Mononoke's'' forest, however, anime's future is in
doubt, according to Miyazaki. So is his own; it's been reported
that his eyesight is failing. Apparently, though, he's never had
much hope for the medium he's excelled in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt like I've lived in a time when it was good to
make animation,'' he explains. ``You're always in a battle for time
and money. Certainly, we've done our best. But it's not improving.
I actually don't have high hopes for Japanese animation. There are
certainly plenty of cults around the world that are interested in
anime, but I can't tell you I have great expectations that it will
grow into mainstream acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one individual can gather a lot of energy and move it on
into a new direction, then there's hope,'' he adds. ``But it has to
be taken beyond where we are. It's creatively stagnant.''
</P>
<P>
   One might think the guy to do that would be Hayao Miyazaki.
After all, that's what many critics feel he does with each new
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's missing most is my own talent; if I were more talented,
I would be able to churn them out,'' he says with a laugh. ``But
I'm talking about people in their 20s and 30s. I'm out of the
question. I'm over the hill, an old guy.''
</P>
<P>
   He grins slyly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just let me die in peace!'' &QL;

EXCLUSIVE: CLINTON TO PROPOSE NEW RULES TO PROTECT PRIVACY OF
MEDICAL RECORDS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will soon announce sweeping new
federal rules to protect the privacy of billions of medical records
and will assail Congress for failing to enact any safeguards,
administration officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulations would be the first comprehensive
federal standards specifically intended to protect the
confidentiality of medical records. They come at a time when
doctors, hospitals, pharmacists and health maintenance
organizations are sharing more and more data, often without the
knowledge of patients, and insurance companies are demanding more
information to justify the payment of claims.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals would cover any medical records that are kept or
transmitted electronically, as well as paper printouts of
electronic transactions. Patients would generally have a right to
review and copy their medical records, and to supplement the
records or correct mistakes, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Most medical records are still kept on paper, but a growing
number of health plans require doctors to submit claims
electronically. In practice, health care experts said, the proposed
rules would set standards for all medical records because it is not
practical for doctors and insurers to follow different policies for
the use and disclosure of personal medical information kept in
different forms.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been trying to write such protections into law, but
the effort has stalled. In 1996, Congress imposed a deadline on
itself, requiring the secretary of health and human services to
issue privacy rules if lawmakers failed to pass health privacy
legislation by Aug. 21, 1999. The administration's new proposals
carry out that requirement.
</P>
<P>
   In offering the proposed rules, White House officials said,
Clinton will try to achieve three political purposes. He will put
pressure on Congress to pass legislation. He will present himself
as a champion of privacy rights, a politically popular cause. And,
by making aggressive use of his power, he will try to counter the
perception of himself as a lame duck.
</P>
<P>
   The president expressed impatience on Monday, when he criticized
Republicans for blocking his proposal to provide prescription drug
benefits under Medicare. In a fleeting reference to his next
initiative, Clinton said: ``Because they have not taken action to
protect the privacy of medical records, I will use the power of my
office to do that in the coming days. I think that's a very
important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said: ``We would have preferred that Congress pass
bipartisan legislation. They gave themselves three years to do it.
But in the absence of action on Capitol Hill, the president will
act.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House is still negotiating some details with law
enforcemicials, who want to be sure the privacy rules do not
hamper their investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are also analyzing the cost of the proposals.
A recent study by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association said
that compliance with such standards could cost tens of billions of
dollars because health care providers, health plans and insurance
companies would have to retrain employees, hire privacy experts,
rewrite contracts and reprogram computers.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials are compiling data to show that those
cost estimates are grossly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules appear stricter than the comparable
provisions of a landmark bill hammered out last week to overhaul
the nation's financial system. Under that bill, divisions of a big
financial conglomerate _ for example, an insurance company and a
consumer bank _ could share information about a customer under many
circumstances, and they would have to inform customers at least
once a year of their policies on privacy and disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Under the medical privacy rules, an insurer would also have to
inform the subscriber of its privacy practices, but it would be
more difficult for the insurer to share health information with an
affiliated company. In most cases, the insurer would have to get
the consumer's permission before allowing use of the information
for purposes unrelated to medical treatment or the payment of
claims.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules will probably not go far enough to satisfy
psychiatrists, but may go too far for some law enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul S. Appelbaum, vice president of the American
Psychiatric Association, said: ``The administration's proposal
would protect notes taken by a therapist in the course of
psychotherapy, and that's good. But it would take away some of the
power that patients have traditionally had to decide when and if
their records are released to third parties.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, law enforcement agencies would need a search
warrant, a subpoena or some other legal authorization to get
confidential medical records. Federal, state and local law
enforcement officials said they wanted to preserve their ability to
get immediate access to medical information without a warrant in
emergencies _ when they are investigating a bomb threat or trying
to rescue hostages, for example.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   John R. Justice, chairman of the National District Attorneys
Association, said investigators often did not have enough time or
specific information to get a warrant for medical records in
``exigent circumstances.'' For example, he said, the police may ask
local hospitals to notify them if a fleeing suspect shows up for
treatment of a gunshot wound. And the police may want to know about
the health problems of a person who is holding hostages or being
held hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The public will have an opportunity to comment on the proposed
rules. Under the 1996 law, the secretary of health and human
services must issue final rules by Feb. 21 of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on health privacy in and out of the government said the
proposed rules also included these provisions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Health care providers and HMO's would not have to get a
patient's consent before disclosing information needed for medical
treatment or the payment of claims. But they would have to get the
patient's consent if the information was to be used for marketing
and certain types of research.
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal rules would establish minimum protections for
patients' privacy and would not override any contrary provisions of
state law that were ``more stringent'' than the federal
requirements. Many states provide more protection in specific areas
like mental health, genetic testing, AIDS or other sexually
transmitted diseases. These state laws would not be pre-empted by
the federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   _ Before disclosing information, doctors would have to take
reasonable steps to make sure they did not disclose more
information than was actually needed to accomplish the purpose of
the request. The rules would forbid the wholesale release of entire
records when a small part would suffice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Doctors, hospitals and health plans could charge a reasonable
fee to cover the cost of copying records.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, doctors and hospitals can be fined up to
$50,000 for the improper disclosure of confidential medical
information, and they are subject to larger fines if they sell such
data for ``commercial advantage'' or ``malicious harm.'' Under the
proposed rules, patients would not gain any new federal right to
sue a doctor or an HMO for divulging medical records. Federal
officials said that only Congress could create a new right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules would provide additional protection for some
sensitive personal information in mental health records, but not as
much protection as many psychiatrists want.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, a psychotherapist would not need a patient's
consent to disclose information about the diagnosis of a condition,
the patient's level of functioning or medications when such
information was necessary for treatment or for the payment of
claims. But the therapist would have to get the patient's consent
before disclosing more detailed information about a patient's
feelings, family relationships or sexual relationships.

SENATORS PROPOSE NEW SYSTEM TO CHOOSE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON and JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying that the current system of front-loaded
presidential primaries makes no sense, two senators Tuesday
proposed a dramatic restructuring of the way the country chooses
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal from Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., is for a rotating system of four regional
primaries, each including 12 or 13 states, that would become
effective in the 2004 presidential election. The primaries would be
held on the first Tuesdays of March, April, May and June.
</P>
<P>
   While the proposal is not new, the two senators hope the idea
will pick up steam when people see next year's primary schedule and
realize how many states have crammed their primaries into just a
few weeks, leaving candidates little choice but to ignore most
small states.
</P>
<P>
   But a leading Northwest opinion expert said he doubts that even
the ``insane front loading'' of next year's presidential primaries
will provoke any outcry from the public demanding a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty sorry process, but I don't see voters that wound
up about it,'' said Portland-based Tim Hibbitts. ``Voter interest
in politics and politicians is the lowest in the 25 years I have
been polling.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing their legislation yesterday, Gorton and Lieberman
argued that the current system exaggerates the importance of Iowa
and New Hampshire, the earliest caucus and primary states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's neither fair nor rational that a few select states
dictate the outcome of every presidential race,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   After the two early states, candidates are forced to campaign
through television advertising to reach voters in the multiple
states holding primaries at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The process next year is concentrated in a six-week period that
will begin with Iowa's caucuses on Jan. 31. The result, Republican
consultant Brett Bader warned yesterday, is that ``the primaries
will begin and end, for all practical purposes, a full 10 months
before the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, a record 42 Republican state primaries were held,
nearly three quarters of them in the first three months of the
year. For 2000, the calendar (has been) accelerated even more, and
46 Republican and at least 37 Democratic primaries are scheduled,''
veteran political journalist Jules Whitcover reports in his new
book ``No Way to Pick a President.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, for example, Washington is holding a primary on Feb.
29, the same day as North Dakota and Virginia. Gorton said the
distance between the states impairs candidates' ability to reach
any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said the same will happen on March 7, when his state,
Connecticut, holds a primary on the same date as California and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no way the candidates are going to adequately
campaign in those states, and give the voters a chance to meet
them, hear them, and so what you're going to have is again the
rising factor of money, because the candidates won't be able to be
in all those places at once,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton and Lieberman also decried the influence of Iowa and New
Hampshire, which by tradition have become the first states to hold
votes and as a result have a disproportionate influence in choosing
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion is widely held by political activists of both
parties around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of New Hampshire and Iowa having the starting
position every time is not a rational way of choosing party
nominees,'' said former Washington Gov. Mike Lowry, who ran against
Gorton for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said the two senators would now push the Senate rules
committee to hold hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see constantly in the newspapers and on television
protests against the irrational nature of the way in which we're
doing things today, and our colleagues sort of grouse about it,''
Gorton said. ``We just decided to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The senators said that the biggest obstacle to passage of the
proposal is that senators from Iowa and New Hampshire would
strenuously object to anything that altered their states'
prominence.

   ``When you think about it, more voters in the country certainly
would benefit from this regional primary approach, and of course we
think the country and the campaign would benefit. ... I understand
the local interests of New Hampshire and Iowa, but overall the
current system is not serving the country,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime student of presidential politics, Western Washington
University political scientist Eugene Hogan, warned that the two
states will fiercely defend their first-in-the-nation status.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa caucuses launched Jimmy Carter on the road to the White
House in 1976, and have been a make-or-break first test ever since.
New Hampshire has enjoyed its privileged first-primary status for a
half-century. It began picking presidents with Dwight Eisenhower's
victory in the 1952 GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd have to blast the primary out of the Granite State,''
said Hogan, referring to New Hampshire.

ST. MARTIN'S EDITOR-IN-CHIEF QUITS AFTER RECALL OF BUSH BIOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The editor-in-chief of St. Martin's Press abruptly
resigned from the company Tuesday in another sign of continuing
turmoil at the New York publishing house following its cancellation
of a biography of Texas Gov. George W. Bush by an author with a
criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-paragraph statement announcing his resignation, Robert
B. Wallace stressed that he and his staff of 20 editors at St.
Martin's Press had no control over the publication of J.H.
Hatfield's ``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and the Making of An
American.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's resignation came just five days after St. Martin's
Press recalled the books from stores, saying that it no longer
trusted the author because he had lied to the publishing house
about a criminal record that included a conviction 11 years ago for
hiring a hit man in a foiled attempt to kill his boss with a car
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The biography, published by the St. Martin's imprint, Thomas
Dunne Books, included an afterword containing allegations from
anonymous sources that Bush was arrested in 1972 for cocaine
possession, a record supposedly expunged by a judge as a favor to
Bush's father, former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he was quitting his position of three years because
``I do not in any way wish to have my name associated with
`Fortunate Son' or future books published by Thomas Dunne Books
over which I have no control.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's sudden resignation jolted St. Martin's, one of the top
10 publishers of trade books in the United States. The company
dispensed with the usual diplomatic announcements customary for
executive departures. Instead, St. Martin's countered that several
weeks before publication, Wallace read the afterword ``and advised
on various aspects of the book's launch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time prior to its release,'' the company continued,
``did he object to the afterword or the publication of the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he had read the afterword, but he said, ``I was
never given a copy of the manuscript or the book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have not read the book,'' Wallace said, ``and, for all
I know, it could be as good as `War and Peace.' I was looped out of
the process until the last minute, and for them to say that I could
have by that point affected the publication of the book is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press president and publisher Sally Richardson said
she had spent the last four days, up until 3 a.m. Tuesday, trying
to persuade Wallace to remain at the company. ``I don't understand
why he's leaving a job over this,'' Ms. Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's clearly in pain,'' she added. ``If you talk to him, he's
miserable so it's sincere. But I'll never understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Former and current employees at St. Martin's said that it was
entirely plausible that the editor-in-chief was not informed early
enough about the sensitive book, which was considered so secret at
the company that St. Martin's sales representatives referred to the
title by the code, ``M.J.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees said there had been tension between Wallace and Thomas
Dunne, a longstanding employee at the company who had been passed
over for the top editor's position when Wallace, a former ABC
producer and Rolling Stone editor, was tapped for his first
position in book publishing. The Bush biography was acquired,
edited and published by Dunne's imprint, a separate line of books
with its own logo that is distinct from the St. Martin's Press
brand.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said it bothered him to receive calls from friends who
had the mistaken impression that he had been involved in the
publishing process. St. Martin's executives and Wallace remain at
odds about exactly when he learned about the biography. Although
executives said he knew about the book for weeks, Wallace said that
his advice was sought only days before publication in an
eleventh-hour meeting Oct. 15. The meeting was called, he said,
after it became clear that the New York Times would not publish a
story about the book because it could not corroborate the book's
more explosive allegations.

   St. Martin's Press, a leading publisher of popular titles in
mystery, science-fiction and crime, is part of Verlagsgruppe Georg
von Holtzbrinck, a German media conglomerate based in Stuttgart,
which also owns in the United States the more literary publishers,
Henry Holt and Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. St. Martin's, with revenues
estimated last year at about $175 million, is the largest
publishing house in Holtzbrinck's American holdings. It has long
had a reputation for buying books for modest advances and then
offering a vast number of titles published in small print runs.
While other publishers have been pruning their lists of titles to
focus their efforts, St. Martin's has continued to publish about
1,800 titles a year.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wallace's leadership as editor-in-chief, the company
posted five best sellers on the New York Times list this year,
including non-fiction books about Monica Lewinsky, Eddie Fisher and
John Bayley, the author of ``Elegy for Iris,'' a book about his
wife's struggle with Alzheimer's disease. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Janet Tiebout Hanson, leaving Goldman, Sachs
after 14 years was ``like stepping off a cliff.'' She had risen to
vice president, after spending her entire professional career at
the Wall Street firm, with all the power and prestige it conferred.
</P>
<P>
   But having spent three years away to take care of her children,
Meredith, now 11, and Christopher, 8, Ms. Hanson found that being
back at the investment banking firm was a huge disappointment.
Changes in technology at the firm left her feeling out of touch,
and she found her new position in marketing for the asset
management division frustrating. ``I wasn't special, and they
weren't special,'' Ms. Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the plunge, she founded Milestone Capital Management in
1994. Now in Yonkers, it has nearly $3 billion under management,
and she no longer has to commute from Bronxville to lower
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Her experience got her to thinking. She had been one of just a
few women professionals at Goldman, Sachs. Her male colleagues had
honed networking over the decades into a science, whether it was
schmoozing at the club or doing deals on the golf course. Those who
ascended could rely on an endless supply of contacts to help them
on their way.
</P>
<P>
   But what about all the women who had left? Some had not worked
for several years, staying at home with their children, and they
found their Rolodexes out of date and their skills rusty. Others
were thinking about starting their own businesses, in hopes of
greater opportunities. All of them would benefit by pooling their
contacts.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Hanson created an organization two years ago called 85
Broads, a playful reference to the Goldman location at 85 Broad St.
There is nothing quite like 85 Broads. Other corporate alumni
networks exist, though few are active. One exception is McKinsey &AMP;
Co., which has a page of news and information about its 8,500
former consultants on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Among other women's networks, the Financial Women's Association
of New York has about 1,100 members. Female graduates of the
Harvard Business School have set up clubs in several cities,
including one in New York that caters to a ``ready-made group'' of
1,600 peers, according to Karen Page, founder of the Harvard
network. Then there is the Committee of 200, a organization of
high-profile professional women.
</P>
<P>
   But 85 Broads is unusual in being a women-only corporate alumni
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I can do this is that I made it out of Goldman into
a successful entrepreneurial experience,'' Ms. Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, about 70 former Goldman women have joined the club,
including not only stay-at-home mothers but also many big names in
American business and finance like Anne Cassells, the chief
investment officer for Stanford University; Karen Cook, a partner
at Steinhardt Management in New York; and Leelee Clement Doughty,
an executive recruiter for Heidrick &AMP; Struggles in Los Angeles.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the well-known managing director at Goldman, is
an honorary member.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the group started its own Web site,
www.85broads.com, as a way for women to connect outside of special
events. Catherine Banat, a former Goldman professional with
7-year-old twins, a son and a daughter, is its volunteer president,
having quit Lehman Bros. six months ago to decide what she should
do next.
</P>
<P>
   Only members have access to the site. Logging on, they can find
the names and phone numbers of former colleagues, many of whom have
individual profiles on the site, and can exchange tips and
informations.
</P>
<P>
   The 85 Broads club is an attempt to replicate some of the
aspects of the traditional old boys' network, in which phone calls
are always taken and people are quick to make referrals. ``Women
haven't networked as well as they should _ or can,'' said Noreen
Harrington, who worked at Goldman for 11 years and is one of the 85
Broads. ``We're not always our best asset.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After leaving Barclays Capital last year as the co-head of fixed
income for Europe, Ms. Harrington is trying to establish a money
management firm with some others and expects to use contacts in 85
Broads as a way to share information.
</P>
<P>
   Though the site is not fully off the ground, members are using
it to share information about how to work for political candidates
like Jon Corzine, the former Goldman co-chairman who is running for
the U.S. Senate from New Jersey, and noting articles on current
Goldman executives. There are places where they can peruse
``favorite'' lists of books and vacations, and the site even plans
to create a chat room for Wall Street gossip.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Redinger, who left Goldman in the late 1980s, has not
worked since her daughter, now 7, was born. ``I'm trying to figure
out how to take back some of my life without sacrificing my
family's life,'' said Ms. Redinger, who lives in a Cleveland
suburb. ``I never thought I would miss pantyhose,'' she said with a
laugh. Ms. Hanson is helping her find out what certification she
might need to return to financial services.
</P>
<P>
   For a suburban housewife with applesauce stains on her T-shirt,
knowing that you can ask the advice of a former colleague who is
still in the thick of the business can be a lifeline. Too often,
women who have stayed at home for a while feel embarrassed about no
longer being considered a heavy hitter. ``You're no longer part of
that club,'' Ms. Hanson explained.
</P>
<P>
   It probably should not be surprising that 85 Broads was formed
in the Goldman milieu. The firm has always boasted of recruiting
the best and the brightest, and its new hires became very close as
they went through its rigorous training programs. This was
particularly true in the 1970s and '80s, when Goldman was much
smaller and the atmosphere was more intimate.
</P>
<P>
   Women professionals forged especially strong bonds as outsiders
in a mostly male culture. ``It was probably the most exciting time
of my professional career,'' said Phyllis Esposito, who left
Goldman in 1990 to found Artemis Capital with some other women
investment professionals and is now a senior partner at Mathias &AMP;
Co., a financial services consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The 85 Broads group ``is a tremendous source of individual and
professional talent,'' she said. ``We are proud to claim our
Goldman heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Goldman women still connect, although it may have been years
since some last worked together and some had never met, according
to Ms. Hanson. She remembers the ``camaraderie and excitement'' of
a dinner she organized two years ago for about 30 of her former
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hanson says she realized the full power of networking
shortly after she created Milestone, her money management firm. She
was having lunch with Ms. Esposito, then a senior managing director
at Bear Stearns, who urged her to market her fund there. She did
so, and now she credits Ms. Esposito's backing with helping
Milestone get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a win-win for all of us,'' Ms. Esposito recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of women who are able to break through the
so-called glass ceiling into the upper echelons of corporate
America remains small, and Wall Street is particularly viewed as an
inhospitable place to work. About 11 percent of Goldman's 693
managing directors are women.
</P>
<P>
   Since networking on a professional level often involves
connecting mostly with men, women often develop another network to
talk to other women, according to Herminia Ibarra, a professor at
the Harvard Business School. The other network represents a forum
where there are enough women facing similar issues, like the
difficulty advancing or the challenge of raising children while
working.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hanson wants her group to serve as a resource for current
Goldman women, too, many of whom may face the same quandary she did
in deciding whether to take time off or leave. ``My biggest hopes
for 85 Broads is that women at Goldman, Sachs will reach out to us
in a way, informally,'' Ms. Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where was this group 10 years ago?'' she asked.

IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE: BEST WAYS TO MEET AND GREET
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   People who do not belong to a ready-made career network like 85
Broads or the Harvard Business School alumni clubs may need to be
creative in thinking about how to establish and use networks. There
are various networks, but joining them is not always useful,
according to Dee Soder, a career adviser for executives in New York
at the CEO Perspective Group. ``The people you want to meet and
interact with are generally not going to go to those things,'' Ms.
Soder said.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the best way to meet and greet? Ms. Soder says
focusing on organizations that you feel strongly about _ Girls
Inc., say, or City Meals on Wheels _ can be a good way for
like-minded men and women to get together. At a private reception
recently at the Economic Club of New York, for example, she made a
variety of contacts.
</P>
<P>
   People looking to connect should also not limit themselves to
one vehicle, says Herminia Ibarra, a Harvard Business School
professor. She suggests exploring a broad variety of informal and
formal ones, based on your interests and location. Join a local
alumni club, for example, as well as specific professional
associations. The more networks you join, the more opportunities
and ideas, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Here, at least, women may have an advantage. ``Women are far
more likely to have a variety of people they know than men are,''
Ms. Soder said.

 Mervyn Rothstein, an editor in the Real Estate section of The New
York Times, often interviewed Joseph Papp.  
 By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Michael Weller's new satirical comedy, ``The Heart of Art,''
a character named Arthur Dick is the short, mercurial,
cigar-smoking impresario of the People Playhouse in Manhattan, a
home to ``challenging drama'' and ``provocative playwrights.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick has had a ``huge impact on American theater'' and has
fostered the careers of many young writers, but he needs to be a
father figure, meddles with their plays and becomes involved in
feuds. He is, in the words of one angry dramatist, the ``collective
nightmare of every playwright since the dawn of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Weller, 57, is best known for his 1988 play ``Spoils of War,''
the 1970s plays ``Moonchildren'' and ``Loose Ends'' and his
screenplays for ``Hair'' and ``Ragtime.'' He had three other works
_ all flops _ produced in the 1970s and '80s by Joseph Papp, the
short, mercurial, cigar-smoking impresario of the Public Theater, a
home to challenging drama and provocative playwrights.
</P>
<P>
   But Weller says that Arthur Dick is not really Joseph Papp. And
that, despite Weller's Public Theater flops, he has fond memories
of Papp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used, may he forgive me, the shell of Joseph Papp,'' Weller
said at a coffee shop down the block from the People Playhouse _
er, the Public Theater. ``But I put into the character all the
producers who have made me feel, `My God, I have to deal with these
people every time I do a show.'''
</P>
<P>
   Papp, who died in 1991, was once called the most important force
in the English-speaking theater. He championed the work of many
young playwrights, among them David Rabe, John Guare, David Hare
and George C. Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, needed to be a father figure. And his relationships
with his playwrights could be volatile. Rabe did not speak to Papp
for four years after one disagreement, and Sam Shepard vowed never
to work for Papp again _ and kept his vow _ after a dispute over
the handling of his play ``True West'' in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Heart of Art,'' a young playwright, Kyle Wayward,
encounters Dick, who is seeking a new protege after the last one
has called him a ghoul and stomped out. ``I can make a famous
playwright out of anyone who walks through my door,'' Dick says.
And he decides, without even reading Wayward's script, to make him
a star.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heart of Art,'' presented by the Hypothetical Theater
Company, opens Sunday at the New 14th Street Y. It has been staged
by Amy Feinberg, the company's artistic director, with Alan
Corduner in the role of Arthur Dick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my play to get bogged down in an argument about
how close this is to reality,'' Weller said. ``If I was doing a
play about a real person, a rounded character, there are huge
things about a man like Joe Papp that I would use to leaven the
portrait. But I'm not doing that. I'm writing a travesty. I wanted
to create a larger-than-life character who's not stopped by any
considerations of reality. He just plows on. I love that in the
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Weller said he had not known Papp very well. ``I remember other
playwrights telling me he would try to make himself a father to
you,'' he said. ``I thought they were just exaggerating. But after
`More Than You Deserve' opened'' _ Weller's musical that flopped _
``he gave me a Columbia Encyclopedia. I had never received an
opening-night present from a producer that specific. It's usually
flowers or champagne. But this was quite thoughtful. I said: `Thank
you very much, Papp. It's quite considerate of you.' He looked at
me and said, out of nowhere, `I'm not your father.' And I thought,
`I see where these people get this idea.'''
</P>
<P>
   Weller said his situation at the Public Theater was unusual
because his successes, ``Moonchildren'' and ``Loose Ends,'' had
happened elsewhere. ``I would come to the Public and do another
flop,'' he said. ``Papp was a stalwart supporter. I met all these
playwrights who were crazed about him, who were outright bitter.
But because my career was salvaged elsewhere, I saw him in a very
different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Weller acknowledged that there were occasional problems,
especially with Papp's temper. ``You depended on him when you were
doing a play,'' he said, ``so when he would get into one of his
tirades you would have to manage him out of it. But if anything, I
felt a bit protective about him. He struck me as a kind of sweet,
lonely guy. I always felt I wanted to hug him and say, `It's OK,
Joe, don't worry about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many playwrights and actors have expressed highly positive
feelings toward Papp. At his funeral, Meryl Streep called him her
hero, the only boss she ever loved. Albert Innaurato has said he
considered Papp a colleague rather than a producer.
</P>
<P>
   But Weller said that the pros and cons of Joe Papp are not the
point. ``What I'm really writing about,'' he said, ``is a certain
kind of theater making. I wanted it to be humorous. I got rid of
all the stuff I usually pin motivation on, such as social context,
and tried to make it all driven by the force of Arthur Dick's
personality. There's a kind of insanity in the making of a play.
Everybody invests huge amounts of their lives in this thing, which
is, as Terrence McNally said, just a play. I'm always looking at
how silly it is for me and everybody to be getting so wound up in
what is, after all, just a way to entertain people for a few
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Weller, who lives in the East Village, is involved in the new
Mentor Project at the nonprofit Cherry Lane Alternative, a program
in which five established playwrights _ himself, Tony Kushner,
Wendy Wasserstein, A.R. Gurney and Charles Fuller _ work with five
younger playwrights developing the younger writers' plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people keep trying to do theater,'' he said. ``All
this talent is astonishing. It seems never to get exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   And part of the credit for the New York theater's continued
energy, he said, belongs to Papp. ``One person in New York who
would have definitely put on my play,'' Weller said, ``is Joseph
Papp.''

   In May 1994, Jeff Treuhaft, 25, joined a little Silicon Valley
start-up called Mosaic, later to be renamed Netscape Communications
Corp. The pace was brutal _ 18 hours a day, seven days a week in
the early months _ but the work was exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really tough part was that my son was 9 weeks old when I
started at Netscape,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Treuhaft has two more children and a tidy nest
egg from the sale of Netscape this year to America Online. Like
many former Netscape executives, he is stepping back from the front
lines of the Internet business, working part time as an investor
and adviser to a few start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Treuhaft finds himself free to play with his children,
feed them lunch, even tag along on a school field trip to the
pumpkin patch down the road. ``It seems mundane stuff,'' he said,
``but when you finally get a chance to do it, you appreciate it.''

   At Microsoft, Netscape's main rival in the infamous Internet
browser battle, some have made similar personal choices. Brad
Silverberg, a former senior vice president, took a sabbatical in
the summer of 1997 to decompress after directing Microsoft's
hurried march to catch up and then gain leadership in the Internet
software business. He took a solo bicycle trip through the Canadian
Rockies, spent time with his wife and two children and thought
about all the personal things that had been shunted aside for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is the one thing you cannot get back,'' said Silverberg,
45, who now works part time as an investor and adviser to
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off choices made in so many American households of
personal life vs. work, time vs. money, are magnified in the
Internet economy. The time pressure is so intense because a lead of
just a few weeks or months over a rival can be a huge competitive
advantage in the Internet land rush. And the financial rewards for
the front-runners can be astronomical.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the Internet is going to be a transforming technology,
like electricity, it must spread throughout the economy and
society, as it finds new uses and new customers.
</P>
<P>
   That process, inevitably, will take time. It means carefully
building big Internet businesses, not just starting them. Internet
``cruising speed'' will become a valued skill and a competitive
edge.
</P>
<P>
   For both companies and individuals, that means pacing, in one
way or another, in a race that is becoming more a marathon and less
a sprint. As the Internet economy matures, high-technology
companies are expanding programs and policies intended to help
harried workers balance their personal lives and the demands of
work. A greater use of flexible hours, part-time work, day care,
sabbaticals and longer vacations are all part of that effort.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Radford division of the benefits firm Aon
Consulting, average vacation time offered by high-technology
companies has steadily increased in recent years. Forty-one percent
even offer full vacation benefits to new recruits during their
first year of employment, and 10 percent of Silicon Valley
companies now offer sabbaticals, Radford reports.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, for example, gives all new hires four weeks of
vacation at the start. After surveying its employees last year,
Cisco is building a day-care center on its corporate campus in San
Jose. ``We found supply was low, demand was high and more and more
high-tech companies are doing something in child care,'' explained
Peggy Lynch, manager of benefits for Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, IBM introduced a program allowing people to work
part time while still getting the benefits and opportunities of
full-time employees. One person in the program is Marie Wieck,
director of XML technology, a hot new field of Internet software
programming. Ms. Wieck, 39, works 32 hours a week now instead of
the 60 that she used to. She still travels, but she typically is in
the office only three days a week, giving her more time to spend
with her two young daughters. ``I'll keep doing this as long as it
makes sense both for the business and for me,'' Ms. Wieck said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is in Internet start-ups, not established companies,
where the work regimen is the most grueling. The hours are still
long in today's second-generation Internet start-ups, but the
perspective of the young programming whizzes does seem to have
changed a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Montulli, 29, was one of the first engineers at Netscape.
After Netscape was sold, he moved on to another Internet start-up,
Epinions.com. ``I really like the energy of a start-up,'' he said,
``because it's an environment where you can really make a
difference as an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, Montulli is working 70-hour weeks instead of the
120 hours he often did at Netscape _ a single-minded commitment to
work that he acknowledges contributed to the break-up of his
marriage to the daughter of Jim Clark, a co-founder of Netscape.
``I'm just not emotionally equipped to work like that anymore,'' he
said. ``I have a life.''
</P>
<P>
   For people with children, however, 70-hour workweeks may not be
their idea of balancing work and personal lives. And the
stock-option wealth created by many high-technology companies has
given people like Treuhaft and Silverberg the financial freedom to
do what they call ``serial balancing'' _ shifting from stints of
intense work to time off or part-time work, and back again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balance is a very difficult thing to achieve, at least in
parallel,'' Silverberg said. ``To achieve great things in one's
career typically takes a tremendous amount of focus and dedication.
I've tried to achieve balance in a more serial way, so that
hopefully it will even out over the long haul. And thanks to
Microsoft, I have the freedom to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, Treuhaft takes a similar approach to his
period of part-time work, viewing it as a recess. ``I don't think
I'd call this my career,'' he said. ``It's more catching my breath,
while still pedaling the bicycle.''

Bush/``The Science of Things'' (Trauma/Interscope) On Bush's third album, frontman Gavin Rossdale, the bubble-grunge
Brad Pitt, is worried about the ``urang-a-tans.'' At least he's got
a cause. The ``urang-a-tans'' song, the ridiculously titled ``The
Disease of the Dancing Cats,'' is just one example from an album
and band that tries so hard to be edgy that the cumulative effect
makes you wonder if Rossdale is merely putting us on.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The London quartet's midtempo stop-start rhythms, dynamics and
cringe-a-minute lyrics continue to posit Bush as a Nirvana/Pixies
knockoff for the alienated end of the Britney Spears demo, but this
time they've missed the melodies and hooks.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the tuneless current hit, ``The Chemicals Between
Us,'' and possibly album-opener ``Warm Machine,'' it doesn't seem
likely ``The Science of Things'' will add much to Bush's collection
of radio songs (``Everything Zen,'' ``Little Things,''
``Glycerine,'' ``Comedown'') that stations like KROQ are apparently
mandated to spin every 20 minutes. Hey Gavin, nice guitar noise,
though. (2 stars)

 &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Nelson's first instrumental album is a lovely, low-key affair
featuring a host of longtime collaborators from his Family band.
Nelson clearly signals his intentions with the opening numbers,
``Nuages'' and ``Vous Et Moi,'' songs associated with legendary
gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt. With fiddler Johnny Gimble making
like Stephane Grappelli, Nelson engagingly works his way through
jaunty selections like ``Sweet Georgia Brown'' and Reinhardt's
arrangement of the title track. Nelson, who will perform next month
in Thousand Oaks and Cerritos, displays affection and understanding
for the classic material, and it shows in this distinctive release.

<P>
   ``It's alive ... ALIVE!'' Frankenstein's monster lives again on
this journey through three classic horror films that have
fascinated audiences for nearly 70 years. The disc, released just
in time for Halloween, is a highly entertaining montage of quotable
dialogue and grandiose score segments selected by monster fan
Zombie from the films ``Frankenstein'' (1931) and two sequels,
``The Bride of Frankenstein'' (1935) and ``Son of Frankenstein''
(1939). Included is a 22-page booklet jammed with behind-the-scenes

   Sweet's uneven new project might disappoint fans hoping for a
reprise of the note-perfect pop of his widely praised 1991
masterpiece, ``Girlfriend,'' but it offers some mighty impressive
moments nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Peppered throughout these 14 tracks are gems like ``Faith in
You,'' which suggests Sweet could revisit his previous poptastic
glory at the drop of a guitar pick despite the ambitious Phil
Spector-ish wall-of-sound production that dominates ``In Reverse.''
While the effect is stunning on ``I Should Never Have Let You
Know'' and ``Worse to Live,'' the nine-minute ``Thunderstorm''
falls flat.
</P>

   Pop archeologists should note the presence of Carol Kaye, who
played bass on ``Pet Sounds'' and countless other '60s and '70s

<P>
   The echo of ``Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)'' that
Scottish-born diva Annie Lennox inserts into ``17 Again,'' the
opening cut of this botched reunion record, only demonstrates how
far this project is from the wit and melodic invention of the duo's
'80s heyday. The album unfortunately has a by-numbers feel, and
where earlier songs burst with ideas, ``Peace'' feels like a so-so
solo effort from Lennox or Eurythmics partner Dave Stewart. Buy the
greatest hits instead. (2 stars)

<P>
   Songs about the ``first rays of sun breaking through our
windowpane'' and Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young reunions are
generally best avoided. The tepid ``Looking Forward'' breaks both
rules. This dull album attempts to trade on past glories while
rarely recalling CSN's groundbreaking debut, or the equally
marvelous second album that brought Y into the picture.
</P>
<P>
   While the quartet's background harmonies are often still strong,
the songs borrow from a number of sources. Stills' ``Seen Enough''
gives Bob Dylan a co-writing credit since it leans on the
``Subterranean Homesick Blues'' melody for the verses. Crosby's
``Stand and Be Counted'' was apparently influenced by Tom Petty's
``Mary Jane's Last Dance,'' and Young apparently borrowed his own
``Heart of Gold'' for ``Slowpoke.'' (1 1/2 stars)

</P>
<P>
   Compilations aren't usually of much interest to jazz fans, who
tend to be completists favoring entire albums in their original
form. But the ``Elite Edition Collectors' Disc 1954-65'' (3 stars)
succeeds, gathering fascinating outtakes of familiar tunes from
greats like Louis Armstrong, Bill Evans, Coleman Hawkins and Oscar
Peterson. The record is part of a limited series, as is the 1959
Ellis/Giuffre collaboration. Joined by a stellar lineup including
Bud Shank, Art Pepper and Jim Hall, Giuffre pits his dark saxophone
lines against Ellis' sunny, melodic guitar. Needless to say, given
the talent involved, this meeting was a very good idea. (3 stars)

collaborated on the 1995 hit single ``How High'' (included here as

genre, while various cameos ensure nobody gets tired of the same
two voices.
</P>
<P>
   Imaginative production by the duo, along with Erick Sermon and
Wu-Tang's RZA on such standouts as ``Mic Checka,'' ``Well All Rite
Cha'' and the title track, should keep this one alive through the
holidays. (3 stars)

 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert E. Rubin, arguably the best known financier of
his generation and the recently retired Treasury secretary, has
taken a top position at Citigroup, the country's largest financial
services company.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, 61 and the former top official of Goldman Sachs, said he
had joined Sanford I. Weill and John S. Reed, the co-heads of
Citigroup, in what Reed described as a ``three-person office of the
chairman'' overseeing what has become the first true American
financial conglomerate since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment comes less than a week after the Clinton
administration and Congress agreed on a compromise bill that would
overhaul the laws that regulate the financial industry, a measure
that removes many of the restrictions preventing banks, securities
firms and insurance companies from buying each other or engaging in
each other's businesses. Both Rubin and Citigroup strongly
supported the bill. But Rubin said the likely repeal of the
so-called Glass-Steagall legislation had nothing to do with his
decision to join the company.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment settles the swirl of speculation about what
Rubin, who is considered a hero by some for helping avert a
worldwide financial panic in 1998 and who has emerged unscathed
from the scandal-ridden Clinton administration, would do for an
encore.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also discussed employment with American International
Group, a leading life insurance company, and Warburg Pincus, a New
York investment firm, before agreeing to join Citigroup, said
people who were told of Rubin's negotiations. He also had
discussions with Goldman about serving on his old firm's board of
directors, people close to Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin declined to discuss his talks with any other company, and
officials of those three companies also declined to comment.
Citigroup officials said that while Rubin would be free to pursue
outside endeavors, including a role in local New York or national
politics, he would not work for any financial company that competes
with Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin will not become a third chief executive with Messrs. Weill
and Reed, who brought Citigroup together by joining one of
America's leading banks with a large insurance company and
investment bank last year and have had a sometimes rocky
relationship since then. But he will head the executive committee
of Citigroup's board, work full time at the company, and
participate in all major managerial and strategic decisions, the
three men said. Rubin will also have a corner office alongside
Weill and Reed in the company's blond-wood and glass executive
suite in mid-town Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like the issues of managing a large institution and I
want to really get back involved,'' Rubin said in an interview.
``I'd also like to fish, read books and play tennis, but life is a
trade off.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's role at Citigroup appears to be a delicate balance
between his desire to take an active role in plotting the future of
the company and to be involved in major decision making, but to
avoid becoming a chief executive or to have day-to-day
responsibilities for a particular part of the business. The terms
of his employment were complex enough that it took five weeks of
almost constant meetings to negotiate, people close to Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob has the best job in the company: no line responsibility,
but he will be a full partner,'' Reed said during a meeting to
announce Rubin's appointment at Citigroup's Park Avenue
headquarters. ``He will not play a role as an executive officer of
the company, as Sandy and I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   But after years as the government's top economic official, Rubin
brings to Citigroup a rolodex of contacts that one bank analyst
called priceless. To the extent that he is willing to use his
contacts to push Citigroup's banking business around the world,
Rubin could generate potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in
fees for the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also saw the Rubin name on Citigroup's marquee as
a draw for star bankers on Wall Street, potentially making the
firm's Salmon Smith Barney investment bank a more formidable
competitor to other firms, including Goldman, where Rubin spent the
bulk of his career as a bond trader and senior executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be one of the most well regarded individuals among
senior government officials and corporations world wide. He can get
a meeting with anyone he wants,'' said Joan Solotar, who analyzes
Citigroup for Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette. ``They will win deals
that they would not otherwise have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Messrs. Rubin, Weill and Reed all said that Rubin's role at the
firm would go far beyond cajoling corporate executives and
government officials to hire Citigroup bankers, however. He intends
to help plot the firm's strategy. He and the two Citigroup
executives said they would be walking in and out of each other's
offices all day, running the firm as a troika.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offices are adjacent and no one will be out of touch,''
said Weill.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup officials declined to discuss Rubin's compensation
package, although details will have to be revealed in a proxy
statement next spring because Rubin will be a director of the
company and will likely be one of its most highly paid executives.
Asked about his pay, Rubin declined to comment. But asked if it
would top his $150,000 salary as Treasury secretary, he deadpanned:
``That's a fair assumption.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not need the money. When he entered government service
in early 1993, Rubin put his assets, most of which consisted of
partnership shares in Goldman, into a blind trust. The trust at the
time was valued at about $100 million, though it has possibly
increased considerably in value given the bull market in stocks
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by leaving Goldman and accepting cash in exchange for his
shares, Rubin missed the windfall other partners enjoyed when
Goldman became a public company earlier this year. Had he remained
the top executive at Goldman, his assets would have increased at
least three fold in value and totaled over half a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, his old Goldman pay pales in comparison with what
Weill and Reed now earn at Citigroup. Last year, Weill and Reed had
total compensation, including stock options, valued at about $27
million. Rubin seems unlikely to earn as much as either Weill or
Reed because he does not have the same executive responsibilities.
But his senior role in the firm suggests that he could easily earn
tens of millions of dollars in salary, bonus and stock options each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's return to Wall Street is not unprecedented. James Baker,
the former Bush and Reagan administration official, joined Carlyle
Group, a venture capital and buy-out firm. Nicholas Brady, a Bush
administration Treasury secretary, also followed Rubin's circular
path from Wall Street to Washington and back. Brady now heads Darby
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, however, cuts a much higher profile. It has 100
million clients in 100 countries and is on course this year to earn
$10 billion in net profits, far ahead of any of its rivals in the
finance industry. It was also one of the leading forces in
Washington pushing for an overhaul of financial laws, in part
because Citigroup might have had to sell some of its businesses,
including its insurance underwriting subsidiary, if Congress had
not agreed to pass reforms this year.

 &HT;    Pall cast on Championship
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The windshield of courtesy car No. 43, a green Buick
Century, was covered with flower bouquets. Wreaths and cards were
placed near the parking sign that read, ``Reserved for Payne
Stewart.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's nameplate remained on locker 162 between the space
reserved for Tiger Woods and Jeff Sluman in the Champion's locker
room. On the pro-am sheet, Stewart's name was still there as the
9:09 a.m. tee time.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the practice range, normally a spot for jokes and small
talk on Tuesday at a Tour Championship, the only sounds were those
of the occasional ball being struck. Conversations were solemn and
muted.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament has been turned into a week-long funeral since
the shocking death Monday of Payne Stewart. When the Learjet
crashed into a field in Mina, S.D., killing the U.S. Open champion
and five others, an emotional dagger pierced the golf world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you got to the golf course, it was so silent, it was
almost eerie,'' Tiger Woods said. ``Nobody was really asking for
autographs or clamoring for pictures. Nobody was talking. It was
just silent out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to even describe the feeling,'' Jeff Sluman said.
``Golf is just not very important right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sluman hit long irons at the middle of the practice range, an
umbrella placed parallel to his stance, and tried to work on his
alignment and ball flight. The motions were sluggish and without
focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really knows how to react, because it was so sudden,''
Woods said. ``It was a shock to everybody. I almost feel like he's
going to show up. I just saw him the other day. It's hard to
believe he's not going to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Searching for happy memories of the good-time man in the
plus-fours, Fred Funk recalled the hours they spent in the fitness
center in recent years. On adjacent exercise machines one day, they
were watching a rerun of ``Jerry Maguire'' on the TV ahead.
Suddenly, Funk looked over at his buddy and said, ``Payne, you
complete me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started laughing so hard, he almost fell off the machine,''
Funk said. ``It was nice to finally get him on something. He
usually gets you on something.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-am participation Tuesday was made voluntary, but many
players sought the golf course for therapy, as Woods said, ``to at
least get away from it for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 29 players in the field, 22 played at least nine holes.
Sea Island's Davis Love III was among those in Orlando to comfort
Stewart's wife Tracy and their two children. After the plane crash
of his father in 1988, Love knew such grief too well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vivid memory of Payne will forever be the confidence he
instilled in me during the opening match of the Ryder Cup in
Brookline,'' Love said in a statement. ``Payne Stewart's passing is
a great loss for the game of golf and the people around the world
that knew and love him.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the players are expected to fly to Orlando on a PGA Tour
chartered jet for funeral services at 11 a.m. Friday, when
tournament play will be halted, before a revised schedule for the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he planned to attend in Orlando, Woods said, ``I don't
know. Either way, it's going to be a tough day. . . . Some players
would rather stay away and try to handle it on their own. Other
players find more comfort in knowing that they are giving of
themselves to others in need. . . . You need to find some kind of
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   John Huston said, ``It just makes you think that you've got to
enjoy the moment. You just never know whether it's your turn.''
</P>
<P>
   On a beautiful Texas fall morning, Huston decided, ``It's just a
dreary day.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro golfers are independent contractors with worldwide
obligations, and they all have to trust the safety of air travel.
Most of them are husbands and fathers. Most of them are struggling
to attain what Stewart already had.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had just gotten to where it wanted to be,'' Funk said,
``and now he could relax and really enjoy the fruits of all his
work for the rest of his life _ and now it's cut short.''

</P>
<P>
   Japan's animated phenomenon ``Princess Mononoke'' has finally
arrived, and it is indeed a wonder to behold. It often makes you
wonder, too, what exactly is going on, pictorialism being a much
stronger suit for director Hayao Miyazaki than narrative.
</P>
<P>
   But even at its most confusing, ``Mononoke'' exerts a powerful
mythic pull. Miyazaki set out to do no less than create an
ecological fable that appreciates both the majesty of nature and
mankind's drive to advance at nature's expense. It's a boldly
complex story, rendered with loving artistry and atavistic fury,
that some may just find complicated.
</P>
<P>
   That can't, apparently, be blamed on cultural miscues. Though
Miyazaki based much of his monster- and samurai-filled adventure on
Japanese legend, it's been reported that much of the film's huge
box-office gross in Japan _ some $150 million, more than any other
movie except ``Titanic'' has made in that country _ is to a good
degree based on people going back several times to try to figure
the whole thing out.
</P>
<P>
   The English-language adaptation was written by comic book writer
Neil Gaiman and Jack Fletcher, a veteran dubber of Japanese anime
who also directed the translated version's voice talent. They
necessarily have to shove a lot of exposition into the characters'
mouths, but lyrical passages and some good, vulgar humor balance
out the clunkier dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, the best way to experience this film
is by surrendering to the visuals. Working for the first time with
computer graphics, the master animator creates striking tableaux
and exhilarating action sequences. There are equal doses of
grotesque horror (heaps of human and animal carcasses, wormlike
wound infections), coy humor (little, gossamer forest sprites whose
heads rattle adorably) and magesterial beauty. Clouds, leaves,
water, light and often people don't exactly move in a realistic
way, but their starkly stylized composition often appears an
improvement on nature's design.
</P>
<P>
   The story, set during the Muromachi period (1392-1573), involves
the young warrior Ashitaka (voiced by Billy Crudup), who must leave
his village when he's infected by a mad, rampaging boar-god. Riding
his dependable red elk Yakul, he heads for a faraway forest that is
being encroached upon by iron smelters. The workers _ many of whom
are lepers and ex-prostitutes just trying to make a respectable
living _ are led by Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver), a formidable,
pragmatic she-warrior whose only dependable loyalties are to her
people _ or maybe just to herself.
</P>
<P>
   In the forest, giant wolf-goddess Moro (Gillian Anderson) plots
the humans' destruction with the help of Mononoke (Claire Danes), a
feral girl whom Moro has raised from infancy. Ashitaka tries to run
interference between the two sides and bonds with the initially
reluctant Mononoke in the process.
</P>
<P>
   That should be enough plot for your average cartoon feature, but
``Mononoke,'' which runs nearly an hour longer than most U.S.
animated movies, throws in much, much more. There are at least two
other contending human factions, conflicts between the various
animal spirits, and a gargantuan, overlording deer god who changes
powers as fast as he changes shape, which is often reminiscent of a
really cooking lava lamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mononoke'' serves up some pretty violent imagery (Miyazaki is
big on beheadings) that is sure to upset very young viewers _ or,
at least, upset their parents. The film's PG-13 rating is wholly
justified, for that and for the fact that the best way to enjoy
``Princess Mononoke'' is to ponder its impressions, not wait for
its points to become fully clarified. &QL;

DAIMLERCHRYSLER REPORTS THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS THAT BEAT
EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Having discovered three months ago that hell hath no
fury like an analyst scorned, DaimlerChrysler reported
better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The German automaker said its third-quarter adjusted net income
rose 14 percent to 1.51 billion euros, or $1.61 billion, compared
with the 1.33 billion euros, or $1.41 billion, that Daimler-Benz
A.G. and the Chrysler Corp. combined earned in the quarter a year
earlier. Daimler bought Chrysler last November. Revenue rose 15
percent to $38.56 billion, from $33.42 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last quarter, when DaimlerChrysler disappointed analysts
and saw its stock take a pounding in Europe and the United States,
the earnings reported Tuesday beat expectations. In the third
quarter, DaimlerChrysler earned an adjusted $1.60 per diluted
share, up from $1.42 a share a year ago. Wall Street had been
expecting earnings of $1.40 a share, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial, the investment research network.
</P>
<P>
   Even though earnings were significantly stronger than expected,
the financial markets yawned, and the stock barely rose. In
Frankfurt, shares of DaimlerChrysler rose 1.85 euros to 72.25. In
New York, shares rose 75 cents to $76. Shares of General Motors
rose 12.5 cents to $65.1875, and shares of Ford Motor fell 6.25
cents to $54.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons that the stock didn't react to the good
third-quarter numbers is that there's a suspicion out there that
Wall Street demanded a good third quarter and so they got it,''
said David B. Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities, who added
that ``the numbers look clean.''
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert J. Eaton said the company had
improved its financial disclosure practices. ``We gave out a very
detailed package that dramatically improved our transparency,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very good quarter,'' Eaton added. ``We have
outstanding sales and outstanding profits.'' The adjusted results
exclude a one-time gain of $943 million from the sale of the
company's 32.4 percent stake in Debitel, a European
telecommunications operator, and a one-time charge of $149 million
for future lump-sum retiree payouts.
</P>
<P>
   The brands belonging to the former Chrysler _ including Dodge,
Chrysler, Jeep and Plymouth _ had record revenue of $16.1 billion
and earned better-than-expected profits. Operating profits rose 11
percent to $1.09 billion, up from $984 million in the third quarter
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``DaimlerChrysler basically outperformed our expectation because
of Chrysler,'' said David M. Garrity, an analyst at Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sent shares sharply lower after the second-quarter
results were released because the Chrysler brands turned in
disappointing profits, in part because of higher-than-expected
costs from rebates, discounted financing, and cheap leases aimed at
luring buyers. Eaton said Tuesday that incentives were headed lower
as the company trots out its 2000 models. In the third quarter,
incentives averaged $1,573 a vehicle, but by late September, they
had dropped below $1,500, and they are expected to drop to $1,375
to $1,400 in the fourth quarter. ``Incentives are clearly coming
down with the new models,'' said Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things that were disappointing in the second quarter
are turning around,'' said Scott F. Merlis, managing director and
head of the automotive practice at Wasserstein Perella Securities.
``The earnings were a surprise for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercedes-Benz and Smart car unit had an operating profit of
$754 million in the third quarter, up 40 percent from the $540
million it earned in the third quarter of last year. Strong profits
from Mercedes sales have made up for weak results in sales of the
Smart car, a compact jointly developed with Swatch, the world's
largest watchmaker. Eaton confirmed analysts' estimates that
Smart's losses are in the range of 400 to 500 million euros a year.
</P>
<P>
   Third-quarter operating profits edged up 1 percent for Daimler's
commercial vehicles division, to $322 million from $318 million.
The company's services division earned $299 million, up 7 percent
from $279 million in the same quarter last year. Those results
exclude a one-time gain from the sale of the Debitel stake to
Swisscom.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler's aerospace unit, Dasa, saw profits rise 30 percent to
$197 million from $151 million. Daimler plans to merge Dasa with
Aerospatiale Matra of France and Casa of Spain to create the
European Aeronautic, Defense and Space Co., in which Daimler would
retain a 30 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler reports its results in both euros and dollars,
and it used the Sept. 30 exchange rate of $1.0643 a euro for both
1999 and 1998 results announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton also said the company was on track to find at least $1.4
billion in cost savings this year from combining Daimler and
Chrysler. He said that after three or four years, the savings would
amount to $3 billion to $4 billion a year. He also said the company
was still mulling over whether to jettison its Plymouth brand.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, who is expected to step down within the next two years,
refused to say when he might leave the company. ``I'm focused on
continuing to have good results and continuing to make this company
extremely strong and not focused on retirement or when I might
leave,'' said Eaton, who added, ``we have a very strong team in
place.''

 &HT;    Gingrich lawyer to question aide
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a surprise move, Newt Gingrich has initiated his
own deposition of the Washington congressional aide named in his
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In a notice filed Tuesday in Cobb County Superior Court,
Gingrich announced he will question Callista Bisek under oath Nov.
9. The deposition would come two days before he and estranged wife
Marianne Gingrich are to make their first court appearance together
since the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives filed
for divorce in July.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which an opposing attorney called ``unique,'' comes
weeks into an unresolved legal contest between Bisek and Marianne
Gingrich over the same deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Bisek has asked a Washington judge to block Marianne Gingrich's
subpoena asking her to answer questions about her relationship with
the former speaker. The subpoena also asks for documents, such as
letters, phone records and gift receipts, that could link the two
romantically. The judge's ruling is expected any day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole idea of us hiding the ball, I want to get rid of
that real quick,'' Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, said Tuesday.
``We're not hiding anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, characterized
Gingrich's deposition notice as ``peculiar'' and pointed out that
Bisek has not withdrawn her objections to Mayoue's request for a
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   While Bisek could conceivably object to questioning by
Gingrich's attorneys, Evans said she has agreed to participate. In
fact, the deposition will be taken at her attorney's office in
Washington, according to Tuesday's filing. Bisek's attorney, Pamela
Bresnahan, did not return a phone message seeking confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's notice also instructs Bisek to bring with her records
of any money he has spent on her, gifts he's purchased for her, and
travel she's taken at his expense since he became speaker. They are
all documents Bisek already has agreed to turn over in the
deposition dispute between her and Marianne Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   According to divorce experts, Gingrich wants to make it clear to
the public and to the court that Bisek is an independent witness
who is not under his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to show the court that they are not trying to
hide her,'' Atlanta divorce attorney Shiel Edlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than as a public relations tool, Gingrich's move to depose
Bisek offers little tactical benefit, Edlin said. In a deposition,
both sides are allowed to question the witness.
</P>
<P>
   While Evans has scheduled Bisek's deposition for Nov. 9, his
notice left open the possibility that a new date could be
negotiated. On Nov. 11, the Gingriches are due to appear before
Judge Dorothy Robinson in Cobb Superior Court as their lawyers
argue several discovery motions still in contention. Both sides say
they intend to follow through with the hearing. Said Evans: ``We
want to get this case resolved or tried.''

PARTIES SCRAMBLE OVER CHAFEE'S SEAT IN US SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The political world came to a grinding halt this
week, as friends and colleagues of Senator John H. Chafee mourned
the passing of an esteemed legislator.
</P>
<P>
   That pause lasted about 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after learning the Rhode Island Republican had died of
heart failure, political strategists on both sides began plotting
strategies for a replacement _ despite countless protests they were
honoring a grace period in Chafee's name.
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning Monday, Democrats had dusted off the Constitution
to see if they could prevent the Republican governor from naming
Chafee's son to the seat. Republicans, nervously aware that a
five-seat swing would end their Senate majority, quietly cheered
the prospect of having another young Republican ushered in. And
everyone vigorously debated what would happen if Lincoln Chafee
took his father's place.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee had announced in March that he would retire and not seek
a fifth term in 2000, setting off an early campaign season that
quickly raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations and
split the Rhode Island Democratic Party. But in the aftermath of
his death Sunday night, it appeared the race could become more
contentious than anyone had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering how liked and well-respected Chafee was, you'd
think people would have enough sense not to talk politics,'' said
Mike Vallante, former head of the Rhode Island Republican Party who
now runs a political consulting firm. ``But talking politics is a
pastime in Rhode Island. It's a small state, and of all the places
I've ever worked or lived, there's no more politically intense
state I can think of.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Chafee, the mayor of Warwick, Rhode Island's largest
city after Providence, has not commented publicly about his
father's seat. And there was speculation, fueled by news reports in
Providence, that he might not seek it at all. Governor Lincoln C.
Almond has also refused to discuss the matter, except to say he
will not announce a successor until next week.
</P>
<P>
   But the heads of both state political parties did not shy from
the debate. Indeed, each was already assessing how an interim
Senate term with Lincoln Chafee would play out next year. William
Lynch, head of the state Democratic Party, admitted it is a
``tricky proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   When the younger Chafee announced he was running earlier this
year, he came under attack for his lack of experience in statewide
office and for not being as politically astute as his father. Now,
Democrats admit, it would be difficult to lob those same criticisms
without offending admirers of the elder Chafee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to be critical, because everybody's so
sensitive to the fact that there's been a death and the senator was
a larger-than-life figure,'' Lynch said. ``But I would risk
sounding crass by saying that nothing has changed from a month ago
as to who is more qualified to be elected a year from now, and I
don't believe that's Lincoln Chafee.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch added: ``These offices are not meant to be simply handed
off from one person to the next. Obviously, with the death of
Senator Chafee, it's more difficult to say that in a way people
don't see as unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were equally frank about the effect a Chafee
appointment would have not only on his own standing, but also on
the two top Democratic challengers, US Representative Bob Weygand
and attorney Robert Licht. If Chafee were to work in Washington the
next 12 months, he would gain access to key fund-raisers and
potentially eat into his opponents' campaign funds, several
Republican Senate aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Quick, chairman of the state Republican Party, agreed:
``Certainly, from a partisan political perspective, it would make
political sense. . . . That would give him the incumbent advantage,
and certainly not to be underestimated is the advantage it would
give him fund-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explained why Darrell West, a political science
professor at Brown University, said he was answering questions
about the political future of the seat ``right away'' on Monday
morning, shortly after news of the senator's death was made known
to the public. Rhode Island Secretary of State James Langevin also
started getting calls at 8:30 a.m., and turned to the Constitution
to determine what role the governor would play in announcing a
successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of speculation right away . . . because the
stakes are very high,'' West said. ``It's the old saying, power
abhors a vacuum. When a powerful senator dies, there is a major
vacuum. It's happened before with other family dynasties.''

<P>
   ``Beefcake'' is two movies in one: a superficial documentary
about the subculture of male ``beefcake'' photographers of 1950s
Los Angeles and a campy fictionalization of same. Despite
occasional interesting insights into the history of erotic
photography and antiporn laws, along with a few laughs at the
weirdness of it all, the mix of fact and reality is largely
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel MacIvor plays Bob Mizer, an actual photographer who ran a
male ``model agency'' and published Physique Pictorial beginning in
the early 1950s. In the fictionalized scenes, we're led to believe
that Mizer was a mild-mannered oddball who lived with his loving
mother (played by Carroll Godsman) in a John Waters-like house full
of period furniture and bright colors. Isn't it terrible, the movie
says, that basically innocent men like this were persecuted under
U.S. obscenity laws?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's hard to get worked up about the examples of Mizer's
work we see on screen: If anything, they're laughable in their
goofy innocence, even though the muscled male models are totally or
mostly nude.
</P>
<P>
   Also sympathetic are other photographers and models who knew
Mizer, who are interviewed documentary-style and intercut with the
fictional story. They all seem to present the world of '50s
beefcake photography as a pretty harmless one. But these men _
including photographers Russ Warner and Dave Martin and models Jim
Lassiter and Joe D'Allesandro (who went on to appear in Andy Warhol
films) _ shed very little light on Mizer the man or on his
operation. Fitness guru Jack LaLanne, whose connection to this
world was fairly tenuous, gives no perspective at all, except on
his own mythmaking ability.
</P>
<P>
   A small subplot employing actual testimony from a lawsuit
brought against Mizer paints a different picture of his operation.
Mizer was charged with running a prostitution ring among the young
men who lived at his house. A much different, darker picture starts
to emerge of Mizer, one that doesn't jibe with the colorful
lightheartedness of the rest of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The film has its merits: It unearths a little-known but
influential 1950s subculture that was a battleground for First
Amendment rights. It has a few nice performances, most notably from
the handsome and likable Josh Peace (recently seen in ``54'' and
``The Big Hit'') as a young man who is drawn into Mizer's world.
But due to its explicit nature and the fact that it seems to turn a
blind eye to Mizer's darker side, the film is destined to appeal
only to a small, niche audience. &QL;

   Japan's animated phenomenon ``Princess Mononoke'' has finally
arrived, and it is indeed a wonder to behold. It often makes you
wonder, too, what exactly is going on, pictorialism being a much
stronger suit for director Hayao Miyazaki than narrative.
</P>
<P>
   But even at its most confusing, ``Mononoke'' exerts a powerful
mythic pull. Miyazaki set out to do no less than create an
ecological fable that appreciates both the majesty of nature and
mankind's drive to advance at nature's expense. It's a boldly
complex story, rendered with loving artistry and atavistic fury,
that some may just find complicated.
</P>
<P>
   That can't, apparently, be blamed on cultural miscues. Though
Miyazaki based much of his monster- and samurai-filled adventure on
Japanese legend, it's been reported that much of the film's huge
box-office gross in Japan _ some $150 million, more than any other
movie except ``Titanic'' has made in that country _ is to a good
degree based on people going back several times to try to figure
the whole thing out.
</P>
<P>
   The English-language adaptation was written by comic book writer
Neil Gaiman and Jack Fletcher, a veteran dubber of Japanese anime
who also directed the translated version's voice talent. They
necessarily have to shove a lot of exposition into the characters'
mouths, but lyrical passages and some good, vulgar humor balance
out the clunkier dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, the best way to experience this film
is by surrendering to the visuals. Working for the first time with
computer graphics, the master animator creates striking tableaux
and exhilarating action sequences. There are equal doses of
grotesque horror (heaps of human and animal carcasses, wormlike
wound infections), coy humor (little, gossamer forest sprites whose
heads rattle adorably) and magesterial beauty. Clouds, leaves,
water, light and often people don't exactly move in a realistic
way, but their starkly stylized composition often appears an
improvement on nature's design.
</P>
<P>
   The story, set during the Muromachi period (1392-1573), involves
the young warrior Ashitaka (voiced by Billy Crudup), who must leave
his village when he's infected by a mad, rampaging boar-god. Riding
his dependable red elk Yakul, he heads for a faraway forest that is
being encroached upon by iron smelters. The workers _ many of whom
are lepers and ex-prostitutes just trying to make a respectable
living _ are led by Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver), a formidable,
pragmatic she-warrior whose only dependable loyalties are to her
people _ or maybe just to herself.
</P>
<P>
   In the forest, giant wolf-goddess Moro (Gillian Anderson) plots
the humans' destruction with the help of Mononoke (Claire Danes), a
feral girl whom Moro has raised from infancy. Ashitaka tries to run
interference between the two sides and bonds with the initially
reluctant Mononoke in the process.
</P>
<P>
   That should be enough plot for your average cartoon feature, but
``Mononoke,'' which runs nearly an hour longer than most U.S.
animated movies, throws in much, much more. There are at least two
other contending human factions, conflicts between the various
animal spirits, and a gargantuan, overlording deer god who changes
powers as fast as he changes shape, which is often reminiscent of a
really cooking lava lamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mononoke'' serves up some pretty violent imagery (Miyazaki is
big on beheadings) that is sure to upset very young viewers _ or,
at least, upset their parents. The film's PG-13 rating is wholly
justified, for that and for the fact that the best way to enjoy
``Princess Mononoke'' is to ponder its impressions, not wait for
its points to become fully clarified. &QL;

STANFORD RECEIVES $150 MILLION FROM NETSCAPE FOUNDER FOR BIOTECH
CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Fla.) (mcd) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Stanford University announced a $150 million
gift Tuesday from James H. Clark, co-founder of two high-profile
Silicon Valley companies, that will be used to create a new
biotechnology center.
</P>
<P>
   The which is the largest in Stanford's history, is
intended to create a cross-disciplinary biomedical program that
will advance the frontiers of biology and a series of related
science and engineering fields.
</P>
<P>
   The donation, which is the fifth largest in U.S. history, is
also the largest ever given to a university by a former faculty
member. Clark taught in the electrical engineering department for
three years during the early 1980s before leaving to found Silicon
Graphics based on research he had done while at Stanford. He later
co-founded Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford, work has been going on for 18 months toward
planning a new program in biomedical engineering and sciences. It
is intended to integrate the work of faculty across disciplines in
both basic and applied sciences to develop new therapies and cures
for human disease.
</P>
<P>
   Clark noted that his own academic career had shifted from
engineering to physics to computer science. He said if he was ever
to go back to school it would be in the biological sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The donation also comes at a time when high technology
executives like Clark are under increasing pressure because their
world has lagged in terms of philanthropic contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Tuesday from his home in Florida, Clark
said that he had been motivated in large part by the idea of giving
something back to the university where he had experienced great
freedom as a faculty member.
</P>
<P>
   Funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the
Office of Naval Research, he developed a silicon chip he called the
Geometry Engine, which vastly accelerated the rendering of
three-dimensional graphic images.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 Clark took the design and left Stanford to found Silicon
Graphics, which for many years remained the world's leading
developer of 3D computer work stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanford did a lot for me, and I've always felt indebted,''
Clark said. ``It was a lenient and productive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had begun discussing a donation with Stanford
provost John Hennessy, after his second company, Netscape, went
public in 1995. Originally he had considered financing a center on
bio-informatics _ the convergence of information technology and
molecular biology _ but after discussing the project with Stanford
faculty and administrators, he decided on a broader vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biology has come of age and become a grounding science for
lots of activities,'' said Hennessy. ``We felt for Stanford this
was a really good direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The new center will be housed at a new Stanford building to be
named the James H. Clark Center for Biomedial Engineering and
Sciences. The grant will also provide equipment for the facility,
endow positions for faculty members and pay for fellowships for
graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has given several other smaller donations, including
grants to National Public Radio and the Exploritorium, a San
Francisco-based science museum.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he would make other contributions in the future and
felt that he would be most effective in targeting his donations in
specific ways rather than in general areas such as helping the
poor.

EXTREMIST GROUP TARGETS RESEARCHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tucked inside a small, white envelope are four type-written
lines on a rectangular slip of paper, and a razor blade angled so
that it can slice open a fingertip.
</P>
<P>
   An extremist group within the international animal rights
movement has sent the booby-trapped letters to a number of
scientists at Harvard University and to 70 other researchers across
the country who use primates to test vaccines and treatments for
AIDS, cancer, and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have been targeted and you have until autumn of 2000 to
release all your primate captives and get out of the vivisection
industry,'' one letter said. ``If you do not heed our warning, your
violence will be turned back upon you.''
</P>
<P>
   since Monday, five Harvard scientists have received the letters
from a group identifying itself as the ``Justice Department.'' The
letters were immediately turned over to Harvard police. Only one
scientist actually opened his letter, and was not cut, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the animal rights people taking on a new way of
targeting researchers,'' said Harvard Detective Sergeant Richard
Mederos, who oversees criminal investigations. ``They have upped
the stakes in that there is potential for violence now. We've
warned the researchers to be vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the targeted scientists could be reached for comment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman with the regional office of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation declined to say whether the agency is investigating
this wave of threatening letters. But sources said both the FBI and
the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are trying to
identify the senders, and have officially warned the targeted
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The group identified itself in an e-mail sent Monday to various
research groups, university police, law enforcement groups, and
others, warning that it was sending out the letters to specific
scientists at primate research facilities across the country. In
August, the group sent similar letters to fur farmers in the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   At least one supporter of the use of animals in scientific
research said Tuesday that mainstream advocates of vegetarianism
and humane animal treatment should realize that the animal-rights
movement also includes extremists willing to commit violence to
advance their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense to target these dedicated scientists _ they
are searching for cures that will help every man, woman, and
child,'' said Frankie L. Trull, president of the Foundation for
Biomedical Research, a national non-profit organization that
supports the use of animals in medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard officials, long familiar with the protesters who
regularly gather outside the university's primate research
laboratory in Southborough, said they had not heard the Justice
Department group. But this past summer, the university added
surveillance and other security equipment at the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an increase in activity by these groups and we
thought it was time,'' said Don Gibbons, a spokesman for Harvard
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Animal-welfare activists say the Justice Department group,
relatively new and small, is already well known in its native
Britain and also in Canada for carrying out violent attacks against
humans instead of the fur stores, kennels and laboratories that
many US-based animal rights groups target.
</P>
<P>
   If the Justice Department activists ``follow their tactics used
in Britain, then, yes, we should be worried,'' said Andrew Rowan,
senior vice president for research of the Humane Society of the
United States in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the Justice Department group sent letter bombs and
other letters with razor blades supposedly dipped in rat poison or
AIDS-infected blood, according to recent news accounts. Similar
letters appeared in British Columbia, and were claimed by a
Canadian group using the same name and incorporating a another
feature: The return address was that of another targeted
individual. There have been no reports of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``These small groups tend to take a violent course of action,
which we reject unreservedly,'' Rowan said Tuesday. ``An animal
rights philosophy requires you to reject all violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent letters to Harvard faculty members had no return
addresses, Mederos said, and it was still unclear whether the
blades had been dipped in a substance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 20-year-old international Animal Liberation Front
has taken responsibility for several recent acts of ``economic
sabotage.'' Last week, it firebombed four vans of a fur store in
Warwick, R.I. On Sunday, its members broke into a research facility
at Western Washington University and stole four rabbits and 37
white rats, placing them in private homes, said ALF spokesman David
Barbarash.
</P>
<P>
   In July and September, the ALF vandalized three hunting and
fishing clubs in Maine and said it is planning more strikes in that
state, and not just against sportsmen's clubs, said Barbarash. He
says he has no direct contact with members, but publicizes their
actions after receiving anonymous letters from them as well as
videotapes of their actions.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department group, ALF, and many others have been so
active that Scotland Yard's antiterror branch has a databank called
the the Animal Rights National Index. Some of the Justice
Department group's top activists have been arrested and imprisoned
in Britain.

TV GUIDE JOINS EFFORTS TO LURE HISPANIC MARKET

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Latino influence on U.S. business and culture gets
a significant boost this week with the introduction of a
Spanish-language insert in TV Guide. It follows by one week the
launch of a satellite TV system designed specifically for Spanish
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The insert, which began appearing Monday on newsstands in
specially marked TV Guides, includes Spanish-language interviews
and feature stories.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite system, DirecTV Para Todos, provides Hispanic
viewers access to more than 20 Spanish-language channels ranging
from the familiar (Univision, Telemundo, GEMS, Galavision) to the
exotic (TV Chile, Cine Latino, Canal Sur, Utilisima).
</P>
<P>
   That both developments deal with television should come as no
surprise, since the whiff of ``dinero'' follows large audiences,
and when it comes to television, Latinos love to watch.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Hispanics see an average of 15.3 hours of Spanish
programming and 10 hours of English programming a week, according
to a 1998 study by Market Segment Research and Consulting in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research says there are 8.67 million Hispanic TV
households in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Combine those statistics with a national Hispanic purchasing
power estimated at $375 billion annually, and it becomes clear why
there are campaigns for Latino eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos watch more television on average than the American
viewer, and they're brand-loyal,'' said Chiqui Cartagena, executive
editor of TV Guide en Espanol. ``These things factored in to the
executives of TV Guide saying, `Hey, this seems like a logical
thing to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Top 10 Hispanic TV markets in the United States are Los
Angeles, New York City, Miami, San Francisco-San Jose, Chicago,
Houston, San Antonio, Dallas-Fort Worth, Harlingen-McAllen area in
South Texas, and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   TV Guide en Espanol is launching in 15 markets. DirecTV Para
Todos is available only in Miami, San Jose/San Francisco and
Houston. (DISH Network, a competing satellite service provider,
offers a less extensive Spanish-language lineup.)
</P>
<P>
   It is significant that both new services are bilingual, said
Cartagena, since three-quarters of the Spanish-speaking population
is bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between Spanish-dominant and
Spanish-preferred,'' said Cartagena, who was founding editor of
People en Espanol. ``My parents, who have been here 20 years, still
watch Spanish-language television because they feel more
comfortable. They're perfectly fluent in English. It's as if (an
English speaker) would move to Paris. (He'd) probably watch CNN in
English and not the local news.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who subscribe to DirecTV Para Todos get ``some of the
best'' Spanish-language networks from the United States, Latin
America and Spain, said Yolanda Macias, senior director of
programming for the service. Customers can choose between two
packages: a 38-channel lineup (14 in Spanish) for $19.99 a month,
and a 98-channel lineup (21 in Spanish) for $31.99. Both lineups
include seven Spanish music channels.
</P>
<P>
   The dish for the service is more oblong than the standard
18-inch-round dish used by DirecTV's 7.7 million customers. Its
shape enables it to pick up channels off more satellites than the
standard dish. Existing customers who want the Spanish service will
be able to upgrade their equipment, Macias said.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which initially will be available through rack
sales only, may have a tougher go of it than the dish.
</P>
<P>
   Nestor Rodriguez, an associate professor of sociology at the
University of Houston, believes TV Guide en Espanol ``is going to
have to cultivate a market, because those who read English and
Spanish probably read English mainly. Those who read Spanish may be
hard to persuade to read something written primarily in English.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis O'Neill, vice president and publisher of Editor and
Publisher magazine, believes the magazine will be a regional trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In pockets, the audience is great,'' said O'Neill, who
previously was president of TV Update, a service that provided TV
listings to newspapers. ``I don't see magazines or TV or major
communication outlets going automatically Hispanic in a major way.
TV Guide is just trying to be aggressive with their product.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's circulation has dropped dramatically during the
past decade. One source said subscriptions have dropped from a high
of about 20 million to 13 million now.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do a Spanish insert for a Spanish market is quite an
operational commitment on their part,'' O'Neill said, ``but the
returns are potentially enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   One early return: Cartagena said ad sales for the insert are
sold out for the fourth quarter of 1999.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the 14 months since President Clinton ordered a
cruise missile strike on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, his aides
have steadfastly defended the decision. Clinton, they say, acted on
evidence that left no doubt the factory was involved with chemical
weapons and linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile they blame
for blowing up two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But a re-examination of the decision, based on interviews with
key participants, shows that it was far more difficult than the
administration has acknowledged and that the voices of dissent were
numerous.
</P>
<P>
   Officials throughout the government raised doubts up to the eve
of the attack about whether the United States had sufficient
information linking the factory to either chemical weapons or to
bin Laden, according to participants in the interviews. They said
senior diplomatic and intelligence officials had argued strenuously
over whether any target in Sudan should be attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Aides passed on their doubts to the secretary of state and the
director of central intelligence, officials said. But the national
security advisor, Sandy Berger, who played a pivotal role in
approving the strike, said in an interview that he was not aware of
any questions about the strength of the evidence on the factory
before the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, some senior officials moved to suppress
internal dissent, officials said. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and a senior deputy, they said, encouraged State
Department intelligence analysts to kill a report being drafted
that concluded that the bombing was not justified.
</P>
<P>
   The new accounts of the deliberations provide the clearest
explanation to date of the reasoning behind one of the most debated
military actions undertaken by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials said they were told that the president and his
aides had approved the operation _ code-named Infinite Reach _ to
show that the United States could hit back against an adversary
that had bombed U.S. embassies simultaneously in two countries.
</P>
<P>
   And, some officials said, the president's chief advisers
concluded that the risks of striking the wrong target were far
outweighed by the possibility that the plant in Sudan was making
chemical weapons for a terrorist eager to acquire and use them.
</P>
<P>
   Like many decisions of this kind, the decision to bomb the plant
was made under intense pressure and with a sense of urgency created
by intelligence showing that bin Laden was contemplating another
lethal attack against the United States. ``We would have been
derelict in our duty not to have proceeded,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former U.S. officials agreed to discuss the
operation because, more than a year later, they continue to be
plagued by doubts about whether it was justified. They said they
are still troubled by the lack of a full airing of what they view
as gaps in the evidence linking the plant, called Al Shifa, to bin
Laden. And they complain that the decision-making process was so
secretive that Al Shifa was not vetted by many of the government's
experts on chemical weapons sites or terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The officials brought to light several previously unknown
aspects of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at the pivotal meeting reviewing the targets, the
director of central intelligence, George Tenet, was said to have
cautioned Clinton's top advisers that while he believed the
evidence connecting bin Laden to the factory was strong, it was
less than iron clad.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that the link between bin Laden and the factory could
be ``drawn only indirectly and by inference,'' according to notes
taken by a participant. The plant's involvement with chemical
weapons, Tenet told his colleagues, was more certain, confirmed by
a soil sample taken from near the site that contained an ingredient
of nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said he does not recall that Tenet raised any such doubts
at the meeting. ``I would say the director was very clear in his
judgment that the plant was associated with chemical weapons,''
Berger said. ``No one in the discussion questioned whether Al Shifa
was an appropriate target.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few hours before the attack, officials said, Clinton
called off a planned attack on a second target in Sudan, a tannery,
after senior military officers raised questions about the risks of
civilian casualties and the evidence connecting it to bin Laden.
The last-minute campaign was led by Gen. Harry H. Shelton, who
enlisted other senior officers in an effort to undo the
recommendation of Clinton's civilian advisers.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20, 1998, U.S. missiles hit two targets, demolishing Al
Shifa and several of bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan. Within days,
Western engineers who had worked at the Sudan factory were
asserting that it was, as Sudan claimed, a working pharmaceutical
plant. Reporters visiting the ruined building saw bottles of
medicine but no signs of security precautions and no obvious signs
of a chemical weapons manufacturing operation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the strike, as criticism mounted, the
administration closed ranks, publicly asserting that the
intelligence was persuasive. But the doubts persisted, particularly
at the State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research.
</P>
<P>
   Before the attack, the bureau had written a report for Albright
questioning the evidence linking Al Shifa to bin Laden.Following
the bombing, analysts renewed their doubts and told Assistant
Secretary of State Phyllis Oakley that the CIA's evidence on which
the attack had been based was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oakley asked them to double-check; perhaps there was some
intelligence they had not yet seen. The answer came back quickly:
There was no additional evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oakley called a meeting of key aides and a consensus
emerged: Contrary to what the administration was saying, the case
tying Al Shifa to bin Laden or to chemical weapons was weak. Ms.
Oakley told her aides to draft a report reflecting their
skepticism, a significant step because there was a chance its
findings might leak out.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oakley told Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering that
her aides were preparing a report that would sharply question the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Pickering asked whether the report contained any
information omitted from the State Department's previous study. Ms.
Oakley said no. In that case, Pickering said, there was no reason
to raise the issue again.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Al Shifa strike,'' Pickering said in an interview,
Ms. Oakley told him her staff ``was working on a draft, and we both
agreed that there was nothing new in what it had to say. She and I
discussed the idea of pursuing it further, and I said I didn't see
the value in pursuing it further, and she agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   But other officials say that while she accepted the order to
kill the report, Ms. Oakley, who retired from the State Department
last month after 42 years, privately expressed a sense of
frustration and concern over the decision. Other officials in the
intelligence bureau have also expressed concern over the action.
Ms. Oakley declined to be quoted in this article.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was after the strike and I didn't see the point,''
Pickering said. ``There was not an effort to shut off a new
inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oakley passed on Pickering's order to her analysts.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later, Albright asked Ms. Oakley about the
report and was assured that work had been stopped. Ms. Oakley
replied that there was not going to be any report, according to
people familiar with the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Albright doesn't recall the details of her conversation with Ms.
Oakley, but does remember that she was ``not interested in having
that debate rehashed,'' said James Rubin the State Department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said the report was being drafted solely for the use
of himself and Albright, both of whom were already aware of the
intelligence bureau's qualms.
</P>
<P>
   A reconstruction of events shows that Ms. Oakley was hardly the
only senior government official to question the intelligence
linking Sudan, bin Laden and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's suspicions about Sudan's links to chemical weapons
date back to the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War in 1991. The CIA
received reports that Iraqi chemical weapons experts had visited
Khartoum, prompting suspicions that Iraq was shifting some of its
production of chemical weapons to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, bin Laden moved to Sudan after his exile
from Saudi Arabia and began to invest heavily in Sudanese
commercial enterprises, often through joint ventures with the
government, while using Sudan as a base for his loosely knit
international terrorist organization, Al Qaeda, U.S. intelligence
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA received intelligence reports indicating that in 1995,
bin Laden won tentative approval from Sudanese leaders to begin
developing chemical weapons in Sudan for use against U.S. troops in
Saudi Arabia. But in 1996, the Sudanese, responding to pressure
from the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, forced bin Laden to leave,
prompting the Saudi radical and many of his supporters to retreat
to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the United States had pulled its embassy staff out of
Sudan and had closed down the CIA's Khartoum station, citing
threats of terrorist action. Some U.S. intelligence officials now
acknowledge that the decision to pull out left the United States
with only a limited capacity to understand events in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about the Al Shifa plant arose in the CIA in the
summer of 1997. U.S. intelligence officials said an informant
reported that two facilities in Khartoum might be involved in
chemical weapons production. The informant also mentioned a third
site _ Al Shifa _ on which he had less information but which was
suspicious because it had high fences and stringent security.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, an agent working for the CIA collected a soil
sample at a site about 60 feet away from the plant, directly across
an access road from the main entrance, according to U.S. officials.
U.S. officials say the sample was taken on open ground outside the
factory fence, on land that does not appear to have been owned by
Al Shifa.
</P>
<P>
   That soil contained about two and a half times the normal trace
amounts of Empta, a chemical used in the production of VX nerve
gas, a senior U.S. official said. The results prompted a heated
debate among U.S. intelligence analysts about Al Shifa's possible
links to weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, 1998, the CIA issued its first report on Al Shifa,
based on the soil sample, spy satellite photographs and other
intelligence. The CIA report highlighted apparent links between Al
Shifa and bin Laden, including indirect financial connections
through Sudan's Military Industrial Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   But CIA analysts also suggested that additional information
would be needed to be more certain about Al Shifa. One key
paragraph, entitled ``next steps,'' called for more soil samples to
be taken and requested additional spy satellite photographs of the
site.
</P>
<P>
   The report also raised a new question about the evidence against
Al Shifa by noting that there were no longer signs of heavy
security around the plant.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 4, 1998, the CIA issued a more ominous report, one that
assessed the possible connection between Sudan, bin Laden and his
efforts to obtain chemical weapons. It mentioned Al Shifa, but the
report's highlight was new intelligence indicating that bin Laden,
who earlier in the year had announced a renewed ``holy war''
against the United States, had acquired chemical or nuclear
materials and ``might be ready'' to conduct a chemical attack.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, intelligence analysts responded with
skepticism. In an Aug. 6 memo for senior department policymakers,
Ms. Oakley's analysts argued that, even with the new intelligence
in the Aug. 4 report, the evidence linking Al Shifa to bin Laden
and chemical weapons was still weak.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es
Saalam, Tanzania, were bombed, and the United States soon concluded
bin Laden was behind both attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and a small group of his most senior advisors _
including Berger, Defense Secretary William Cohen, Albright,
Pickering, and Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff _ quickly decided to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   On August 8, the president's senior advisors ordered the
Pentagon's Joint Staff and the CIA to provide a list of sites
connected to bin Laden and his organization that could be bombed.
</P>
<P>
   A group of officials that included the CIA's Counter-Terrorism
Center prepared a list of about 20 possible targets in three
countries: Afghanistan, Sudan and one nation that U.S. officials
declined to identify. It spelled out the evidence linking each
target to bin Laden's organization and weighed the risks, including
those for ``collateral damage'' _ the military term for
accidentally hitting civilians. The plant at Al Shifa was on the
list, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, senior U.S. intelligence officials met to discuss Al
Shifa and debated whether additional soil samples were needed.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 12, after the list was winnowed down, Clinton and key
National Security Council officials were briefed for the first time
on the possible targets, including Al Shifa, by Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the CIA received a report that changed the nature
of the debate and the pace of planning for the retaliatory strike.
New intelligence showed that bin Laden and his key lieutenants
would be meeting at camps in Khost, Afghanistan, on Aug. 20.
Reports also indicated that bin Laden might be planning further
attacks, possibly with chemical weapons.The Afghan camps were
already among the top priority targets proposed by the Pentagon and
CIA planners.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Some officials said the White House seemed determined to hit bin
Laden in more than one place. Richard Clarke, the senior National
Security Council aide who played a pivotal role in planning the
operation on behalf of the president, later explained to a
colleague that the Saudi exile had shown ``global reach'' by
attacking U.S. embassies simultaneously in two countries. The
United States, he then said, had to respond by attacking his
network beyond its haven in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Clarke said it was the president and his
principal foreign policy advisers who ``obviously decided to attack
in more than one place.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the White House meeting on Aug. 19, where the final
recommendations were to be made to the president, officials chose
to target the Afghan training camps and two sites in the Sudan: Al
Shifa and a tannery in Khartoum that intelligence reports indicated
was linked to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Berger denies that there was a significant debate about the
evidence concerning Al Shifa during that meeting. Rather, he said,
there were ``geopolitical'' questions raised about whether it was
appropriate to strike Sudan, an Arab country where bin Laden no
longer lived. ``There were a few people who felt we shouldn't go to
a second country, but those questions were not based on any doubts
about Al Shifa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes taken at the meeting, however, say that Tenet, the
director of central intelligence, alluded to ``gaps'' in the case
linking bin Laden to the factory. The agency, he said, was working
to ``close the intelligence gaps on this target.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said he had been careful to delineate ``what we knew and
didn't know, what the risks were, and what the downsides were,''
about Al Shifa.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Shelton objected to striking the Khartoum
tannery, both because of the potential that missiles might hit
civilians and because the site was not suspected of being involved
in chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Officials recall that the debate was halted by Berger. The
administration, he said, would justifiably be pilloried if the
United States did not destroy Al Shifa and bin Laden later launched
a chemical attack that could have been pre-empted.
</P>
<P>
   A recommendation was sent to Clinton to attack the Afghan camps,
Al Shifa and the tannery.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Shelton and told his colleagues among the Joint
Chiefs of Staff about the planned bombing, in part to gain their
help in convincing the White House to drop the tannery as a target.
It was the first time the service chiefs had been told about the
pending operation.
</P>
<P>
   After their meeting, Shelton called the White House to say that
the officers shared his opposition to bombing the tannery. Other
senior officials began to object, and Berger relayed those concerns
to Clinton on Martha's Vineyard. At about midnight, Clinton
consulted some of his senior advisors about the matter and at about
2 a.m. ordered that the tannery be removed from the target list.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In Washington, late in the day on Aug. 19th, several officials,
including members of the administration's committee of top
counter-terrorism experts, were summoned to Clarke's office at the
National Security Council and told to remain there for the evening.
The group's members had met previously to discuss the idea of a
retaliatory strike but had not been involved selecting targets.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were told of the decision to strike for the first
time that night by Clarke, according to a participant in the
meeting. But as Clarke gave them reports to read about Al Shifa, he
was met with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the group told Clarke that they believed the
intelligence on Al Shifa was too thin. ``People said, ``Dick, what
is this?'' according to the participant,
</P>
<P>
   but Clarke brushed aside those concerns and said the decision to
strike had already been made.
</P>
<P>
   The officials had been summoned that night not to pass judgment
on the targets, Clarke told them, but to help prepare paperwork
related to the operation, including talking points for U.S.
ambassadors around the world and briefings for Congress and the
press that would begin after the strike was completed.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Clarke denied that anyone had raised doubts to
him during that meeting or at any other time either before or after
the Al Shifa strike. The ``people brought in the night before were
brought in to do paperwork,'' not to review the targets, he said.
Across the Potomac River, at the CIA's headquarters in Langley,
Va., similar worries were being expressed. Senior agency officials
gathered in Tenet's conference room to discuss the targets and, one
participant said, there was strong disagreement about the plans.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Al Shifa also surfaced at the State Department
just before the attack. Pickering was shown the intelligence
analysts' memo expressing skepticism about the CIA's intelligence
on Al Shifa, he said. Pickering said he mentioned the report's
findings to Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering and Ms. Albright both decided to support the decision
to strike, however. They were convinced that the CIA's materials _
primarily the soil sample from Al Shifa _ were persuasive, he said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the strike, an international controversy
erupted, with Sudan demanding damages and an independent review of
case. In Washington, senior officials insisted in press briefings
that the links between bin Laden, the factory, and chemical weapons
were strong and compelling.
</P>
<P>
   There was much less certainty behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the strike, word began to filter out of the
government that senior U.S. intelligence officials, including Jack
Downing, the head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, its
clandestine espionage arm, believed the Sudan strike was not
justified.
</P>
<P>
   Others raising similar questions included the head of the
African Division in the clandestine service and the chief of the
CIA's Counter-Terrorism Center, whose own office had collected the
intelligence on the site.
</P>
<P>
   While they did not question that the intelligence on Al Shifa
raised strong suspicions, they found the connections between Sudan,
Al Shifa and bin Laden too indirect to support the administration's
public statements justifying the attack. . Downing and the other
two officials, whose names have been withheld at the request of the
CIA, would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   At the intelligence branch of the State Department, officials
began drafting the report renewing doubts about the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the strike, the CIA conducted an after-action study
and gathered intelligence about the plant's owner, a Sudanese-born
businessman named Salah Idris. In the weeks after the strike, the
agency said it had found new evidence about his possible financial
connections to the terrorist group Islamic Jihad, which in turn has
strong connections to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   But agency officials acknowledged that at the time of the strike
they had not known that he owned the plant. Today, officials also
acknowledge that the soil sample collected at Al Shifa was obtained
about four months before Idris bought the plant in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now, officials also say that Idris was never put on the
government's terrorist watch list, either before or after the
attack, which would prevent him from obtaining a visa to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   After the strike, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign
Assets Control froze Idris' accounts at Bank of America's branches
in London and Guernsey, in the Channel Islands. That prompted Idris
to file suit against the government seeking the release his funds.
In May, Treasury agreed to unfreeze his assets, which totalled more
than $24 million, just before the government's response to his
lawsuit was due in court. Idris has reportedly considered filing
suit against the United States seeking damages for the loss of his
plant, but has not yet done so.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, meanwhile, remains in Afghanistan, and the United
States has warned repeatedly over the past year that he has been
attempting to conduct further terrorist acts against U.S. targets.
Senior Clinton administration officials now say they believe bin
Laden is trying to develop chemical weapons in Afghanistan, and may
have obtained them.

REPUBLICAN PLAN FOR SPENDING CUT COMES UNDER INCREASED ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The latest plan from Republican congressional
leaders to wrap up their work on spending bills with an
across-the-board cut came under attack on Tuesday from Republican
lawmakers and the nation's top military officer.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a wave of criticism that includes a veto threat
from the White House, the House Republican whip, Tom DeLay of
Texas, warned President Clinton that he would be blamed if the plan
failed and a government shutdown resulted.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert made two concessions as he sought
to quell dissent among Republicans and win passage of the plan as
early as Wednesday. He said that the cut could be as low as 1
percent, instead of the 1.4 percent proposed on Monday, and he
agreed that the cut would include congressional salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing budget negotiations between the White House and
Congress are aimed at seeking ways to pass the remaining five of 13
spending bills to run government agencies without dipping into
surplus Social Security funds and without scuttling programs dear
to President Clinton. The two sides are separated by about $10
billion worth of programs, including money to hire teachers and
police officers, and a thicket of thorny policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert vowed to stake his job and Republican control of the
House in next year's elections on passing a budget without spending
surplus Social Security funds, a goal that now relys on an
across-the-board cut.
</P>
<P>
   In chorus, the most senior Democrats in Congress and the White
House chief of staff on Tuesday denounced the cuts as ``mindless.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn, DeLay personally challenged Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find the billions in savings if you want to keep the
government open,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   The clear implication was that if the president vetoed the cuts,
he would have to cut the budget himself if he wanted to avoid a
government shutdown, and take the heat if he failed.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said he was not threatening to shut the government down, a
strategy that proved politically disastrous for Republicans when
they reached a similar spending impasse with Clinton in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have said, `Mr. President, you've told the American
people you don't like this way of keeping the budget balanced,'''
Delay said. ```If you don't like our ideas, then the American
people need to know what your ideas are.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he vetoes it, the American people should expect him to come
up with his own solutions,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   But members of his party said on Tuesday that they did not
strongly support DeLay's solution.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William F. Goodling of Pennsylvania said the cut would not
pass without support from Democrats _ a highly unlikely event _ and
that its passage would be political fodder for Republicans'
opponents in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the Republican caucus believe it's not the
way to go,'' Goodling said. ``It's the easy way, but it gives the
opposition all sorts of opportunities to demagogue the issues _
health care, school lunches, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the plan's prospects were damaged on Tuesday when the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton,
testified that even a 1 percent cut at the Pentagon _ about $2.7
billion _ would cripple the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be devastating,'' he told the Senate Armed Services
Committee. ``It would be disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans argued that a 1 percent across-the-board cut _
as opposed to the 1.4 percent reduction they proposed on Monday _
could be easily obtained by identifying ``waste, fraud and abuse''
in government programs, including military spending.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert also said the 1 percent cut would shave back the
salaries of members of Congress, who just raised their own pay to
$141,300 from $139,900 in January, but should not affect other
government workers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Senate Republicans were less enthusiastic than their House
counterparts. ``If forced to do it, I will accept 1 percent across
the board,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska. The majority leader,
Trent Lott of Mississippi, said the cuts ``may be necessary,'' but
should be ``as small as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House chief of staff, John Podesta, said that while
the president might propose ways to find savings, it was up to
Congress to cut its own budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've put together a budget that is full of pork _ boats
that the Pentagon didn't request, planes that the Pentagon didn't
request,'' Podesta said. ``Before we start cutting meals on wheels,
and veterans, and education, they ought to go back and look at the
things they've already put into the budget that have fattened this
thing up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most Congress is allowed to spend for fiscal 2000 under the
rules it set for itself is $594 billion. Its auditors at the
Congressional Budget Office say the Republican-written spending
bills add up to at least $609 billion, or $15 billion in spending
that would have to come from surplus Social Security revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans contend that they are only about $5 billion over
the limit, a sum that would be covered by a 1 percent
across-the-board budget cut. Both parties have vowed not to touch
the Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans cannot force an across-the-board cut, they
have three choices left: break their pledge and spend Social
Security surpluses, eliminate billions in spending, or compromise
with Clinton in negotiations on spending and policy issues, a
prospect they dread.

AMERICANS STILL PACKING ON THE POUNDS, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite a seeming obsession with their health, diet, and
exercise, Americans are getting fatter and fatter. New data
released Tuesday show that more than half of all adults in the
United Sates are overweight, and the number of obese people _
defined as being 30 percent over the ideal weight _ has increased
from 12 percent in 1991 to almost 18 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say they are stunned at how fast Americans are
adding extra pounds, and some said that obesity _ which kills about
325,000 every year _ should be considered a real public health
problem and not simply a cosmetic one.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Blackburn, director of the division of nutrition at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said that over the last 15
years, Americans have become aware that diet and exercise can
reduce the risk for many health complications, such as high blood
pressure, heart disease, or diabetes, but they just aren't ready to
do it yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fewer people are doing what they know they should do. Instead,
everybody just wants a magic bullet,'' Blackburn said. ``But they
don't realize if they can just spend an extra few minutes each day,
and as little as 200 calories less a day,'' they would be 20 pounds
lighter by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   some researchers are calling for the country to adopt
high-profile strategies to combat the growing girth of the nation.
Similar to the national antismoking campaign, the measures proposed
would tax high-fat foods, require sidewalks and bicycle paths in
cities, and mandate more open space and athletic facilities in
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly Journal of the American Medical Association, which
devoted its entire issue Tuesday to the problem of obesity, said
the highest weight increases have been among people 18 to 29,
people with higher education, and Hispanics. But its study also
found that ``a steady increase was observed in all states; in both
sexes; across age groups, races, educational levels; and occurred
regardless of smoking status.''
</P>
<P>
   Aviva Must of Tufts University School of Medicine, one of the
study's authors, said that once people are overweight, the risk for
multiple health complications increases. ``Patients may already be
30 pounds over by the time the doctor approaches them. Where was
this physician when you were five pounds overweight? Or 10 pounds?
Doctors have been reluctant to intervene on just obesity, since it
has not been considered a disease itself,'' Must said.

<P>
   In an editorial, CDC Director Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, who grew up in
Quincy, said a multifaceted approach is needed to cure the obesity
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in Quincy, I walked on both sides of the street and
played ball. Where I live now, there are no sidewalks and no open
fields for kids to play. It's those things to make it easier to
exercise,'' Koplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons why Americans are gaining weight are easy to spot.
</P>
<P>
   Although weight-loss products and services are a
$33-billion-a-year industry, and weight-loss books typically make
the best-seller lists, people are simply eating more. Blackburn
said restaurant consumption is up, with working people eating at
least one meal out every day and at least two or three times a week
at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Health club memberships may be up, but Joseph Donnelly, chairman
of health, sport, and exercise sciences at the University of
Kansas, said that after six months, 50 percent of new fitness club
members quit.
</P>
<P>
   William Dietz, director of the CDC's division of Nutrition and
Physical Activity, suggested that even health-care professionals
need to change their mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way is to focus on how physicians take care of their own
diets. There are still lots of grand rounds that serve donuts,''
Dietz said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though doctors stress the only surefire method to drop
weight is to eat less and exercise more, even JAMA couldn't resist
hinting that there may be help in a promising drug to fight
obesity. In a preliminary JAMA report, one small study indicates
that the hormone leptin helps people achieve weight loss, though
some people lost no weight in the study. The data from was first
released more than a year ago by Amgen, the company that sponsored
the study. Experts say that more research is needed to see whether
leptin can help certain obese people lose weight.

SPECIALISTS SUSPECT LOSS OF CABIN PRESSURE DOOMED PLANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The plane had been checked thoroughly. The crew was
professional. In the event of cabin depressurization, there were
oxygen masks at the ready and several instruments to warn of a
dangerous drop in air pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Several aviation specialists say such a loss of cabin pressure
is the most likely explanation for what caused golf professional
Payne Stewart's private Learjet to fly hundreds of miles off course
with only an automatic pilot at the controls before nose-diving to
earth with such force that the top of the wreckage is 10 feet deep
in a crater. The accident killed Stewart and five others on the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   But &UR;  &LR; loss-of-pressure accidents are extremely rare in business
aviation. The airplanes are well equipped to prevent such an
incident from becoming a catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Further compounding the mystery is the possibility that we will
never know what caused the crew to lose consciousness shortly after
taking off from Orlando on Monday en route to Dallas. The plane
never turned west, but continued on a straight northwest heading
before running out of fuel and crashing in South Dakota four hours
later.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board vice chairman Robert
Francis said Tuesday that the crash site was in a fairly compact
area, about 30 feet by 40 feet. Bringing up the wreckage from 10
feet down without causing further damage to the mangled airplane
will be a painstaking process, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane is broken up pretty badly. It is going to take some
very close examination to determine anything at all,'' said one
transportation official.
</P>
<P>
   The plane did not have a flight data recorder. There was a
cockpit voice recorder, but that is a 30-minute continuous loop
tape. Therefore, it is unlikely to yield any clues if it is
recovered, since it would only capture the last 30 minutes of the
flight and the crew was perhaps unconscious or dead from hypoxia _
a loss of oxygen that prevents the brain and other organs from
functioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that physical evidence will shed a lot of light
on it,'' said John Hansman, a professor of aeronautics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Golf course designer Bruce Borland was not originally scheduled
to be on the flight, said James Watkins, president of Sunjet
Aviation Inc., which maintained and managed the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The itinerary called for a morning trip to Dallas where Stewart
and his agents Robert Fraley and Van Ardan, were to look at
potential sites for golf courses, and then a flight later that day
to Houston where Stewart was scheduled to compete in a golf
tournament. Borland apparently got on at the last minute, Watkins
said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane took off from Orlando International Airport at 9:19
a.m. The Federal Aviation Administration said the last contact
controllers had with the airplane was at 9:44, when the crew
responded to an order to climb to 39,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Several aviation specialists theorized that a loss of
pressurization in the cabin incapacitated pilot Michael J. Kling,
who had 4,000 hours of flight time, and copilot Stephanie
Bellegarrigue, who had 1,700 hours.
</P>
<P>
   One puzzle is that the crew should have been able to maintain
control of the plane and land safely even with a loss of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of cabin depressurization: one is sudden and
severe, the other a slow gradual loss of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden loss of pressure can be catastrophic, but even so the
crew should have had enough time to don emergency masks.
Furthermore, Captain Chris Hamilton, an F-16 pilot who flew within
500 feet of the aircraft for about 10 minutes, saw no sign of a
hole in the fuselage or a blown-out window.
</P>
<P>
   One good indication the crew was not aware of the problem is
that the autopilot stayed on. After putting on masks, the first
thing pilots are trained to do is to disconnect the autopilot and
put the plane into a hard descending turn, Hansman said. Instead,
the plane remained on autopilot, flying a straight northwesterly
course until it crashed some 1,400 miles after taking off.
</P>
<P>
   If the loss of pressure was slow _ or the system never
functioned at all _ an alarm should have sounded in the cockpit and
the crew should have known something was amiss by reading the
cockpit altimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not clear to me that the plane ever pressurized,''
Hansman said. If that occurred, the onset of hypoxia would have
been slow, affecting each person differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may have been some event, like a self-contained fire, or
something else that incapacitated them, because the altimeter or
the annunciator on board should have alerted them.''

MARKET PLACE: SWITCH IN STOCKS MAY MAKE DOW MORE VOLATILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average, whose performance
has lagged behind the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index in recent
years, on Tuesday dropped four stocks that have not done well
recently and substituted four stocks that have done much better.
</P>
<P>
   By removing four relatively dull performers and substituting
highfliers, the editors of The Wall Street Journal, who determine
the index's components, made it likely that the Dow will be more
volatile than it has been. Whether it will also be a better
performer is likely to turn on the question of whether large
technology stocks continue to be market leaders. The changes are
effective Monday. Two of the stocks being added, Intel and
Microsoft, are the first from the NASDAQ stock market, ending the
monopoly of New York Stock Exchange-listed companies in the
average. The other stocks that are being added are Home Depot, the
specialty retailer, and SBC Communications, one of the regional
Bell phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks being dropped, all of which had been in the Dow since
1930 or earlier, are the oil company Chevron; the retail chain
Sears Roebuck; ; the chemical company Union Carbide, and Goodyear
Tire and Rubber Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal managing editor Paul Steiger said the
changes would make the Dow ``even more representative of the
evolving U.S. economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the last change in the components of the Dow, when four
stocks were added in March 1997, the index has risen 49 percent.
But over the same period, Goodyear and Sears have declined in value
while the other stocks being taken out have risen less than the
Dow. Over all, the stocks being removed have shown a decline.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the four stocks being added have been sterling
performers. SBC is up about 65 percent, Intel has more than doubled
and the other two have tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street Journal markets editor John Prestbo said ``stock
performance is not a factor in deciding whether to take a company
out, or which one to add.'' He said the editors had ``made a
conscious effort to get rid of duplicate companies,'' leading to
the elimination of Chevron while Exxon remained and to the dropping
of Sears while Wal-Mart stayed.
</P>
<P>
   A calculation by The New York Times indicates that had the four
new stocks been added to the Dow at the time of the last change, in
1997, the Dow would have been up 71 percent since that change,
significantly better than the 62 percent gain shown by the S&AMP;P 500.
In fact, the Dow was up 49 percent over the period, leaving it well
behind the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak this summer, the Dow would have topped 12,800 had
the new stocks been in it. The actual high was 11,326.
</P>
<P>
   The competition between indexes has become more important
because both Standard &AMP; Poor's and Dow Jones license their indexes
for option and futures trading and make money based on how popular
such derivatives are with traders.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Microsoft and Intel do not trade on the New York
Stock Exchange had no effect, either on the decision to include
them in the average now or on the decision not to add them earlier,
Prestbo said. He noted that the Dow Jones transportation average
had added NASDAQ stocks in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the move served as a reminder of the inability of the Big
Board, historically the place where large American companies
traded, to lure away the most successful technology companies from
NASDAQ. It prompted Frank Zarb, the chief executive of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, the parent of the NASDAQ market,
to declare, ``The inclusion of these two NASDAQ companies makes the
Dow more reflective of today's global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes are likely to bring on substantial trading by index
funds based on the Dow and by the managers of the so-called
Diamonds, investment trusts that trade on the American Stock
Exchange and mimic the Dow. With more than $1.1 billion in
Diamonds, the managers will have to sell more than 500,000 shares
of each of the stocks being removed and buy a similar number of
each stock being added.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, the Dow had just one large computer technology
company, IBM. Then it added Hewlett-Packard, and now it is adding
Microsoft, the dominant personal computer software company, and
Intel, the leading maker of semiconductor chips for such computers.
Because those stocks are relatively high priced, the technology
stocks will make up 16 percent of the index. Even so, that is below
the 25 percent technology weighting in the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 changes to the Dow also added Wal-Mart, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and Travelers Group, now called Citigroup after merging
with Citicorp. The companies taken out then were Texaco, Bethlehem
Steel, Woolworth _ since renamed Venator _ and Westinghouse. As is
the case now, the companies that were removed had been poor
performers in the years before they were taken out of the average.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 1997 rejects have continued to lag the market since
that move. Only Westinghouse, since renamed CBS after taking over
the television network, has outperformed the Dow since the last
change. Of the four that were added, all but Hewlett-Packard have
outperformed the index.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average is by far the most widely
followed index of U.S. stocks, in part because it is the oldest
continual index around, dating back to 1896 (The original version
was dropped during World War I, and Dow Jones did not make the next
version continuous in terms of prices with the earlier one.)
</P>
<P>
   The definition of an industrial stock used by Dow Jones is a
broad one, basically making all companies eligible except those
that could be in the Dow Jones transportation or utility averages.
The latter index has traditionally included electric and gas
utilities, not telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   While the S&AMP;P 500 is much broader, it dates only to the 1920s
and is less well known. Ask money managers how they are doing over
some period of time, and they will probably compare their
performances to the S&AMP;P 500. But ask what the market is doing on a
given day, and the same manager is likely to describe how far the
Dow has risen or fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most major indexes, which are weighted based on the
market value of the company, the Dow is computed on a
price-weighted basis. The closing prices of the 30 Dow stocks are
added up and divided by a divisor, now 0.1974, which is adjusted
whenever a stock in the Dow splits or when new companies are added.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the highest weighted stock in the Dow will continue
to be American Express, now worth about $144 a share. It will have
a larger effect on the average than Microsoft, now worth about $92
a share, even though Microsoft has a market value _ and thus a
weighting in the S&AMP;P 500 _ that is more than seven times the value
of American Express.
</P>
<P>
   At the current divisor for the Dow, a rise of 50 cents in each
of the 30 stocks would send the average up 75 points. The divisor
will rise slightly next week because the stocks being added trade
at higher prices than the ones being removed.

FORD BUYS A GLOBAL TELEVISION ROADBLOCK AT 9 P.M. ON MONDAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: New Zealand, Britain, France, Germany, Italy,   Mich.)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Turn on a TV set almost anywhere around the world at about 9
p.m. local time on Monday, and chances are a Ford commercial will
be on.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Ford Motor, in an unusual stunt, is buying an
estimated $10 million of commercial time on dozens of national and
pan-regional TV networks _ 40 broadcast and cable channels in
America alone _ to run a single, two-minute spot.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed to be the most widespread use of one commercial
at one time by a giant advertiser, which will also include showing
the spot on two Web sites, www.ford.com and www.broadcast.com.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's ambitious effort to present the commercial to millions of
people at the same hour _ known in industry parlance as a roadblock
_ is emblematic of the extraordinary steps being taken by major
marketers to stand out in a cacophonous, cluttered media landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the beauties of television is its massive, immediate
reach,'' said Jon Mandel, co-managing director of Mediacom in New
York, an agency owned by Grey Advertising that buys commercial time
and advertising space for marketers like Hasbro, Mars, Oracle and
Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   ``But because there's now a gazillion channels to watch, reach
declines further and further,'' he added. ``I'd call what Ford is
doing pretty big.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional commercial is intended to help welcome the
millennium and celebrate Ford customers for their diversity.
Viewers will hear Charlotte Church, a 13-year-old soprano, sing an
uplifting tune, ``Just Wave Hello,'' as they watch footage filmed
in nine countries. There are scenes of people of various races and
nationalities engaged in everyday activities: arguing with a lover,
exercising, bidding a friend goodbye, sightseeing, dancing, working
and, of course, watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   All that loving, leaving and living _ presented in an upbeat
manner reminiscent of ``It's A Small World'' or ``We Are the
World'' _ takes place in the presence of Fords, vintage and
contemporary. They represent the seven brands the company makes
from Aston Martin to Volvo and include a Model T, pickups, a sleek
Lincoln, buses, a Jaguar XK8, a 1999 Ford Mustang and a 2000 Ford
Focus.
</P>
<P>
   Though the spot is the first to include all the Ford brands, its
purpose is less about selling cars and trucks than it is about
burnishing Ford's image. The goal: generate warm and fuzzy feelings
about Ford as part of the mission of Jacques A. Nasser, the new
chief executive, to have consumers perceive Ford as the world's
leading company for auto products and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to think our customers and prospective customers
would trust the Ford Motor Co.,'' said Jim Schroer, vice president
for global marketing at Ford, ``but you can't trust anybody unless
you know who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``People know what Ford is, a big automobile
manufacturer, but they don't know who Ford is. They don't know
we're a company with heart, soul, a passion for their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroer discussed the global roadblock in a phone interview in
advance of a news conference, scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in
midtown Manhattan. He predicted that the commercial would ``reach a
billion people, 300 million households, in one night.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroer and other executives plan to disclose details about the
commercial, which was created by a longtime Ford advertising
agency, the Detroit office of J. Walter Thompson, a unit of WPP
Group that handles assignments including the Ford division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mammoth task to pull it all together,'' said Ted
Powell, international creative director on the Ford account at
Thompson Detroit. ``We've been working on it for 10 months, getting
all the countries, all the satellite stations on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our research points to this being a world first,'' he
added, ``though somebody may come out of the woodwork claiming
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson Detroit is being assisted by other Ford agencies,
Powell said, like Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, also part of WPP, and
Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising. The media buying is being done by Ford
Motor Media and Mindshare, a joint venture of Thompson and Ogilvy.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how the global roadblock will work. The commercial will
begin running in New Zealand on the Internet, then head west around
the world _ ``following the sun just like the new millennium
will,'' as Schroer put it. The schedule calls for the spot to run
at around 9 p.m. in each country or region.
</P>
<P>
   Pan-regional networks that will carry the commercial overseas
include CNN International, Discovery, Eurosport and MTV; networks
in individual countries include ITV (Britain), TF1 (France), RAI1
(Italy) and RTL (Germany).
</P>
<P>
   In this country, the spot is to run on these broadcast networks:
ABC, CBS, Fox Broadcasting, NBC, Pax and WB. It will also be seen
on cable networks including A&AMP;E, Animal Planet, BET, Bravo, CNN,
Comedy Central, Discovery, E Entertainment Television, ESPN, FX,
the History Channel, Lifetime, MSNBC, Nick at Nite, the Sci-Fi
Channel, TBS, TNT, TNN, Univision, VH1 and the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is to run without a narration or voice-over
announcer. Ms. Church will be heard singing the song _ commissioned
by Ford and planned as the first track on her coming CD _ only in
English. Carolyn Brown, a spokeswoman for Ford, attributed that to
English being ``the universal language'' as well as ``the language
of our home base.''
</P>
<P>
   The global roadblock is the most recent in a series of unique
television events involving Ford.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1953, ``The Ford 50th Anniversary Show'' ran
simultaneously on CBS and NBC; the variety tribute featured stars
like Mary Martin, Ethel Merman and Frank Sinatra. The movie ``The
Wizard of Oz'' made its television debut in November 1956 as part
of ``Ford Star Jubilee,'' a series of lavish monthly specials.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, Ford was the sole sponsor of ``Schindler's List,''
which NBC ran without commercial interruptions. The Ford Focus is
being introduced with a skein of live spots by Thompson Detroit,
which began last month at the MTV Video Music Awards; those spots
are being modified to be less scripted and more spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   If an advertiser ``is saying something new and different and
wants everyone to know it,'' Mandel of Mediacom said, expensive and
extensive stunts like a global roadblock ``make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it's just done for the ego,'' he added, ``save your
money.''
</P>
<P>
   An anthemic commercial running around the world has another
purpose, Mandel said: ``cheerleading to yourselves,'' promoting the
company to its own employees, suppliers and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Schroer of Ford said: ``We call it our `Global Anthem.' We're
proud of our track record in the millennium we're leaving and we're
waving hello to a new millennium, a new generation.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, think of the commercial as the modern
manifestation of the old ad slogan, ``There's a Ford in your
future.''

FLEET PLANS COMPREHENSIVE WEB-BASED FINANCIAL SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is a brass-knuckled cost-cutter, not a speculator. His office
is full of trophy art from acquisitions, not mousepads and
management books from Amazon.com. He dislikes experiments and is
suspicious of trends.
</P>
<P>
   In a dot.com world, where Internet firms spend fortunes without
ever turning a profit, FleetBoston Financial chief executive
Terrence Murray seems out of place. But the bank that Murray has
built in his image is about to take a giant leap into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   In what it calls its biggest technology bet ever, Boston-based
Fleet will spend up to $100 million over the next 18 months to
launch a comprehensive Web-based financial service, with banking,
stock trading, mutual funds, credit cards, mortgages, financial
news, bill payment, and incentives all on one Web site for 8
million household customers in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Among the planned cyber offerings: real-time account data,
mortgage application-taking, portfolio calculators, corporate
research, investment advice from high-end financial publishers,
even four months' free service and reduced monthly fees from
Microsoft Network, the Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   The project, to be rolled out in stages and still in the works,
would be the newest entrant in the fast-shifting world of Web
finance. While Fleet already has basic Web banking and on-line
stock trading, ``we eventually want you to buy every financial
services product or service you could ever need through us,'' said
Blaise Heltai, managing director of Fleet's Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's bet is about more than technology. It is also a novel
wager that the future of on-line banking is inseparable from the
future of on-line investing, a trend that has taken off in recent
years and left many banks drooling with envy.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleet's move is a leap into uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The company, now the nation's eighth-largest bank after
acquiring BankBoston Corp for $16 billion, already faces a complex
technological task as it starts to mesh its old rival's computer
systems with its own.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fleet sees the Internet as a way to satisfy customers,
Murray's no-frills, bottom-line approach has won his bank few
prizes in the customer service category. And some industry analysts
say fleet.com, the company's Web site, is a visual mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's confusing, difficult to navigate, not intuitive,'' said
Ian Rubin a senior analyst of Tower Group, a research advisory and
consulting firm in Needham.
</P>
<P>
   Patching together different businesses in cyberspace will be
even tougher. Among other things, Fleet wants Web customers to have
access to research from Robertson Stephens, its investment bank.
And it is unclear how Fleet will sort out the brand-identity crisis
washing over Quick &AMP; Reilly, its discount stock brokerage, which
also runs an Internet-based unit, Suretrade.
</P>
<P>
   Even Fleet's own executives are hedging their bets on the
enterprise, which took off Tuesday as Fleet linked fleet.com, its
basic Web banking service, with Quick &AMP; Reilly. Customers can now
bank and trade stocks in one place without having to log on to
separate sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not at this point thinking about going national with a
broad Internet product,'' said Charles Gifford, Fleet's president
and chief operating officer and BankBoston's former head. ``I'm not
sure how you make money on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's efforts to stitch together its various parts on line and
establish a Web brand name are ``our largest single technology
commitment ever,'' said Eugene McQuade, Fleet's chief financial
officer. ``Clearly the Internet is a critical change,'' he said.
But he declined to say how much the on-line business could add to
Fleet's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the Web has become a financial hodgepodge of
on-line brokerages like ETrade, virtual banks like Wingspan.com,
and all-in-one money-management offerings through companies like
Fidelity Investments. Conservative by nature, banks are racing to
catch up to brokerages and e-commerce outfits as regulatory
barriers come tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   While many banks have Web outposts, and a few, like Fleet, own
brokerages, Fleet will be one of a tiny group to offer bank
products and stock trading in one place. Fleet also offers on-line
access to 2,000 mutual funds through Quick &AMP; Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fleet's efforts reflect a dilemma for banks now grappling
with an investing revolution that has lured legions on line and
left banks in the dust. Gifford, who compares the birth of the
Internet to the invention of the printing press, and who recently
bought pants through LandsEnd.com, spends an hour each Sunday
exploring the Web. Murray, bank insiders say, is not a surfer but
has held several one-on-one meetings with Gifford to plot Internet
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to be out there with an Internet presence, but
nobody is winning yet,'' observed Chuck Farkas, managing director
of Bain &AMP; Co's global financial services practice in Boston. ``Most
institutions have experienced the Internet as a money-losing
proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's basic strategy is to stick with old-fashioned
bricks-and-mortar branches and automated teller machines but
develop a major virtual presence _ an idea known as ``clicks and
mortar.''
</P>
<P>
   Other models include virtual banks, like the pioneering
Net.bank, with no branches or proprietary ATMs. Then there are the
stand-alone Web banks of traditional banks, with Bank One Corp's
Wingspan the most prominent example.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet is not the only traditional bank expanding into
cyberspace. Wells Fargo and Bank of America have established
on-line presences. More recent entrants include Citibank's new citi
f/i _ a virtual bank not linked to its giant parent's branches.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet sees Quick &AMP; Reilly, a national franchise it acquired in
1997 for $1.6 billion, as its secret weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best financial product on the Internet is the brokerage
product,'' said McQuade, adding that the high-yielding certificates
of deposit and checking accounts that are staple offerings of
Internet-only banks were dead-end propositions.
</P>
<P>
   That Fleet wants to look more like ETrade just as the on-line
brokerage, which recently bought Web bank Telebank Financial for
$1.8 billion, is trying to look more like a bank underscores the
blurring of boundaries among financial services providers.
</P>
<P>
   It is a change that is challenging all companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``On-line financial services is an asset game, and players must
offer the broadest, most widely accessible services possible to
acquire and retain those assets,'' wrote Jupiter Communications, an
Internet research firm, in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans have been slower to flock to on-line banking
than to cyberbrokerages, that could change in coming years. Jupiter
sees the number of on-line trading households growing from 4.3
million in 1998 to more than 20 million in 2003. The number of
on-line banking households will increase from 3.8 million last year
to 26 million in 2003, representing 25 percent of all US banking
households.
</P>
<P>
   But revenues from on-line banking will grow more modestly
compared with on-line investing, which means banks must focus on
developing and selling less traditional banking products, like
mutual funds, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet sees other opportunities as well. It wants corporate
customers to do more cash management business on line, and to set
up more ``storefronts'' for Web-based businesses, for which Fleet
handles credit card processing.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's new Web product for ordinary customers is based on
BankBoston's HomeLink _ a popular on-line banking program that will
soon replace Fleet's original, less-lauded product. BankBoston,
which had 22 percent of its customers on line, one of the highest
percentages in the industry, is phasing out its older PC Banking
system and will push customers to the Web next month.
</P>
<P>
   About 700,000 Fleet clients now use the new bank's electronic
banking services. Fleet also has 1.3 million customers at Quick &AMP;
Reilly, including 60,000 on line. And it has 400,000 accounts at
Suretrade, the brokerage's Web-only unit. By contrast, Citibank,
with 100 million clients worldwide, or five times more than Fleet,
has 750,000 on-line customers, according to spokesman Mark Rodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hedges, Fleet's retail head, said Fleet hoped to add
several hundred thousand customers to fleet.com by the end of next
year. The bank plans to hire two dozen new tech specialists to
develop Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, which recently spent $40 million on a computerized data
warehouse that collects and sorts details about customers, wants to
apply that same tailored marketing strategy, known as data-mining,
to on-line customers. The idea is to pitch products strategically,
so that a middle-aged customer won't be offered student loans,
while a college student won't be bombarded with home-equity
refinancing plans. Fleet is already a leader among US banks in
tailoring service levels to customer profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, which scoffs at Bank One's plans to spend a huge $150
million promoting Wingspan over its first year, will spend one-half
of its retail advertising and marketing budget promoting its
Internet efforts in 2000. It declined to name the amount.

LOSS OF CABIN PRESSURE SUSPECTED IN STEWART CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Also moving on national wire)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The plane had been checked thoroughly. The crew was
professional. In the event of cabin depressurization, there were
oxygen masks at the ready and several instruments to warn of a
dangerous drop in air pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Several aviation specialists say such a loss of cabin pressure
is the most likely explanation for what caused golf professional
Payne Stewart's private Learjet to fly hundreds of miles off course
with only an automatic pilot at the controls before nose-diving to
earth with such force that the top of the wreckage is 10 feet deep
in a crater. The accident killed Stewart and five others on the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   But &UR;  &LR; loss-of-pressure accidents are extremely rare in business
aviation. The airplanes are well equipped to prevent such an
incident from becoming a catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Further compounding the mystery is the possibility that we will
never know what caused the crew to lose consciousness shortly after
taking off from Orlando on Monday en route to Dallas. The plane
never turned west, but continued on a straight northwest heading
before running out of fuel and crashing in South Dakota four hours
later.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board vice chairman Robert
Francis said Tuesday that the crash site was in a fairly compact
area, about 30 feet by 40 feet. Bringing up the wreckage from 10
feet down without causing further damage to the mangled airplane
will be a painstaking process, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane is broken up pretty badly. It is going to take some
very close examination to determine anything at all,'' said one
transportation official.
</P>
<P>
   The plane did not have a flight data recorder. There was a
cockpit voice recorder, but that is a 30-minute continuous loop
tape. Therefore, it is unlikely to yield any clues if it is
recovered, since it would only capture the last 30 minutes of the
flight and the crew was perhaps unconscious or dead from hypoxia _
a loss of oxygen that prevents the brain and other organs from
functioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that physical evidence will shed a lot of light
on it,'' said John Hansman, a professor of aeronautics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Golf course designer Bruce Borland was not originally scheduled
to be on the flight, said James Watkins, president of Sunjet
Aviation Inc., which maintained and managed the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The itinerary called for a morning trip to Dallas where Stewart
and his agents Robert Fraley and Van Ardan, were to look at
potential sites for golf courses, and then a flight later that day
to Houston where Stewart was scheduled to compete in a golf
tournament. Borland apparently got on at the last minute, Watkins
said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane took off from Orlando International Airport at 9:19
a.m. The Federal Aviation Administration said the last contact
controllers had with the airplane was at 9:44, when the crew
responded to an order to climb to 39,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Several aviation specialists theorized that a loss of
pressurization in the cabin incapacitated pilot Michael J. Kling,
who had 4,000 hours of flight time, and copilot Stephanie
Bellegarrigue, who had 1,700 hours.
</P>
<P>
   One puzzle is that the crew should have been able to maintain
control of the plane and land safely even with a loss of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of cabin depressurization: one is sudden and
severe, the other a slow gradual loss of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden loss of pressure can be catastrophic, but even so the
crew should have had enough time to don emergency masks.
Furthermore, Captain Chris Hamilton, an F-16 pilot who flew within
500 feet of the aircraft for about 10 minutes, saw no sign of a
hole in the fuselage or a blown-out window.
</P>
<P>
   One good indication the crew was not aware of the problem is
that the autopilot stayed on. After putting on masks, the first
thing pilots are trained to do is to disconnect the autopilot and
put the plane into a hard descending turn, Hansman said. Instead,
the plane remained on autopilot, flying a straight northwesterly
course until it crashed some 1,400 miles after taking off.
</P>
<P>
   If the loss of pressure was slow _ or the system never
functioned at all _ an alarm should have sounded in the cockpit and
the crew should have known something was amiss by reading the
cockpit altimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not clear to me that the plane ever pressurized,''
Hansman said. If that occurred, the onset of hypoxia would have
been slow, affecting each person differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may have been some event, like a self-contained fire, or
something else that incapacitated them, because the altimeter or
the annunciator on board should have alerted them.''

FEDERAL APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS 2 STATE LAWS ON `PARTIAL BIRTH'
ABORTIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Ark. Wis., Iowa, Ill., Ohio)   By JO THOMAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   URBANA, Ill. _ In a sharply divided vote, a federal appeals
court in Chicago Tuesday upheld the constitutionality of laws in
Illinois and Wisconsin that criminalize a late-term abortion
procedure its opponents call ``partial birth.'' Neither law has yet
been enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The decision from the entire U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit came a month after a panel of the federal appeals
court for the Eighth Circuit ruled that laws banning the procedure
in Nebraska, Arkansas and Iowa were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents and supporters of Tuesday's decision agreed that the
conflict between the federal appeals courts make it more likely
that the Supreme Court will take up the highly politicized issue in
the near future. Last year the court turned down a case from the
Sixth Circuit, which ruled that a law banning the procedure in Ohio
was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a decision that cries out for the Supreme Court to fix
it,'' said Simon Heller, who represented the Center for
Reproductive Law and Policy, which opposed the laws, in the
Wisconsin case, Christensen vs. Doyle. ``We don't intend to sit
idly by while these judges determine that women's health should be
sacrificed.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to
Life Committee, which supported the Wisconsin law, said he also
expected ``that the Supreme Court will rule, perhaps next year, on
whether Roe vs. Wade covers pulling most of a living baby
feet-first outside of the womb, puncturing her skull, and removing
her brain.''
</P>
<P>
   The laws in Wisconsin and Illinois allow the prosecution of
doctors who perform what the Seventh Circuit called ``an incommon
procedure known to the medical community as `intact dilation and
extraction' or just `dilation and extraction (D&AMP;X),' and to the
public as `partial-birth abortion.'''
</P>
<P>
   The court said that, according to the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in a dilation and extraction, a
woman's cervix is dilated, usually over several days, and the body
of the fetus is extracted feet first; the contents of the brain are
then partly evacuated, and the fetus is delivered dead, but
otherwise intact.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixth and Eighth Circuits found that the laws banning the
procedure were unconstitutional because their language was too
vague and might be interpreted to prohibit common and legal methods
of late-term abortions, in which a fetus is dismembered inside a
woman's uterus and removed by forceps or suction.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seventh Circuit, in Tuesday's ruling, said the language
in the Wisconsin and Illinois laws was sufficiently precise so that
the state courts could interpret them in a way that would not
forbid legal procedures. A woman's right to these procedures, the
court said, was protected under Supreme Court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's decision, which split 6 to 4 and takes effect in 20
days, the majority noted that the attorneys general of Wisconsin
and Illinois had assured the court that application of the statutes
to a legal procedure, even one that ``turned out to have elements
of a D&AMP;X because of inadvertence or developments during surgery,''
would be ``constitutionally impermissible.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, therefore, the judges said, ``can practice medicine
without undue concern on the legal front.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's opinion noted the contrasting decision in the Eighth
Circuit but observed that all three of states involved forbid the
D&AMP;X.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wisconsin law, the maximum penalty for a doctor who
performs a dilation and extraction is life in prison. In Illinois,
the penalty is three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's opinion, the judges took note of testimony in the
trial of the Wisconsin case, that the D&AMP;X procedure ``is never
necessary from the perspective of the patient's health.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges continued: ``We proceed on the assumption, which
appears to be shared by the American Medical Association, that the
D&AMP;X is not the best or safest option in any articulable category of
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bans on dilation and extraction abortions have been passed in 30
states, and lower courts have struck down or delayed
implementations of those bans in 20 states. The deeply political
character of the debate was taken into account by both the majority
and the minority opinions Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Writing an impassioned opinion for the minority, Circuit Judge
Richard A. Posner observed: ``To understand this issue requires
understanding the peculiar and questionable character of these
statutes. They do not protect the lives of fetuses either directly
or by seeking to persuade a woman to reconsider her decision to
seek an abortion. For the statutes do not forbid the destruction of
any class of fetuses, but merely criminalize a method of abortion _
they thus have less to recommend them than the antiabortion
statutes invalidated in Roe vs. Wade,''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``There is no meaningful difference between the
forbidden and the privileged practice. No reason of policy or
morality that would allow the one would forbid the other. We should
consider therefore why any state would pass such a law. An
important part of the answer is found in Judge Manion's opinion in
Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin vs. Doyle,'' ``the states want to
dramatize the ugliness of abortion.''

CAMPBELL ANNOUNCES FIRST STEP IN BID TO UNSEAT FEINSTEIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican Rep. Tom Campbell of California took a
major first step Tuesday in his long-anticipated bid to challenge
the popular Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein in next year's
election.
</P>
<P>
   He announced that he is forming an exploratory committee to
raise money and gauge support for his candidacy for the Senate
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Campbell said that Feinstein ``has been a good
senator.'' But he added, ``I think I would be a better senator.''
However, he declined to outline ideological differences between
himself and Feinstein, saying he would do that later.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, addressing a Republican social group called the
Capitol Hill Club, said, ``I am very interested in becoming a
United States senator and I think I have qualifications for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It is very, very likely I will not be running for my
House seat'' next year, and he pledged not to take money from any
political action committees during his Senate run. He was one of a
handful of Republicans to back a comprehensive campaign finance
overhaul, which the House passed but Republicans in the Senate
killed last week.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who now represents the south San Francisco Bay area,
said he intends to ``seek the advice of friends'' about his Senate
candidacy over the next several weeks and make a formal
announcement in early December in California.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old lawmaker is a Stanford University Law School
professor who is serving his fourth term in the House and who calls
himself fiscally conservative and socially moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his candidacy, Feinstein said Tuesday, ``I certainly
don't mind facing him. I'm going to run a race based on what I have
done and where I believe the future of California is.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she thinks Campbell is anticipating she will be a vice
presidential candidate and vacate her Senate seat, Feinstein shook
her head no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has more to do with his tenure than whether I'll be
vice president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford officials have reportedly asked Campbell to return to
full-time teaching or give up his tenured position. If he were to
run for the Senate and loses, he presumably would return to
Stanford. If he were to run for reelection to the House, he would
have an excellent chance of winning and thus could lose his campus
position.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell declined to discuss the tenure issue Tuesday, saying it
is a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is convinced that California's new open primary
system, which places all candidates on the ballot instead of
separating Republicans and Democrats, will favor socially moderate
candidates such as himself.
</P>
<P>
   The open primary was not in place when he ran unsuccessfully in
the 1992 Senate primary against conservative TV commentator Bruce
Herschensohn, who lost to Barbara Boxer in the November general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, asked about Campbell's candidacy, said Tuesday that it
``makes no sense.'' She added, ``Dianne will clean his clock. He
doesn't offer anything she doesn't offer. I don't see the rationale
for removing a woman who has made history.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's entry into the Senate contest would pit him in the
Republican primary against at least three conservatives: wealthy
Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ron Unz, who sponsored a voter-approved
initiative last year, which put strict limits on bilingual
education; San Diego County Supervisor Bill Horn and Ray Haynes,
the GOP whip in the state Senate. Feinstein is unopposed for the
March 7 primary election.
</P>
<P>
   During an hour-long session with reporters Tuesday evening
Campbell fielded questions by telephone from California reporters
and those from about three dozen reporters gathered at the Capitol
Hill Club.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed his record as a fiscal conservative, saying
California needs a senator who would vote for a balanced budget
amendment to the Constitution. ``Year in and year out, my ratings
in not spending your money are the very best,'' he said, noting
that he was twice named the most fiscally responsible member of
Congress by the National Taxpayers Union, a conservative
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's socially moderate views could alienate him from the
conservative wing of his party and hurt his fund-raising efforts.
But he contends those views would make him more competitive against
Feinstein in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, he said that despite his differences
with conservatives, ``I am offering them the best chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He supports gun control and abortion rights. He has opposed a
proposed ban on a controversial late-term procedure that critics
call ``partial-birth'' abortion, saying it would be
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said he opposes affirmative action, adding, ``I
believe it's wrong for the government to separate us on the basis
of race. I believe it's wrong and unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell also said he will keep fighting to ensure that
Americans go to war only ``when your vital interests are at risk''
and only when Congress has given its permission.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said the most important thing he has done in Congress
is fight for enforcement of the 1973 War Powers Act, which allows
the president to go to war without congressional approval for up to
60 days. After that, the president must get either a declaration of
war from Congress or use some specific statutory authorization.
</P>
<P>
   In the 105th Congress, Campbell introduced a bill to withdraw
troops from Bosnia because President Clinton never consulted
Congress before sending them.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Campbell and a team of lawyers took the issue to
the U.S. Court of Appeals in an attempt to reassert Congress's
constitutional war power authority by having the court declare that
President Clinton went to war in Kosovo illegally.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Campbell supplied reporters with results
from two polls conducted in the past few weeks. One, by Charlton
Research, showed Feinstein with 42 percent of voter support
compared with 30 percent for Campbell. Another, by Public Opinion
Strategies, showed Feinstein leading Campbell, 48 percent to 33
percent. Those polls show stronger support for Campbell than a
state-wide Field Poll released last week showing Feinstein with 55
percent of those polled, compared with 30 percent for Campbell.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Campbell said the Senate race could cost up to $5 million for
the primary and $25 million for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is seeking financial support from the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, headed by Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., who has his hands on purse strings that can make or break a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But so far McConnell has been noncommittal. ``Obviously we'd
love to be competitive in California,'' McConnell said. ``Maybe
(Campbell's candidacy) will help.''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna
College, said McConnell ``is performing triage,'' ignoring
candidates that are bound to win or lose and focusing resources on
``races that will make a difference.'' Pitney said Campbell ``has
to convince Mitch McConnell and contributors in general that he can
actually win.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's House campaign committee shows him with $1.1 million
in cash on hand as of June 30. Feinstein's campaign committee had
$1.8 million.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ A student was asking Vice President Al Gore if he
would visit his high school. ``Absolutely!'' Gore responded, then
laughed at his quickness to please. ``You caught me at a vulnerable
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Every moment is a vulnerable one these days. Al Gore is putting
himself out for people to judge in a way that he has not had to do
in seven years behind the vice presidential podium. But now as a
presidential candidate, with a competitive challenge on his hands
from former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore appears eager to please anyone
he comes in contact with, eager to put himself in situations where
he can talk to people, eager, most of all, to connect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a breakthrough in how he's communicating,'' a top
Gore adviser said on Tuesday, as Gore and Bradley prepare to answer
questions from an audience during the first town hall meeting of
the Democratic primary season Wednesday night in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has not only revamped his campaign _ rejiggering staff and
moving his headquarters to Nashville _ but is trying to overhaul
himself as well. With Bradley projecting the persona of an
independent non-politician, Gore is trying to make himself appear
more casual and less scripted.
</P>
<P>
   This calls for serious attention to detail _ not only kahkis and
cowboy boots and a PalmPilot clipped to his belt, but changes in
body language and careful word choice. Instead of letting his arms
hang limply at his sides, Gore now gestures. Instead of telling
people he went to Vietnam, he makes a point of saying he
``enlisted'' _ a word that strategists say strikes a chord with
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of just cooing at babies, he now picks them up. This did
not amuse one little girl here who looked at him with some alarm.
``I'm not too scary!'' the vice president tried to reassure her.
``I'm not too scary!''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest change is in his campaign appearances. He is
making fewer speeches behind podiums to vast audiences, instead
making himself available to small groups of voters to press his
case one on one. He is even campaigning door to door. On Monday
night he ducked into a few houses here, spending several minutes
with surprised families. (``The house is a mess,'' grumbled Tom
Mulligan, who said the visit was ``totally unexpected.'')
</P>
<P>
   Later at the Fairgrounds Junior High School here, he held his
second open meeting of his campaign with undecided voters. ``I'll
stick around as long as necessary,'' he told the 200 people crammed
in to the school cafeteria. ``I want your votes in the New
Hampshire primary and I hope that you will use this opportunity to
resolve any doubts that you have in your minds.''
</P>
<P>
   He then spent three hours talking, appearing personable if not
quite personal. He talked about how, after the Columbine high
school shootings, he turned to the Bible and the story of Cain and
Abel, ``the first murder,'' as he put it. ``Forgive me, I'm not
proselytizing,'' he quickly added, ``but when something like this
happens, I go to my roots to try to understand what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about his sister's death from lung cancer. He called
smoking a disgusting habit and said he wanted to raise taxes on
tobacco, but also added: ``I don't want to offend anyone who
smokes.'' He then asked his questioner: ``Have you lost someone you
love?'' before turning to the audience and asking for a show of
hands: ``How many people here have lost someone they love through a
tobacco-related illness?''
</P>
<P>
   Like a tough guy asking for a punch, he even begged a student to
``dis'' him. The student complied, saying, ``Your accent stinks.''
Gore laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The open format is designed not only to help Gore connect with
people but also to prepare him for events like Wednesday's town
hall meeting, where he will be asked questions screened by the
host, CNN, but unknown in advance to the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been in New Hampshire since late Sunday night,
acclimating himself to the state. He has set up a studio with two
stools and a camera. His friend, Tom Downey, a former congressman
from Long Island and now a lobbyist in Washington, sits on the
other stool and plays Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said he practiced for two hours Monday and about three
hours on Tuesday, taking questions hurled at him by aides and then
watching videotapes of his performance.
</P>
<P>
   His task, advisers said, is not so much to bone up on the
issues, which he already knows (although they gave him a three-inch
thick black briefing book anyway). Rather, they said, they are
trying to get him to connect with people and still answer the
questions within the 90-second limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue for Gore is connection, connecting to the people in
the audience and being a candidate and not vice president,'' said a
top Gore strategist. ``When you are number two, you are programmed
to do what number one wants, not what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   His advisers said he has been diminished, as most vice
presidents are, in the service of promoting the views of number
one. That number one's name is Bill Clinton only further
complicates the task.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he likes town-hall-style meetings. ``It's true that as
vice president I haven't been able to do them in the same way, and
now I remember what I was missing,'' he said.

IT SHOULDN'T TAKE PAIN TO SEE CLEARLY

<TEXT>
<P>
   A champion golfer and five other people are killed in a
mysterious jet crash, and you know somebody will say it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, here it is in the Associated Press report on rival
golfers' reactions to Payne Stewart's death Monday.
</P>
<P>
   !ital!``It certainly puts into perspective little things like
missed putts.'' _ Jean Van de Velde, runner-up at this year's
British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Perspective. The word is as handy as a lob wedge at moments like
these, when real life intrudes on fun and games.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most offensive cliche in the sports world, which is
full of cliches.
</P>
<P>
   A football coach walks away from a highway collision feeling
lucky to be alive, and he tells a reporter, ``It put that game in
Miami in perspective, trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   A young basketball player is diagnosed with bone cancer, and his
coach says, ``When something like that happens, it kind of puts the
importance of basketball in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   A record-setting former jockey is paralyzed in an auto accident,
and a thoroughbred trainer says, ``A horse runs bad and you're mad
_ but then you look over there (at the man in the wheelchair) and
it kind of puts it all in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   And you can only wonder if people have to die, if spouses and
children have to bury their loved ones, if athletic bodies have to
be devastated for some of these numbskulls in helmets and cleats to
realize where sports rate in the grand scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   How thick must you be if the big picture isn't clear to you
until you're at a funeral, consoling the widow?
</P>
<P>
   A basketball immortal's retirement press conference falls on the
day his city mourns a slain police officer, and the player says,
``That puts life in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   A hockey player comes back from a debilitating illness, and he
says, ``It put a lot of things in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   A running back's ghastly knee injury forces amputation, and his
coach says, ``It just puts everything in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, until the moment the doctor came in with the bad
news, the coach thought life revolved around establishing the run.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, somebody doesn't always have to die for athletes
and coaches to get the message. Sometimes, sports themselves put
sports in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   A Cy Young Award-winning pitcher goes back to the minor leagues
on an injury-rehabilitation assignment, and notes, ``This puts
baseball back in perspective. It's fun, it's a game, and that's how
these kids are playing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's rare. More often, it takes a network news bulletin to
straighten people out.
</P>
<P>
   Sportswriters are as guilty as athletes and coaches. Uneasy
asking athletes about subjects bigger than the hit-and-run, we fall
back on a sad shake of the head and, ``Kinda puts it all in
perspective, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Just once, I'd like to hear an athlete reply, ``Not if you're
bright enough to have it all in perspective already.'' But instead
he'll typically nod along with the reporter, like the baseball
player, following a cancer scare, who is quoted saying, ``Did it
put (my life) in perspective? It has been an eye-opening
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   A women's basketball team gets to the NCAA Final Four after a
season marked by the deaths of the coach's husband, the center's
father, the team physician and a former ball girl. ``The deaths
have put winning and losing into perspective,'' somebody writes.
</P>
<P>
   A men's basketball coach's father dies of cancer: ``His father's
death helped Cremins shift his perspective on the relative
importance of bouncing basketballs in life's big picture,''
somebody writes, ever so concisely.
</P>
<P>
   A prep basketball star, son of an old college basketball star,
loses his 12-year-old sister to cancer: ``They Have Wider
Perspective on Life,'' a newspaper's sub-headline reads.
</P>
<P>
   So be assured that we in the press have our priorities
thoroughly in order: 1. Life; 1A. death; 2. basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, there are people in sports who do have it all in
perspective before tragedy occurs.
</P>
<P>
   A workaholic football coach collapses and dies, and a colleague
notes that he always reminds people, ``Although the game is life
and death to us, you still have to have a sense of awareness that
there is a real world. You can't lose perspective of that, or you
become all-consumed.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart seems to have been one of those rare sportsmen,
the ones who knew the difference between ``major'' and
``important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew what the Ryder Cup meant to him,'' says Jose Maria
Olazabal, an opponent of Stewart's in the recent competition
between U.S. and European golfers. ``But he never lost perspective
on what the match was all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad Stewart's son and daughter have to lose their father
before some of his rivals figure it out.
</P>

 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The interview is scheduled for 1 p.m. _ location
mysteriously, maddeningly still to be determined. But by 12:59
p.m., there is still no word from Woody Harrelson.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the Woodster partied a little too hard the
night before. His assistant was supposed to push the interview back
but she had partied a little too hard, too. When she finally
surfaces, the meeting is moved to 5 p.m., to a sushi restaurant _
still to be determined _ somewhere in SoHo. Then the meeting is
moved to a vegan place on the Upper East Side. Then the time is
changed yet again to 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   And when a reporter walks into the restaurant, Harrelson has
already started eating. On his plate are the rinds of a fully
excavated organic mango.
</P>
<P>
   Not an auspicious beginning.
</P>
<P>
   But it is tough to stay piqued at Woody Harrelson. Like a peace
offering, he plucks another mango from the window display for his
dining companion and clumsily carves it himself with a butter knife
_ no small feat. He shares his vegetable dumplings. The bouquet of
contrition he sends over the next day certainly helps (even though
it is from 1-800-Flowers).
</P>
<P>
   And let's face it, the guy is a movie star. That means a) he's
allowed to stand you up b) how often do you get to have dinner with
one? c) those blue eyes bring out the forgiveness in you.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson agreed to meet in the first place because he has a
play to promote: N. Richard Nash's 1954 comic drama ``The
Rainmaker,'' which opens on Broadway at the Brooks Atkinson Theater
on Nov. 11 with Harrelson in the title role.
</P>
<P>
   One could quickly draw larger conclusions from this chaotic
prelude and to some extent they would be accurate. Harrelson, 38,
is in many ways the boyish, free-wheeling bartender _ the role that
made him famous on the successful sitcom ``Cheers.'' He admits to a
long-running problem with punctuality (``I was born two months
early and have never been early since'') and clearly has a strong
carpe diem streak.
</P>
<P>
   Even more resonant, Starbuck, Harrelson's character in ``The
Rainmaker,'' is a rootless wanderer, a dreamer who charms people
into believing he can bring rain, then cuts out with their cash. So
it is tempting to see all sorts of links between the actor and his
latest acting job.
</P>
<P>
   But he somewhat testily warns against making too much of this
childlike angle. ``I'm responsible,'' he said. He says he gets the
job done. He has children of his own. And while he can be goofy at
times, the man is not stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much smarter than he looks,'' said Jayne Atkinson, who
plays opposite him in ``The Rainmaker.'' ``He's just a mischievous,
adventurous human being. He definitely marches to the beat of his
own distinct drum, but what I appreciate about the way he steps is
that it's never to the detriment of others. It's about just being
who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Who he is is a little difficult to pin down. On one hand, he
drinks green juice and doesn't touch meat, wears hemp and promotes
its legalization, climbs the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge to
protest the logging of redwood trees, does yoga and seems to value
his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he had stayed out late drinking wine the
night before, has warmed to the subject of his past womanizing in
published interviews, and admits to having wrestled with his
notorious temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't lay down the law about anything,'' he said. ``I guess
that makes me full of contradictions. I want to be liquid. I don't
want to be solid mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Some might say slippery. But Scott Ellis, who is directing the
Roundabout Theater Company revival of ``The Rainmaker,'' said that
quicksilver callow quality that is Woody is just what he wanted for
his Starbuck. ``He's a wanderer and he cannot settle down,'' Ellis
said of the character. ``He's always been running away.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson said he had come to respect his character, not to
judge him. ``He dreams bigger than his capabilities, but he's well
intentioned,'' Harrelson said. ``I refuse to look at him as a con
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ellis suggested that it was too easy to dismiss someone
like Harrelson _ or Starbuck _ as a mere hedonist. ``I wish I was a
little bit more like that,'' Ellis confessed. ``He's having a
better time than most of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the process of channeling all this appropriate zest for
life into a Broadway play has not been entirely smooth. Harrelson
had to get used to working in the theater again. He had started out
on the stage, performing in high school plays back in Lebanon,
Ohio, getting his first big break at 23 as an understudy in the
Broadway production of Neil Simon's ``Biloxi Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   But the last thing he did onstage was five years ago, returning
to his alma mater, Hanover College in Indiana, to do ``The
Diviners'' by Jim Leonard. There has been a lot of Hollywood in
between _ movies like ``White Men Can't Jump,'' ``Indecent
Proposal,'' ``The People vs. Larry Flynt'' _ and theater is a very
different ball game, as Harrelson quickly realized.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the lack of perks the actor had to get used to _ no
car service, no trailer, no catering. He was perfectly comfortable
taking the subway to work and buying his own sprout salads for
lunch. The tough part was the discipline it demanded. ``You can't
phone it in,'' Harrelson said.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered this the hard way, staying out till dawn after a
movie premiere one night and showing up for rehearsal the next day
barely able to function. ``The level of exhaustion was epic,''
Harrelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis sat him down and told it to him straight. ``I said,
`You're running a marathon and you're not ready for it yet,'''
Ellis said. ```You can't do the work after staying up till 4 in the
morning. You won't be able to enjoy it. You'll waste this period of
time and you will never get it back.'''
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson said he never showed up tired again. ``I needed this
process to kick my butt and it has,'' he said. ``That's not to say
I'm going to do a good job,'' he quickly added. ``That remains to
be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   One would expect a movie star to be a little more sure of
himself. But Harrelson is openly nervous about opening night.
``I'll be honest with you, I'm scared,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson said the toughest part is his entrance. ``The opening
scene, when I come in is, without question, the most challenging
thing I've ever tried as an actor,'' he said. ``And it has to look
really simple. You can't see the effort. He literally walks into
this house _ walks in without knocking _ and he has to convince
people that he's going to bring rain. There are times I've thought:
`This is not possible. No family's going to be taken in by this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless a patient director,'' Harrelson continued. ``I have
these questions, like `How could this be?,' and he has the right
answer _ not only to pacify my fears and anxieties but to inspire
me to do something better.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do it at all? Harrelson doesn't need the money, or the grind
of eight shows a week. He reaches millions of people with his
movies. Why bother trying to please 988 a night?

 NEW YORK: a night?  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For one thing, stars get something out of appearing on Broadway
_ cachet, a certain nobility, respect _ and they only have to
commit for a limited period; Harrelson's run is over on Feb. 6.
That is why so many of them have been showing up lately: Nicole
Kidman, Kevin Spacey, Liam Neeson, Natasha Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   But Harrelson also said he had specific reasons for doing the
project at this point in his life. ``I feel like I compromised my
integrity over the course of my career,'' he said. He is speaking
primarily of the film ``The Money Train,'' an expensive flop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never do anything for money again, never because it's the
right career move either,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like Tracy Chapman says, `All that you have is your
soul,''' the actor continued, citing a lyric he frequently quotes.
``I sold a piece of it and I'm trying to get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Tracy Harrelson was born in Midland, Texas, about 250
miles east of El Paso, in 1961. Diagnosed as emotionally disturbed,
hyperactive and dyslexic, he attended a private school for children
with learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 7, his father, Charles Voyde Harrelson, a
professional gambler who shares his son's birthday, was convicted
of a contract killing.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Woody moved with his mother _ Diane, a legal
secretary _ and his two brothers to Lebanon, Ohio. His mother was
religious and Woody briefly considered becoming a minister. But
then he discovered performing.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, he sent away for Elvis record sets from TV Guide
and one time did his Elvis routine in the library, jumping up and
gyrating on one of the tables to ``All Shook Up.'' The head of the
drama department urged him to try out for the school play. ``That's
all I needed,'' Harrelson said.
</P>
<P>
   At Hanover College, where he went on a scholarship, Harrelson
performed in 26 productions and by his junior year had decided on
an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   It was only because a friend moved to New York to go to the
Juilliard School that Harrelson moved there, too. He went through
17 jobs in 14 months _ mostly because he kept being fired.
</P>
<P>
   He was about to give up and go back to Ohio to live with his
mother and write a play when the audition came up for the 1985
production of ``Biloxi Blues.'' His subsequent appearance in the
1986 Goldie Hawn movie ``Wildcats'' led to an audition for
``Cheers.'' He was on the hit television series for seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in college, his father was sentenced to life in
prison for a second contract killing.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson used to talk about his father and his troubled past
fairly freely, although he was dismissive about its relevance.
Lately, he said, he has come to learn the value of circumspection.
He would only acknowledge that he has been fighting for his
father's right to a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the weight of what Harrelson has lived through, Ms.
Atkinson said, it does not seem capable of crushing him. ``The
light in him is stronger than the dark,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson suggested he had recently made a concerted effort to
explore that darkness rather than deny it. ``Things used to ignite
me, definitely,'' he said. ``I don't let things get me that much
these days. Anger comes from pain, so it behooved me to take a look
at that pain. Otherwise, it's going to destroy me, it's going to
kill me. So I did it. I took a look at it and I went pretty deep.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't therapy he's talking about. Harrelson said he had done
some ``spontaneous writing,'' a stream of consciousness about his
childhood, thinking ``about things that impacted me and hurt me.''
He said he realized he had lived through experiences that needed to
be confronted, ``things that would have toppled people mentally,
would have crushed me at least for a while and I just took it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I became Zen or anything,'' he said. ``I'm a
long way from that. What helps the most is that I feel I love
myself. Check that, I like myself a lot. Just right there on the
periphery of loving myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot I really didn't want to look at,'' Harrelson
added. ``Hell, I'll look at everything now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is a quality to him of having come out the other
side, evening out a little. This man, who for so long swore that
monogamy was unnatural, got married last year to Laura Louie, his
longtime girlfriend and former personal assistant. They are
bringing up their two little girls in Costa Rica, Hawaii and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's about the coolest gal I've met in my entire
life,'' Harrelson said. ``I'm not saying everything's perfect by
any stretch, but you do want to be with someone who inspires you.
She inspires me.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson says he loves being a father to Deni, 6, and Zoe, 4.
And that, while he enjoys working, he also likes not working.
Picking fruit from a tree for his breakfast. Surfing. Playing with
his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, what do we want? We want to be at peace,''
Harrelson said. ``And I'm not saying I'm at peace, but I sure have
a lot of moments of peacefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing off his dinner with chamomile tea and a slice of
vegan banana cream pie, Harrelson slaps on a dilapidated fishing
hat and heads for the door. On his way out, he grabs a mango from
the basket on the bar. ``Can I take one for the road?'' he asks one
of the managers. The manager waves his assent as if to say, ``Of
course, Woody, anything for you.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: RATING PHONE RESPONSE TIMES AT FREQUENT-FLIER
PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication warning: also sent with `t' code)

 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent survey of response times of airline representatives in
frequent-flier program telephone service centers found that
Southwest Airlines and Alaska Airlines did the poorest job of
responding to their customers, while America West and United
Airlines did the best.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, in the latest issue of Inside Flyer, a magazine on
loyalty programs, involved test calls made on weekdays to
frequent-flier program service centers. The response time by
representatives on a Monday _ which Inside Flyer said was the
centers' second-busiest day of the week, behind a Tuesday following
a Monday holiday _ ranged from no response at all at Southwest (its
center was closed); no response at Trans World Airlines, because of
high call volume; busy signals on three consecutive calls to Alaska
Airlines and Continental Airlines; to a 52-second response time at
Northwest Airlines and a 26-second response time at United.
</P>
<P>
   The response time on a Wednesday, according to the magazine,
ranged from 10 minutes and 41 seconds at Alaska Airlines to 20
seconds at America West and 10 seconds at United.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid getting a busy signal when calling a service center, or
worse yet, being stuck in a voice mail labyrinth, Inside Flyer
recommends the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoiding calling on Tuesdays after a holiday, or on Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   _ Calling early in the morning or late in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   _ Waiting a few days before calling a service center if you
receive your statement and have a question, because the week that
statements are mailed is usually the busiest of the month.
</P>
<P>
   _ Calling back for a second opinion, if you are not satisfied
with one representative's response to your question. ``Service
centers have hundreds of people, and they're not all proficient,''
said Randy Petersen, publisher of Inside Flyer. ``Call several
times, or ask for a supervisor if you have an important question
you want answered, or need to make a decision about buying a
ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Using the programs' automated systems and Web sites as much as
possible, as these can save time.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen also recommended being courteous to representatives,
who might be helpful in the long term. He said frequent fliers with
elite status often could cultivate ``angels'' who can bend rules in
the elite programs' call centers, which differ from the regular
call centers.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Update
</P>
<P>
   Leading Hotels of the World, the global marketer of luxury
hotels, has established a new sales organization, Leading Small
Hotels of the World, for luxury boutique hotels with 100 or fewer
guest rooms. Like participants in Leading Hotels, hotels in the new
group will be regularly inspected; officials said they would
alsofeature innovative or classical design and be expected to offer
customized, personal service. Members of the new group include One
Aldwych in London, the Lancaster and the Hotel Raphael in Paris,
the Carlton Hotel Baglioni in Milan, the Clarence in Dublin and the
Lowell in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A report from Merrill Lynch on hotel loyalty programs operated
by Marriott International, Hilton Hotels and Starwood Hotels and
Resorts rated Marriott No. 1. According to the report by two
securities analysts, Denise Wilder Warren and Kirk Materne, to earn
one free night at a New York hotel managed by any of these three
companies requires that a traveler spend $3,000 with Marriott,
$3,500 with Hilton and $5,000 with Starwood, which owns Sheraton
and Westin hotels. Over all, the report called Marriott's program
the best because it is the oldest and has a membership of more than
11 million, as well as having the largest selection of locations
and the largest number of brands.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Tickets
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines and America West, which have a code-sharing
agreement, now issue so-called electronic interline tickets for
each other. This means that travelers whose itinerary involves both
airlines may use an electronic ticket for their entire trip; it
also means that if their plans change, the electronic ticket issued
by one airline will be good on the other. Continental has a
minority stake in America West.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines and Canadian Airlines, which also have a
code-sharing accord and are part of the One World Alliance, began
offering electronic interline tickets last June. Officials at
American said they expected to offer such ticketing to travelers
flying on other One World carriers next year, as well as to
passengers on United Airlines. AMR, the parent of American, also
owns 25 percent of Canadian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   United said it and Air Canada, both part of the Star Alliance,
would offer electronic interline tickets next March. A spokesman
for United said it would also offer these tickets to travelers on
six other airlines _ including some U.S. carriers and others in the
Star Alliance _ by the end of 2000. &QL;

DESIGN OF CARS RATHER THAN TRUCKS IS MORE KEY TO SAFETY, REPORT
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Designing cars that provide more protection for
their occupants will do more for automotive safety than designing
sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are less lethal to
car occupants in collisions, according to a new data analysis
presented by insurance industry officials at a safety conference
here.
</P>
<P>
   There are still many more cars on the road than sport utility
vehicles or pickups, so cars will hit other cars or roadside
objects more often than they are involved in crashes with the big
light trucks. Since automakers safety budgets are limited, spending
should be concentrated on sturdier passenger compartments in cars
and other such features, the researchers said, while adding that
they nonetheless welcomed Ford Motor's decisions this year to put
energy-absorbing steel bars below the bumpers of its largest
pickups and sport utility vehicles to keep them from riding over
cars in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Safer cars would protect their occupants in all crashes, said
officials from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an
industry group that seeks to reduce the cost of accident claims.
Modifying sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks to make them
less dangerous to cars would only affect car crashes with these
light trucks, and such accidents accounted for only 15 percent of
all deaths among car occupants between 1991 and 1997, the insurance
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers did not try to forecast death rates when sport
utility vehicles in particular are likely to account for an
ever-growing percentage of vehicles on the nation's roads. Sport
utility vehicles currently make up about 20 percent of new
automobile sales, and the percentage seems likely to rise. But they
still represent only 7 percent of all vehicles in use because few
were sold until the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   If the lightest cars on the road were replaced by somewhat
heavier cars, the overall number of deaths in passenger vehicles in
1997 would have been 2.7 percent lower than the actual toll of
26,429 deaths, the institute calculated. But if the heaviest sport
utility vehicles and pickup trucks were taken out of service, the
death rate would have been only 0.6 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who choose lightweight cars increase the overall death
rate by putting themselves at risk, however. Drivers who choose the
heaviest sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks increase the
death rate on the nation's roads by putting others at risk, as well
as incurring a greater risk of rolling over in their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Federal researchers have calculated that the designs of sport
utility vehicles, pickups and minivans cause about 2,000
unnecessary traffic deaths a year.

 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the 14 months since President Clinton ordered a
cruise missile strike on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, his aides
have steadfastly defended the decision. Clinton, they say, acted on
evidence that left no doubt the factory was involved with chemical
weapons and linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile they blame
for blowing up two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But a re-examination of the decision, based on interviews with
key participants, shows that it was far more difficult than the
administration has acknowledged and that the voices of dissent were
numerous.
</P>
<P>
   Officials throughout the government raised doubts up to the eve
of the attack about whether the United States had sufficient
information linking the factory to either chemical weapons or to
bin Laden, according to participants in the interviews. They said
senior diplomatic and intelligence officials had argued strenuously
over whether any target in Sudan should be attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Aides passed on their doubts to the secretary of state and the
director of central intelligence, officials said. But the national
security advisor, Sandy Berger, who played a pivotal role in
approving the strike, said in an interview that he was not aware of
any questions about the strength of the evidence on the factory
before the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, some senior officials moved to suppress
internal dissent, officials said. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and a senior deputy, they said, encouraged State
Department intelligence analysts to kill a report being drafted
that concluded that the bombing was not justified.
</P>
<P>
   The new accounts of the deliberations provide the clearest
explanation to date of the reasoning behind one of the most debated
military actions undertaken by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials said they were told that the president and his
aides had approved the operation _ code-named Infinite Reach _ toshow that the United States could hit back against an adversary
that had bombed U.S. embassies simultaneously in two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Like many decisions of this kind, the decision to bomb the plant
was made under intense pressure and with a sense of urgency created
by intelligence showing that bin Laden was contemplating another
lethal attack against the United States. ``We would have been
derelict in our duty not to have proceeded,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former U.S. officials agreed to discuss the
operation because, more than a year later, they continue to be
plagued by doubts about whether it was justified. They said they
are still troubled by the lack of a full airing of what they view
as gaps in the evidence linking the plant, called Al Shifa, to bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the strike, as criticism mounted, the
administration closed ranks, publicly asserting that the
intelligence was persuasive. But the doubts persisted, particularly
at the State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research.
</P>
<P>
   Before the attack, the bureau had written a report for Albright
questioning the evidence linking Al Shifa to bin Laden. Following
the bombing, analysts renewed their doubts and told Assistant
Secretary of State Phyllis Oakley that the CIA's evidence on which
the attack had been based was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oakley called a meeting of key aides and a consensus
emerged: Contrary to what the administration was saying, the case
tying Al Shifa to bin Laden or to chemical weapons was weak. Ms.
Oakley told her aides to draft a report reflecting their
skepticism, a significant step because there was a chance its
findings might leak out.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oakley told Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering that
her aides were preparing a report that would sharply question the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Pickering asked whether the report contained any
information omitted from the State Department's previous study. Ms.
Oakley said no. In that case, Pickering said, there was no reason
to raise the issue again.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later, Albright asked Ms. Oakley about the
report and was assured that work had been stopped. Ms. Oakley
replied that there was not going to be any report, according to
people familiar with the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But other officials say that while she accepted the order to
kill the report, Ms. Oakley, who retired from the State Department
last month after 42 years, privately expressed a sense of
frustration and concern over the decision. Other officials in the
intelligence bureau have also expressed concern over the action.
Ms. Oakley declined to be quoted in this article.
</P>
<P>
   A reconstruction of events shows that Ms. Oakley was hardly the
only senior government official to question the intelligence
linking Sudan, bin Laden and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about the Al Shifa plant arose in the CIA in the
summer of 1997. U.S. intelligence officials said an informant
reported that two facilities in Khartoum might be involved in
chemical weapons production. The informant also mentioned a third
site _ Al Shifa _ on which he had less information but which was
suspicious because it had high fences and stringent security.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, an agent working for the CIA collected a soil
sample at a site about 60 feet away from the plant, according to
U.S. officials, from land that does not appear to have been owned
by Al Shifa.
</P>
<P>
   That soil contained about two and a half times the normal trace
amounts of Empta, a chemical used in the production of VX nerve
gas, a senior U.S. official said. The results prompted a heated
debate among U.S. intelligence analysts about Al Shifa's possible
links to weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, 1998, the CIA issued its first report on Al Shifa,
based on the soil sample, spy satellite photographs and other
intelligence. The CIA report highlighted apparent links between Al
Shifa and bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   But CIA analysts also suggested that additional information
would be needed to be more certain about Al Shifa. The report also
raised a new question about the evidence against Al Shifa by noting
that there were no longer signs of heavy security around the plant.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 4, 1998, the CIA issued a more ominous report, one that
assessed the possible connection between Sudan, bin Laden and his
efforts to obtain chemical weapons. It mentioned Al Shifa, but the
report's highlight was new intelligence indicating that bin Laden,
who earlier in the year had announced a renewed ``holy war''
against the United States, had acquired chemical or nuclear
materials and ``might be ready'' to conduct a chemical attack.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, intelligence analysts responded with
skepticism. In an Aug. 6 memo for senior department policymakers,
Ms. Oakley's analysts argued that, even with the new intelligence
in the Aug. 4 report, the evidence linking Al Shifa to bin Laden
and chemical weapons was still weak.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es
Saalam, Tanzania, were bombed, and the United States soon concluded
bin Laden was behind both attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and a small group of his most senior advisors _
including Berger, Defense Secretary William Cohen, Albright,
Pickering, and Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff _ quickly decided to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   On August 8, the president's senior advisors ordered the
Pentagon's Joint Staff and the CIA to provide a list of sites
connected to bin Laden and his organization that could be bombed.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 12, after the list was winnowed down, Clinton and key
National Security Council officials were briefed for the first time
on the possible targets, including Al Shifa, by Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the CIA received a report that changed the nature
of the debate and the pace of planning for the retaliatory strike.
New intelligence showed that bin Laden and his key lieutenants
would be meeting at camps in Khost, Afghanistan, on Aug. 20.
Reports also indicated that bin Laden might be planning further
attacks, possibly with chemical weapons.The Afghan camps were
already among the top priority targets proposed by the Pentagon and
CIA planners.
</P>
<P>
   In the White House meeting on Aug. 19, where the final
recommendations were to be made to the president, officials chose
to target the Afghan training camps and two sites in the Sudan: Al
Shifa and a tannery in Khartoum that intelligence reports indicated
was linked to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Shelton objected to striking the Khartoum
tannery, both because of the potential that missiles might hit
civilians and because the site was not suspected of being involved
in chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Officials recall that the debate was halted by Berger. The
administration, he said, would justifiably be pilloried if the
United States did not destroy Al Shifa and bin Laden later launched
a chemical attack that could have been pre-empted.
</P>
<P>
   A recommendation was sent to Clinton to attack the Afghan camps,
Al Shifa and the tannery.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Shelton told his colleagues among the Joint
Chiefs of Staff about the planned bombing, in part to gain their
help in convincing the White House to drop the tannery as a target.
It was the first time the service chiefs had been told about the
pending operation.
</P>
<P>
   After their meeting, Shelton called the White House to say that
the officers shared his opposition to bombing the tannery. At about
midnight, Clinton consulted some of his senior advisors about the
matter and at about 2 a.m. ordered that the tannery be removed from
the target list.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Al Shifa also surfaced at the State Department
just before the attack. Pickering was shown the intelligence
analysts' memo expressing skepticism about the CIA's intelligence
on Al Shifa, he said. Pickering said he mentioned the report's
findings to Albright, but that they both decided to support the
decision to strike; they were convinced that the CIA's materials _
primarily the soil sample from Al Shifa _ were persuasive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the strike, an international controversy
erupted, with Sudan demanding damages and an independent review of
case. In Washington, senior officials insisted in press briefings
that the links between bin Laden, the factory, and chemical weapons
were strong and compelling.
</P>
<P>
   There was much less certainty behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the strike, word began to filter out of the
government that senior U.S. intelligence officials, including Jack
Downing, the head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, its
clandestine espionage arm, believed the Sudan strike was not
justified.
</P>
<P>
   At the intelligence branch of the State Department, officials
began drafting the report renewing doubts about the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the strike, the CIA conducted an after-action study
and gathered intelligence about the plant's owner, a Sudanese-born
businessman named Salah Idris. In the weeks after the strike, the
agency said it had found new evidence about his possible financial
connections to the terrorist group Islamic Jihad, which in turn has
strong connections to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   But agency officials acknowledged that at the time of the strike
they had not known that he owned the plant. Today, officials also
acknowledge that the soil sample collected at Al Shifa was obtained
about four months before Idris bought the plant in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now, officials also say that Idris was never put on the
government's terrorist watch list, either before or after the
attack, which would prevent him from obtaining a visa to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, meanwhile, remains in Afghanistan, and the United
States has warned repeatedly over the past year that he has been
attempting to conduct further terrorist acts against U.S. targets.
Senior Clinton administration officials now say they believe bin
Laden is trying to develop chemical weapons in Afghanistan, and may
have obtained them.

NETSCAPE COFOUNDER TO HEAD INTERNET SOFTWARE START UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For some people in Silicon Valley, the garage
still holds more allure than the board room.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Andreessen, a cofounder of Netscape Communications Corp.,
announced Tuesday that he would be the founding chairman of
Loudcloud Inc., a Menlo Park, Calif.-based company that is, for the
time being, housed in a single warehouse-like room. The company
will develop software to help companies get their businesses on the
Internet quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to head a startup, Andreessen is eschewing both his
recent corporate role as chief technology officer of America
Online, which acquired Netscape last year, and the currently
popular career route for successful entrepreneurs: becoming a
venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Andreessen said he was reveling in
being back in a world that was closer to the legendary Silicon
Valley garages in which Hewlett Packard and Apple Computer were
born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is that we're cheap and we're proud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen, who is 28 and whose personal wealth has been
estimated at several hundred million dollars, said he had located
his new startup in an extra room at a semiconductor equipment
company.
</P>
<P>
   The new company so far is self-financed. Its management team
consists of three Netscape veterans: Ben Horowitz as chief
executive officer, Timothy Howes as chief technology officer and In
Sik Rhee as chief strategist. Andreessen will be the full-time
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had flirted with several offers to become a venture
capitalist but had ultimately rejected that path in favor of
hands-on entrepreneurism because ``I think it would get very
frustrating only being able to get so far involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Andreessen's decision to take an operating role comes at
a time when many of the Valley's venture capital firms have been
bemoaning a dearth of experienced managers in technology
industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real issue in finding a good CEO,'' said Joe
Schoendorf, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners in Palo Alto,
Calif. ``At the end of the day, you still have to run a business.
We love great ideas, but if we look at our top 10 successes, in
each case they are ones which have been started by great management
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Loudcloud is almost certain to have major competitors, perhaps
including giants like IBM Corp. and Microsoft Corp. But Andreessen
said he believed that the explosive growth of Internet commerce
would only accelerate the market for Loudcloud's technology.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen said that more detailed announcements about the
company's strategy, products and customers would be made early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our DNA is going to be software,'' he said. ``We're not going
to be consultants, and we're not going to build Internet data
centers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he predicted that the traditional software
industry would face increasingly perilous times as the Internet
changes the way software is, purchased, used and distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software will become more important in the future, but at the
same time, the software industry will be less so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his new start-up venture, Andreessen said he had
made investments in two other start-up ventures: ReplayTV, a
digital television recording system, and Accompany, Inc. an
Internet consumer purchasing company.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen stepped down as America Online's chief technology
officer in September, seven months after the company acquired
Netscape.

UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA PRESIDENT SANCTIONS MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The University of Minnesota president, Mark Yudof, announced
Tuesday that he would not allow the men's basketball team to
participate in any post-season tournaments this season as a result
of an internal investigation into alleged academic cheating in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   He also indicated the National Collegiate Athletic Association
may hand down more severe penalties once it receives the school's
final report some time after Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must demonstrate good faith and take meaningful action to
repair the damage that has been done by others,'' Yudof said.
</P>
<P>
   Yudof said the university is also placing the program on
probation for an unspecified length of time. He said it would
adhere to more stringent standards of reporting to the NCAA and
would conduct more vigilant compliance checks.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the program began last March after a
former tutor, Jan Gangelhoff, claimed she did more than 400 pieces
of course work _ many of them papers _ for at least 20 players from
1993 to 1998. The inquiry has expanded to examine allegations of
improper payments, travel irregularities and sexual misconduct in
the men's athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   Yudof acknowledged the measures were harsh, but said that they
were necessary to discourage future abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we do need to impose sanctions,'' he said. ``I don't
hate to do it. It's the right thing to do. The NCAA has to worry
about deterrents. I have to worry about deterrents in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations center on the tenure of Coach Clem Haskins who
resigned under pressure in June and accepted a $1.5 million buyout.
Haskins, who took the Gophers to the 1997 Final Four of the NCAA
tournament, has repeatedly denied any knowledge of academic
cheating in his program.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Monson, who replaced Haskins, said he was aware of the
potential for harsh penalties when he was hired from Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the staff and our team, it's the beginning of the end,''
Monson said.
</P>
<P>
   The post season ban includes the NCAA and National Invitation
tournaments, but not the Big Ten Conference tournament, Yudof said.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA refused to comment on the situation, but a spokeswoman,
Jane Jankowski, said self-imposed penalties by schools are a common
practice though they don't preclude the organization from imposing
more severe sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities do frequently hand down their own penalties, and
our committee considers that and can adopt those sanctions, as well
as add other penalties,'' she said.

LARGE STUDY URGED FOR NEW METHOD OF DETECTING LUNG CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
 - (TRIMS)-NYT  
(ATTN: Va., Minn., Md.)  (bl)  
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAITHERSBURG, Md. _ Doctors and scientists on Tuesday urged the
federal government to start a large study of a new way of detecting
lung cancer as soon as possible, seizing what they see as a small
window of time to discover if the method works before it becomes so
widely used that no one will question it.
</P>
<P>
   If the study is begun, it would be one of the fastest movements
in medical history from the discovery of a method to its
large-scale testing. Dr. Peter Greenwald, director of division of
cancer prevention at the National Cancer Institute, said he did not
know of another example in diagnostic imaging of a large study's
starting so soon after a discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The lung cancer screening method, known as spiral CT scanning,
is so new that doctors are still learning its capabilities. It can
find lung cancers when they are as small in diameter as a soda
straw, as compared with chest X-rays that find them when they are
about the size of a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the question is, Does finding a lung cancer so early mean
that patients will live longer? The first major papers on the
spiral CT scanning were published in April and July. Ordinarily, a
period of years would follow during which the method would be
studied in groups of patients to learn if the early results were
easily replicated.
</P>
<P>
   But medical experts at a workshop held in a hotel in
Gaithersburg said the usual languid period of waiting to start a
clinical study would not suffice. A large study in which possibly
tens of thousands of patients are randomly assigned to have the
screening test or not must start immediately, they said, or it will
be too late. Already, they said, patients are lining up to have the
scan and hospitals are advertising that they will provide it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christine Berg, the acting chief of the lung and upper
aerodigestive cancer research group at the National Cancer
Institute, who oversaw the meeting, said the institute's advisory
board had already urged that a large study be undertaken. And now,
with most of the participants at Tuesday's meeting saying the same,
she said she would urge that planning begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to convey to decision makers that a study should be
moved on as quickly as possible so that we can understand the
benefits and risks of this technology,'' Berg said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates of the technology, however, said it would be
unjustified to deny it to people at high risk of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claudia Henschke of the Weill Medical College of Cornell
University in New York, said a study that randomly assigned people
to be screened with the new technology or to forgo such screening
would be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're condemning the control arm,'' Henschke said.
</P>
<P>
   And Margaret McCarthy, executive director of the Alliance for
Lung Cancer Advocacy, said she was sure that every person in the
room would seek out the new test for themselves if they were at
risk of lung cancer. Who, then, she asked, would be willing to be
in a study where they might not get the screening test?
</P>
<P>
   The two studies so far of spiral CT scanning tested it on
smokers and former smokers, documenting the test's ability to find
tumors when they are very small. Henschke, who directed one study,
estimated that the method could allow as many as 80 percent of lung
cancer patients to survive at least five years. Just 15 percent
live that long now.
</P>
<P>
   But neither her study nor one conducted by Japanese scientists
included a group of patients who, for comparison, did not have the
test, raising questions of whether the patients really lived longer
than they would have if they had not taken part in the study.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Henschke said, she and her colleagues are recruiting 10,000
patients in the New York area for additional study of the method's
efficacy. That study would not include a control group of patients
who did not get the screening test.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some participants at the meeting warned that though it sounded
logical that if cancers were detected very early, patients who
would otherwise die would be cured, the history of lung cancer
screening provided a cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades ago, it was widely believed that chest X-rays
could save lives by finding lung cancers before people had
symptoms. The American Cancer Society recommended that smokers have
annual chest X-rays and doctors urged the tests upon their
patients. But in 1971, the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., began a
study of 9,211 smokers who were randomly assigned to have regular
chest X-rays or not.
</P>
<P>
   The results were startling. Cancers were found earlier, but the
men who were screened lived no longer than those who were not _
their cancers killed them at the same time, but they lived a longer
time beforehand knowing that they had cancer and being treated for
it. As a result, the cancer society withdrew its recommendation
that people at high risk for lung cancer be screened with chest
X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Spiral CT scanning is much more sensitive than chest X-rays, and
it is possible that it is picking up cancers when they are really
curable. On the other hand, cancer experts said, it is also
possible that it is picking up tumors that would never have caused
a problem, and that patients would have died with them, not of
them.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible that, like chest X-rays, spiral CT finds
cancers early but does not save lives.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barnett Kramer, deputy director of the division of cancer
prevention at the cancer institute, said more was at stake than
medical certainty that patients would be helped. Spiral CT scanning
would be enormously expensive.
</P>
<P>
   It costs anywhere from $250 to $1,000 for a scan, depending on
the hospital offering it, Kramer said in an interview before
Tuesday's meeting. He calculated that it would cost $39 billion to
screen all smokers and former smokers in the country. And, he
added, that does not include the cost of doing biopsies for people
whose tumors turn out to be benign and those whose tumors are so
indolent that they would never have been life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Fletcher, an ethicist, said it was the uncertainty
about the value of spiral CT scanning that made him want a
randomized clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a situation that the experts call equipoise, where we
really don't know if spiral CT scanning is better than usual
care,'' Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Fletcher, an emeritus professor at the University of
Virginia, told participants at the meeting, ``There is a window of
opportunity here that you will lose when the pressure to do the
test is so high that you can't resist it and it becomes a de facto
standard of care.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Dr. Anthony Miller of the German Cancer
Research Institute in Heidelberg said, ``the message we're getting
is, let's get on with it.''

NEIL AUSTRIAN, NFL PRESIDENT, TO RESIGN AT END OF YEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Neil Austrian, who has been the National Football
League's president and chief operating officer since 1991, will
leave at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very intense, time-consumptive job,'' he said. ``I
never intended to stay for nine years but this is a good time to
go, with the labor deal, TV deal and DirecTV deal done. There is no
crisis. We got past expansion, Cleveland and a lot of stadium
issues. The longer I stayed, the more likely I would be dragged
into something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Austrian's position, which did not exist before he came to the
NFL, will not be filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul wants to give more responsibility to a lot more people
and see who breaks out of the pack,'' said Austrian, referring to
Paul Tagliabue, the commissioner of the NFL. ``Given the culture of
the league, it doesn't make sense to bring in anybody from the
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   All business units, which had reported to Austrian, will report
to Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian said he did not know what his next job would be. ``In
1986, I took nine months off when I left Showtime,'' he said. He is
an investor in and a director of iwon.com, an Internet portal
company, but has no intention of taking a management position.

FOREIGN INVESTORS EXPRESS CONCERNS ABOUT INDONESIA'S NEW
PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With INDONESIA-CABINET) 
(mcd) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ This country's new government is getting a
skeptical reception from a constituency that does not vote but
could play a determining role in the future _ foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   The bankers, brokers and fund managers whom Indonesia's
government must court to help pull the country out of its worst
economic crisis in a generation expressed some doubts Tuesday
whether the newly chosen president, Abdurrahman Wahid, and his 35
ministers have the expertise and cohesion needed to become
efficient crisis managers.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, they fear that the government, in its attempt to use
unfamiliar democratic institutions to eradicate the corruption of
its predecessor, may sacrifice economics in the name of popular
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is a desirable form of government, but it's not
necessarily the most efficient form of government,'' said Ron
Leven, a J.P. Morgan currency strategist in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Pervading such concern is a sense that despite encouraging moves
toward stability and accountability, Indonesia's political process
is hard to decipher and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only certain about one thing: the economy's a mess,''
said William Belchere, head of fixed-income research and strategy
at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   With its banks and largest corporations still immobilized by
delinquent debts, Indonesia remains dependent on emergency
financing from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
But that help has been suspended until a banking scandal, which
helped undermine the previous administration, is resolved. The
scandal has virtually paralyzed the agency responsible for
reworking those loans and resuscitating banks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite appeals by the new president that Indonesia needs
foreign investors, many foreign financial specialists here seem
dismayed that Wahid, a frail Muslim cleric, emerged as the
country's leader. Noting the violent protests of the last 15
months, investors had concluded that the only combination likely to
put Indonesia on stable ground was for Megawati Sukarnoputri, whose
party won the greatest share of votes in June's Parliament
elections, to be chosen president and the former defense minister
and armed forces chief, General Wiranto, to be named vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these financial specialists said they were encouraged by
Wahid's speech over the weekend, in which he said that ``foreign
investment'' remained the two most important words for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   They also noted that the value of the Indonesian currency, the
rupiah, which is often seen as a barometer of investor sentiment,
had risen against the dollar for much of the last month. Even so,
caution prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed by Gus Dur's speech,'' said Hugh Young,
managing director of Aberdeen Asset Management, referring to Wahid
by the nickname commonly used here. ``But a speech is one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among concerns is how quickly the government can
satisfy demands by the IMF that those responsible for the banking
scandal be brought to justice. The fund and other lenders have
suspended a $43 billion aid package until the scandal, in which
funds designated for bank restructuring were diverted to a company
affiliated with Habibie's political party, is resolved. Indonesia's
new parliament has given two commissions the task of deciding
whether to meet the IMF's demand that an audit of the scandal
naming those involved be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are also waiting to see how resolution of the scandal
affects the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency. Officials at the
agency approved the deal in question, and some political analysts
predict that they and the agency's chairman, Glenn Yusuf, will be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts also surround Wahid's choice of economics minister, Kwik
Kian Gie, a top aide to Ms. Megawati, who has in the past suggested
that Indonesia adopt policies opposed by the IMF, including a
change that would lock Indonesia's currency into a constant value
against the dollar. Kwik said Tuesday that Indonesia would not
adopt such a change.

 &HT;    Ohio school programs near bottom of country
 &HT;    By Michael C. Bender and Mike Wagner

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Ohio's participation in school breakfast
programs for low-income children ranks near the bottom nationally,
according to a report released Tuesday by anti-hunger activists.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 166,000 children statewide participate in the program,
which provides free or reduced-price meals at 1,847 schools, the
Washington, D.C.-based Food Research and Action Center reported in
its ninth annual ``School Breakfast Scorecard.''
</P>
<P>
   That's down slightly from a year ago. Also, the 45 percent of
schools that participate in both the breakfast and lunch programs
is fifth-worst in the United States. The national average is 74
percent. South Carolina tops the list at 98.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, six of a possible seven stars were awarded to programs
in Florida, Iowa, Maryland and Texas. Ohio earned three stars.
Below Ohio were only seven states _ six with two stars and Wyoming
with one.
</P>
<P>
   States were rated on the number of schools and low-income
children participating, on improvements in participation, and on
state efforts to encourage the program.

PIERCE IS IMPROVING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's not his team yet, but Paul Pierce is making
progress.
</P>
<P>
   And he's still not the go-to guy, but he's close, as evidenced
by what he has done throughout the exhibition season for the
Celtics, including this line in Monday's 105-99 loss to the Atlanta
Hawks in Biloxi, Miss.: 27 points, 9 rebounds, 3 assists, 2 blocked
shots, 2 steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's doing,'' said coach Rick Pitino after Tuesday's
practice, ``is taking good shots, and letting the game come to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a bright spot in the dark hole that Celtic
basketball has been the past few years, it is the emergence of
Pierce not only as a player but as a low-maintenance person.
</P>
<P>
   He's got game every night he plays, and more than just about
anyone wearing Celtic green these days.
</P>
<P>
   All of this from someone who is just starting his second season
in the NBA, still testing himself on what he can and cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going through last year helped me prepare for this year,''
said Pierce, who has scored in double figures six straight games,
and hopes to make it seven Wednesday night against Washington at
the FleetCenter in Boston. ``I worked hard at doing the things that
I didn't do well last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The harshest critic would have difficulty finding any major
problems with the University of Kansas product's production last
season, when he averaged 16.3 points and 6.4 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Paul is a force to be reckoned with,'' said Pitino,
who carried it a step further when he compared Pierce to Oscar
Robertson in some ways. ``Paul is a type of player who I remember
watching Oscar Robertson to be. He takes what's there. He doesn't
force the issue. He lets the game come to him. That's what makes
him a good teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has fiddled with his lineup, with Pierce making the move
from small forward to 2 guard, a switch that Pitino says means
little because of the Celtics' switching and pressing style.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce says it isn't any big deal either, though it may give him
an edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said with a smile, ``they have to find a way to
guard me.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 6 inches, 230 pounds, with sound fundamental skills
and a smooth offensive game, Pierce is a throwback Celtic, someone
who can fit into a system that will produce another championship
banner sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what Pierce hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a good nucleus of guys here,'' said Pierce. ``We
like each other, hang out with each other. I can see us doing some
things in the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics went through a two-hour practice Tuesday after
getting back from Mississippi in the morning. Pitino said everyone
is healthy, including guard Wayne Turner, who has been plagued by a
sore right elbow . . . Pitino announced that the players and staff
voted on a pair of cocaptains, Dana Barros and Antoine Walker. This
is unlike the last two years, in which Pitino chose the captains.
Pitino felt the team was ready for a vote. In choosing Pervis
Ellison and Walker the last two seasons, Pitino said he was using
the captain's role as a motivational force for those two, as much
as anything. ``Now it's up to the team who will be the leaders,''
he said, with a laugh, reserving the right to change his mind, of
course.

FROM THE HUMBLE MINI-SERIES COMES THE MAGNIFICENT MEGAMOVIE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for THE-SOPRANOS-TV)  
 (af)  
 By VINCENT CANBY  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Movies and television have been feeding off each other for
years, each trying to capture whatever part of the mass audience is
the other's territory. In this age of political strategy dictated
by public opinion poll, movies and television behave like a pair of
rival party candidates for the same office: each side quietly
adopts policies that differ from the other's only in degree, rarely
in substance.
</P>
<P>
   When innovative thinking is discouraged, choices dwindle in art
as well as politics. Movies imitate television as television
imitates movies that imitate television. While the screens in
so-called home entertainment centers are getting bigger and bigger,
movie theater audiences, with increasing frequency, carry on as if
at home, talking, swilling their sodas and chomping junk food
labeled lite.
</P>
<P>
   And why not?
</P>
<P>
   Today's audiences have been conditioned. A theater is simply a
first-run outlet for material that will be seen again in the living
room. Pop theatrical movies and television dramas are essentially
the same: a dependence on close-ups, on shock effects and on pacing
of narratives to bridge commercial interruptions, whether the
interruptions exist now or are to be inserted later.
</P>
<P>
   When there are exceptions, they usually come from independent
and foreign filmmakers, seldom from television sources.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the effect is tonic when something turns up as singular as
``The Sopranos,'' HBO's 13-episode, nearly 13-hour melodramatic
comedy, created by the seriously talented David Chase. It is also
an event that prompts an examination of what our films and our
television series have become and what their possibilities are,
given the circumstances in which they are produced and the contexts
in which they are seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' did not emerge whole and complete like a sonnet
from a single artist working in splendid isolation. Rather, it came
out of the same rough-and-tumble process by which teams of
collaborators have traditionally put together everything from soap
operas, police and hospital dramas and sitcoms to shows as
idiosyncratic as Roseanne's and Frasier's.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too much, I think, to compare ``The Sopranos'' to such
seminal works as ``Berlin Alexanderplatz'' (1980), Rainer Werner
Fassbinder's 15{-hour adaptation of Alfred Doblin's epic 1929
German novel, and ``The Singing Detective'' (1988), the tumultuous
six-hour British production based on Dennis Potter's original
script about the physical and moral redemption of an overly
imaginative sinner with a skin condition. Both were created to be
seen as television mini-series, which they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos,'' shown earlier this year as what was, in
effect, a mini-series, was produced in the hope that it would
become a continuing HBO series if successful, which it was.
Thirteen new episodes have already been filmed, to be broadcast
starting in January, after a possible rerun of the original show
the last week in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlin Alexanderplatz,'' ``The Singing Detective'' and ``The
Sopranos'' are something more than mini-series. Packed with
characters and events of Dickensian dimension and color, their time
and place observed with satiric exactitude, each has the kind of
cohesive dramatic arc that defines a work complete unto itself. No
matter what they are labeled or what they become, they are not
open-ended series, or even mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   They are megamovies.
</P>
<P>
   That is, they are films on a scale imagined by the big-thinking,
obsessive, fatally unrealistic Erich von Stroheim when, in 1924, he
shot ``Greed,'' virtually a page-by-page adaptation of Frank
Norris' Zola-esque novel, ``McTeague.'' Stroheim intended it to be
an exemplar of cinematic realism.
</P>
<P>
   He also imagined audiences with cast-iron constitutions. His
first cut ran nine and a half hours. He later reduced the running
time to something less than five hours. Yet before ``Greed'' was
sent out to theaters, the film had been taken away from him and
others had removed more than three-quarters of the master's
original material.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, after being persuaded to look at the mutilated final
version in the archives of the French Cinematheque in Paris,
Stroheim is reported to have said: ``This was like an exhumation
for me. In a tiny coffin I found a lot of dust, a terrible smell, a
little backbone and shoulder bone.''
</P>
<P>
   Had television and the mini-series format been available 75
years ago, it is possible that Stroheim would have been spared his
humiliation. ``Greed'' might have survived in something resembling
the director's version. It could have been one of history's first
megamovies.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have mini-series, though few of these have the tight
focus and consistency of tone associated with the megamovies I've
mentioned. The English adaptation of Jane Austen's ``Pride and
Prejudice'' qualifies. The ``Brideshead Revisited'' mini-series
might qualify, even if, for me, anyway, it has the mournful
expression and rouged cheeks of something embalmed. Unlike ``Berlin
Alexanderplatz,'' ``The Singing Detective'' and ``The Sopranos,''
``Brideshead'' never achieves its own identity.
</P>
<P>
   This may be because the novel, which it recreates with
solemnity, itself seems a romantic and pious literary exercise
compared with Waugh's comic masterpieces ``Decline and Fall,''
``Vile Bodies'' and ``A Handful of Dust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos,'' about the world of a New Jersey Mafia kingpin
who seeks the help of a psychiatrist after suffering acute anxiety
attacks, is no spinoff of ``The Godfather'' films or any kind of
variation on the Robert De Niro-Billy Crystal comedy, ``Analyze
This.'' It's a stunning original about a most particular slice of
American life, a panoramic picture that is, by turns, wise, brutal,
funny and hair-raising, and of significance to the society just
beyond its immediate view.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Equally important is the way ``The Sopranos'' calls to mind the
collaborative process that was accepted in Hollywood before every
director considered himself an ``auteur,'' to give the director the
status of artist and largely to ignore the collaborators. In truth,
the term auteur, as it was used by Francois Truffaut and his
colleagues in the New Wave of French filmmakers and critics in the
1950s, was reserved for those directors of pronounced personal
style and vision. In recent decades, though, it has become simply a
fancy way to identify anyone who manages to receive a credit as a
director.
</P>
<P>
   The manner in which ``The Sopranos'' came together sounds
initially less like Truffaut's now-classical auteurism than the old
days at MGM or Warner Brothers or 20th Century Fox. This would
cover the Hollywood studio system from the 1930s into the 1950s,
when a production chief like Louis B. Mayer, Jack L. Warner or
Darryl F. Zanuck vetted every film on his lot, changed directors at
will, recut films to his tastes and secretly assigned writers to
rewrite scripts not yet completed by the original writers.
</P>
<P>
   No less than 11 directors receive credit for ``The Sopranos''
(two of whom each directed two segments), as well as eight writers
(who sometimes wrote alone, sometimes in pairs or in threes) and
two different directors of photography.
</P>
<P>
   As the man who conceived the project and who, as the executive
producer, kept its large team in harness, Chase is the show's
undisputed auteur. He wrote and directed the first episode, takes
solo writing credit for another and collaborated on scripts for two
others.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``The Sopranos'' received 16 Emmy nominations, the
members of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, a
traditional base for broadcast (as opposed to cable) television,
finally gave the show only two awards. James Manos Jr. and Chase
shared an award for the script of the fifth episode. Edie Falco was
voted best actress in a drama for her performance as Carmela
Soprano, the Mafia boss' wife, a loving, worried, common-sensical
woman who aspires to respectability.
</P>
<P>
   The production was budgeted to come in at $1.9 million to $2
million per episode, which would have made the total cost in the
neighborhood of $26 million. That is small change by standards in
Hollywood, where $26 million is not an outrageous budget for a
comparatively plain, contemporary two-hour movie. By those same
standards, ``The Sopranos,'' as a nearly 13-hour feature film,
might have cost $169 million, without even trying to sink the
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   In describing the production of ``The Sopranos,'' Chase makes it
sound like the process by which a platoon of great comedy writers,
ruled by Sid Caesar, put together the seminal Caesar shows of the
1950s. According to Chase, the writers of each ``Sopranos'' segment
would meet to discuss ideas, sometimes augmented by suggestions
from the other writers. Everybody chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   Each segment was shot fast _ eight days _ though they often went
into overtime. There was a good deal of reshooting and a certain
number of disagreements. That is, everything was perfectly normal.
</P>
<P>
   Chase's background is in television, commercial and cable, where
his credits as a producer, writer and director include ``The
Rockford Files,'' ``I'll Fly Away'' and ``Northern Exposure.''
Nothing he had done before, though, was preparation for the
achievement of ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the comic, frequently tortured journey toward
self-awareness of Tony Soprano, affluent suburban family man, loyal
son to a brutish mother, loyal Mafia member, extortionist and
unhesitating executioner.
</P>
<P>
   His immediate problem as he sees it: his business as a ``waste
disposal consultant'' is ``trending downward.'' More deep rooted
are moral crises. Tony is a guy who is moved to scary (to him),
inexplicable tears when he remembers a family of migrating ducks
that had made an extended stopover in his expensive swimming pool,
then suddenly abandoned the pool to continue the flight north.
</P>
<P>
   The seamlessness of the direction, the writing, the photography
(here is one show in which every close-up has a point and the
camera never loses sight of physical context) is matched in the
ensemble performances by the breathtaking cast.
</P>
<P>
   Most notable: James Gandolfini (the heavy-lidded Tony, an
assassin with sweet instincts he can't comprehend, a nascent beer
belly and a short fuse), the splendid Ms. Falco, Lorraine Bracco
(Tony's psychiatrist, whose treatment of her patient results in
problems for both that Freud never dreamed of), Dominic Chianese
(Tony's aging uncle and immediate mob superior, who is nearly
undone by his longtime mistress) and Michael Imperioli (Tony's
raging nephew, who aspires to be both a ``made'' man of the mob and
a screenwriter).
</P>
<P>
   Dominating every scene she is in is Nancy Marchand as Tony's
mother, a tough, emotionally stingy woman who wears a frown as her
umbrella. It is she who instigates the kind of revenge on a son (he
doesn't love her enough) to which only a mob widow and mother has
access.
</P>
<P>
   I saw ``The Sopranos'' not as it was initially broadcast at the
rate of one segment per week, but at my own pace on cassettes
supplied by HBO. Once I watched four together, another time three,
but always at least two. This gives the critic an edge over the
general public. Momentum builds. Small but important details that
might otherwise be forgotten from one week to the next, or simply
overlooked while one is attending to the plot, remain vivid.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet such privileged viewing also has the potential to create the
sort of intimacy that makes it easier to spot lapses in continuity,
contradictions within characters and a too-ready reliance on story
formulas. ``The Sopranos'' not only survives such close inspection,
but also benefits from it. A series like ``Law and Order'' does
not. If cassettes are one way to establish that intimate contact,
syndication is another.
</P>
<P>
   By chance, I had never seen ``Law and Order'' on first-run
network television. Then, not long ago, I caught up with it as a
syndicated series available at 11 p.m. five nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   The first impressions were good: excellent cast, decent writing,
gritty New York locations. ``Law and Order'' seemed to be the sort
of show touted by friends who like to stir things up when they call
such television dramas ``the literature of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Very quickly, however, I felt like talking back to the screen.
Viewings on successive nights did damage. Repeated plot ploys were
too quickly identified. Characters didn't become more complex with
time, only more familiar, even when the actors playing them were
replaced and the new characters were given different names.
</P>
<P>
   At best, ``Law and Order'' is soothing. You know that, whether
the case is won or lost, the same detectives and lawyers will be
back tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   How we respond to television fare depends on the manner in which
we see it. Commercial-free premium cable channels, as good as they
are, still lock one into someone else's scheduling. Cassettes are
ideal, but there aren't that many mini-series or megamovies at the
corner video shop.
</P>
<P>
   Though the networks still dominate the television market, their
audiences are dwindling. More and more people are apparently
realizing that so-called free television demands too high a price:
that we surrender an ever-increasing proportion of our attention to
the contemplation of commercials. Since the rules were changed
during the Reagan years, broadcasters can stuff any program with as
many commercials as they can get away with. Only children's
programs are regulated.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to avoid commercials, of course _ riding the
remote, going to the fridge _ but in the long run commercials win:
it's just too much trouble to run away.
</P>
<P>
   In our society we celebrate advertising as an art form, which it
may be. Advertising also helps to keep the economy going. Yet no
child grows up today without being aware of the gulf between the
real world and the world as seen in television commercials and in
much of the entertainment they support. Isn't it possible the
resulting skepticism eventually can evolve into something more
pernicious: an unfocused, closeted cynicism that explodes in
violence of no easily recognized motivation?
</P>
<P>
   Such are the thoughts suggested by a show as fresh and
provocative as ``The Sopranos,'' which has nothing to do with
advertising but a lot to do with the temper of American life,
especially with the hypocrisies that go unrecognized.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Tony tries to persuade Meadow, his teen-age
daughter, that, although he has mob connections, her life is no
different from those of the doctor's children who live next door.
Her reply: ``Did the Cusamano kids ever find $50,000 in Krugerrands
and a .45 automatic while hunting for Easter eggs?''
</P>
<P>
   There is a difference. Meadow knows it. So does Tony. ``The
Sopranos,'' which plays as a dark comedy, possesses a tragic
conscience.

BUSH TELLS STUDENTS ABOUT `WRONG CHOICES,' LESSONS HE'S LEARNED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORANGE CITY, Iowa _ Hundreds of high school students sat in edgy
silence Tuesday as Texas Gov. George W. Bush pondered a question
from the student body president: Had he ever made ``wrong choices''
in his life, and what were the consequences?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, let me see ... '' Bush said, facing a similar question to
the one reporters have been dogging him with for months.
</P>
<P>
   After a laden pause, he launched into a brief version of a story
that has appeared in numerous articles about him. Pulling off a
college fraternity prank while in a state of intoxication, he stole
a Christmas wreath from a business in New Haven, Conn. The misdeed
earned him a trip to the police station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake was drinking too much and thinking I was
invisible,'' he said of the incident, which took place near Yale
University in the late 1960s. Police eventually dropped misdemeanor
theft charges.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's event, part of Bush's campaign for president in a
state that conducts its party primary caucuses Jan. 24, was
designed to promote the teaching of ``right choices'' to the next
generation. Many students in this farming community have enrolled
in programs about morality, and Bush has made the subject a
cornerstone of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Bush told the students, he and the rest of his baby boom
generation are qualified through their mistakes to teach lifestyle
lessons to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it was incidents like the one in New Haven that led
him to stop drinking about two decades later. And, without owning
up to having ever used illegal drugs, Bush said his generation that
came of age has a message about those substances, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust us when we say drugs destroy your life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also urged the students to abstain from sex before marriage
to avoid unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted disease. The
federal government should spend more money on teaching abstinence
than on teaching ``safe sex,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The talk about his ``wrong choices'' was one of Bush's few
unscripted statements of the day, which he spent in western Iowa
running through his standard campaign speech so fast that his words
sometimes slurred together. It is a speech that features his vow to
make sure that ``the American dream touches every willing heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The morality discussion was also unusual because questions about
unsubstantiated rumors about Bush's supposed drug use, as well as
any of what he calls his ``young and irresponsible'' days, have
usually come from reporters rather than voters or other audience
members. Bush has told reporters he has not used illegal drugs for
the last 25 years, and he has declined to say whether he ever used
marijuana or cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is taking questions from his presidential campaign
audiences, and his responses sometimes break new ground.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign rally Tuesday in Sioux City, Bush seemed to
stretch the boundaries of his ``compassionate conservative''
philosophy when he answered an audience question about immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that while the federal government should work hard to
keep illegal immigrants out of the country, citizens should
remember that Mexicans cross into the United States illegally
because they want to earn money to feed their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family values do not stop at the Rio Grande River,'' he said.
He added that immigrant parents seeking to make more money to
support their family ``is just a powerful instinct, and it's part
of being a dad and being a mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also defended the use of the death penalty in Texas, saying
he believes it deters crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says to people `don't kill somebody,''' Bush said.

<P>
   He said there is probably fiscal waste at the Pentagon because
the U.S. military has not developed enough of a strategy to shift
from Cold War preparedness to vigilance against worldwide
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of campaign finance reform, he said voters should
worry more about whether a candidate is honest than about where his
or her campaign contributions come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a corruptable person who is going to be corrupted by
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had a three-pronged plan against abortion: Ban
late-term abortions, require doctors to notify an underage
patient's parents before performing an abortion and pass laws that
encourage adoptions.

GOLFERS STRUGGLE TO DEAL WITH STEWART'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day after Payne Stewart's death in a plane crash, his
friends and peers were still trying to cope.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods and David Duval, the world's No. 1- and No. 2-ranked
players, spoke Tuesday in Houston about how difficult it was to
accept that Stewart had died Monday. A memorial service will be
conducted Friday morning in Orlando, Fla., at the First Baptist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the PGA Tour has modified the schedule for the Tour
Championship in Houston to accommodate the memorial service. The
tournament will begin Thursday at the Champions Golf Club, but the
field will play 27 holes instead of the normal 18. No golf will be
played Friday, and the competition will resume with 27 holes
Saturday, followed by a final 18-hole round Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a brief memorial service for Stewart on
Thursday morning on the No. 1 tee at the Champions Golf Club. But
for the players, it remained difficult to accept that Stewart would
not be there. He was being flown to the tournament, but his plane,
with five others aboard, flew for four hours with no one at the
controls before crashing in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost think that hopefully it was a bad dream or a
nightmare,'' said Woods, who lives not far from the Stewart home in
Orlando. ``I think the tournament should go on, but it is not going
to be an easy week for all of us. I almost feel like he is going to
show up. I just saw him the other day. It is hard to believe he is
not going to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's caddie, Mike Hicks, was fortunate to be spared from
the crash. Hicks often traveled with Stewart, but Hicks took his
family with him to last week's tournament outside Orlando. Instead
of leaving with Stewart on Monday, Hicks accompanied his family
back to their home in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Curry, spokesman for the Stewart family, said the family
would probably remain in seclusion until the memorial service in
Florida. About 10 youngsters who are friends of Stewart's two
children, 13-year-old Chelsea and 10-year-old Aaron, visited their
home Tuesday. Later in the day, the Stewarts were visited by a
class from the First Academy, which the Stewart children attend.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks ago, Stewart donated $500,000 to the First
Foundation, the fund-raising arm of the First Baptist Church. He
also helped raise almost $500,000 for the Orlando Children's
charities in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was an Orlando Magic season ticket-holder, and he once
gave former Magic guard Penny Hardaway, now with the Phoenix Suns,
a set of golf clubs. Magic head coach Doc Rivers said Stewart's
death had subdued his team. A moment of silence for Stewart was
observed before Monday's preseason game against the Dallas
Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Duval found out about the accident Monday at the Champions Golf
Club shortly after lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the players are being asked their opinions and their
emotions,'' said Duval, who considered Stewart a friend. ``I think
you have probably heard a lot of people are at a loss. I am
certainly one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many prominent golfers travel regularly on private planes, but
neither Woods nor Duval felt the accident would change the way
golfers travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys have families and they want to get home,'' Woods said.
``Out here, that is huge because you are always playing by
yourself. You are always alone. If you have a family, it is nice to
go home to a family when you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've read, flying is the safest mode of
transportation, just unfortunate that when you have an accident it
is more catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he was uncertain how many of the 29 golfers in the
Tour Championship field would fly to Orlando for Friday's services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, it is going to be a tough day,'' Woods said.
``Some players would rather stay away and try to handle it on their
own. Other players find more comfort in knowing they are giving of
themselves to others in need. It is not going to be an easy answer,
I will tell you that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sleep at all last night. I tossed and turned. I don't
see how you cannot. It is a huge blow to all of us, because he was
part of our lives. It is really difficult to refer to him right now
in the past tense.''
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour announced that contributions in Payne Stewart's
name may be made to the Payne Stewart Memorial Fund, First Orlando
Foundation of the First Baptist Church, 3000 South John Young
Parkway, Orlando, Fla. 32805-6691. All of the tour's tournaments
this week will honor Stewart. At the Southern Farm Bureau Classic
in Madison, Miss., there will be a private memorial service
Thursday night after the first round, and play will be suspended
Friday. The tournament will end Monday. At the Pacific Bell Senior
Classic in Los Angeles, there will be a public memorial service
following Friday's first round. &QL;

ROSE HAS NO CHANCE OF BEING REINSTATED, COMMISSIONER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The overwhelmingly favorable fan reaction toward Pete Rose in
Atlanta on Sunday will have no impact on Rose's chances of being
reinstated to Major League Baseball, Commissioner Bud Selig said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Selig also left no doubt that his position on Rose's
reinstatement is unchanged: He has no chance.
</P>
<P>
   Rose and his appearance at the all-century team festivities was
the hot topic of conversation at Yankee Stadium in the hours before
the third game of the World Series. Selig, standing in foul
territory near home plate as the Yankees took batting practice, was
besieged with questions on Rose's status and a controversial
television interview conducted by Jim Gray on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   When Rose was introduced at Turner Field on Sunday, the crowd
saluted him with the longest and loudest ovation accorded any of
the 18 players. Television viewers have also overwhelmingly
criticized Gray and defended Rose since the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly can't influence your decision, in anything,''
Selig said. ``In the end you have to do what you think is right, as
Bart did and other commissioners have done, in baseball and in
other sports. You can't be guided by what you think X number of
people feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose was banned for life for gambling in 1989 by Commissioner A.
Bartlett Giamatti, with the right to apply for reinstatement a year
later. Rose did not make that application until two years ago.
Selig has not acted on it formally, but with his public comments he
has left no question about his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made my feelings very well known over the past year,''
Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said: ``I think I've been pretty clear on this all
summer long.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked whether he could envision reaching a middle ground,
where Rose would continue to be suspended from baseball but be made
eligible for the Hall of Fame. The board of directors of the Hall,
which is a private enterprise, adopted a rule after Rose was
suspended that anyone on baseball's ineligible list would not be
eligible for election to the Hall. ``The Bart Giamatti decision is
very clear and very lucid on all those points,'' Selig said.
``These kinds of situations don't call for middle-ground
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The all-century festivities Sunday marked the first time since
his banishment 10 years ago that Rose had been invited to or
allowed to attend or participate in a Major League Baseball
function. Asked whether baseball should have held to its previous
stance on Rose, the commissioner said: ``I'm the one that made that
decision this summer. I took a long walk one night and thought
about it. I thought to myself if the fans elect Pete to the team
than it's only fair he be allowed to come. I will not second-guess
myself on that decision at all. In fact I'm glad I made that
decision.''

 &HT;    Compaq defies analysts' expectations
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Compaq Computer Corp. Tuesday reported profits
that were better than Wall Street analysts had expected, but it
also disclosed its key commercial PC business had a substantial
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Compaq reported profits of $140 million or $0.08 a
share, $0.03 higher than many Wall Street analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings were better than the $115 million, or $0.07 a
share, the company reported a year ago, although they included a
one-time gain from the sale of its AltaVista Internet portal. Not
counting the $1.2 billion gain and separate charges related to a
major restructuring, Compaq earned $117 million, or $0.07 a share
for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   While the company did not disclose profits for its consumer
business, it said its commercial business lost $169 million in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Mike Capellas, meanwhile, warned the fourth
quarter is highly unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the history of the computer industry, you won't ever find a
more difficult quarter to predict than Q4 '99,'' Capellas said,
adding that the outlook for commercial sales is uncertain because
of businesses' Y2K concerns.
</P>
<P>
   IBM last week warned that fourth-quarter sales would suffer
because customers are deferring high-end purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp., which reports its third-quarter results
Nov. 11, warned Oct. 18 that profits would be affected by tight
supplies of memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   Capellas said he doesn't expect supply disruptions, noting that
Compaq signed a five-year agreement on Monday for memory chips with
Micron Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Capellas attributed the loss in the commercial PC business to
intense price cutting and Compaq's continued difficulty competing
with Dell and other direct companies that can get new products to
market faster.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Compaq's commercial PC business has lost $394
million, $83 million more than IBM's PC business lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't yet kept pace with the PC sales and distribution
model,'' Capellas said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was $9.2
billion, up about 6 percent from a year ago. Operating costs
declined to $1.97 billion from $2.2 billion a year ago, in part
because of the major restructuring that resulted in the elimination
of 700 full-time and 2,100 part-time jobs so far.
</P>
<P>
   The results were released after markets closed. Compaq closed up
$0.56 1/4 at $19.50 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss in its commercial business, Compaq's numbers
indicated the major restructuring it began earlier this year is
starting to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's consumer PC group posted sales of $1.5 billion, up 15
percent from last year. Enterprise products and services posted a
12 percent increase in services revenue and a 14 percent increase
in product sales.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's earnings report came on the heels of research reports
Monday that showed that Dell displaced Compaq as the No. 1 U.S.
computer maker for the second quarter in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is still second to Compaq in worldwide computer shipments,
according to researchers International Data Corp. and Dataquest
Inc.

ANXIOUS WIFE TRIED TO CALL STEWART DURING FATAL FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Payne Stewart's wife, Tracey, was one of the
millions of people transfixed by television reports Monday about
his Learjet flying uncontrolled across the United States, and she
tried to call him on his cellular phone, a family member said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She tried to ring Payne on his cell phone, but she couldn't
raise him,'' said Mike Ferguson, a brother of the wife of Stewart,
the golf champion who died with five others in the plane, which
crashed in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators began a tedious search for clues, the
electronic age added another twist to the old-fashioned tragedy of
a plane crash: an advertisement offering the doomed plane for sale
was still posted Tuesday on the Web page of the operator, Sunjet
Aviation. The plane had a new interior installed in July 1998,
including a compact disc sound system and ``medium gray carpet
w/gray accents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft is in premium condition inside and out,'' the
advertisement said.
</P>
<P>
   Crash investigators said Tuesday that the Learjet, which flew
1,400 miles before it crashed near Mina, S.D., had buried itself
deeply in the soft mud, promising a laborious task. The plane
apparently hit the ground at a high angle, creating a compact field
of debris, and Robert Francis, the vice chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board, speaking near the crash site, said it
would take time to recover the pieces in a way that preserved all
possible information.
</P>
<P>
   Francis said investigators would pay special attention to the
seals around the doors and windows, among other parts. Asked about
identifying parts in the wreckage, he said, ``I was amazed this
morning, standing at the side of the pit out there, that the folks
from Lear could say, `that's the horizontal stabilizer, that's part
of the aileron.'''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the two pilots
stopped responding to air-traffic controllers some time after
reaching 37,000 feet, and Air Force jets called out to chase the
Lear found that the windows were fogged. The plane's mechanical
systems kept working, including the autopilot and a radio beacon
that faithfully broadcast the flight's identity and altitude.
</P>
<P>
   The Lear, which can carry up to eight passengers, had a cockpit
voice recorder, but it had not been found by Tuesday afternoon.
Even if it is found it is unlikely to have any voices on it,
because it has a tape that is only 30 minutes long before recording
over earlier conversations and the plane flew for four hours. As is
the case with most corporate jets, it did not carry a flight data
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota officials said that they would order tests on the
human remains but that there was no specific toxicological test to
determine if the two pilots and four passengers had been knocked
out or killed by a lack of air. Loss of cabin pressure is one
possible cause of the crash. Smoke in the cockpit is another, and
that can be determined from blood tests, as well as from evidence
in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were also interviewing the pilots of military
chase planes, and asked if any member of the public had made a
videotape of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other investigators were poring over maintenance
records of the plane, which was built in 1976 and had made about
7,500 flights. One question was whether the operators had complied
with an order from the FAA in November 1995 to replace the valve
that controls the flow of air out of the cabin. The valve, under
the co-pilot's seat, is one place where a cabin pressure problem
could develop, if that is what happened to this plane. The aviation
agency ordered planes using the valve not to fly above 41,000 feet
until the repair was done, and to do the work within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   David Franson, a spokesman for Lear, a subsidiary of Bombardier
Inc., said the order, which amounts to a recall, began when Allied
Signal Aerospace, which supplied the environmental control system,
found a defect in the manufacturing process. It was not triggered
by a failure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane that crashed had been bought in September by Jetshares
One, a company that sells fractional ownership in planes, Franson
said. He said Stewart owned a fractional share, though it was in a
newer Learjet, a 31A, not the one that crashed.

BUSH UNDER ATTACK AS HE SAGS IN NEW POLLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of relatively smooth sailing toward
the Republican primaries, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas found
himself in less placid straits Tuesday, with his two main
Republican rivals attacking him at the same time that several new
polls suggested some give in Bush's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Both developments dulled the shiny aura of inevitability that
has enveloped Bush since he announced his presidential candidacy in
June. And while this moment was inevitable, political analysts
said, it also confirmed that Bush has yet to face his most intense
scrutiny, from competitors and voters alike.
</P>
<P>
   Alan K. Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming,
suggested that Bush would have to spend even more time mingling
with voters in important primary states and scuffling with his
opponents over the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for him to gear up,'' said Simpson, who teaches at
the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. ``No one can
stay loose like that and do what they have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's two most formidable challengers for the Republican
nomination, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and the publisher Steve
Forbes, made arguably their strongest efforts to date to rattle
Bush's composure.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning in California on Monday, accused Bush's
aides of planting and abetting an unflattering newspaper article
about him. He was referring to a front-page article in The New York
Times on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently,'' McCain said, ``the memo has gone out from the
Bush campaign to start attacking John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said Tuesday that McCain's accusation was wholly
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ken Blackwell, the national chairman of the Forbes
campaign, issued a statement Tuesday denouncing a new television
commercial by Bush that asserts that he significantly reduced the
growth of government spending in Texas. Blackwell cited independent
analyses that showed a 36 percent increase in spending under Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfair and it's misleading for him to represent his
fiscal leadership to be of a conservative nature, when he really
makes Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton's administration look like
conservative fiscal managers,'' Blackwell said in a subsequent
telephone interview. ``There's an old saying in Texas: all hat, no
cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell called on the Bush campaign to withdraw or amend the
advertisement, which began running in Iowa and New Hampshire this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said they would do no such thing. They said that
the 36 percent figure failed to account for inflation, increases in
population that strained state services and other factors, and that
the rate of growth of spending was higher under previous governors.
</P>
<P>
   They also accused the Forbes campaign of reprising the negative
tactics that Forbes used against Bob Dole, the Republican
front-runner in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This misleading attack says more about Steve Forbes than it
does about Governor Bush,'' said Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for
the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to both McCain and Forbes have long maintained that the
overwhelming early support for Bush was not built on any real
knowledge among voters and that Bush was more vulnerable than he
appeared. The attacks Tuesday may well have been set off by new
hints of that vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of New Hampshire voters, made public this week by
Research 2000, showed that in that state, which holds the first
Republican primary early next year, McCain trails Bush by 12
points. Bush held a 35-point lead in a poll last August.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two national surveys made public this week
suggested that in a hypothetical contest between Bush and Vice
President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner, Gore is gaining
ground.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll of 1,005 adults showed Gore to be 9 points behind
Bush; a similar poll by Gallup just two weeks ago put the spread at
16 points. The margin of sampling error for each survey was three
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Iowa Tuesday, said, ``I think it's too
early to be talking about the general election.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said that other recent national polls did not
show any dent in the governor's lead and that they had always
expected his lead to shrink, a development that political analysts
called inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's numbers were stratospheric and unsustainable over the
long haul,'' said Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist.
</P>
<P>
   But Gillespie added that those numbers were still
extraordinarily promising and that rivals who were waiting for Bush
to hurt himself were now realizing that, with only three months
before the first Iowa caucuses, they have to inflict the pain
themselves. ``It's gone from `if he stumbles' to `I've got to trip
this guy,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is making his own adjustments, his advisers said, adding
that his campaign schedule will grow lighter on fund-raisers and
heavier on events where he meets with voters.
</P>
<P>
   These advisers said such changes were planned long ago. But one
adviser acknowledged that the race had become more volatile with
the departures of Patrick J. Buchanan and Elizabeth Dole, which
narrowed the Republican field and raised the profiles of Bush's
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth Dole took 12 percent of the vote and threw it up
into the air as a jump ball,'' said the adviser, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``And there are really only three primary
contenders clawing for that vote: Forbes, McCain and Bush.''

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Thursday, Oct. 21,
about visits to women's history landmarks in western New York
misidentified the suffragist who wrote an 1861 diary passage saying
she had ``fitted out a fugitive slave for Canada with the help of
Harriet Tubman.'' The author was Susan B. Anthony, not Elizabeth
Cady Stanton.

<P>
   A listing with the article misstated the subtitle and price for

HELMS WOULD ACT ON NOMINEE IN RETURN FOR SENSITIVE PAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under criticism for his handling of a racially
sensitive nomination, Sen. Jesse Helms says he will hold a hearing
next week on the choice of former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun to be
ambassador to New Zealand if the Clinton administration supplies
internal documents on accusations that she used money from her 1992
campaign for personal use and never declared it as income.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Democrats and administration officials criticized the
offer on Tuesday, saying it amounted to an extraordinary demand for
sensitive data by Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. ``It's clear that Senator Helms does not intend to move
this nomination forward in the near future,'' said Barry Toiv, a
White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, R-N.C., inspired a partisan dispute over race and
nominations last week when he made clear that he opposed President
Clinton's choice of Moseley Braun _ an Illinois Democrat who seven
years ago became the first black woman elected to the Senate _ in
part because in 1993 she successfully opposed a measure, supported
by Helms, that would have renewed a patent featuring a Confederate
flag. The chairman demanded an apology as a price for considering
her nomination, and indicated that he would not take up the matter
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   But after intense criticism by civil rights groups and
congressional Democrats, who accused Republicans of being
insensitive to minorities, Helms changed tack late Monday. In a
letter to the president, he promised to convene his committee for a
hearing on the nomination, and perhaps even a vote before Congress
adjourns for the year, if the administration provided sensitive
documents from the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue
Service related to Moseley Braun's conduct. The senator gave a
deadline of next Monday, according to a copy of the letter provided
to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports last year disclosed that the IRS twice asked
the Justice Department in 1995 to open a grand jury inquiry into
whether Moseley Braun had used 1992 campaign funds for personal use
without reporting the income and paying taxes on it. The Justice
Department refused each time, citing a lack of credible
information.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a Federal Election Commission audit in 1996 of
Moseley Braun's 1992 campaign found sloppy bookkeeping, but the
commission levied no fines. With the five-year period under the
statute of limitations expiring, the commission dropped its case in
1997, saying it did not have the time or resources to finish the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Relations Committee is especially interested in
examining the internal administration documents related to the
Justice Department's refusal to impanel a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving them a chance to have a hearing on this, on the
merits,'' said Marc Thiessen, a committee spokesman. ``If she has a
clean ethical bill of health, she'll be confirmed as ambassador
next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides writing Clinton, Helms requested information from John
D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff; Attorney General Janet
Reno, and Charles O. Rossotti, the commissioner of internal
revenue. He sought legal opinions, prosecution memorandums,
requests for grand jury proceedings and a variety of other
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Thiessen said the administration had honored a similar request
for confidential documents in what had been the long-delayed
nomination of Richard C. Holbrooke to be chief delegate to the
United Nations. But Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the
committee's ranking Democrat, called Helms' request a ``fishing
expedition'' that went well beyond the paperwork required for
Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley Braun, who after one term in the Senate lost her
re-election race last year, was nominated by Clinton to the
ambassadorship to New Zealand earlier this month. In light of what
they regard as Helms' continued resistance, administration
officials have begun thinking of the possibility of a recess
appointment by the president, which would allow Moseley Braun to
take office once the Senate leaves town for the year and to hold
her post until the next Congress, more than a year away.

CENSUS AD CAMPAIGN TRIES TO ENTICE THE INDIFFERENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The commercial shows an empty school hall as the
words, ``Built to hold 875,'' flash on the screen. Suddenly
students pour out of classrooms and down stairs, filling the hall
to overflowing. ``Now holds 1,145,'' the screen says.
</P>
<P>
   Next an empty cafeteria: ``Built to hold 135.'' The commercial
cuts to students carrying their lunch on trays, vainly looking for
an empty chair in a crowded lunchroom. ``Now holds 221,'' the
screen says, as a voice-over intones, ``You (italics)can(end
italics) do something about overcrowded schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fill out your census,'' the voice says at the end. ``It helps
determine public funding for schools.''
</P>
<P>
   With advertisements like this, the Census Bureau is beginning
the first paid advertising campaign in its history to encourage an
often-wary and indifferent public to fill out its censu
after they are mailed out next March. From November through next
April, the Census Bureau will spend $102.8 million on television
and radio commercials, and advertisements placed in newspapers,
magazines and on billboards.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which will include more than 250 advertisements in
17 languages, is intended to slow a three-decades-old trend of
fewer and fewer people mailing back their completed census forms.
It is intended for groups that research has shown are less likely
to return the form: blacks living in poor city neighborhoods,
renters of all races, high school dropouts and the sons and
daughters of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very different type of campaign,'' said Darlene
Billia, an executive with Young &AMP; Rubicam, which is conducting the
advertising campaign under contract to the Census Bureau. ``Most
marketers will tell you to go after the people who are most likely
to buy your product. We have to try to reach people who are the
least likely to be responsive.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Census Bureau publicized the census through $68.3
million worth of advertising time and space donated by television
networks, radio stations and outdoor advertisers. But networks
tended to run the public service announcements very late at night
or early Sunday mornings, not during valuable prime time.
</P>
<P>
   This time the bureau is paying for commercials, spending the
equivalent of what a corporation like H.J. Heinz, Canon or Toys
``'R'' Us would in a comparable period. Young &AMP; Rubicam officials
estimate that because of large advertising purchases on cable
networks like Black Entertainment Television and in magazines like
``Ebony,'' many African-Americans could see the census
advertisements as many as 120 times from November to the end of
April.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hispanic Americans could see them as many as 105 times, as
a result of extensive advertising on Spanish-language networks like
Univision, and most whites could see them more than 50 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible campaign for each of the targeted groups,''
said Terry Dukes, the Young &AMP; Rubicam executive who headed the
advertising team. ``We haven't been able to find anything that
matches its scope and depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Census officials say the campaign is needed because of the
declining mail-back response rates among the public. In 1990, only
65 percent of the 120 million households in the country returned
the form, down from 75 percent who did so in 1980. Without any
changes in how the census is promoted, bureau experts had projected
that only 55 percent of the households would return the form in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the information on mail-in forms tends to be more
accurate than the data solicited by a census taker. Thus the lower
the mail-in response, the greater the likelihood of a repeat of the
1990 census when more than 8.4 million people were missed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even with the advertising campaign, census officials only
hope to slow the slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current budget and staffing plans are based on a return
rate of 61 percent,'' said Kenneth Prewitt, the director of the
Census Bureau. ``If it dips below that we will have a real hard
time conducting the census.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts are skeptical that in an era of distrust of
government and a flood of junk mail that is often ignored, the
bureau will have a hard time reaching that goal, no matter how much
of an enhanced advertising campaign it runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is down for response rates for surveys, both
government and non-government,'' said Stephen E. Fienberg, a
professor of statistics and social science at Carnegie Mellon
University and an expert on the census. ``Just think about how many
items you get in the mail every day asking you to respond to
something. I get four or five. The likelihood of that getting
thrown away is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Extensive research conducted by Young &AMP; Rubicam among groups
that are least likely to return the form found high levels of
ignorance about the census, and great wariness about how the
information that is gathered would be used. Focus groups and
surveys determined that appeals to a person's civic responsibility
to complete the forms worked well among groups like
college-educated whites with already high response rates. Such
appeals fell completely flat with groups that tend not to fill out
the forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a quantitative study, we found that appeals to patriotism
just didn't work,'' said Daisy Exposito, president of the Bravo
Group, a Hispanic advertising company that is under a subcontract
help design the appeal to Hispanic Americans.
</P>
<P>
   So, much of the campaign appeals to racial or ethnic solidarity
or to self-interest, reminding people of the federal financial aid
that is distributed on the basis of census data and how much a
person's community may miss out on this largess by not completing
the form.

   GETTING OFF TO A SHAKY START
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Bonsignore says he has had lots of ``pivotal
moments'' at Honeywell, which at the moment he is busy merging with
Allied Signal, trying to meld two cultures and defuse anxiety. But
for sheer personal drama, no event can match the time he almost
lost his first job there _ before he even showed up for work.

</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler reported a 14 percent rise in third-quarter

forecasts of 29 cents, sending its stock up smartly. Lucent also
announced a reorganization into four core businesses and an
executive shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   STOCK PRICES FALL ON RETAIL DROP

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Elizabeth Carr was such a historic
one-of-a-kind when she was born that the doctors who helped give
her life also gave her a heart-shaped silver pendant engraved with
the number 1. She wears it to this day, at age 17.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carr was America's first ``test-tube baby,'' conceived
through in vitro fertilization, a technique that addresses
infertility by introducing sperm to egg in a laboratory dish rather
than in a woman, with the egg then implanted in the mother.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is ``just one of a crowd,'' as Ms. Carr's mother
predicted soon after giving birth to her: a crowd of 60,000
American children who, if not for the technique, would not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, when Ms. Carr was born, in vitro fertilization has
become a staple of fertility clinics. Around the globe, 300,000
children have been born with its help since the very first, Louise
Brown of England, came into the world in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   But in America, Elizabeth Carr _ now a merry, choir-singing,
honor-roll senior in high school _ remains unique, in that being
first has made her a torchbearer for all the other test-tube
children, and she has lived her young life accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   That is, she seems mostly to have lived a very normal life with
her mother, Judith, director of a preschool, and father, Roger, an
engineer, in a colonial house in the central Massachusetts town of
Westminster. These days she is applying for early decision on
admission to Simmons College in Boston, counting the days until her
high school grades stop mattering, and tooling around in her first
car.
</P>
<P>
   But every once in a while, she and her parents stop and go
public, as they did last week when they received an award from
Resolve, the national infertility association, which was meeting
here in Cambridge. For Ms. Carr, such occasions mean submitting to
questions like these:
</P>
<P>
   Does she feel any different from other teen-agers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I always respond the same way,'' Ms. Carr replied. ``I don't
 &UR; know &LR; ! I've been this way for 17, almost 18 years of my life. I
don't know what normal is or isn't. This is what I am. To me it's
normal. But I think people still expect me to be somehow different.
They expect me to have thorns growing out of somewhere or that I'm
psychic, or something interesting. They want a good story. But I
always say, `No, I don't think I'm any different.' If you walk down
the street, you can't pick out, `Oh, there's an in-vitro kid.'''
</P>
<P>
   Has her status as the nation's first ``in-vitro kid'' affected
her?
</P>
<P>
   ``Day to day I don't even think about it,'' she said. ``It's
part of who I am now, and it's made me a little bit who I am just
because of all the attention. But you can't take yourself too
seriously; you have to laugh. If I had told myself when I was
younger, `I am so special because I am the best and I am the
first,' my God! I would never have any friends.''
</P>
<P>
   (And, Judith Carr put in, ``your mother has no patience with
prima donnas.'')
</P>
<P>
   Has anyone ever held the nature of her conception against her?
</P>
<P>
   Just once, Ms. Carr said. During a soccer game in gym class, a
girl shouted something like: ``You stupid test-tube baby! You can't
kick! They didn't put that in the petri dish!''
</P>
<P>
   Certain groups and denominations, including the Roman Catholic
Church, oppose in vitro fertilization as a procedure defying the
will of God, but Judith and Roger Carr say they have never been
uncomfortable with the decision they made. Indeed, the family, with
the help of screening by friendly media savants, has so carefully
managed the exposure that it has ended up being a downright
positive experience _ so positive that Ms. Carr says she would like
to become a journalist herself, probably a television reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided we wanted to be public, but in a controlled manner,
to focus on education, not the sensationalistic aspects,'' Carr
said. So they cooperated with ``Nova,'' the science series on
public television, and Family Circle, and a few others, including
Life magazine, which put 8-month-old Elizabeth on its cover.
</P>
<P>
   They turned down the less reputable outfits that tried to sign
exclusive contracts with them, and have made no profit from their
media appearances. They declined an offer for a made-for-television
movie, although Judith Carr, taking wry note of her daughter's
college plans, now says, ``If I knew what places like Simmons were
going to cost, I might have considered it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Nova'' special, whose production began well before
Elizabeth was born, came in handy: when she started asking
questions about where babies came from, the physician who had
engineered her conception, Dr. Howard Jones of what is now the
Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine at East Virginia Medical
School, could sit down and show her the telecast as aal. Her
reaction, she said the other day, was, `Oh, wow, my parents went
through all that to have me?'''
</P>
<P>
   The many parents who owe the birth of their children to Dr.
Jones continue to hold frequent, deeply moving reunions, the Carrs
said; it might be considered an unerring sign of a fertility
technique's true maturation that at the latest one, Ms. Carr and
several other in vitro baby pioneers got bored, asked their parents
for money and went off to a nearby mall.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carr cannot count how many times she has been interviewed.
Her parents are so tele-seasoned that when a television news team
here asked the three of them to take a casual walk along the banks
of the Charles River, Judith Carr commented, ``We don't do the
strolling well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry, Mom,'' her daughter reassured her. ``They can cut
this and edit.''
</P>
<P>
   The family seems to have fun with its occasional fame, and
advocates for infertile people say the Carrs' willingness to open
their lives to the public periodically has proved a great help to
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infertility is such a personal and private issue for so many,
and the infertility constituency is invisible _ you can't see our
disease,'' said Diane Aronson, executive director of Resolve. The
Carrs ``have really brought an awareness about it and shown people
there is opportunity and hope and treatment that can be available
to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of infertile couples try in vitro these
days, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
An average attempt costs $8,000 to $12,000, according to Resolve,
and the law varies by state as to whether insurance covers it.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, it might be said, in vitro fertilization has
entered its second generation. Louise Brown, now a 21-year-old
nurse in Bristol, England, has not had children, but in July her
younger sister, Natalie, also conceived in vitro, became the first
in-vitro child to bear a child of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Conception was achieved the old-fashioned way, The Bristol
Evening Post reported.

GALARRAGA AND LOPEZ ROOT FROM THE BENCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What if the Yankees had reached the World Series this
season without Bernie Williams for the entire schedule and Paul
O'Neill for half the season? This is roughly what the Atlanta
Braves have accomplished without Andres Galarraga all season and
without Javy Lopez for half the season.
</P>
<P>
   Both Galarraga and Lopez were in uniform and on the field before
Game 3 at Yankee Stadium Tuesday night. But their participation was
confined to pregame drills and conversations on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' said Lopez, a 28-year-old catcher who was
batting .317 with 11 home runs and 45 runs batted in when he
suffered a season-ending ligament injury to his right knee on July
24. ``You want to do something to make the team win. But you won't
be able to do it because you are not playing. You try to give
advice, but it's not the same. I have a lot of fun watching the
team, but it's tough to watch the team lose and you can't do
anything to help them besides cheer for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga's medical situation was even more serious. After
batting .305 and hitting 44 home runs with 121 runs batted in last
season, he missed this entire season while recovering from
lymphatic cancer. After undergoing chemotherapy and radiation
treatments focusing on his lower back, Gallaraga, a 38-year-old
first baseman, has gained about 25 pounds over his normal playing
weight and is planning to work out all winter so that he can report
to spring training in playing shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably feel better than I look,'' Galarraga said. ``It's
really hard to watch from the bench. You can't do anything. But
it's different for the guys who are not playing, but they at least
have a chance to be in the game sooner or later. I don't have any
chance to be inside the game, so it's more frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga said he never lacked confidence in his eventual
recovery. As for his current role, he said, ``Right now, the big
thing is pushing the guys to be positive and aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   At first base for Atlanta last night was Brian Hunter, who
shared time there this season. The catcher was Eddie Perez, who
played full time in Lopez's absence.
</P>
<P>
   John Schuerholz, the Braves' general manager, said the team's
success without Lopez and Galarraga ``says a lot about the guys who
were here and the job they've done and how hard they've played and
how effective they've been.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real tribute to the professionalism,'' he said. ``We've
lost some key guys, but no one's complained about it or whined
about it. They've just sort of circled the wagons and played
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the presence of Galarraga and Lopez on the bench and
around the team, Schuerholz said: ``I think they are delighted to
be here. Andres told me after the last game with the Mets that he
was more nervous than if he had been playing. They have strong
feelings for their teammates and we are glad they are here. Their
presence is a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Hernandez, the designated hitter last night, said the two
disabled players ``give us more confidence, and there are more
people in the dugout cheering for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are veterans, so they can talk about baseball more than
someone else,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Andruw Jones said that, more than Lopez's knee
injury, Galarraga's cancer had ``an effect on the whole team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big guy on the team,'' Jones said. ``He's a big part.
Losing a guy like that is like losing three guys. We stick together
and we battled and we made it to the World Series. He's happy for
us. He tells everybody he wishes he could play with us. That's part
of life. You can't do anything about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said it was a mistake for people to assume that the Braves
won the National League pennant despite the absence of him and
Galarraga and that Atlanta might be doing better in the Series if
he and Galarraga were available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why use that as an excuse?'' Lopez said. ``Maybe with me and
Andres, we might not have made it to the World Series. That's
something people don't realize: they played great baseball even
with our absence. If we made it all the way here, that means we can
beat any other team, including the Yankees.''

 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert E. Rubin, arguably the best known financier of
his generation and the recently retired treasury secretary, has
taken a top position at Citigroup, the nation's largest financial
services company.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, 61 and the former top official of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.,
said Tuesday he had joined Sanford I. Weill and John S. Reed, the
co-heads of Citigroup, in what Reed described as a ``three-person
office of the chairman'' overseeing what has become the first true
American financial conglomerate since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment comes less than a week after the Clinton
administration and Congress agreed on a compromise bill that would
overhaul the laws that regulate the financial industry, a measure
that removes many of the restrictions preventing banks, securities
firms and insurance companies from buying one another other or
engaging in one another's businesses. Both Rubin and Citigroup
strongly supported the bill. But Rubin said the likely repeal of
the so-called Glass-Steagall legislation had nothing to do with his
decision to join the company.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment settles the swirl of speculation about what
Rubin, who is considered a hero by some for engineering one of
America's longest economic booms, would do for an encore.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also discussed employment with American International
Group, a leading life insurance company, and Warburg Pincus, a New
York investment firm, before agreeing to join Citigroup, said
people who were told about Rubin's negotiations. He also had
discussions with Goldman about serving on his old firm's board of
directors, people close to Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin declined to discuss his talks with any other company, and
officials of those three companies also declined to comment.
Citigroup officials said that while Rubin would be free to pursue
outside endeavors, including a role in local New York or national
politics, he would not work for any financial company that competes
with Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin will not become a third chief executive with Weill and
Reed, who brought Citigroup together by joining Citibank, one of
America's leading banks, with Traveler's Group, a large insurance
company and investment bank last year and have had a sometimes
rocky relationship since then. Rubin will head the executive
committee of Citigroup's board, work full time at the company, and
participate in all major managerial and strategic decisions, the
three men said. Rubin will also have a corner office alongside
Weill and Reed in the company's blond-wood and glass executive
suite in mid-town Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like the issues of managing a large institution and I
want to really get back involved,'' Rubin said in an interview.
``I'd also like to fish, read books and play tennis, but life is a
trade off.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's role at Citigroup appears to be a delicate balance
between his desire to take an active role in plotting the future of
the company , but to avoid becoming a chief executive or to have
day-to-day responsibilities for a particular part of the business.
The terms of his employment were complex enough that it took five
weeks of almost constant meetings to negotiate, people close to
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   No Citigroup employees will report to him directly. But Rubin
plans to bring Michael Froman, his former Treasury Department chief
of staff, to work at Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob has the best job in the company: no line responsibility,
but he will be a full partner,'' Reed said during a meeting to
announce Rubin's appointment at Citigroup's Park Avenue
headquarters here on Park Avenue. ``He will not play a role as an
executive officer of the company, as Sandy and I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   But after years as the government's top economic official, Rubin
brings to Citigroup a rolodex of contacts that one bank analyst
called priceless. To the extent that he is willing to use his
contacts to push Citigroup's banking business around the world,
Rubin could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also saw the Rubin name on Citigroup's marquee as
a draw for star bankers on Wall Street, potentially making the
firm's Salmon Smith Barney investment bank a more formidable
competitor to other firms, including Goldman, where Rubin spent the
bulk of his career as a bond trader and senior executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be one of the most well regarded individuals among
senior government officials and corporations world wide. He can get
a meeting with anyone he wants,'' said Joan Solotar, who analyzes
Citigroup for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``They will win deals
that they would not otherwise have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's return to Wall Street is not unprecedented. James Baker,
the former Bush and Reagan administration official, joined Carlyle
Group, a venture capital and buy-out firm. Nicholas Brady, a Bush
administration treasury secretary, also followed Rubin's circular
path from Wall Street to Washington and back. Brady now heads Darby
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, however, cuts a much higher profile. It has 100
million clients in 100 countries and is on course this year to earn
$10 billion in net profits, far ahead of any of its rivals in the
finance industry. It was also one of the leading forces in
Washington pushing for an overhaul of financial laws, in part
because Citigroup might have had to sell some of its businesses,
including its insurance underwriting subsidiary, if Congress had
not agreed to pass reforms this year.

NEW YORK: this year .   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal law requires retired government officials to refrain
from interceding with their former agency on behalf of a new
employer for at least one year after leaving public service. The
Clinton administration requires its top officials to pledge that
they will not lobby their agency for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that he would take a ``belt and suspenders'' approach
to ethics questions, regularly consulting with a lawyer, if
necessary, to make sure that his work for the company did not raise
questions about influence peddling or conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there should be any political sensitivity
here,'' Rubin said. ``I am involved in the business of this
organization, not in lobbying.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin acknowledged that he had helped to broker a deal to make
possible the compromise agreement repealing Glass-Steagall even
during his negotiations with Citigroup. He said he had a hand in
urging Congress and the White House to preserve the Community
Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to channel a portion of
their lending to poor, inner city areas. The future of that act had
been a sticking point between Republicans and the White House that
held up agreement on the financial overhaul package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care greatly about CRA,'' Rubin said, adding that he was
pleased with the final legislative compromise. ``I did have
conversations about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and Weill said that they had come to know one another
while Rubin was in office and Weill was constructing Citigroup, the
formation of which involved required extensive talks with
government regulators. Weill was also perhaps Wall Street's most
active lobbyist on behalf of the financial services overhaul, in
which Rubin played a guiding role. Though both men are avid
Democrats and have spent their careers in New York financial
circles, they said they had not been close friends before.
</P>
<P>
   But both Rubin and Weill said that they had not discussed
Rubin's future when Rubin was at the treasury department. Citigroup
officials said that Weill first raised the offer of a job at the
company in mid-September, more than two months after Rubin resigned
his post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have inappropriate to discuss that while I was in
office,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, Weill and Reed all said that Rubin's role at the firm
would go far beyond cajoling corporate executives and government
officials to hire Citigroup bankers, however. He intends to help
plot the firm's strategy. He and the two Citigroup executives said
they would be walking in and out of each other's offices all day,
running the firm as a troika.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offices are adjacent and no one will be out of touch,''
said Weill.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup officials declined to discuss Rubin's compensation
package, although details will have to be revealed in a proxy
statement next spring because Rubin will be a director of the
company and will likely be one of its most highly paid executives.
Asked about his pay, Rubin declined to comment. But asked if it
would top his $150,000 salary as treasury secretary, he deadpanned:
``That's a fair assumption.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not need the money. When he entered government service
in early 1993, Rubin put his assets, most of which consisted of
partnership shares in Goldman, into a blind trust. The trust at the
time was valued at about $100 million, though it has possibly
increased considerably in value given the bull market in stocks
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by leaving Goldman and accepting cash in exchange for his
shares, Rubin missed the windfall other partners enjoyed when
Goldman became a public company earlier this year. Had he remained
the top executive at Goldman, his assets would have increased at
least three fold in value and totaled over half a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, his old Goldman pay pales in comparison with what
Weill and Reed now earn at Citigroup. Last year, Weill and Reed had
total compensation, including stock options, valued at about $27
million. Rubin seems unlikely to earn as much as either Weill or
Reed because he does not have the same executive responsibilities.
But his senior role in the firm suggests that he could easily earn
tens of millions of dollars in salary, bonus and stock options each
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiger Woods had just watched the tragic episode of his neighbor
and good friend unfold before his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It was Monday afternoon in Orlando, Fla., and Woods was
incredulously following the televised story of an out-of-control
Learjet with Payne Stewart on it, knowing there was nothing anybody
could do to keep it from crashing and, in fact, knowing already
that Stewart probably had died.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Woods was bound for Houston and the Tour
Championship after jumping on an aircraft hauntingly similar to the
one that had taken Stewart to his death.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about jumping back on the horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has happened to other people as well,'' Woods said.
``People who are either killed in a freak accident like Payne was
or in terrorist bombings, or you have planes going down like (that
of) JFK Jr. You have accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when you have an accident, it's just part of the risk that
we all live. If you have been in a car accident, you are hesitant
about getting in a car again, but you have to. You are not going to
ride your bike 50 miles to go to work. You have to go on. And
that's the hard part sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is comfortable in the company of death. And there is no
question that Stewart's death has thrown the world's golfing
community into a numb state that has enveloped the days leading up
to the start of the Tour Championship on Thursday. Woods, the
world's No. 1 golfer, is no more immune to the feelings of despair
than the other 28 golfers at Champions Golf Club, the fans who were
at times like zombies on Tuesday and the media horde.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got to the golf course, it was so silent,'' Woods
said. ``It was almost eerie. Nobody was really asking for
autographs or clamoring for pictures. It was just real quiet. Even
on the range, guys were hitting and nobody was talking. It was just
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really knows how to react, because it was so sudden. It
was a shock to everybody. I feel almost like he's going to show up.
I just saw him the other day. It's hard to believe he's not going
to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' first realization that Stewart's death had hit home came
when he arrived at his Houston hotel room late Monday night. One of
the first things he saw was the pairings sheet for Tuesday
morning's pro-am.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's my name at 9 o'clock,'' Woods said. ``And there is an
open space right behind me. That was a rude awakening. You almost
think that it was a bad dream, a nightmare. But unfortunately, it
came true.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Woods realized during a difficult night's sleep and an
emotional trip around the Cypress Creek Course at Champions on
Tuesday, moving on is never easy to do in these circumstances. You
can't stop living. And you can't live in fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go ahead and do your job,'' Woods said. ``But when
you have a sudden change like we did with Payne, you can't put that
aside. You can't bury that in your head.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, I was walking down the fairway, and occasionally
I get a few flashes in my head of Payne and some of the memories I
have of him. Everyone is going to go through that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate enough to run into Stuie (Stuart Appleby), and
he said, `Well, he is in a place where Renay has just welcomed him.
And Renay is going to be there and take care of him, and he is
going to be OK.' That was pretty eye-opening right there. It put
everything in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby's wife, Renay, died in July 1998 in a freak traffic
accident outside a London train station.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he came close to losing his father in 1997, when Earl
Woods had to have emergency heart surgery. That experience is one
that has helped him through times like these.
</P>
<P>
   ``That puts things in perspective real quick,'' he said. ``My
father said to me: `Go out and play. Play a tournament. I want to
see you on TV. At least I will have something to look forward to
while I'm in the hospital bed.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of how you have to go on. And you have to move on.
You've got to come to peace within yourself and know he's in a
better place.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I just feel so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, golfers golf. In times of trouble, people tend
to ease their minds by doing what they do. Writers write. Musicians
pick up their instrument. And golfers go to the course. The four
hours spent between the ropes is the time when they can overcome
the depressing atmosphere. It's therapeutic, in a way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge blow to all of us because he was a part of our
lives,'' Woods said. ``It really is difficult to refer to him in
the past tense. That's the hardest thing for me right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the PGA Tour pros at Champions are expected to take the
opportunity Friday to go to Stewart's memorial service in Orlando,
Fla. But Woods indicated Tuesday that he will not attend the
memorial, although he said nothing definitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do everything on my own and away from everybody,'' Woods
said when asked how he would grieve for Stewart. ``I am more a
person that reflects on the positive memories I have had with that
person and reminisce over the great times we have had. I know that
from the deaths I've had in my family. You just have to understand
they're in a better place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no struggling where they are anymore. It's just
unfortunate that we are now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are at a place at which they are happy. They are
peaceful and looking over us. Maybe Payne in essence can be like a
guardian angel to all of us. But I will do it (his grieving) on my
own away from everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, he said, his feelings for Stewart will not change.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came out (as a pro), I watched some of the reports on
TV that he was a very difficult person at times to be around,''
Woods said. ``But I never found that to be the case. When I came
out, I guess he became more dedicated to his religion and it
changed his entire life. That's the Payne I knew. I knew Payne as a
carefree guy who was nice to everybody, open-hearted and loved to
share and talk. That is the Payne that I will always have inside of
me.''

 Andreessen Takes Wraps Off His Latest Startup  &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Web wunderkind Marc Andreessen reignited his entrepreneurial fires
yesterday when he officially unveiled a new  &LR; startup that will
provide technology and services to Internet companies.
<P>
   The venture, called Loudcloud Inc., is based in Menlo Park and
has about 20 employees, including several people who worked closely
with Andreessen at Netscape Communications Corp., as well as other
Internet veterans from Cisco, InfoSeek and Frontier GlobalCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen and his three co-founders, Ben Horowitz, Tim Howes
and Sik Rhee, are funding Loudcloud from their own pockets, but
analysts believe that the company soon will start courting outside
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of the management team alone will certainly
attract the attention of venture capitalists,'' said Dennis
Gaugahn, an analyst with AMR Research in Boston. ``But interest
will quickly wane if Loudcloud doesn't have anything under the
covers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been an eventful year for the 28-year-old Andreessen, who
first made worldwide headlines in 1994 when he co-founded Netscape
and developed the first commercially available Web browser.
Netscape was sold to America Online for $10 billion earlier this
year after it became clear that Andreessen and his troops had lost
the browser war to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen became AOL's chief technology officer but lasted in
that position for only six months. He left AOL in September but
continues to hold an ``advisory'' role with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers said Andreessen chafed under AOL's rigid
corporate environment and, as a devout technologist, he was not
well suited to AOL's marketing-driven culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a huge affinity for AOL,'' Andreessen said in an
interview yesterday. ``I left because I wanted to be an
entrepreneur again and get back into the startup world.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen and his Loudcloud co-founders were tight lipped about
details. But it's expected that the startup will provide
behind-the-scenes technology to help Internet companies get up and
running quickly and painlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce sites are becoming increasingly complex in terms of
the services, software and technology needed to run them,'' said
Andreessen. ``There is nothing out there that can help companies
run and maintain these sites without having to build huge technical
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers speculated that Loudcloud, through its own
technology and partnerships with existing software vendors, will
provide all the key components needed to run an e-business, such as
content management and customer support applications, and then host
those components on its own computer servers.
</P>
<P>
   Potential competitors could range from Oracle Corp. and IBM,
which are devising their own application-hosting strategies, to
Exodus Communications, which runs the data centers for many leading
Web outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see lots of new companies pop up to provide
hosted services and functions for e-business,'' said Christopher
Lochhead, chief marketing officer at Scient Corp., an Internet
services firm in San Francisco that also could be a potential rival
for Loudcloud.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen said he would reveal more details about Loudcloud's
business plans by early next year. He also expects the company will
have its first customers by that time.

 _ SF CHRON  
 S.F. Firm to Develop Properties at Toxic Sites  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Seeking out opportunities in nasty places, San Francisco's AMB
Property Corp. is teaming up with one of the world's largest
insurance firms to purchase, clean and develop sites nationwide
that are ``environmentally challenged'' by hazardous materials.
<P>
   It is the first time that a real estate investment trust, or
REIT, will take an active role in turning around contaminated
properties. REITs are business entities that invest in property,
mortgages or real estate-related securities. They have been popular
with many small investors.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the initiative also is noteworthy. AMB will commit
$50 million to the venture, as will AIG Global Real Estate
Investment Corp., a subsidiary of American International Group, the
country's largest underwriter of environmental and industrial
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies said they will focus on target &LR; contaminated
urban areas in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Atlanta,
Chicago and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``For quite some time, we have encountered properties that have
environmental challenges,'' said Blake Baird, AMB's chief
investment officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It occurred to us that if you can understand and bring
solutions to such environmental challenges, you can make
above-market returns.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the partners figure that they can make some cool
cash by developing sites that other people might not touch with a
10-foot pole.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture has been dubbed the Greenfield Investment
Alliance _ a cheerful spin on what the Environmental Protection
Agency calls ``brownfields,'' or sites that are on the skids
because of ``real or perceived environmental contamination.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird declined to discuss specific Bay Area properties that
could be acquired. But, he said, AMB, which will oversee the
day-to-day operations of the venture, prefers sites near ports and
airports, as well as along major highways near major population
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield is looking primarily for sites that can be used for
warehouses or as distribution centers, Baird said. He added that
the venture's partners are not as interested in the military bases
around the Bay Area now being converted for civilian use and known
to be dripping with toxic materials.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Bayview-Hunters Point area along the San
Francisco waterfront, where potentially lucrative land is tainted
by no fewer than 700 hazardous waste facilities, Baird said only,
``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he noted that AMB is spearheading a $37.5 million
overhaul of San Francisco's Pier 1 near the Ferry Building,
converting the ramshackle dock into prime downtown office space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything we can do to help reclaim the waterfront, we would be
very interested in doing,'' Baird said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McKone, a professor of environmental health sciences at the
University of California at Berkeley, said one of the tricks to
tackling contaminated land is having the resources and expertise to
deal with both regulatory hurdles and unforeseen developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always get surprises,'' he said. ``You get hot spots, and
that holds up all the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Alameda County officials put a halt to shipments
of dirt from Pacific Bell Park to a landfill in March after
unexpectedly high levels of lead were detected. The Giants are
still pushing to get the park open by April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For the other Greenfield partner, AIG of New York, such episodes
underline the importance of one key element that the insurance
giant is bringing to the Greenfield venture: a form of
environmental insurance known as the ``cleanup cost cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Boren, president of AIG Environmental, said this insurance
protects developers of contaminated sites from getting hammered by
unexpected expenses during mopping-up operations, thus reducing
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not for the faint of heart,'' he said. ``You have to
have all the pieces together.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kevin Fitzpatrick, president of AIG Global Real
Estate Investment, said AIG, as the leading underwriter of
environmental insurance, boasts a substantial file of contaminated
sites nationwide, as well as risk assessments relating to cleanup
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a great investment opportunity,'' he said.
``There are currently not a lot of people who want to invest in
brownfield properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hanson, the EPA's brownfields coordinator for California and
other Western states, said AIG's participation will clearly give
Greenfield an edge over would-be rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have an in-house environmental group that is rather
sophisticated,'' he said. ``They can analyze samples and come to
their own conclusions without relying on the opinions of others.''
</P>
<P>
   That advantage may be crucial in evaluating investments that
could run well over $25 million apiece. As AMB's Baird put it, ``I
haven't seen any other ventures doing this at this scale.''

 _ SF CHRON   Ways for Small Firms To Reduce Tax Bite 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: With just two months to go until the end of the year, what are
some of the strategies businesses can adopt to minimize taxes?
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; A: Two of the top ways are to set up retirement plans for
yourself and your employees if you don't already have them, and
take advantage of the $19,000 tax deduction for the purchase of new
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a company pension plan has two benefits, according to
Robert Caplan of Caplan &AMP; Solon CPAs in Foster City. It defers
income for the employer and employees. And in a tight job market
like today's, it gives your company a competitive edge in
attracting and retaining talent.
</P>
<P>
   Pension plans can get complicated, but here are the main choices
beyond the individual retirement account, in which employees can
contribute up to $2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   _401(k) plans cost $1,000 to $3,000 to set up, according to
Caplan, and allow employees to contribute up to $10,000 a year to a
tax-deferred account. Employers can contribute nothing or match a
percentage of the employee's own contribution.
</P>
<P>
   _SIMPLE Plans, which stands for Savings Incentive Match Plans
for Employees, allow employee contributions of up to $6,000 a year.
They do not involve as much paperwork or the complicated rules of a
401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   _Simplified Employee Pensions (or SEPs) are basically a group of
IRAs in which the employer makes contributions on behalf of
employees. Caplan often recommends SEPs for small businesses
because they involve virtually no paperwork, the money is deposited
into an account in the name of the plan member and the plan can be
set up after the end of the calendar year but before you file your
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   As much as 13 percent of an employer's income and 15 percent of
employees' income, up to $24,000, can be put annually in a
tax-deferred SEP. Caplan notes that during the first two years of
employment, an employee may not be eligible for a SEP contribution.
For a firm with high turnover, a large percentage of the SEP
contributions therefore may be allocated to the owners.
</P>
<P>
   _Keogh Plans allow businesses to defer as much as $30,000 of
wages or earnings of employees and owners from taxes. Unlike an
SEP, there are various levels of contributions up to 25 percent of
compensation. However, Keogh Plans can involve both a lot of
paperwork and hiring a plan administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Determing which retirement plan is best differs from business to
business. The important factors are the overall profitability,
employees' compensation and years of service, the generosity of the
owner, and the competitive landscape. For more information, you
might call a certified public accountant or visit the California
Society of CPAs Web site (www.calcpa.org). Internal Revenue Service
Publications 560 and 590 also have information on pension plans
(www.irs.gov).
</P>
<P>
   Another deduction is the $19,000 annual exclusion from federal
and California taxation for equipment purchases. If you haven't
spent that much on computer gear, furniture or other equipment for
your business this year but are considering such purchases in 2000,
Caplan says you might want to move up your buying plans.
</P>
<P>
   Most any business, from sole proprietorship to a ``C'' or
regular corporation, can write off up to $19,000 in equipment
purchases directly from their income this year. Next year, the
allowance rises to $20,000. Note, you can use the deduction only to
offset income. In other words, you can't use it to create a loss.
Also, autos purchased for business use don't count toward the
annual exclusion; they must be depreciated over several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The equipment-purchase deduction is one of my first
suggestions for reducing taxes,'' says Caplan. Equipment purchases
over $19,000 typically can be depreciated over five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Internet Hit Parade
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are looking for financing for an Internet company and
wonder how venture capitalists determine the value of hits (page
views). What kind of site activity do they look for?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Alas, there are no standard conversion tables that say, for
example, your company is worth $5 million if your Web site gets
50,000 hits a day.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that not all hits or consumers are
created equal. Michael Linnert, partner of Menlo Park VC firm
Technology Crossover Ventures, says advertisers will pay ``a ton of
money'' to get access to potential small-business customers but
little for 5- to 15-year-olds, because kids ``don't pull out their
wallets.''
</P>
<P>
   VCs spend a lot of time trying to figure out how online ventures
will turn a customer relationship into revenue. The demographics of
your target customer make a huge difference in ad rates, but as a
rule of thumb, Linnert says, advertisers are unlikely to be
interested unless your site attracts 1 million ``unique'' users a
month. That means you must have 1 million individuals who visit
your site once rather than one individual who visits 1 million
times.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways to make money from your hits. Advertising
rates are based on per-thousand page views. Linnert says e-commerce
often is a better way to make money than banner ads, but he looks
for real profits over time. ``Selling products at cost or below
cost doesn't generate gross margins,'' he notes.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of e-commerce companies say they price products below cost
to attract customers and gain market share, and eventually, they
expect to raise prices. But Linnert worries that these companies
could flop if they mainly attract ``price surfers'' who have no
brand loyalty and simply will jump to another low-price site.

GERMAN BANK FORCES OUT SEVERAL TOP EXECUTIVES DUE TO REAL ESTATE
SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Rocked by a real estate scandal that has
cost it more than $2 billion, Hypovereinsbank AG in Munich forced
out several top executives Tuesday in an attempt to put an end to
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The purge capped an internal battle that had poisoned the
atmosphere at Hypovereinsbank, Germany's second-largest bank, ever
since it was created in 1998 through the merger of two Bavarian
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent departure was Eberhard Martini, who had been
chief executive of the Bayerische Hypo-Bank and was until Tuesday a
member of the combined bank's supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
   But the purge also includes all the other members of the bank's
management board who had come over from Hypo-Bank after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted thankfully. Shares of Hypovereinsbank, which
had lost half their value since the merger, rose 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a huge portfolio of soured real estate loans at the
former Hypo-Bank. The bad loans, many for nearly worthless
apartment projects in eastern Germany, only surfaced after
Hypo-Bank merged with its Bavarian rival, Bayerische Vereinsbank.
</P>
<P>
   Albrecht Schmidt, who became chairman of Hypovereinsbank,
shocked investors by setting aside 3.5 billion marks, about $1.9
billion, a few weeks after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year now, the bank has been torn by angry
charges between executives of the two predecessor banks. Schmidt,
who came from Vereinsbank, argued that Martini should have
recognized the problems much earlier and accounted for them
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Martini and his supporters insisted that the problems were
wildly exaggerated and merely being used as a power play to force
them from office.
</P>
<P>
   But an independent audit released last weekend validated
Schmidt's decision and excoriated Hypo-Bank for not recognizing the
bad loans back in 1997. The auditors concluded that Hypo-Bank's
official results for 1997 were simply not valid.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the bank actually expanded its loan-loss provisions
Tuesday, adding another $1 billion to account for other potential
problems in the $12 billion real estate portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's actions leave Schmidt and his followers from
Vereinsbank in control.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Munich and government regulators are continuing
with their own investigations.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear how long it will take Schmidt to untangle the
whole problem or put an end to the bad blood that has strained
relations inside the bank for so long.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the two Bavarian banks announced their plans for a
merger, the deal seemed like a clear winner. The two banks had a
powerful presence across Bavaria, Germany's biggest state. In sharp
contrast to Deutsche Bank, which wants to be a global power, the
Bavarian banks wanted to emulate big regional banks in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Viermetz, chairman of Hypovereinsbank's supervisory board,
expressed hope that the bank could finally return to something like
normality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that this can end the discussions which have
been damaging for the bank and clear matters up,'' Viermetz said.

 Silicon Valley Startups Often Have to Shift Business Plans
to  Succeed 
 &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Who said consistency and staying the course is a virtue? To become
successful in business, especially in the fast-paced high-tech
sphere, entrepreneurs often have to change directions, and fast.
<P>
   Many Bay Area startups have veered sharply for a variety of
reasons: The envisioned market failed to develop. Competitors got
to market first. The technology got eclipsed by something better or
cheaper. Investors turned their noses up and their thumbs down.
Entrepreneurs had a new brainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they start, most companies have an idea and a perceived
market but they don't know what is going to catch on,'' said
Richard Kramlich, general partner of the venture capital firm New
Enterprise Associates in Menlo Park. ``After they get established,
many good companies warp or morph to meet real market demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Switching gears is not a new business phenomenon. But it's
happening more as product cycles grow shorter, competition gets
more intense and having worked for a failed company _ especially in
Silicon Valley _ has come to be regarded as a badge of honor rather
than a black mark.
</P>
<P>
   Among the local enterprises that have learned to zig instead of
zag is Zing.com.
</P>
<P>
   The company started out in 1997 with the name Streamix and
technology that presented ads and multimedia presentations to
Internet users while they waited to download information from a Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   The software was nifty. It could detect when a modem was not
transferring data and use that time to load images and sound that
could be displayed during the seconds it might take to download the
next page.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, the company had about a half-million users, but
venture capitalists balked at financing a company that was banking
on the Internet remaining slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though 90 percent of home PCs are connected by relatively
slow modems and will be for years, VCs didn't want to go against
all the money they had betting that the Web would be fast,'' said
Zing.com chief executive Mark Platshon.
</P>
<P>
   So a year ago, he and company founder and Chief Technology
Officer Kap Shin took a walk in San Francisco's Yerba Buena Park to
discuss ways to revamp the company. With the convergence of digital
cameras and increasingly cheap data storage, they settled on an
online photography business.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco startup, renamed Zing, provides a free site
where people can store their digital photos.
</P>
<P>
   Zing attracted $14 million a couple months ago from venture
capital firms including Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers. At the
time, Kleiner Perkins partner John Doerr said Zing was ``perfectly
positioned to be the online photography portal'' where millions of
consumers store and share their pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Since it unveiled www.zing.com in May, Zing has become one of
the 500 most-visited Web sites. It also is generating revenues from
sponsors, advertisers and from sales of personal photos printed on
products ranging from mugs to shortbread biscuits to Christmas tree
ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Garage.com of Palo Alto is another company that shelved its
initial business plan.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, former Apple Computer evangelist Guy Kawasaki
was talking to Rich Karlgaard, now publisher of Forbes magazine,
about Boomcities.com. The idea was to create an
advertising-supported Web site that would give business people
information on the world's major cities, the same way CitySearch
and Sidewalk provide community news to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The two asked Craig Johnson at Venture Law Group to be their
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craig told us this was a dumb idea because the
advertising/content/click-through model wasn't working,'' Kawasaki
recalled. ``Instead, he told us to focus on helping angel investors
find tech startups to invest in, and tech startups to find great
angel investors.'' And Garage.com was born as a matchmaking service
for entrepreneurs and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Chan, 26, already has made two major changes in
direction since graduating from Stanford University two years ago.
After dabbling with the idea of posting students' report cards
online, he decided to establish Activeschool.net, an Internet
portal where school teachers could post class material, students
could find homework assignments, and parents could monitor their
children's progress and activities.
</P>
<P>
   Chan explored the concept with technologically savvy Gunn High
School in Palo Alto and received a favorable response. But then he
and colleagues went to several educational conferences and
discovered that most schools were having problems simply sharing
computers and getting on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a painful discovery,'' said Chan.
</P>
<P>
   Although several other companies, including EduLink and
GradeNet, are pursuing the same idea, Chan veered off. His new San
Jose company, called Everyone.net, adds e-mail, search engine and
community bulletin board services to Web sites so that their
visitors don't have to go to outside services like Hotmail or
Yahoo. Singer Mariah Carey is using Everyone.net to let her fans
sign up for e-mail service at www.MariahCarey.org.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone.net has received financing from angel investors and
Venture Frogs, a new San Francisco investment fund and incubator
for young high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a business model doesn't work or the market isn't
there,'' said Venture Frogs partner Tony Hsieh, 25. ``That's why
it's important to invest in smart, motivated people who will figure
out how to make a modification or U-turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Venture Frogs invested in another Internet startup that changed
course. Entango of San Jose is developing online fund-raising tools
for nonprofit organizations, including several chapters of the
American Red Cross and International Planned Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Entango CEO Richard Cox, a 30-year-old former
Intel engineer, started a Web consulting company called Terret with
another Intel veteran. Counseling others was lucrative, Cox said,
but ``we wanted to develop our own product or service.''
</P>
<P>
   During a consulting project for a nonprofit, it dawned on Cox
that many charitable organizations have Web sites but few were able
to e-mail supporters or securely raise money online. Entango aims
to fill this niche. The company does not charge nonprofits any
set-up or retainer fees but receives 3 to 7 percent of funds they
raise online.

 S.F. Voters vs. ATMs _ Surcharge Ban on Ballot  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
It's happened to all of us. You need cash, you're in a hurry, so
you make a beeline to the nearest ATM, even though it's not your
own bank's. Wham! You're hit with $3.50 in fees.
<P>
   Of all the pesky charges consumers run into these days, few seem
to raise more hackles than that little bit extra banks slap on
noncustomers for using their ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, San Francisco voters will get a chance to show how
they feel about ATM fees. Proposition F, the San Francisco ATM Fee
Initiative, would ban financial institutions from levying separate
charges on noncustomers who use their ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot measure has touched off a noisy squabble between
consumer activists who accuse banks of fee gouging and financial
institutions that view the charges as a fair price for the
convenience of universal ATM access.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a jihad against big banks,`` said Greg
Wilhelm, who heads government relations for the California Bankers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is only one part of the total fees consumers pay to use
outside cash machines.
</P>
<P>
   Most banks, thrifts and credit unions let their customers use
their own ATMs free of charge. But they charge their customers a
nominal sum to use machines that belong to other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America and Wells Fargo, the state's two biggest banks,
hit their customers for $2 when they use outside ATMs. Proposition
F would not affect these so-called foreign ATM fees.
</P>
<P>
   What would be banned are ATM surcharges, which financial
institutions levy on noncustomers for using their cash machines.
BofA and Wells Fargo, for example, collect $1.50 every time a
noncustomer withdraws money from one of their ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would not eliminate surcharges at cash machines that
are not owned by banks, such as those in some gas stations and
convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1996 that bank ATM surcharges became common.
That is when the major ATM switching networks, Visa's Plus and
MasterCard's Cirrus, began allowing their members to impose the
fees.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, the latest period for which figures are available,
about 78 percent of banks nationwide surcharged noncustomer ATM
users, according to the Federal Reserve. That was up from 60
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Because the surcharges are relatively new, and because they
appear immediately on the ATM receipt, not on a bank statement
weeks later, they have gotten under the skin of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really ticks me off,'' said Kelly Krawchuk, a 30-year-old
San Francisco resident who ``six to eight times a month'' uses ATMs
that do not belong to her bank, Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it when I'm desperate and need the money,'' said
Krawchuk, a loss-prevention trainer at Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing public ire, consumer groups and public officials have
begun campaigns to prohibit ATM surcharges across the country.
Banking authorities in Iowa and Connecticut, the Santa Monica City
Council and the U.S Defense Department, among other official
bodies, have enacted or proposed bans in facilities under their
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Fee critics argue that the surcharge represents a double charge
because banks already collect revenue when noncustomers use their
ATMs. And they say that surcharges harm small banks because they
give consumers an incentive to bank with large institutions that
have thousands of cash machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think all bank fees should be outlawed, but the
surcharge is unique,'' said Jon Golinger, consumer program director
of California Public Interest Research Group, a co-sponsor of
Proposition F.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, banks view the surcharges as reasonable
compensation for the money they have laid out to install ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built our ATM network for our customers,'' said BofA
spokesman Harvey Radin. ``We feel we ought to be able to charge a
nominal fee for people who want the convenience of using our ATMs
but choose not to do business with us.''
</P>
<P>
   And while ATM surcharges may make it more difficult for little
banks to compete with the BofAs and Wells Fargos of the world, the
small fry have lined up beside their bigger brethren to fight legal
bans. Community bank worries about competition are outweighed by
their loathing of government interference.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to keep customers, some small banks reimburse
customers for ATM surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, many bankers are scornful of a public that demands
the convenience of an ATM on evry corner, but objects to paying for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides of the debate have been guilty of overblown rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   For example, banks insist that the surcharges do not represent a
double charge. In fact, every time a customer uses another bank's
ATM, the consumer's own bank pays the ATM owner 40 to 50 cents _
whether or not the consumer's bank charges the customer a foreign
ATM fee. So the surcharge, levied by the ATM owner, represents a
second source of income.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, consumer groups say that ATMs are such huge money
makers that banks will keep their networks intact even if
surcharges are banned.
</P>
<P>
   ATMs were originally put up outside bank branches as a cheaper
alternative to live tellers. But since surcharging became common,
the number of cash machines in the United States has jumped from
about 139,000 in 1996 to 227,000 by 1999, according to the trade
newsletter Bank Network News.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the growth has come at nonbank locations such as
airports, malls and sports arenas. Industry experts say that if
surcharges were banned and ATMs could no longer pay for themselves,
banks might remove many machines from such off-site locations.
However, independently owned ATMs, which could continue to levy
surcharges, would probably remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will they all get yanked out? No, but some machines may get
(removed),'' said John McAllister, an executive with Benton
International, a Torrance consulting firm that specializes in
electronic funds transfers.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. If Proposition F passes, bankers will file
suit to block it. ``This will be challenged in court,'' said
Wilhelm, the California Bankers Association lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   The association says that cities cannot legally ban surcharges
by nationally chartered banks such as BofA and Wells Fargo. Such
banks are subject only to federal regulation, the association
maintains.
</P>
<P>
   The legal precedents are unclear. ``It's a matter that has not
yet squarely been addressed,`` said Boston banking lawyer Lynne
Barr.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Proposition F is not likely to be decided by calm
consideration of the pros and cons.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters seem angry at the growing number of nuisance fees
charged not just by banks, but by all kinds of businesses, from
telephone and cable television companies to ticketing agencies. The
San Francisco ATM measure is giving them a chance to strike back.
</P>
<P>
   As Jonathan Josephs, a 42-year-old marketing executive, put it:
``I'm going to vote against the dinging.``

NOT MUCH DEPTH OF EXPERIENCE AT UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA coach Bob Toledo did not alter the starting
lineup following the 48-point loss at Oregon State, but two subtle
shifts in the depth chart have exacerbated the Bruins' greatest
deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo demoted senior linebacker Ali Abdul Azziz and senior
safety Eric Whitfield from second to third string this week _
leaving the inexperienced Bruins younger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 44 players on the depth chart, only eight are seniors. In
comparison, Saturday's opponent, Arizona, has 18 seniors on its
two-deep. While the discrepancy doesn't guarantee trouble for UCLA,
a four-point underdog, it's far from reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience plays a huge role in being able to execute in tough
situations, like when it's third-and-12 and you have to keep the
drive alive to win the game,'' Bruins senior fullback Durell Price
said. ``It's like growing pains. That's what we've been going
through for the last month.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has nine juniors, 15 sophomores and 12 freshmen on the
depth chart. Nowhere is the inexperience more apparent than the
secondary, where freshmen and sophomores hold six of eight spots.
(The Bruins started three freshmen in the secondary against Oregon
State.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the guys haven't played in many Pac-10 games and
they're still learning,'' senior cornerback Ryan Roques said. ``But
it's not like the seniors haven't made many mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have played a major role in the youth movement: two
seniors, defensive end Travor Turner (knee) and cornerback Jason
Bell (heel), are out for the year, and a third, receiver Danny
Farmer, is questionable th because of a strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   __ Less stress: Although disappointed, freshman quarterback Cory
Paus did not blame himself completely for the Bruins' poor
production against Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still hard on myself, but I'm just taking a better
outlook,'' Paus said. ``I realize we have to fix more than just me
throwing the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Switching gears: From Oregon State's passing attack to
Arizona's powerful running game, not a week passes without a major
challenge for UCLA's young, porous defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats lead the Pac-10 in rushing (219 yards per game),
and UCLA is last in stopping the run (183 yards per game).
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Trung Canidate has rushed for 500 yards in his last
three games and quarterbacks Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins are
excellent runners, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canidate's really good and the quarterbacks scare the dickens
out of me,'' Toledo said. ``You see them going 50 or 60 yards.
They're real running threats.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Bright spots: There weren't many in the Oregon State game,
but Toledo mentioned four: linebacker Ryan Nece (10 tackles), who
played his best of the season; defensive tackle Pete Holland;
center Troy Danoff; and Roques.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were also impressed with redshirt freshman cornerback
Paul Nelson, a converted receiver who started for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   __ Stat of the week: With myriad injuries and 13 freshmen
redshirting, Toledo struggled to find 60 players (the league
maximum) for the travel squad to Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   He resolved the problem by taking eight walk-ons: tailback Mike
Vanis; fullback Adam Geitner; receivers Devon Reese and Ryan
Wilkins; defensive tackle Kory Lombard; safety John Hall; kicker
Chris Griffith; and long snapper Jeff Grau.

 _ SF CHRON   Microsoft, Intel Added to Dow Jones Industrial Average 
 &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a breakthrough for both high technology and the Nasdaq stock
market, software colossus Microsoft Corp. and giant chipmaker Intel
Corp. will be added to the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average.
<P>
   Microsoft, Santa Clara-based Intel and two other companies _
retailer Home Depot, which caters to do-it-yourselfers, and SBC
Communications, the parent of Pacific Bell _ will be included among
the 30 Dow components on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Four industrial companies are being yanked to make room for the
newcomers. They include Chevron, the San Francisco oil giant;
Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber; retailer Sears, Roebuck; and Union Carbide,
the chemical manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Intel will become the first Nasdaq-traded stocks
ever included in the Dow. That prompted a celebratory response
yesterday from Nasdaq Chairman Frank Zarb.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inclusion of these two Nasdaq companies makes the Dow more
reflective of today's global economy,'' Zarb said. declared. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The changes in the Dow _ the first since March 1997 _ were
announced yesterday by the editors of the Wall Street Journal, the
flagship Dow Jones &AMP; Co. publication.
</P>
<P>
   Originating with 12 stocks in 1896 _ and expanded to 30 in 1928
_ the venerable Dow average is the market indicator most widely
followed by the general public.
</P>
<P>
   However, because the Dow consists of only 30 stocks, most
professional money managers prefer to use the much broader-based
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index as their principal benchmark. Each of
the Dow stocks is also included in the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers suggested yesterday that considering the great
size and high visibility of Microsoft and Intel, their addition to
the Dow seems overdue.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow had fallen ``behind the times,'' said Richard Moroney,
co-manager of the Strong Dow 30 Value Fund, which invests primarily
in the Dow industrials. He said the change ``will broaden the
interest in the Dow average and make it a better-performing
index.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash., co-founded by multibillionaire &LR; 
 &LR; Bill Gates, ranks first among all companies in total market value
_ the number of shares outstanding times the stock price _ at $475
billion. General Electric, already a Dow component, ranks second at
$412 billion. Intel, the largest chipmaker, ranks third with a
market value of $246 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Microsoft and Intel is likely to make the Dow
more volatile. Both stocks tend to fluctuate more widely from day
to day than the companies that are being removed.
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft will be the most valuable company in the Dow,
it won't have the greatest effect on the average.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Dow is price-weighted _ meaning that it is
calculated by adding the prices of all 30 stocks, then dividing by
a denominator that changes periodically. The current denominator is
0.2.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the highest-price stock has the biggest effect on
the Dow. That distinction is currently claimed by American Express,
which closed yesterday at $144.75. Of the companies that will
remain in the Dow, seven are pricier than Microsoft, which closed
at $92.38 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the S&AMP;P 500 is capitalization-weighted: The
companies with the highest market value have the greatest impact.
Microsoft, as the most valuable company, accounts for about 4.5
percent of that index's value.
</P>
<P>
   Before yesterday's action, high-tech was represented in the Dow
only by IBM and Palo Alto-based Hewlett-Packard, which was added in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate America is changing,'' said Buck Newsome, managing
director at Cincinnati-based Cambridge Financial Group Inc. ``Years
ago, it was a completely different flavor, but now everything is
tech-driven; that is what is being reflected.''
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones spokesman Dick Tofel declined to explain the rationale
for any of the changes. ``Our overall philosophy is to have an
index broadly reflective of the U.S. economy and U.S. markets,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tofel said the Journal editors decided to re-examine the Dow
list because some of the companies were undergoing significant
changes.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Exxon _ the nation's largest oil company and the
only one in the Dow average apart from Chevron _ is buying its
enormous, longtime rival Mobil, which is not a Dow component. The
unstated implication is that Exxon plus Mobil equals enough oil in
the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Tofel also pointed out that Union Carbide is merging with a big
non-Dow company, Dow Chemical _ no relation to Dow Jones. However,
he declined to say why that would cause the Journal editors to oust
Union Carbide.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Waldrop, a spokesman for Intel, said: ``Obviously, we're
pleased to be added to the Dow Jones index.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Golon, a spokeswoman for Chevron _ which had been among the
Dow stocks since 1930 _ seemed less pleased. She said her company's
management was ``surprised by the unexpected turn of events.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``We don't see this as having any impact on the value
of Chevron, nor on our strong growth opportunities.''

RELEASE HEARTENS FOES OF SECRET EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)   (af)  
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ When the guards came to his cell on Monday night,
he held out his arms for the manacles as usual.
</P>
<P>
   But when he heard the whispered words ``Pack up'' and was led
out of the Hudson County Correctional Center to the cold, empty
street, Hany Kiareldeen realized that his long, dark odyssey
through the immigration system was over.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen, 31, a Palestinian immigrant, was released Monday
night after a 19-month sojourn in two New Jersey jails. He had been
detained on the basis of secret evidence alleging that he had links
to terrorists, including one of the men convicted in the 1993 World
Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A series of immigration court and federal court rulings had
found that the evidence was unreliable and that its use was
unconstitutional, and on Monday the Immigration and Naturalization
Service decided to stop fighting judges' orders that Kiareldeen be
freed.
</P>
<P>
   His release and the court rulings have given hope to supporters
of some 20 other people of Arab descent being held on secret
evidence from anonymous sources that the immigration agency will
finally have to scrap a practice it has used since the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen also hopes for such a big change, but Tuesday,
reeling from the legal ordeal that at first seemed destined to end
in his deportation, he was still trying to make sense of the
personal and political drama that has left his life in tatters but
his faith in justice intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried a lot while in prison, because I was almost
sure that this was how it should end up, because I was sure justice
would win out,'' he said in an interview in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   He then turned somber when asked about the government's
allegations, the evidence for which he was never allowed to see,
except for sketchy summaries. He and his lawyer have asserted that
the charges _ including accusations that he threatened the life of
Attorney General Janet Reno _ were based on the statements of an
embittered former wife who talked to the Federal Bureau of
Investigations Joint Terrorism Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has damaged me a lot and it has damaged some
relationships,'' said Kiareldeen, who has lived in the United
States since 1990 and who worked in an electronics store before he
was jailed. ``I have to reconstruct my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bittersweet'' was how some immigrant advocates and
Arab-American groups described the release of Kiareldeen, as they
took note of the continued detention of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm hoping this case will initiate the government's taking
a closer look at what they use as secret evidence, and becoming a
lot more judicious in light of the loss in this case at so many
administrative and judicial levels,'' said Kit Gage, national
coordinator of the National Coalition to Protect Political Freedom,
a coalition of advocacy groups and ethnic and civil rights groups
that came together to oppose the use of secret evidence and other
immigration law provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Aly R. Abuzaakouk, the executive director of the American Muslim
Council, while applauding the release of Kiareldeen, said he
believed it would not, on its own, force the immigration agency to
rethink its use of the classified evidence to detain, deport,
exclude and deny asylum to immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   He said the only thing that would end those practices and repair
the damage they had done to Arab-Americans and Muslims would be the
passage of a bill now before Congress that would outlaw the use of
secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in our community are aware of secret evidence, and it
is having a chilling effect on their expressing themselves on
issues,'' Abuzaakouk said. ``It has created an intimidating factor,
and I don't think INS will pull back on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Mueller, a spokesman for the the immigration service,
said the agency's decision to release Kiareldeen did not mean that
it would abandon the use of secret evidence altogether. He said the
service had concluded, as had other units in the Justice Department
that deal with immigration cases, that the evidence against
Kiareldeen was not credible and had been effectively rebutted by
his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., said he was
pursuing discussions with the Justice Department about
``administrative changes'' in the use of secret evidence. But Rep.
David E. Bonior, D-Mich., and the prime sponsor of the Secret
Evidence Repeal Act of 1999, said the only effective solution would
be to eradicate the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hany's Kiareldeen's release will be a hollow victory unless we
permanently discard this law,'' he said Tuesday in an interview,
referring to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act as
well as the Immigration Reform Act, both of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen said he had dreamed about being released every night
during his incarceration, but he never thought it would come
unheralded and almost ignominiously, near midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be in daylight with all my family around
and with an apology from the INS,'' he said, still slightly dazed.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that he was not so bitter about his experience that
he would abandon his plans to seek American citizenship. And while
he was not converted to political activism by his time in
detention, he does plan to visit Washington this week to appear at
a press conference with Bonior in support of his bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   After his release, 19 months to the day from when he was
arrested, Kiareldeen joined one of his lawyers, Regis Fernandez,
his brother, his sister-in-law, Lily, and a friend for a noisy
celebration in the parking lot of the Hudson County jail, complete
with loud Arab music, a bottle of his favorite beer, Corona, and
much laughing and hugging. Then it was off to his brother's house
for the first nonprison food, or Arab food, he has had in a year
and half: grape leaves stuffed with rice and chicken.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Tuesday with Kiareldeen, his lawyers _
David Cole, Houieda Saad and Fernandez _ recounted how their first
victory in the case came in April, when an immigration judge,
Daniel Meisner, upheld their client's contention that he was
eligible for a green card. Meisner, an administrative law judge,
had himself viewed the secret evidence in its entirety and found it
unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   Working with sketchy summaries of that same secret evidence
against their client, Ms. Saad said they were able to mount a
defense built on documents, rent checks, telephone records and
testimony. Among other things, they said, they proved that
Kiareldeen was not politically active or an observant Muslim, as
those convicted in the bombings were, and even frequented go-go
bars when he was single. This became known, Fernandez said
jokingly, as ``the go-go bar defense.''
</P>
<P>
   They also proved to the judge's satisfaction that Kiareldeen did
not live where the secret evidence said he lived when he was said
to have met with one of the World Trade Center bombers, and that he
had none of the extensive telephone contacts with the conspirators
that had been such key evidence in the government's successful
prosecution of the bombing conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, a volunteer lawyer with the Center for Constitutional
Rights and a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said
that what turned the tide for Kiareldeen was the immigration board
rulings _ upheld on appeal to the Board of Immigration appeals _
and a federal district court ruling last week. In the decision,
Judge William H. Walls said that detention on the basis of secret
evidence was a violation of due process.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling, the first ever to find the detention practice
unconstitutional, broke with several rulings in the 1950s that
seemed to justify the use of such evidence. Cole said Walls had
followed the reasoning of several more recent cases, which had
outlawed the use of secret evidence in other types of immigration
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   He applauded the INS commissioner, Doris Meissner, for not
continuing to pursue appeals. But he said that he first had to
applaud Kiareldeen himself for fighting the use of secret evidence
rather than submitting to deportation, as had so many other
immigrants.

<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ Bullet holes and boarded-up windows remain
in this poverty-stricken area of west Kingston as a testament to
the days of the 1970s and 1980s when gunmen from rival political
parties exchanged wild bursts of gunfire on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The battles between the adjoining communities of Tivoli Gardens
and Rema got so fierce that one local congregation fled its church.
On one block in Rema, nothing remains but thick clumps of weeds
that smother the concrete foundations where tiny houses once stood.
</P>
<P>
   Now the people of Rema are taking back their community. Inside a
long-abandoned schoolhouse, a half-dozen dreadlocked men busied
themselves on a recent day building bookcases, checking wires and
installing sinks for a library and study center.
</P>
<P>
   Peace has come to Rema, not so much imposed from the outside,
but warily worked out by its own residents in a truce with Tivoli
Gardens last year.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Jamaica's two main political parties supported a
violent local patronage system in this group of poor communities in
the Trenchtown area of Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   The parties provided arms, money and favors to local toughs, who
fought street battles in the name of politics. Some of them later
abandoned politics and turned to gang warfare over drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But now the people here are rebuffing the alliances that turned
their neighborhoods into war zones. They have come to realize that
the combat did nothing but wreck their neighborhoods and lives.
With jobs, education and decent housing so scarce, they have more
important battles to wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need many things, and if we as elders had not come
together, we would not see any healing,'' said Michael Smith, 43,
the chairman of the Trenchtown Development Association. ``If our
elders had done that before, our work would be easier for us. But
the politicians just used Trenchtown.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes in Rema and other low-income neighborhoods reflect a
national dissatisfaction with the tactics of the rival Jamaican
Labor Party and People's National Party. In recent elections fewer
and fewer voters have turned out at the polls to support either
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people in the inner city say they're sick and tired of
the politics and they will not let themselves be used by the
political process that created them,'' said the Rev. Al Miller,
leader of a religious coalition that recently declared a national
day of repentance for violence and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met with a number of leaders in the community,'' he said,
``including some of the gunmen, and they all say they're tired of
it. Not only did it kill off a lot of them, but there's no future
for their children. They realized who benefited from the
divisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The choices in Rema became stark a few years ago. Feuding local
leaders finally realized that their conflicts were hurting the
people whose interests they said they were representing. Leah
Watson, 42, a resident of Rema, described those times: ``They had
people killed. We had people killed. We can't continue to live like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Raphael Smith, the brother of Michael Smith, the leader of the
Trenchtown Development Association, was among the Rema leaders who
decided that it was time to broker a peace. He went on to support
various neighborhood projects, making contacts with friends and
business owners to encourage their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our community had been under siege for so long,'' said Michael
Smith. ``He said enough is enough and became a man on a mission.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Raphael Smith died violently this year _ killed on a street in
London, where he had been working. But his friends and family say
they will not seek retribution, because they are committed to
maintaining the peace in Rema.
</P>
<P>
   Percy Hamilton is another Rema resident who has turned his
efforts to rebuilding. He has been helping out at Operation
Restoration, a church-run community group that took over an
abandoned building that was being used as an outhouse and turned it
into a school and community center. It has since expanded to
another building, and construction has begun on a third.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers check on children when they are absent, and the
school has added computer courses and classes in dressmaking for
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with unemployment hovering at 60 percent and few jobs
available even for those with skills, it can be difficult to
persuade some people to get training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen other youths who are talented and have the
potential to be somebody turn out to be nothing,'' Hamilton said.
``You have two or three kids, you're unemployed. So they turn to
things that are no good, and a man may go somewhere and steal.''
</P>
<P>
   That is just one of the obstacles to sustaining the peace,
especially in communities where the truce is more tenuous. In
Grants Pan, a collection of neighborhoods nestled at the foot of
the hills that overlook Kingston, some local dons continue to fight
over drug turf, even though a peace treaty is supposedly in effect.
</P>
<P>
   At one point a local day care center closed because of the gun
battles, and most tenants moved out of a shopping center. Staff
members at a community education program say the gang leaders have
used implied threats to block the efforts or have demanded that
their cronies get jobs or benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them, `If you're the big godfather, why would you want
to oppose the services people need?''' said Keith Russell Brown,
who directs the program for the Stella Maris Foundation. ``The dons
have a desire to keep the status quo for power and control. Skilled
people with income don't need to look to the don for a handout.''
</P>
<P>
   Rema leaders contend that these days, the police are the biggest
obstacle to progress, acting as if the neighborhood were still
under siege. ``We got wise and we said we don't want terror tactics
_ we want to build our community,'' said Donovan English, a local
resident.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials, while acknowledging some past uses of
excessive force, questioned the sincerity of some of the peace
efforts, saying the complaints might have come from people who had
gotten used to depending on the dons and wanted them left alone.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups are serving as go-betweens in an effort to
improve relations between residents and the police. Trevor Munroe,
a political scientist at the University of the West Indies, helped
bring about one meeting between law enforcement officials and
neighborhood youths. And he helped plan a recent weekend conference
with residents from various neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most positive thing I see in this country are the peace
processes in the inner city,'' he said. ``There is no guarantee it
will be sustained, but it promises well for a period of time _
which could allow for the possibility of rehabilitation and inner
city development.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rema, residents said, what they have so far is a glimmer of
hope. They point to a local park where children put on a talent
show with the help of a former gang leader who is now trying to
become a force for good. Some are even talking about capitalizing
on Trenchtown's fame as home and muse to the reggae star Bob Marley
and turning it into a tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   Skip, an unemployed young man, rode his bicycle through the
streets on a recent day, past a wall with graffiti that said both
``Rema One Love'' and ``Police Brutalize Rema Youth Day by Day.''
He said he hoped that the community leaders would succeed _ that
they could do no worse then the politicians who once wooed him and
his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would come around with free beer and sweet talk,'' he
said. ``But it was only cheap talk.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the worn-out buildings, the bullet holes, the
broken sidewalks. At least some of his own were now trying to fix
up what they could.
</P>
<P>
   But he wondered if they would ever have a real chance at a
normal neighborhood life. ``They'll always need a jungle, so they
can say, `That's a bad guy, that's a bad neighborhood,''' he said.
``And them created this.''  &QL;

DIVORCE STIGMA CITED IN RESIGNATION OF ANCHORWOMAN IN JAPAN  
(DW/JS)
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Since her resignation from Japan's equivalent of the
``Today'' show this month, the private life of one of the country's
most popular television personalities has become one of its most
talked about off-screen dramas.
</P>
<P>
   The furor centers on the star, Ayumi Kuroda, and the closely
held secret of her divorce two years ago from her high-school
sweetheart, a story that broke in the gossip pages of a Tokyo
magazine and seems to have led quickly to the star's disappearance
from her morning perch.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists and sympathetic viewers have united in one of the most
bitter polemics in years over women's rights. In a torrent of calls
to Ms. Kuroda's broadcasting company and letters to national
newspapers, they are asking whether the 39-year-old anchor jumped
or was pushed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kuroda has learned by bitter experience that in a country
where women's rights often lag far behind those of men, the divorce
of a prominent professional woman may also mean the loss of a job.
Her private life exploded onto the public stage on Oct. 4, when her
usually chipper delivery was replaced with the sober voice of a
previously unannounced successor who read a resignation statement
on her behalf that left viewers dumbfounded.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in charge of the program `Living Info: Hot
Morning' since March 1995,'' the statement said. ``For four and a
half years, I have devoted myself to this program with all my
strength, encouraged by the audience. Because of this, I regret to
have concealed my divorce from the audience and to have caused a
big fuss.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was swift. ``The announcer should not have had to
publicize her divorce, which is her personal business, and she does
not deserve to be deprived of the position,'' a leading feminist,
Mizuho Fukushima, a lawyer and member of parliament, wrote in a
prominent article in The Mainichi Shimbun. ``This case is an
example of discrimination against women in Japanese society.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper received letters from more than 400 people who
felt similarly, which it said was far more than usual for most
articles. And the network that broadcasts her program, NHK, said it
too had received a flood of sympathetic mail for Ms. Kuroda.
</P>
<P>
   An associate director of NHK, Makoto Yonemoto, was asked in an
interview about Ms. Kuroda's dismissal. ``Her divorce has nothing
to do with it,'' Yonemoto said in an interview. ``It was a private
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, however, Yonemoto said somewhat contradictorily
that had a sports weekly not broken the story of the divorce, which
occurred two years ago, nothing would have happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kuroda and her former husband, Osamu, had been high-school
sweethearts and graduated together from Tokyo University, the most
prestigious institution of higher learning. He became a salary man
for an electric company, and she went on to become a glamorous
television personality.
</P>
<P>
   There have been rumors that the two separated over tensions
caused by Ms. Kuroda's supposed failure to help care for her ailing
mother-in-law. But in the sole interview the two have given on the
subject, they told Shukan Shincho, a weekly here, that family
problems like those had no bearing on their decision to divorce.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why we divorced is solely due to my selfishness,''
Ms. Kuroda was quoted as saying. ``But that has nothing to do with
the circumstances of the Kuroda family.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances said she had spread the word that she really
wanted a break from her demanding job. She has also said it pained
her to leave her school-age daughter eating breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   With the divorce splashed across the headlines, Ms. Kuroda told
others that the brouhaha became a ready-made pretext to break with
her high-pressure style of life. But even friends are treating the
explanations with skepticism. Many say her account reflects the
aversion to public disputes that runs deep in Japanese society, and
perhaps a desire to regain prominence by helping the matter blow
over quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, these rumors, coupled with the NHK explanations,
have only heightened the puzzlement over what happened to the star,
while deepening the sense of outrage.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Makoto Sataka wrote of his own experience of divorce in his
column in The Mainichi Shimbun: ``Divorce and family problems have
a negative impact on your evaluation at your company. Those who are
still unmarried at the age of 30 or more get slower promotion and
are left behind by others. Of course, the company wouldn't openly
say, `We will delay your promotion, because you are divorced.'
Therefore it can't be taken to court. It is an invisible wall, and
for that reason it is a thick wall.''
</P>
<P>
   But if such problems are realities for men and women alike, the
Kuroda case has focused an especially harsh light on how society
treats divorced women.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If a woman goes on a business trip, she is asked, `How is your
husband coping while you are away?''' said Yoriko Madoka, a
feminist legislator in the upper house of parliament. ``One would
never ask that question of a man. But in Japan we are still
operating in an environment of sexual harassment, where people
inquire freely about a woman's marital status.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a job situation, if a divorced woman offers her opinion too
directly, the men will say, `No wonder you've been divorced,'''
said Ms. Madoka, who was once heckled over her own divorce on the
floor of parliament by another legislator.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Office of Gender Equality of the prime
minister's office, Tamae Onishi, said: ``After the war, Japan
established a system of basic equality of the sexes under the law.
But in actual life, the differences persisted in our customs, that
women should stay at home and that men should work.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Onishi said the government had recently begun education
campaigns to focus attention on one area of inequality. To persuade
men to help out more at home, the government is using the slogan,
``Men who don't participate in child rearing cannot be called
fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of divorce, which caused such controversy in Ms.
Kuroda's case, has not inspired public campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   One woman wrote a letter to the editor of The Mainichi Shimbun
telling how 10 years ago, despite feeling the stigma would be too
strong for her to remain at her company, she decided to tell the
president of her divorce.
</P>
<P>
   `` `You understand that it may deprive you of some
credibility?''' she recalled the president as having asked. `` `I
will try to be understanding. But why don't you just keep your last
name?'''
</P>
<P>
   The writer said she eventually quit the company and set up shop
on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am fully aware of the impact of divorce on a woman's career,
but now I am running my own business,'' she wrote. ``And if I am
asked about my marriage, I don't hesitate to say once divorced.''

VILLAGE VOICE, A PIONEER OF COUNTERCULTURE JOURNALISM, IS FOR
SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Village Voice is for sale, but does anybody care?
</P>
<P>
   The paper's scrappy union local has yet to stencil up a bundle
of picket signs. Vitriolic petitions have not issued from the
famously contentious staff. Corrupt politicians seem not to be
gloating more than usual. Villainous landlords have not been caught
cackling with glee.
</P>
<P>
   And thus far, even pundits have pretty much resisted bemoaning
the end of an era since September's announcement that Leonard
Stern, the pet-food-and-real-estate magnate, was auctioning off The
Voice and the six other alternative weeklies he owns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was prepared for the staff to be concerned and nervous,''
said Donald Forst, 67, the former tabloid tough guy who, as Voice
editor in chief, is perpetually spoiling for a fight. ``But I have
heard not a peep.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an improbable silence, given the superabundance of arias
during the operatic past of The Voice. Who can forget the fun when
Rupert Murdoch tried to replace the editor shortly after he bought
The Voice in 1977?
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire staff walked out and told Murdoch that all he'd
bought was a bunch of typewriters,'' said Richard Goldstein, an
executive editor, who has survived four owners at The Voice since
1966. Murdoch, of course, relented.
</P>
<P>
   But in its new niche as a profitable giveaway, the alternative
weekly _ which turned 44 on Tuesday _ has attained a settled middle
age. The Voice is no longer the ground zero of new trends as it was
when baby boomers ruled the roost, back when its reportage was
indivisible from the movements it covered.
</P>
<P>
   It was The Voice that broke news on the rock revolution, the
stirrings of psychedelia, the Stonewall uprising and the
radicalization of feminism; and it was The Voice that led the
charge to bring down Ed Koch, Geraldine Ferraro and the W-free
George BushBut the effects of time, generational change and intense
competition have conspired to erode the once-sharp profile of the
perennial house organ of the counterculture.
</P>
<P>
   And in eschewing newsstands for freebie boxes, the paper that
practically invented the modern concept of listings has in a sense
become its listings, including the legendary ``Transgender
Section'' (``looking for an attractive she-male to join me on my
vacation''), not to mention page after page of full-color ``Adult
Bodywork'' notices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the rest of the journalism profession doesn't take us
as seriously now because we went free,'' said the Voice's
take-no-prisoners political reporter, Wayne Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   And now the paper is competing with itself: dozens of its own
writers and editors, in leaving The Voice, have carried its
sensibility to mainstream newspapers, magazines and broadcast
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, The Voice was pushing the envelope, but now the envelope
is as big as  &UR; they &LR;  are,'' said Koch, the former mayor who was
actually the lawyer for The Voice in the early days, later became a
political punching bag for its writers and, most recently, posed
with the Rev. Al Sharpton, his new ally, for a cover story by Peter
Noel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still at the cutting edge, but so is everybody
else,'' Koch added. ``There is not a thing they write about that
you don't find in a mainstream paper.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forst, who ran the late New York Newsday, asserts that The
Voice offers superior coverage of everything from the arts to the
city's new immigrant groups, and he insists that the weekly's
impact is greater than ever because its circulation has more than
doubled since it dropped its cover price. (The Voice is now free in
all five boroughs.)
</P>
<P>
   And its staff points with pride to its coverage of the Russian
banking scandal and the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo, and they
proffer recent awards from the New York Press Club and the Society
of Publication Designers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many within the news media say without a trace of malice
that The Voice means less to them than ever. ``I find now that I
leaf through it not expecting to find something that will lead to a
follow-up by us,'' said Peter Landis, news director of the cable
channel New York 1 News.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice's coverage is no longer prime required reading in the
run-up to the general election. The criterion for journalistic
success ``is very simple,'' said Dr. Jay Rosen, a professor of
journalism at New York University. ``Does anybody pick it up? I
think that more stories in The Voice go unfollowed these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Barrett _ the junkyard dog of city political reporters who
has drawn blood from generations of elected officials, and not
infrequently the wealthy friends of his publisher _ said that ``The
Voice does not have as much political impact as it once did.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he says he is proud of his recent journalistic
provocations _ especially an influential 1998 revelation about Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato's attendance record in Nassau County that benefited
his Senate campaign rival, Charles Schumer _ ``now the soft stuff
is up front,'' Barrett said, referring to the Voice's life style
section. ``And we don't have as big a news hole'' for politics, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice is also battling rampant media fragmentation in its
traditionally formidable gay constituency, as it is buzzed by the
Internet and beset by print rivals like The New York Blade, Poz
magazine and LGNY.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question in my mind, politically speaking from a
gay perspective, The Voice has less clout than it used to,'' said
Jeff Soref, co-chairman of the board of the Empire State Pride
Agenda, the state's largest gay and lesbian lobbying group. ``It
doesn't set the agenda at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the weekly still sees itself as a city institution
and is fiercely protective of its establishment-bashing niche. In a
sense, The Voice has waged journalistic war and won, thanks to
``the many writers it has graduated to the mainstream media,'' said
Rosen, referring to the paper's former staff members at
publications ranging from Vanity Fair and Esquire to The New York
Observer and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In both its presence and its circulation of about 250,000, The
Voice still rules the giveaway universe, despite competition from
The New York Press, The New York Blade, LGNY and a swarm of other
gratis publications. On some street corners, these rivals fairly
obscure the battered red plastic street boxes of The Voice, which
has 3,000 points of free distribution in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Press, the Voice's chief competitor, with a
circulation of 115,000, is dismissive about the sale and, as might
be expected, less than kind toward its rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing in The Voice is patronizing, condescending and
boring,'' said Russ Smith, 44, the paper's editor in chief.
``People pick it up only for the listings and the ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an unkinder cut, though, comes from the cartoonist Jules
Feiffer, who said that ``these days I pick up The New York Press
more, because the personal tone reminds me more of the early Voice
of Wolf and Fancher,'' referring to Dan Wolf and Edwin Fancher, two
of its co-founders in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Feiffer, 70, still feels ``rancor over the way I was treated,''
he said. After 42 years at The Voice, during which he captured one
of its two Pulitzer Prizes, he quit the paper in 1997 after being
informed that The Voice did not want to keep paying his
$75,000-a-year salary.
</P>
<P>
   Voice publisher David Schneiderman, 52, explained that ``we got
four cartoonists for the price of one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We constantly reinvent the staff,'' he added. ``The only way
to bring in new people is to remove old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Voice competitor, The New York Observer, took over the
shelf space of The Voice at many Manhattan newsstands when the
non-salmon weekly became a giveaway. A greater economic threat is
Time Out New York, which, although it charges $2.50 for its
listings and articles, competes with The Voice because its glossy
pages are a magnet for advertisers, including big-ticket national
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In going free in 1996, with a circulation of 111,298, The Voice
gave up $3 million in newsstand revenues but has pulled in more
advertising dollars because its circulation has bulked up to
249,404.
</P>
<P>
   Although The Voice still appeals to a cadre of graying Bohemian
partisans, the median reader age is 31.7 years, putting it firmly
in the desirable age-18-to-34 advertising segment. About 57 percent
of its primarily single readers, who have an average household
income of $43,410, are male; 30 percent of them are black and
Hispanic; editors estimate that 15 percent are gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been saying they don't read The Voice _ that it's
not what it used to be _ since the 1960s,'' said James Ledbetter,
New York bureau chief of The Industry Standard, an Internet
publication, who wrote for The Voice for eight years. ``But somehow
The Voice always manages to find a niche that is necessary to large
numbers of readers. A profitable niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern says he expects to sell his company at a considerable
premium to the $120-$150 million it might have fetched before the
age of media-acquisition frenzy. He said his company's pretax
earnings were $16 million last year, or a 20 percent gross profit.
(Those who have seen the prospectus say The Voice is projecting
1999 revenues of $32 million.)
</P>
<P>
   After testing the market, Stern's investment bankers decided on
the tactic of an auction, hoping to flush out nontraditional
bidders.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 15, more than a dozen media businesses, investment
groups and Internet companies submitted bids, which are being kept
confidential. A decision is expected by the end of November.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the auction cannot command a premium price, a $120
million sale would not be a ho-hum payday for Stern, who bought The
Voice for $55 million in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   And so these days, as Stern prepares to rake in his chips, the
staff of 152 and 37 part-timers in the mazelike eternity of rooms
at 36 Cooper Square is counting on protection from its union, Local
2110 of the Technical, Office and Professional Workers of the
United Auto Workers.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, 40 staffers gathered down the block at the
Cooper Union to discuss the sale. The mood was ``pretty confident;
the union is very strong here,'' said Andrew Hsiao, 37, a senior
editor who writes about immigrant activism and is a union shop
steward.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worst nightmare is that some new owner will take the Martha
Stewart approach,'' said columnist Michael Musto, the Voice's
reigning smartypants. ``We hope they don't try to turn us into a
formal dinner party instead of a rave.''
</P>
<P>
   But in this time of media tumult and owner uncertainty, perhaps
the staff of The Voice yearns for some good old-fashioned
validation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the new owner appreciates how special we are,'' said
Lynn Yaeger, the style section editor. ``It's the most important
thing. That someone gets us.''

   &UR; Michael R. Bonsignore, 58, is chairman of Honeywell Inc., which
is merging with Allied Signal Inc., a diversified manufacturer in
Morristown, N.J. He will be chief executive of the new Honeywell.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I grew up a military brat, went to the Naval Academy and spent
seven years in the Navy. I could have commanded my own ship
eventually. Instead, at 28, I made the wrenching decision to take a
job as an engineer at Honeywell.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1969. I packed my wife and three kids into a beat-up
Oldsmobile and set off across the country. In Las Vegas, I stopped
in a supermarket to call Honeywell. I remember the phone was right
next to a one-armed bandit. The personnel manager said: ``Well, I
have bad news for you. Things aren't going so well. We won't be
able to give you that job.'' A great beginning to my Honeywell
career!
</P>
<P>
   I said: ``Wait a minute. My wife and kids are waiting for me.
I'm calling you from a supermarket, and I have $100 to my name. And
you're telling me I don't have a job?''
</P>
<P>
   In all my years with Honeywell, I've had a lot of pivotal
moments, but none has been more pivotal than that. I managed to
negotiate a job at Honeywell after all, although it was in another
department.
</P>
<P>
   And here I am today, trying to meld together two companies and
two corporate cultures. For Honeywell, the process is like
open-heart surgery. We closed our headquarters in Minneapolis and
laid off 800 people, and all the employees were saying, ``What
about me?'' Inevitably, in a situation like this, everybody's
mindset goes into ``me'' from ``we'' and stays there until the
``me'' questions are answered.
</P>
<P>
   We had to take some simple steps to avoid unnecessary confusion.
We couldn't proceed to the ``we'' stage of making the merger work
until we had all the ``me'' questions out of the way. So our first
goal was to get information out. I traveled all over the Honeywell
empire and talked face to face with probably 10,000 employees. I
was out rumor-hunting. If I spotted any nonsense, I'd shoot it dead
on the spot and bury it.
</P>
<P>
   One of our smartest decisions was to give employees a choice
between our current pension plan or moving to a new cash-balance
plan that younger employees favor. A huge level of concern just
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the turmoil, I have managed to keep my temper in
check. Earlier in my life, I was known as a hothead. I still have
to fight sudden surges of anger. You feel it coming. You feel it in
your feet. You feel it in your knees. But I've learned to control
it. My cardinal rule now is: Don't sweat the small stuff. If I blow
my top, it's going to be for something really important, like
losing a contract to a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most satisfying moments for me in these last two
months was attending the 20th anniversary of a volunteer group of
retired Honeywell employees. One woman said she just wantehank me for 32 wonderful years. And I thought about all the
uncertainties of the workplace over the last three decades, and I
was touched.

APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS 2 STATE LAWS ON A TYPE OF LATE BIRTH
ABORTIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(Eds: Adds five grafs at end of story and additional changes
throughout.) 
 (ATTN: Neb., Ark. Wis., Iowa, Ill., Ohio)   By JO THOMAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   URBANA, Ill. _ In a sharply divided vote, a federal appeals
court in Chicago Tuesday upheld the constitutionality of laws in
Illinois and Wisconsin that criminalize a late-term abortion
procedure its opponents call ``partial birth.'' Neither law has yet
been enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The decision from the entire U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th
Circuit came a month after a panel of the federal appeals court for
the 8th Circuit ruled that laws banning the procedure in Nebraska,
Arkansas and Iowa were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents and supporters of Tuesday's decision agreed that the
conflict between the federal appeals courts make it more likely
that the Supreme Court will take up the highly politicized issue in
the near future. Last year the court turned down a case from the
6th Circuit, which ruled that a law banning the procedure in Ohio
was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a decision that cries out for the Supreme Court to fix
it,'' said Simon Heller, who represented the Center for
Reproductive Law and Policy, which opposed the laws, in the
Wisconsin case, Christensen vs. Doyle. ``We don't intend to sit
idly by while these judges determine that women's health should be
sacrificed.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to
Life Committee, which supported the Wisconsin law, said he also
expected ``that the Supreme Court will rule, perhaps next year, on
whether Roe vs. Wade covers pulling most of a living baby
feet-first outside of the womb, puncturing her skull, and removing
her brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has twice passed bills banning the procedure, both
times ending in vetoes by President Clinton. Both times, the vetoes
were narrowly sustained in the Senate; twice, they were overridden
in the House. A bill that passed the Senate by a vote of 63-34 this
month is expected to be taken up in the House next year.
</P>
<P>
   The laws in Wisconsin and Illinois allow the prosecution of
doctors who perform what the 7th Circuit called ``an uncommon
procedure'' that opponents call `partial-birth abortion.'''
</P>
<P>
   The court said that, according to the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in the procedure, a woman's cervix
is dilated, usually over several days, and the fetus is extracted
feet first; the brain is then partly evacuated, and the fetus is
delivered dead but otherwise intact.
</P>
<P>
   The court found that the language in the Wisconsin and Illinois
laws was sufficiently precise so that the state courts could
interpret the laws in a way that would not forbid common and legal
methods of late-term abortions, in which a fetus is dismembered
inside a woman's uterus and removed by forceps or suction. A
woman's right to these procedures, the court said, was protected
under Supreme Court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's decision, which split 6-4 and takes effect in 20
days, the majority noted that the attorneys general of Wisconsin
and Illinois had assured the court that application of the statutes
to a legal late-term abortion procedure would be ``constitutionally
impermissible.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, therefore, the judges said, ``can practice medicine
without undue concern on the legal front.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's opinion, the judges took note of testimony in the
trial of the Wisconsin case that the banned procedure ``is never
necessary from the perspective of the patient's health.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6th and 8th Circuits found that the laws banning the
procedure were unconstitutional because their language was too
vague and might be interpreted to prohibit common and legal methods
of late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Bans on dilation and extraction abortions have been passed in 30
states, and lower courts have struck down or delayed
implementations of those bans in 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   The deeply political character of the debate was taken into
account by both the majority and the minority opinions Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Writing an impassioned opinion for the minority, Circuit Judge
Richard A. Posner observed: ``To understand this issue requires
understanding the peculiar and questionable character of these
statutes. They do not protect the lives of fetuses either directly
or by seeking to persuade a woman to reconsider her decision to
seek an abortion. For the statutes do not forbid the destruction of
any class of fetuses, but merely criminalize a method of abortion _
they thus have less to recommend them than the antiabortion
statutes invalidated in Roe vs. Wade,''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``There is no meaningful difference between the
forbidden and the privileged practice. No reason of policy or
morality that would allow the one would forbid the other. We should
consider therefore why any state would pass such a law. An
important part of the answer is found in Judge Manion's opinion in
Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin vs. Doyle,'' ``the states want to
dramatize the ugliness of abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin law, enacted in 1998, is one of the most Draconian
in the nation, providing a possible penalty of life imprisonment
for anyone performing a partial-birth abortion except to save the
mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's majority opinion, the judges took note of the the
law's severity, but said they had not been presented with an
argument that ``severe criminal punishment for a medical
misunderstanding would inflict cruel and unusual punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   They continued: ``If Wisconsin should some day impose a lengthy
prison term for a violation'' of the law, ``then it will be time to
consider arguments based on the eighth amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Benshof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law and
Policy, which has challenged 14 ``partial-birth abortion'' bans,
said Tuesday's decision ``puts a fist around medical science.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision will force medical progress to grind to a halt
in an entire region of the United States because it deprives
doctors of the ability to decide how to practice safe medicine.''

 &HT;    Bailey trial closer to conclusion
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ Before letting F. Lee Bailey step off the witness
stand Tuesday after five tedious days of testimony, U.S. Magistrate
James Glazebrook personally quizzed him about his finances.
</P>
<P>
   Glazebrook has ordered Bailey to explain why he hasn't turned
over $2 million in a legal defense fund for William J. McCorkle or
face jail.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey spent 3 1/2 days under intense cross examination by
assistant U.S. Attorney Marie DeMarco, who poured over the details
of McCorkle's infomercial empire trying to prove Bailey knew the
money was illegally obtained through McCorkle's real estate scam
when he took it to cover defense costs.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's attorney, Richard Lubin, is arguing Glazebrook can
neither order Bailey to repay the money or hold him in contempt
because the money has been spent.
</P>
<P>
   During his testimony, Bailey explained that he shut down his
practice last year after learning his wife was terminally ill with
cancer and has been living off loans from friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   Openly dismayed, DeMarco asked Bailey specific details on
foreign accounts, a Piper aircraft and his $1.2 million Manalapan
house. Glazebrook repeated many of the same questions.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey explained that the airplane is in hock, the foreign
accounts were closed and he has three mortgages totaling nearly
$1.2 million on his house.
</P>
<P>
   He did not know how much his furniture or art was worth because
his wife purchased it. When she died last month, his wife left all
her belongings to her mother, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glazebrook also questioned Bailey about not following his order
to turn over the money from a Cayman Island account. When Bailey
answered the government controlled the money, that all he could do
was agree with a government order and that no one had asked him,
Glazebrook asked in disbelief: ``Are you saying the government is
an impediment to bringing back the funds?''
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco began presenting her case Tuesday by calling a business
manager fired by McCorkle after a month, a Cayman Island attorney
who helped the government try to freeze the defense fund and an
assistant attorney general who investigated more than 300
complaints about McCorkle.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing resumes today and is expected to conclude by the end
of the week. Glazebrook will then make a recommendation on the
matter to the district judge.

EXCLUSIVE: CLINTON TO PROPOSE NEW RULES TO PROTECT PRIVACY OF
MEDICAL RECORDS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 3rd graf summarizing reaction to proposals; subs 6th

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will soon announce sweeping new
federal rules to protect the privacy of billions of medical records
and will assail Congress for failing to enact any safeguards,
administration officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulations would be the first comprehensive
federal standards specifically intended to protect the
confidentiality of medical records. They come at a time when
doctors, hospitals, pharmacists and health maintenance
organizations are sharing more and more data, often without the
knowledge of patients, and insurance companies are demanding more
information to justify the payment of claims.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates support most of the administration's
proposals. But the proposed rules have generated criticism from
insurance companies and hospitals, which say the rules would be
costly to carry out. Law-enforcement officials have also expressed
concerns because they believe the rules could require them to
obtain search warrants in cases where warrants are not now
required. And psychiatrists have criticized the rules, saying they
may unintentionally weaken a patient's control over medical
records.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals would cover any medical records that are kept or
transmitted electronically, as well as paper printouts of
electronic transactions. Patients would generally have a right to
review and copy their medical records, and to supplement the
records or correct mistakes, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Most medical records are still kept on paper, but a growing
number of health plans require doctors to submit claims
electronically. In practice, health care experts said, the proposed
rules would set standards for all medical records because it is not
practical for doctors and insurers to follow different policies for
the use and disclosure of personal medical information kept in
different forms.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been trying to write such protections into law, but
the effort has stalled because of profound disagreements between
privacy advocates and the health care industry. In 1996, Congress
imposed a deadline on itself, requiring the secretary of health and
human services to issue privacy rules if lawmakers failed to pass
health privacy legislation by Aug. 21, 1999. The administration's
new proposals carry out that requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The public will have an opportunity to comment on the proposed
rules. Under the 1996 law, the secretary of health and human
services must issue final rules by Feb. 21 of next year.
</P>
<P>
   In offering the proposed rules, White House officials said,
Clinton will try to achieve three political purposes. He will put
pressure on Congress to pass legislation, to provide a solid
statutory framework for the new standards. He will present himself
as a champion of privacy rights, a politically popular cause. And,
by making aggressive use of his power, he will try to counter the
perception of himself as a lame duck.
</P>
<P>
   The president expressed impatience on Monday, when he criticized
Republicans for blocking his proposal to provide prescription drug
benefits under Medicare. In a fleeting reference to his next
initiative, Clinton said: ``Because they have not taken action to
protect the privacy of medical records, I will use the power of my
office to do that in the coming days. I think that's a very
important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said: ``We would have preferred that Congress pass
bipartisan legislation. They gave themselves three years to do it.
But in the absence of action on Capitol Hill, the president will
act.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House is still negotiating some details with law
enforcement officials, who want to be sure the privacy rules do not
hamper their investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are also analyzing the cost of the proposals.
A recent study by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association said
that compliance with such standards could cost tens of billions of
dollars because health care providers, health plans and insurance
companies would have to retrain employees, hire privacy experts,
rewrite contracts and reprogram computers.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials are compiling data to show that those
cost estimates are grossly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules appear stricter than the comparable
provisions of a landmark bill hammered out last week to overhaul
the nation's financial system. Under that bill, divisions of a big
financial conglomerate _ for example, an insurance company and a
consumer bank _ could share information about a customer under many
circumstances, and they would have to inform customers at least
once a year of their policies on privacy and disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Under the medical privacy rules, an insurer would also have to
inform the subscriber of its privacy practices, but it would be
more difficult for the insurer to share health information with an
affiliated company. In most cases, the insurer would have to get
the consumer's permission before allowing use of the information
for purposes unrelated to medical treatment or the payment of
claims.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules will probably not go far enough to satisfy
psychiatrists, but may go too far for some law enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul S. Appelbaum, vice president of the American
Psychiatric Association, said: ``The administration's proposal
would protect notes taken by a therapist in the course of
psychotherapy, and that's good. But it would take away some of the
power that patients have traditionally had to decide when and if
their records are released to third parties.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, law enforcement agencies would need a search
warrant, a subpoena or some other legal authorization to get
confidential medical records. Federal, state and local law
enforcement officials said they wanted to preserve their ability to
get immediate access to medical information without a warrant in
emergencies _ when they are investigating a bomb threat or trying
to rescue hostages, for example.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   John R. Justice, chairman of the National District Attorneys
Association, said investigators often did not have enough time or
specific information to get a warrant for medical records in
``exigent circumstances.'' For example, he said, the police may ask
local hospitals to notify them if a fleeing suspect shows up for
treatment of a gunshot wound. And the police may want to know about
the health problems of a person who is holding hostages or being
held hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on health privacy in and out of the government said the
proposed rules also included these provisions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Health care providers and HMO's would not have to get a
patient's consent before disclosing information needed for medical
treatment or the payment of claims. But they would have to get the
patient's consent if the information was to be used for marketing
and certain types of research.
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal rules would establish minimum protections for
patients' privacy and would not override any contrary provisions of
state law that were ``more stringent'' than the federal
requirements. Many states provide more protection in specific areas
like mental health, genetic testing, AIDS or other sexually
transmitted diseases. These state laws would not be pre-empted by
the federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   _ Before disclosing information, doctors would have to take
reasonable steps to make sure they did not disclose more
information than was actually needed to accomplish the purpose of
the request. The rules would forbid the wholesale release of entire
records when a small part would suffice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Doctors, hospitals and health plans could charge a reasonable
fee to cover the cost of copying records.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, doctors and hospitals can be fined up to
$50,000 for the improper disclosure of confidential medical
information, and they are subject to larger fines if they sell such
data for ``commercial advantage'' or ``malicious harm.'' Under the
proposed rules, patients would not gain any new federal right to
sue a doctor or an HMO for divulging medical records. Federal
officials said that only Congress could create a new right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules would provide additional protection for some
sensitive personal information in mental health records, but not as
much protection as many psychiatrists want.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, a psychotherapist would not need a patient's
consent to disclose information about the diagnosis of a condition,
the patient's level of functioning or medications when such
information was necessary for treatment or for the payment of
claims. But the therapist would have to get the patient's consent
before disclosing more detailed information about a patient's
feelings, family relationships or sexual relationships.

COLD WAR SECRECY, REHEATED BY TERROR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Colo.)   (For use with IMMIG-DETAIN)  
 (af)  
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ The government's use of secret evidence to detain
immigrants is a cold war-era practice that re-emerged amid the
terrorism jitters of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Under laws and court rulings dating to the 1950s and renewed in
the 1996 Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and the
immigration reform of the same year, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service has been allowed to detain and deport
noncitizens on the basis of secret evidence without revealing
exactly what the evidence is or where it originated.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and intelligence officials have argued in the past
that such secrecy is necessary to protect intelligence-gathering
methods and the lives of informers.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale dates back to the '50s, when the government used
evidence about political activity as grounds for deporting hundreds
of people who had been members of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, a volunteer lawyer with the Center for
Constitutional Rights and a part of the team representing Hany
Kiareldeen, a Palestinian immigrant released Monday after being
held for 19 months on the basis of secret evidence, said that the
immigration service had relied on a 1956 United States Supreme
Court ruling, Jay vs. Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Cole said, a man facing detention on the basis of
secret evidence that he was a communist challenged whether the
agency had the authority to use such evidence under immigration
law. A divided court simply said that the authority did exist under
the statute, though the justices never addressed the basic
constitutionality of the use of the evidence. In recent years,
other rulings have raised questions about the use of secret
evidence in pressing other actions like deporting immigrants
preventing their entry.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroshi Motomura, a professor at the University of Colorado
School of Law and an expert in immigration law, said that after the
World Trade Center bombing in 1993, fear of terrorism approached
the level of fear that communism generated in the 1950s. But
Motomura noted that, just as Americans eventually realized that
communism was a far smaller threat to the nation than the weakening
of constitutional rights, immigration judges and others have begun
to question whether they should allow the government unlimited
power in fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that they need to more closely scrutinize
these claims of terrorism and national security,'' Motomura said of
the judges, ``and a sense that they don't want to repeat the
mistakes of the '50s where they realize we went overboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David E. Bonior, D-Mich., and sponsor, along with 53 other
members of Congress, of the Secret Evidence Repeal Act, said it
would take legislation, not just court opinions, to end such
practices. Bonior is pressing for hearings on his bill in the
Republican-controlled House, and he said that time is running out
in this session for Congress to take action.

EDITORIAL: SOCIAL SECURITY SCARE-MONGERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Oct. 27: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is one of the oldest weapons in politics. By
charging that various Republican schemes would wreck the Social
Security system, Democrats over the years have blocked tax cuts, a
constitutional amendment to balance the budget and the recent GOP
proposal to replace part of the retirement system with private
investment accounts. Now the Republicans seem to be making
political headway using the same weapon against Democrats. They are
advancing a ludicrous claim that deep Republican budget cuts are
needed to stop a Democratic ``raid'' on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican argument rests on a fallacy that spending budget
money today compromises the ability of the federal government to
meet its Social Security obligations in the future. Instead of
squabbling over dollars in this year's budget, Congress can do more
for Social Security by producing sound budgets that make the right
investments while keeping the economy growing. A prosperous economy
is the best guarantee that workers in the future will be able to
afford paying for their parents' retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In January, President Clinton called for setting aside nearly
two-thirds of the total projected federal surplus, from Social
Security and other sources, to help retire federal debt over the
next 15 years. That was a sensible proposal intended to increase
the savings rate and lower future interest rates. But the argument
this year is over whether a small amount of the $140 billion Social
Security surplus in the current year should be used to avoid
spending cuts in other programs. In fact, no damage would be done
to the economy, to Social Security or to the federal budget itself
if that happened.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that it is merely trying to save money for Social
Security, the Republican leadership in Congress wants to cut
spending by 1.4 percent across the board and block the White
House's initiatives for money to hire new teachers and police
officers. Congress also persists in blocking money for foreign aid
and payments long owed the United Nations. But it is not necessary
to cut these programs to ``save'' Social Security. More to the
point, there are better places to save money, by cutting billions
of dollars in pork-barrel projects and eliminating some of the
expensive tax breaks for special interests that have made big
campaign donations to the party in recent years.

   Clinton is right to veto spending bills that do not meet
priority needs in education, foreign aid, the environment, law
enforcement and other areas. As the White House notes, the
Republican budget schemes approved so far have already tapped the
Social Security system's surplus, according to the Congressional
Budget Office. The fastest way to achieve a budget agreement would
be to agree to a sensible budget and stop scaring the public into
thinking that a modest amount of additional spending would
jeopardize Social Security.

 &HT;    Course designer Bruce Borland, 40, dies in crash
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (s) Sports categories.)

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the fairways, pro shops and 19th
holes of South Florida's golf courses, Bruce Borland's name didn't
often come up in conversation. But in the offices of the area's
many golf course designers, he was well known and well respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the top professionals in our industry,'' said
Gene Bates, a Palm Beach Gardens-based course designer.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County is home to some of the most famous names in
golf course architecture, including Tom and Jim Fazio, Pete Dye and
Joe Lee. Then there are the player/designers: Jack Nicklaus, Greg
Norman, Gary Player _ all have offices here.
</P>
<P>
   But golf course design isn't a one-man business. Behind the
famous names are dozens of others who do the same work but don't
shine in the same spotlight. They're called design associates.
Within the business they get plenty of respect. Bruce Borland of
Jupiter, Fla., one of six people killed in a plane crash Monday
that also took the life of PGA Tour player Payne Stewart, was one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the Fazios and you have Greg Norman and you have
Nicklaus,'' said Bates, who works with Johnny Miller and Fred
Couples, ``but there are a lot of other guys who are not that well
known, but they do just as good work and do work in as broad a base
as the big guys do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the Tom Fazios that haven't been recognized yet. They
probably fit in the same profile as what Tom Fazio did 15 years
ago. When Tom Fazio worked for George Fazio (Tom's uncle), nobody
knew who Tom was, although he was kind of the guy behind the scenes
doing all the leg work, all the detail work and putting together
plans and specifications. He's really the technician. He's the guy
who makes the boat float.''
</P>
<P>
   Borland, 40, was a senior design associate at Nicklaus Design in
North Palm Beach, where he had worked since 1990. Chris Cochran,
another Nicklaus senior design associate, knew him all that time,
``and I shared an office with Bruce or sat next to Bruce for the
last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took no shortcuts,'' Cochran said. ``He was very, very
thorough, excellent with the client. Everybody he worked with knew
they were dealing with someone with a lot of integrity, and you've
got to have that. You've got to win people's trust out there.
They've got to believe in you. They've got to believe in your
motives. He was a very good architect, really good with people. He
loved the game and he understood shot values and strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said he and Borland used to travel to Asia quite a bit
for the company. ``I had the work in Thailand and China and Bruce
did a lot of the Indonesian work,'' he said. ``And he did some
excellent work there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran cited two of Borland's projects, new courses in Orlando
and Missouri, as evidence of his expertise. The Missouri course, he
said, ``is going to win a lot of kudos. Bruce's work, although it
was always very good, was getting better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Whitten, golf course architecture editor for Golf Digest and
Golf World magazines, said he was impressed by a course Borland did
at Hilton Head, S.C., called the Golden Bear Golf Club at Indigo
Run. ``The one that impressed me the most,'' Whitten said, ``is the
one that he did with (PGA Tour player) Glen Day a couple of years
ago called Salem Glen. ``It was really, really well done and it
showed a lot of talent for fitting something into a tough site.''
</P>
<P>
   Borland was known in the business for having been one of the
first to utilize computers in golf course design.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest in getting into CAD _ computer-aided design _ was
just starting to surface when I left Nicklaus Design in 1988,''
Bates said. ``And they really needed somebody who could grab hold
and implement it, somebody who had the knowledge and the patience.
That's where I think Bruce really stood out, because he was a very
patient person.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates left Nicklaus two years before Borland was hired, but the
two often ran into each other. ``We've traveled on the same
airplanes several times,'' Bates said. ``We had a lot of
opportunity to share time on the airplane and talk about our
projects. We talked about how good a man Nicklaus is and how good
he was to me, and Bruce was really excited about how he was treated
in the Nicklaus organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel is the common denominator for course designers, no matter
which company they work for. Jason McCoy, president of Greg Norman
Golf Course Design, ran into Borland recently while having lunch
near his office in Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just talking about the amount of travel that we have
to do in our business,'' McCoy said, ``and how that was the only
drawback to it. Pretty ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   Borland learned to play golf as a boy, practicing his swing in
the backyard of his Peoria, Ill., home, said Lee Antonio of
Chicago, sister of Borland's wife, Kate. Cochran said he and
Borland used to play together at the Golden Bear Golf Club at
Hammock Creek in Palm City and Bear Lakes Country Club in West Palm
Beach. ``Bruce was anywhere between an 8 and an 11 handicap,''
Cochran said. ``He was a lot of fun to play with.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio recalled meeting Borland while at the University of
Illinois. He was a waiter for Alpha Phi, the sorority house to
which Lee and Kate belonged in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Waiters were chosen by the sisters of Alpha Phi, and candidates
had to go through rigorous interviews to get the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was charming, driven and confident,'' Antonio said.
``That's why we chose him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Kate met him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a terrific love affair,'' Antonio said. ``And I never
had a brother, so he was the brother that I never had.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his busy work schedule, Antonio said Borland still found
time to be a wonderful father to sons Daniel, 13, Thomas, 12, and
Benjamin, 10, and daughter Elizabeth, 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``He embraced his family,'' Antonio said. ``He would go to all
of his children's after-school activities, like their diving meets.
And he's taken them golfing since they could hold a stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Borland had planned to fly commercial as late as Sunday night,
Antonio said, but switched plans to fly with Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial services will be held Thursday in Jupiter. Gifts in
lieu of flowers may be sent to one of three funds: Palm Beach
Community Church, Bruce E. Borland Building for Life Fund, 3970 RCA
Blvd., Suite 7009, Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. 33410; First Union
National Bank, Memorial Fund for the Benefit of the Bruce E.
Borland Children, 2000 PGA Blvd., Suite 2200, Palm Beach Gardens,
Fla., 33408; or Wycliffe Bible Translators, c/o Mark/Deb Borland
and Linda/David Captain, P.O. Box 628200, Orlando, Fla. 32862-8200.

 &HT;    Course designer Bruce Borland, 40, dies in crash
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (s) Sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Al Tays
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the fairways, pro shops and 19th
holes of South Florida's golf courses, Bruce Borland's name didn't
often come up in conversation. But in the offices of the area's
many golf course designers, he was well known and well respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the top professionals in our industry,'' said
Gene Bates, a Palm Beach Gardens-based course designer.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County is home to some of the most famous names in
golf course architecture, including Tom and Jim Fazio, Pete Dye and
Joe Lee. Then there are the player/designers: Jack Nicklaus, Greg
Norman, Gary Player _ all have offices here.
</P>
<P>
   But golf course design isn't a one-man business. Behind the
famous names are dozens of others who do the same work but don't
shine in the same spotlight. They're called design associates.
Within the business they get plenty of respect. Bruce Borland of
Jupiter, Fla., one of six people killed in a plane crash Monday
that also took the life of PGA Tour player Payne Stewart, was one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the Fazios and you have Greg Norman and you have
Nicklaus,'' said Bates, who works with Johnny Miller and Fred
Couples, ``but there are a lot of other guys who are not that well
known, but they do just as good work and do work in as broad a base
as the big guys do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the Tom Fazios that haven't been recognized yet. They
probably fit in the same profile as what Tom Fazio did 15 years
ago. When Tom Fazio worked for George Fazio (Tom's uncle), nobody
knew who Tom was, although he was kind of the guy behind the scenes
doing all the leg work, all the detail work and putting together
plans and specifications. He's really the technician. He's the guy
who makes the boat float.''
</P>
<P>
   Borland, 40, was a senior design associate at Nicklaus Design in
North Palm Beach, where he had worked since 1990. Chris Cochran,
another Nicklaus senior design associate, knew him all that time,
``and I shared an office with Bruce or sat next to Bruce for the
last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took no shortcuts,'' Cochran said. ``He was very, very
thorough, excellent with the client. Everybody he worked with knew
they were dealing with someone with a lot of integrity, and you've
got to have that. You've got to win people's trust out there.
They've got to believe in you. They've got to believe in your
motives. He was a very good architect, really good with people. He
loved the game and he understood shot values and strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said he and Borland used to travel to Asia quite a bit
for the company. ``I had the work in Thailand and China and Bruce
did a lot of the Indonesian work,'' he said. ``And he did some
excellent work there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran cited two of Borland's projects, new courses in Orlando
and Missouri, as evidence of his expertise. The Missouri course, he
said, ``is going to win a lot of kudos. Bruce's work, although it
was always very good, was getting better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Whitten, golf course architecture editor for Golf Digest and
Golf World magazines, said he was impressed by a course Borland did
at Hilton Head, S.C., called the Golden Bear Golf Club at Indigo
Run. ``The one that impressed me the most,'' Whitten said, ``is the
one that he did with PGA Tour player) Glen Day a couple of years
ago called Salem Glen. ``It was really, really well done and it
showed a lot of talent for fitting something into a tough site.''
</P>
<P>
   Borland was known in the business for having been one of the
first to utilize computers in golf course design.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest in getting into CAD _ computer-aided design _ was
just starting to surface when I left Nicklaus Design in 1988,''
Bates said. ``And they really needed somebody who could grab hold
and implement it, somebody who had the knowledge and the patience.
That's where I think Bruce really stood out, because he was a very
patient person.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates left Nicklaus two years before Borland was hired, but the
two often ran into each other. ``We've traveled on the same
airplanes several times,'' Bates said. ``We had a lot of
opportunity to share time on the airplane and talk about our
projects. We talked about how good a man Nicklaus is and how good
he was to me, and Bruce was really excited about how he was treated
in the Nicklaus organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel is the common denominator for course designers, no matter
which company they work for. Jason McCoy, president of Greg Norman
Golf Course Design, ran into Borland recently while having lunch
near his office in Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just talking about the amount of travel that we have
to do in our business,'' McCoy said, ``and how that was the only
drawback to it. Pretty ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   Borland learned to play golf as a boy, practicing his swing in
the backyard of his Peoria, Ill., home, said Lee Antonio of
Chicago, sister of Borland's wife, Kate. Cochran said he and
Borland used to play together at the Golden Bear Golf Club at
Hammock Creek in Palm City and Bear Lakes Country Club in West Palm
Beach. ``Bruce was anywhere between an 8 and an 11 handicap,''
Cochran said. ``He was a lot of fun to play with.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio recalled meeting Borland while at the University of
Illinois. He was a waiter for Alpha Phi, the sorority house to
which Lee and Kate belonged in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Waiters were chosen by the sisters of Alpha Phi, and candidates
had to go through rigorous interviews to get the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was charming, driven and confident,'' Antonio said.
``That's why we chose him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Kate met him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a terrific love affair,'' Antonio said. ``And I never
had a brother, so he was the brother that I never had.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his busy work schedule, Antonio said Borland still found
time to be a wonderful father to sons Daniel, 13, Thomas, 12, and
Benjamin, 10, and daughter Elizabeth, 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``He embraced his family,'' Antonio said. ``He would go to all
of his children's after-school activities, like their diving meets.
And he's taken them golfing since they could hold a stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Borland had planned to fly commercial as late as Sunday night,
Antonio said, but switched plans to fly with Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial services will be held Thursday in Jupiter. Gifts in
lieu of flowers may be sent to one of three funds: Palm Beach
Community Church, Bruce E. Borland Building for Life Fund, 3970 RCA
Blvd., Suite 7009, Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. 33410; First Union
National Bank, Memorial Fund for the Benefit of the Bruce E.

SUMMERS: CHINA VOTE ON WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION DELAYED UNTIL NEXT
YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said on Tuesday
that even if an agreement were reached to get China into the World
Trade Organization, the deal could not come up for a vote on
Capitol Hill until next year.
</P>
<P>
   That political reality presents an already divided leadership in
Beijing with a vexing decision: whether to strike a deal in the
next month and trust it can be delivered by President Clinton, who
may have diminishing powers to persuade an election-year Congress
to go along, or abandon the negotiations until the next American
president takes office.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Clinton walked away from a deal in April _ a move he
and others in the administration now clearly regret _ the two
countries have been unable to put an agreement back together again.
</P>
<P>
   Summers' comments Tuesday, as he completed a three-day visit to
Beijing, marked the administration's first public acknowledgment
that it had run out of time to marry a trade deal with Congress'
agreement to grant China permanent trading status.
</P>
<P>
   China has long said that any trade deal would have to be linked
to Congress' agreement to amend the law that provides for
year-to-year renewal of China's trading privileges with the United
States, a vote that frequently becomes the centerpiece of debate
over China's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Summers' visit was the latest in a series of efforts to convince
China's leaders to complete talks on joining the 143-nation trade
organization, which involves extensive commitments by Beijing to
open long-closed markets to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Summers expressed confidence that a trade deal would be approved
by Congress. While he did not go to negotiate, he emerged from a
meeting with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji saying that China
``strongly'' wants the talks to be completed before the trade
organization convenes global negotiations in Seattle on Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   If China is not a member, it will have only ``observer'' status
in the trade organization, and thus will not be able to exert as
much influence over the agenda of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear whether Zhu still holds the power he did in
April, when he arrived in Washington with a surprisingly detailed
offer of trade concessions to complete a deal. Clinton balked at
the time _ on the advice of political advisers and the treasury
secretary at the time, Robert E. Rubin _ for fear that Congress
would not approve the deal. Within days Clinton determined that he
had made an error, aides said. But by then Zhu had lost face, and
the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade a few weeks later
froze any negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Since then China's economy has gotten in deeper trouble, and
political opponents to radically opening the domestic Chinese
market have gained ground. ``It's much tougher today for both Zhu
and Jiang,'' one administration official close to the talks said
recently. ``Clearly there is a fight on within the leadership over
the wisdom of going ahead now.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a parallel fight under way in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, who urged
Clinton to take the deal in April, has now warned against appearing
too eager. But Clinton is now ``very anxious'' to put together the
deal he missed, according to one close aide, in part because he
sees it as the key to rebuilding a relationship with China. ``This
is a legacy thing,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain Clinton's call to Jiang earlier this month, in
which, by some accounts, he hinted that the United States would put
together a bottom-line proposal and get it to the Chinese quickly.
It is unclear whether that proposal has yet been delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the White House and Ms. Barshefsky's office are still
arguing over who is more responsible for Zhu's political problems
since the April trip. The origin of the argument is the
administration's decision to publish a list of China's concessions
when he was still here. They were posted for a while on the White
House Internet site, and faxed around Washington by the trade
representative's office. The intent was to lock China into the
concessions it had made so far.
</P>
<P>
   When Zhu returned home, without a deal, he faced angry Chinese
entrepreneurs _ and longtime political enemies who argued his
economic reforms were going too far. Ever since, he has been under
pressure to retract some concessions, particularly in areas like
foreign ownership of Chinese telecommunications businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether a final deal, if one is reached,
will be more or less advantageous to the United States than the
deal nearly made in April. China needs to show that it limited its
concessions. Clinton must show that he got more than China was
ready to offer in April. In other words, both sides must find a way
to strike an agreement that they can sell at home as a political
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if the business community describes this as a
good deal, it will have a good chance in Congress, a very good
chance,'' said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., and chairman of the
House Rules Committee. ``But we should have done this deal months
ago.''

HOUSE PASSES BILL TO ADDRESS USE OF INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JERI CLAUSING    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House of Representatives passed legislation
Tuesday to crack down on cyber squatting, the practice of buying up
popular words as Internet addresses in the hopes of reselling them
to companies and trademark holders at a hefty profit.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was passed on a voice vote despite an effort by
opponents to slow down action on the proposal. A similar version
has already been passed in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation will make cyber-squatters think twice before
trying to profit off the hard work of others,'' Rep. J.C. Watts Jr.
of Oklahoma, the House Republican conference chairman, said of the
bill by Rep. James E. Rogan, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians, however, are concerned that the proposals,
which now go to a House-Senate conference committee, will trample
on free speech on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail campaign over the weekend, the Association for
Computing Machinery, a group of computer professionals, circulated
a message to get Internet users to urge members of Congress to vote
against the bill, arguing that it would ``grant sweeping new powers
for trademark holders and undermine the rights of domain name
holders, Internet users and small businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The group also said the legislation would undermine a policy
recently adopted by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers, which was picked last year by the Clinton administration
to oversee administration of the Internet's addressing system.
</P>
<P>
   That policy aims to reduce court battles over domains by
establishing a uniform international arbitration system for
resolving such disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate bills outlaw ``bad faith''
registrations of Internet addresses, or domain names, that use
movie, book or product titles or the names of large companies that
might later be interested in using those addresses to build an
Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to get
coveted Internet addresses away from those who had registered them.
Other companies, however, have refused to pay what they consider to
be the equivalent of a ransom, and have instead taken squatters to
court.
</P>
<P>
   In the House and Senate bills, bad faith is defined as using an
Internet domain name that dilutes or is identical or confusingly
similar to a trademark. The House bill gives courts the power to
revoke a pirated domain name, and authorizes damages of up to
$100,000 to be paid to a plaintiff. The Senate bill also
establishes criminal penalties for repeat offenders.

 &HT;    Bradley is Granny D's presidential candidate
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, N.H. _ Granny D, the diminutive 89-year-old walking
across America to promote campaign finance reform, gave her support
to Bill Bradley Tuesday in his final campaign appearance before
preparing for tonight's debate with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing her orange safety vest, straw hat and Adidas sneakers,
Doris Haddock, the icon of campaign finance reformers, strolled
about four blocks with Bradley while a media task force watched
every step.
</P>
<P>
   Walking 10 miles every day, Haddock began her trek in California
last January and has walked 2,200 miles. She hopes to complete her
3,300-mile journey on Jan. 24, her 90th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Flying in from Kentucky to meet with Bradley, they held a rally
at the same site where President Clinton and then-House Speaker
Newt Gingrich shook hands and pledged to change the way they raised
money for campaigns. ``And it's still not done,'' Haddock said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who is flying to Jacksonville on Thursday for a private
money-raising event, applauded Granny D's efforts and said he
intends to continue to make campaign finance reform a major issue
of his campaign for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The issue could come up tonight during the first nationally
televised ``town hall'' meeting between the two candidates. Gore
spent the morning in Concord with high school students, wrapping a
red ribbon around the state Capitol, which he kept incorrectly
calling ``the courthouse'' to show his support for fighting drugs
in schools.
</P>
<P>
   In a fierce struggle with the former New Jersey senator to win
the New Hampshire primary, Gore is expected to be the aggressor
tonight. The format allows citizens to ask each candidate a
question and no direct counterpoint is allowed. But, if past
presidential forums are any indication, rules will quickly give
way.
</P>
<P>
   Polls over the weekend show the two men tied among likely
primary voters. Gore brought hundreds of volunteers here over the
weekend to go door to door as he tries to run his campaign like an
underdog.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley enters the forum, on CNN at 8 p.m. today from Dartmouth
College, confronting a candidate more familiar with the intensity
and high stakes of these televised events.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the nation, the presidential campaign is still a
distant sound. Here in New Hampshire, however, the sound is
roaring. Political ads fill the airwaves. Candidates roam the state
every day. While much of the country may watch tonight's World
Series game, many Granite staters are expected to be glued to the
political game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take this all very seriously,'' said Irene Dunnelly, 38, of
Concord. ``We're proud of being the first state to have a primary
and I think we have a responsibility to make an effort to make an
informed vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and Gore planned to spend most of today preparing
for the forum. The last time the two met, at a Democratic dinner in
Iowa, Bradley was caught off-guard when Gore, during a speech,
challenged Bradley to a series of debates and asked him to stand up
if he agreed. Bradley didn't take the bait.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bradley agreed to a series of six joint appearances. For
this first encounter, Bradley's advisers said he is preparing for
anything that Gore might do. Gore, who successfully debated Vice
President Dan Quayle in 1992 and Jack Kemp in 1996, is determined
to use this forum to erode Bradley's increasing popularity here.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is doing poorly in some national polls but he has shown
considerable strength in this state of often cantankerous voters.
After the meeting with Granny D, Bradley spent the afternoon
reading and rehearsing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have brought several people in to prep him and one will be
playing the part of Gore,'' said Eric Hauser, Bradley's spokesman.
He declined to say who was helping Bradley get ready.
</P>
<P>
   Expect Gore to portray Bradley as an old school liberal Democrat
who wants to spend millions of dollars on new government programs
that will not work. He is likely to repeat his accusation that when
Bradley left the Senate in 1998, he abandoned the party during its
fight with right-wing Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is likely to counter that Gore is too much a part of
Washington, someone out of touch with average voters. So far,
Bradley has not made any direct reference to the scandals involving
the administration and Hauser refused to say whether Bradley would
do so tonight.

SELIG, GRAY PAYING FOR ROSE WRONGDOING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Baseball commissioner Bud Selig says that the issue
of Pete Rose's longstanding petition for reinstatement ``willdressed in the coming months.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC on-field reporter Jim Gray says he's sorry if he ruined all
the warm and fuzzy feelings you'd worked up over Pete's inclusion
on the All-Century Team.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged Yankees players say they may never talk to Gray again
unless, of course, the value of the ``grift'' certificate per
appearance gets better.
</P>
<P>
   Is everybody happy now? Can we just get on with the World
Series?
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after his suspension for gambling, Rose is still
upstaging the game. Typical. Give him an inch and he'll pocket your
shiny new Stanley tape measure.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Selig, who thought he was being a nice guy by allowing
Rose's name to be included on the All-Century Team ballot in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the one who made the decision this summer to include
him,'' Selig said before Game 3 of the Series last night at Yankee
Stadium. ``I was in Boston \R for the All-Star Game\S and I took a
long walk one afternoon and decided that he should be there,
because it was, after all, an election. I'm not going to
second-guess myself on that now.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been ``small and petty'' on baseball's part, Selig
felt, to not allow the fans their chance to vote for ``all'' the
best players of the past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bad decisions have a way of blowing up in people's faces. This
one has become almost a nuclear disaster for baseball, which has
seen Rose's appearance and Gray's aggressive pregame interview with
him Sunday night become the hottest story of the Series,
threatening to overshadow the games themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're much better off with the focus on the field,'' Selig
said. ``This is the World Series, after all. The All-Century Team
ceremony meant so much to me. It was a celebration and, of course,
I'm disappointed that anything would detract from that.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC, Selig said, would be addressing the situation on its
pregame show before last night's telecast. If he expected a major
``mea culpa'' from the network or Gray, however, he must have sadly
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like most baseball fans, you were probably outraged by
Gray's persistent line of questioning, coming on the heels of an
emotional ceremony, heightened by Rose's first appearance on a
Major League Baseball diamond in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But Gray is my new hero. Among that small cadre of those who
call themselves ``journalists,'' it was refreshing to actually see
a TV reporter with some bulldog in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best interview I've ever seen,'' is how longtime ``New
York Times'' baseball writer Murray Chass characterized it.
</P>
<P>
   Gray was basically doing the same thing a group of columnists
and baseball writers had done an hour and a half earlier, when Rose
appeared at a print-dominated media conference.
</P>
<P>
   Is he ready to admit that he bet on baseball? Will he ask Selig
and baseball to forgive him? Is he sorry that he broke baseball's
most sacred rule?
</P>
<P>
   Pete, as usual, just said no, no and no, and pointed out, in his
typical self-serving way, that if he ever did get a plaque at
Cooperstown, ``It'll have to be as long as this table I'm sitting
at.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans continue to see Rose as he was as a player: entertaining,
exuberant, delightful. The reality is that he's a self-centered,
bitter man with a gambling addiction, who refuses to accept
responsibility for his own mistakes, no matter how high the
evidence is stacked.
</P>
<P>
   Those media critics who have criticized Gray wonder if he really
thought Rose would ``confess'' during that brief pregame interview.
I wonder if those critics have ever broken a story in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Gray was doing his job. He asked the questions a journalist is
supposed to ask. If Rose ``had'' appeared contrite and apologetic
for the first time, Gray would have had the ``scoop'' of the year
and the warm and fuzzies you were already feeling would have
multiplied exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   Did his tenacious line of questioning take away from the
occasion? Obviously it did. You, the fans, have made that
abundantly clear. You probably weren't all that thrilled with his
on-air ``apology'' last night, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``After viewing the videotape, I can understand the reaction of
many baseball fans,'' a nervous-looking Gray said. ``I thought that
it was important to ask Pete Rose if this was the right moment to
make an apology. If, in doing so, the interview went too long and
took out some of the joy of the occasion, then I want to say to
baseball fans everywhere that I'm very sorry about this.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have been fun if the network had instructed Bob Costas
to grill Gray as he had Rose _ ``Jim, are you ready to show
contrition, admit your interview was overzealous and make some sort
of apology to that effect?'' _ but that wasn't going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Gray's statement was brief and to the point and NBC, which just
wants this controversy to go away because it actually does value
Gray's reporting instincts, moved quickly back to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   And not a moment too soon for most of us.

HOLBROOKE ACCUSES HOUSE OF HURTING U.S. ROLE IN THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. representative
at the United Nations, went on the offensive against the
Republican-led House of Representatives on Tuesday, charging that
persistent congressional tampering with budget bills covering
foreign operations and payments to the United Nations was damaging
American national security interests.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after President Clinton vetoed the second of two
foreign spending bills because of riders he could not accept,
Holbrooke said that House Republicans had effectively rigged the
legislation with a provision that would have guaranteed the loss of
the American seat in the General Assembly by delaying allocations
past a Dec. 31 payment deadline set under rules established in the
U.N. charter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not with the Senate; it's with the House,'' he
told a breakfast meeting of the Association for a Better New York.
As it is, the United States could lose its Assembly seat even if
Congress passed an acceptable bill because of conditions it
attached to payments.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they have only a few critical weeks
to renew negotiations to try to find agreement on foreign spending.
``I believe this is fixable in the dramatic endgame of the budget
process, which has now begun,'' Holbrooke later told reporters
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming majority of the people of both parties in
both houses of Congress want a strong national security,'' he said.
``We need to band together now on a bipartisan basis to push back
the forces of that small group of people who want to destroy United
States national security interests and simultaneously do
immeasurable damage to the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans do not disagree that time is running out on
legislation to pay U.N. dues, or at least that part of the total
that Congress recognizes as American debt.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans say that Democrats are to blame for not sticking
to a pact negotiated between Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of
the Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the
ranking minority leader. The pact accepted certain conditions _
including a demand for a no-growth U.N. budget and a seat on the
organization's budgetary committee for the United States _ in
return for $926 million. The United Nations calculates the American
debt closer to $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that last-minute Democratic efforts in the House
to strip budget bills of conditions such as bars against aid to
organizations that promote abortion abroad generated hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the administration to work something out with the
House,'' said March Thiessen, spokesman for the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. ``But they have to be flexible and they have
to be creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton vetoed the Foreign Operations bill, which
fell far short of money he had requested for a range of programs,
including support for the Wye River accord on the Middle East. On
Monday, he vetoed the Commerce, Justice and State bill, which
includes U.N. payments. Allocations for other, domestic programs
were also considered unacceptable by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke drew links this morning between the budget impasse and
crucial U.N. projects supported by the United States now in
jeopardy for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
   The extensive U.N. civilian mission in Kosovo, pushed in the
Security Council by Washington, is running out of money and will
soon not be able to pay for local police officers and civil
servants, Holbrooke said. He and other diplomats consider the
establishment of functioning civilian institutions in Kosovo
critical to the reputation of the United Nations in rebuilding life
in shattered territories _ East Timor is next _ as well as to the
longterm success of the NATO military operation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said he had received a phone call over the weekend
from Bernard Kouchner, the U.N. civil administrator in Kosovo,
raising an alarm and pleading for help. Four months after the
establishment of the Kosovo mission, the United States has
contributed only $4 million to a voluntary start-up trust fund of
$27 million. Washington has yet to pay any of the $39 million it
has been assessed for regular contributions to the mission, and a
larger bill looms next year.

 &HT;    700 inmates evacuated in wake of water plant crisis
 &HT;    By Pat Moore and Sally Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANTOWN, Fla. _ A shutdown of Martin Correctional
Institution's water system forced the prison to evacuate 700 of the
state's most dangerous inmates Tuesday as crews scrambled to make
emergency repairs to a water plant plagued by breakdowns, sickening
odors and contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Corrections Secretary Michael Moore declared an
emergency at the maximum-security prison north of Indiantown where
persistent problems at the self-contained water plant, worsened by
flooding from Hurricane Irene, left inmates without working
toilets, showers and drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   For years, state environmental officials have criticized MCI
authorities for ignoring prisoner complaints and failing to warn
inmates of potential health hazards because of fears they would
riot.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the inmates from the prison's main compound and
neighboring work treatment center were loaded onto about a dozen
prison buses and sent to the South Florida Reception Center Annex
in Miami-Dade County. Workers set up portable toilets and trucked
in water for about 500 prisoners left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inmates in for more serious crimes and serving long
sentences were handcuffed and shackled, but others were not,''
prison spokeswoman Joellyn Rackleff said. ``The (most dangerous)
inmates in close management or disciplinary confinement for
aggressive behavior were not moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials could not say how long the inmates would be
kept in Miami-Dade County, but they expected repairs to take ``a
couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   MCI operates its own water plant just outside the prison gates.
The plant gets water from seven nearby wells. Department of
Environmental Protection records show the wells have continually
been clogged, out of service and unproductive. They also note
problems with bad odors and the prison's failure to complete a DEP
survey on the water system.
</P>
<P>
   Rackleff said one well failed Sunday and two more shut down
Monday night, dropping pressure too low to provide safe drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
   DEP staff members' notes of a phone conversation with plant
officials Tuesday show the plant was ``slap out of water'' at 7:30
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no health danger at this point _ just an
inconvenience to the prisoners,'' said Martin County Health
Department spokesman Bob Washam, whose office was monitoring the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Buses sent to MCI from prisons throughout the state were loaded
with 50 inmates apiece Tuesday afternoon and night before leaving
for the prison west of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Such a massive transfer is not unprecedented, prison officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We relocated 4,000 inmates during Hurricane Floyd, including
more than 900 inmates from Brevard Correctional Institution and
nearly 400 inmates from Indian River Correctional Institution,''
Rackleff said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the evacuation began, inmates were served meals on paper
plates with plastic utensils, and bottled water was used to wash
pots and pans.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates initially used buckets of water to flush toilets early
in the day and later used portable toilets brought in and lined up
along sidewalks inside the prison's razor-wire fences.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials bypassed normal bidding procedures under the
emergency order and authorized a Palm City engineering firm to
begin immediate repairs and drill new wells.
</P>
<P>
   While repairs are under way, tankers will supply 100,000 gallons
of water a day to build up the pressure in the water system.
</P>
<P>
   That water should allow the most dangerous inmates, who were not
moved from confinement cells, to flush toilets. They may not be
able to flush after every use, but often enough to meet health
department concerns, Rackleff said.
</P>
<P>
   DEP officials gave permission Tuesday for the prison system to
build a recycling plant to treat sewage water that could be used to
flush toilets, reducing the water consumption 40 percent to 50
percent, Rackleff said.
</P>
<P>
   She said MCI's water problems began during the summer as the
prison's water consumption rose to 700,000 gallons a day. The wells
supply water to the prison, as well as the minimum-security work
camp and Martin Treatment Center for sexual offenders next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had put out bids to get two new wells drilled, but got only
one response and that (price) was too high,'' Rackleff said. ``We
were in the process of rebidding the job when this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   At the adjacent center for sexual offenders, Director Robert
Briody said six portable toilets were set up for its residents in
the recreation yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the evacuation of 700 inmates next door, we're hoping
that will give us enough water pressure to use four or five times a
day,'' he said. ``If that happens, we won't have to evacuate.''
</P>
<P>
   Briody said the 90 men held at the center under the Jimmy Ryce
Act for sex offenders _ deemed by experts likely to commit new
crimes if released into society _ were ``a little upset about
this'' early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Once the portable toilets were in place, they ``seemed
reasonable about it,'' he said. ``We had bag lunches and will have
to do the same for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the prison was violating health regulations,
Washam of the health department said: ``It's an emergency
situation, but they do need to take all the action they can to get
the water flowing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they have toilets, as long as they have safe
drinking water and a way to wash their hands before they eat or
after they use the toilet, they're OK.''
</P>
<P>
   A toll free hot line, (877) 822-1987, was established for
inmates' family members to find out visitation schedules for
inmates moved away from MCI.

IN MIDST OF STRIKE, EX-EMPLOYEE CHARGES TRUCKING FIRM FIRED UNION
SUPPORTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to turn up the pressure during its three-day-old
strike against Overnite Transportation, the Teamsters Union
deployed an unusual weapon Tuesday _ a former Overnite manager who
said the company systematically broke the law by dismissing workers
who supported the union.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Watson, a former operations manager in Overnite's trucking
terminal in Memphis, said the company dismissed several hundred
workers at the terminal over the last four years because they
favored unionizing Overnite, the nation's largest nonunion trucking
company.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit and a telephone news conference, Watson backed
the Teamsters' charges that Overnite has brazenly and repeatedly
violated the law in seeking to rebuff the teamsters' drive to
unionize the company's 8,600 drivers and dock workers.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said company managers had a ``hit list'' designed to
dismiss union supporters, and he added that he had followed his
superiors' orders by helping eliminate more than 40 pro-union
workers since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Federal labor law makes it illegal for any company to fire or
retaliate against an employee for supporting a union. The
International Brotherhood of Teamsters has been seeking to organize
Overnite since 1994 and has filed dozens of charges with the
National Labor Relations Board accusing the company of dismissing
or retaliating against union supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Overnite officials said Tuesday that Watson's comments were made
out of vengeance for the company's dismissing him last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Rosenfeld, an Overnite spokesman, called Watson's statements
``absolutely ridiculous'' and said the company has not fired
workers for supporting the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no hit list, and there never has been a hit list,''
he said. ``This is a gentleman who was fired last week for poor
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he has no idea why he was fired. He said that to
push out union supporters, company managers often gave them
demerits when they arrived a few minutes late to work, but did not
do the same to union opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much injustice being done to employees,'' said
Watson, who said he came forward because he was so upset with how
Overnite treats its employees.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began at the Memphis terminal on Sunday and spread
nationwide on Monday. The Teamsters said they called the strike to
protest unfair labor practices by Overnite.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld said the strike was having a negligible effect. He
said only 600 workers were on strike, and he asserted that the
Teamsters picketed fewer terminals Tuesday than the 40 they had
picketed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sharply disagreeing, Dave Cameron, a Teamsters' spokesman, said
that more than 2,000 workers were on strike Tuesday, with the
picketing expanding to 109 of Overnite's 166 terminals. Cameron
maintained that the strike was disrupting Overnite's operations and
costing the company millions of dollars.

EDITORIAL: NEXT STEPS ON NORTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Oct. 27: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   North Korea, the secretive Stalinist dictatorship with the
ability to build nuclear bombs and intercontinental missiles, poses
one of the most dangerous foreign policy problems facing America.
But the North's rulers, beset by crop failures and isolated by the
worldwide collapse of communism, may now see their best chance of
survival not in continued belligerence but in a broad accommodation
with the United States. The Clinton administration's long-awaited
policy review on North Korea says the time has come to test that
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The review, which was recently made public, calls for steps to
engage Pyongyang diplomatically and economically, as well as to
prepare for possible confrontation and conflict. That is the right
mix, although there are no guarantees the North will respond
appropriately. Still, the costs of any future military clash on the
Korean Peninsula would be so heavy that it would be foolish not to
give diplomacy every realistic chance to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposals, drawn up mainly by William
Perry, the former secretary of defense, advocate building on
policies of the past five years, including the deal that has
successfully frozen North Korea's production of nuclear bomb fuel
in exchange for international help in building a new civilian power
reactor. But Perry would now go further, offering steps toward
diplomatic recognition and an end to most American economic
sanctions if the North abandons its efforts to build long-range
missiles and nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   There is logic in such a broad deal, even though North Korea's
behavior continues to be erratic and provocative. If Pyongyang
really seeks accommodation with Washington, it has a very limited
number of bargaining chips, primarily its bomb and missile
programs. If discussions proceed one issue at a time, the North
will be tempted to hold some chips in reserve. A comprehensive
offer could resolve all issues at once. But the North's real
intentions remain unknown. So Perry rightly urges the United
States, South Korea and Japan to remain militarily prepared to
defend their interests should the North spurn a deal or fail to
carry one out.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's report has gotten a skeptical reception from
congressional Republicans, who would prefer more limited and
gradual negotiations to test Pyongyang's good faith and who urge
strengthened military defenses on the Korean Peninsula. But only
the executive branch can conduct diplomacy and prepare American
forces for possible combat. The Republicans should let the
administration proceed on the course Perry proposes, monitoring its
progress as the situation evolves.

NANULA TO HEAD BROADBAND SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he resigned as president and chief operating officer of the
world's largest hotel company in April, the conventional wisdom was
that after a summer vacation, Richard D. Nanula would land a
similarly important job with a big company in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   So much for conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Broadband Sports Inc., a fledgling Internet company
based in Los Angeles, said it had hired Nanula as its chairman and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Nanula, 39, left Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc.
after less than a year because of a protracted and severe ego clash
with his friend, Barry S. Sternlicht, Starwood's chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, Sternlicht, who has known Nanula since they were
classmates at Harvard Business School, persuaded his friend to
leave the Walt Disney Co., where he was chief financial officer,
and move east to work at Starwood, which is based in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Because he had held big jobs with big companies, it was logical
to assume that Nanula would seek _ and be sought _ by another
corporate giant. The $6 million house he bought in Greenwich,
Conn., a dwelling he has only occupied since March, was seen as
another reason to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Nanula did not say how many big companies approached him about
jobs. But in a telephone interview from Los Angeles, he said going
down that road again did not hold much appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't consider a big company very much,'' he said. ``I had
done that for a while, and I thought this would be a new
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadband Sports, which has 125 employees, is certainly not big.
But the privately held company, which was founded in 1998 by Tyler
S. Goodman, has several well-known, deep-pocketed investors who are
impressed with its prospects _ a group that includes Michael Dell,
the founder of Dell Computer, and Frank J. Biondi Jr., the former
chief executive of Universal Studios Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadband Sports has a compelling business model,'' Biondi
said in a statement announcing Nanula's appointment. ``Unlike most
online media companies, it derives its revenue from a combination
of E-commerce, content syndication, advertising, sponsorship and
subscriptions to premium content offerings. It is structured for
balanced and substantial growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadband Sports has five online properties, including Athlete
Direct, the leading provider of official Web sites for more than
200 professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his most recent position at Starwood, Nanula said he had
no previous personal or professional connection with Broadband
Sports. He was introduced to Goodman by partners at Sequoia
Capital, the venture capital firm that is Broadband's biggest
investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love business and sports,'' he said. ``I like Tyler, the
assets the company has, as well as the position it has in Internet
sports space. And I thought it would be fun and interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting talented executives from big, established companies
to run promising but comparatively unstructured Internet operations
is a dicey business.
</P>
<P>
   James Citrin, managing director of the new global Internet
practice at the executive search firm Spencer Stuart, has known
Nanula since Harvard Business School. He said the challenge Nanula
faces was one he had not confronted since he left Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard has one of the most amazingly quick minds of anyone I
have ever met,'' Citrin said. ``But he is going to have to focus on
rolling up his sleeves himself and operate as he did right out of
B-school, a time when he didn't have big support staff. He hasn't
had to do that for quite a while.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his compensation package, Nanula said he would
receive options to acquire 10 percent to 12 percent of Broadband's
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Nanula may well use some of the $2.35 million in severance pay
he received from Starwood to exercise some of those options. Given
the white-hot market for residential real estate in Greenwich, the
house could be another source of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it, it's beautiful and I just moved in,'' Nanula said.
``But I will relocate back to the Los Angeles area and will
probably sell the house, either immediately or eventually.''

RETHINKING THE EMPHASIS ON PREPARING FOR HIGH-TECH JOBS  
</HEADLINE>
   (This new national education column will run weekly in the national
pages. It will be written every other week by Richard Rothstein, an
independent education analyst, and on the off-weeks by a member of
The New York Times staff.)  
(mcd) 
 By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've got bipartisan agreement that our new high-tech economy
demands radical education reforms. What worked once won't work
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   As Al Gore puts it, 60 percent of new jobs will require advanced
technological skills. Bill Bradley says school improvement is one
thing we need to lead in the 21st century. George W. Bush demands
reform because our new economy requires higher skills.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not really true. Overall skill growth required by jobs
of the future is modest. In fact, skill requirements are growing
more slowly than in the past. School improvement may be a good
idea, but we need better reasons for it than a false skills crisis
because if we reform schools for the wrong reasons, we will reform
them in the wrong ways.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, schools must prepare young people for millions of new
jobs. But, while technologically sophisticated jobs will grow, the
biggest chunk of openings will be in services _ and not very
high-tech services at that.
</P>
<P>
   In the next decade, about 5 million new jobs will be created for
food workers, including kitchen help, waiters and waitresses.
Another 4 million will be for cashiers and retail salespeople. More
than 3 million will be for clerks. Two million will be for helpers,
packagers and laborers. Openings for truck drivers, machine
operators and construction tradesmen will abound.
</P>
<P>
   Managerial and professional occupations will also need more
workers, but their numbers pale compared with openings requiring
less education. Employers will hire more than three times as many
cashiers as engineers. They will need more than twice as many
food-counter workers, waiters and waitresses than all the systems
analysts, computer engineers, mathematicians and database
administrators combined. We will be hiring more nurses, but even
more janitors and maids.
</P>
<P>
   How did we convince ourselves that schools must prepare an
entire generation of youths who know calculus? Partly, we have
confused occupational growth rates with the number of new jobs.
Computer engineering and science employment will increase by a
whopping 100 percent, while food service grows by only 11 percent.
But computer science is a relatively small field, so new positions
generate rapid growth rates. There are more waitresses today, so
smaller percentage growth yields more new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   We are also misled by a truism that more employees use computers
at work. We forget that computers often reduce skill levels. Think
about supermarket cashiers using computers to scan bar codes. Many
workers may need less education, not more, when jobs are
computerized.
</P>
<P>
   And we naturally focus on what is new, overlooking what is
unchanged. Amazon.com may market in cyberspace, but it creates more
jobs for warehousemen than for Web site designers. It takes no more
education to drive a forklift at Amazon than at Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we do face some shortages in skills. But we also have
many jobs where workers, including college graduates, are now
overeducated for tasks they perform. And many shortages in skills
are temporary. We don't have enough engineers, but a decade ago we
had too many. Students then, seeing few openings, switched to other
fields, creating today's shortage.
</P>
<P>
   In time, supply and demand will readjust. We shouldn't confuse
shortages in specific fields with an overall lack of academic
qualifications. The Labor Department projects an increase from 1996
to 2006 of less than 1 percent in the overall share of workers in
occupations requiring a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   False expectations that if all children get higher math scores
they will all get better jobs encourage us to duck critical
decisions about how schools relate to society. We rightly want
schools to equip rich and poor, black and white, to compete equally
for better jobs. And we want all young people, regardless of
background, to get good jobs, for which we expect better schools to
qualify them.
</P>
<P>
   But this hope can't be fulfilled. We already enroll enough
college students to fill foreseeable vacancies in professional
fields. Increasing the number of applicants does little to increase
the number of vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   So we face a challenge: If academic outcomes improve for all,
what will determine which children win, and which lose, that race?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that schools further narrow achievement gaps between
advantaged and disadvantaged children. If highly paid, highly
skilled jobs are limited, and more children from Brooklyn win them,
fewer children from Scarsdale will do so. If improved
qualifications empower more poor children to become computer
scientists, more rich children will have to settle for being
waiters.
</P>
<P>
   This seems decent and fair, but we have a lot of introspection,
debate and economic reform ahead before it can happen. Perhaps, for
example, raising academic achievement for disadvantaged children
also requires, as a practical matter, raising the relative pay of
waiters to make these jobs more acceptable to advantaged children
(and to their parents, who are asked to pay taxes to improve the
competitiveness of inner-city graduates).
</P>
<P>
   We can't face these critical issues of 21st-century education
with minds clouded by a ``high tech jobs of the future'' fog.

PRESSURE ON HERTA
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARITA, Calif. _ Bryan Herta has something to prove at
this week's CART Marlboro 500: to Bobby Rahal, other potential race
team owners and himself.
</P>
<P>
   Herta's final race with Bobby Rahal's team will come in the CART
FedEx series finale on Sunday at the California Speedway in
Fontana. A good finish in the race will go a long way in securing a
ride for the Valencia driver for next season.
</P>
<P>
   After three straight top-five finishes in his past three races,
including a victory at Laguna Seca in Monterey on Sept. 12, Herta,
28, has become one of the hottest drivers on the series.
</P>
<P>
   A good showing at California Speedway in Fontana on Sunday in
the 1999 season finale Marlboro 500 will assuredly secure Herta a
spot with another CART FedEx team. No one knows the importance of
this weekend's race better than him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most important race of my career,'' said Herta, a
Hart High graduate, ``because it's the next one. I'm still in a
position to get into the top nine in points if I can score some
good points at Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm going to be back in CART. My heart is in the
CART series. I am a race car driver. It's how I put food on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   A good showing at Fontana would go a long way toward impressing
potential team owners, including Dan Gurney and Cal Wells, who are
looking to sign Herta for next season.
</P>
<P>
   One of the knocks on Herta is that he has not performed well on
ovals. Even though his past three races have produced consecutive
front-row starts and top-five finishes, all were on road courses.
It's one of the reasons Rahal decided not to renew Herta's
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Bryan and our team didn't get off to a good start,''
Rahal said. ``I don't want to point fingers because I think both
were at fault early on. Our team hasn't been as competitive as I
would have liked on the ovals to start the season. We always knew
Bryan was very fast on road circuits. But we haven't had much
success on the ovals.''
</P>
<P>
   Six of the first seven races of the season were on ovals.
Herta's highest finish on an oval course came at the Grand Prix of
Miami to start the year. He finished 12th. Aside from the Rio 200,
Herta finished out of the top 20 in the other races.
</P>
<P>
   He admits his slow start sealed his fate and ended his
three-year relationship with Team Rahal. However, he said he feels
he deserved a better explanation for why his contract wasn't
renewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby never really gave me a good reason,'' Herta said. ``I
certainly don't plan on hanging around if he's not behind me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we came off a high note,'' he added, referring to
winning at Laguna Seca in 1998 and finishing eighth in the season
standings. ``Expectations were high and we stumbled out of the
blocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is faced with finding a new team, he has an
optimistic attitude about also finding success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is good,'' Herta said. ``Even though we've won some
races, the team hasn't lived up to my expectations. Maybe change is
good. Maybe I can find it somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   California Speedway, a two-mile oval that has produced
record-breaking speeds since its inception in 1997, can be a
proving ground for Herta to show that he can be competitive on
ovals as well as road courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing place,'' Herta said. ``One word describes it _
fast. It's really, really fast.''
</P>
<P>
   He understands how important this race could be to extending his
career in the CART series. So much so, that he tested at California
Speedway on Oct. 1, a week before leaving for Australia for the
Indy Carnival Australia. Herta clocked speeds of 235 mph and said
the tests were very successful.
</P>
<P>
   Herta's history at California Speedway has been marred by
disappointment. In his first race at the Fontana superspeedway in
1997, he qualified third but had engine troubles and dropped out
after completing only 80 laps. He was 21st.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he was running in the top 20 when he got into an
accident with 11 laps to go. He finished 15th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a totally different mindset,'' Herta said about racing at
California Speedway. ``In Australia, you can bounce the car off
curves and get away with a lot of things. But Fontana is smooth.
You got to walk a much narrower tight rope and still make the car
go as fast as it can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Herta's racing career dates back to 1982, when he started racing
go-karts at Indian Dunes off Highway 126 near Fillmore. Indian
Dunes has since closed, but from those roots sprouted a lifelong
love of auto racing.
</P>
<P>
   Herta continued to race karts at Ascot Speedway, competing
against the likes of fellow CART series drivers Richie Hearn and
P.J. Jones. It wasn't until he went to the Long Beach Grand Prix in
1985 that he decided he wanted to race Indy, or Champ, cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long Beach enthralled me,'' Herta said. ``I wanted to race at
Long Beach after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Herta realized his dream of racing at Long Beach, five times to
be exact. Continuing his dream lies in his next race. If he can be
competitive at Fontana, he might be able to race at Long Beach for
as long as he wants.

   Though their hearts and heads probably won't be fully into it,
29 of the world's best golfers will officially start the Tour
Championship on Thursday morning at Champions Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be an on-again, off-again tournament once it begins.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour elected to give players the option of attending
memorial services for Payne Stewart on Friday in Orlando, Fla., and
there will be no golf played at Champions that day.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there will be 27 holes played Thursday, with golfers
going off No. 10 tee, playing the back nine, then circling the
course again starting on No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the routine will be repeated, with players going off
No. 1, playing the full 18 holes, then playing the front nine
again. Sunday's round remains 18 holes to complete the 72-hole
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be difficult to really be focused on what you
are doing,'' said David Duval. ``I imagine everybody will be
playing and doing the best golf they can. But I don't know how
spectacular the golf will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans holding tickets for Friday's round can use those tickets
Thursday, Saturday or Sunday. This includes hospitality venues such
as the Jimmy Demaret Club, Executive Club, Dining Chalets and
Marquees.
</P>
<P>
   Champions Golf Club will be closed to the public Friday. Players
not attending the memorial will not be allowed to practice on the
Cypress Creek Course.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there will be a brief memorial service for Stewart
on Thursday at 7:45 a.m. on the No. 1 tee.
</P>
<P>
   The first tee time Thursday is at 8:39 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Tour Championship will be played under the pall of
Stewart's death, the pairings for the first 27 holes are
intriguing. Duval is paired with Tiger Woods in the last group,
scheduled to go off at 10:45 a.m. They are the two top-ranked
golfers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the next-to-last group at 10:36, Vijay Singh and Hal Sutton
are paired. They were the playoff participants from last year's
Tour Championship in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the tournament should go on, but obviously it's not
going to be an easy week for all of us,'' said Woods. ``It's going
to be a tough one.''
</P>
<P>
   Many players in the field have indicated they will take
advantage of Friday's break in the schedule to attend Stewart's
ceremony. The PGA Tour was working on getting several private jets
to shuttle players to and from Orlando. The service is at 10 a.m.
Houston time.
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen is how the players can focus their
attention on the Tour Championship, which has a $5 million purse
and $900,000 first-place check. Last place will be worth $81,000.
But remembering Stewart is far more pressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf tournament, it doesn't have the same emphasis as it
once did, and rightfully so,'' Woods said. The tour announced that
the Southern Farm Bureau Classic in Madison, Miss., also will be
shut down Friday out of respect for Stewart's memorial service. It
will be shortened to a 54-hole event.
</P>
<P>
   Television times for the Tour Championship will remain the same.
On Saturday, when ABC is set to show the tournament from 12:30-2:30
p.m., the leaders should be on the back nine during the telecast.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nineteen years ago, Roberta Guaspari, devastated by a
wrecked marriage, left her mother's house in upstate New York, took
her two little boys and moved to East Harlem with a crate full of
old violins and the need for a job. She talked her way into New
York City's Central Park East School, a center of progressive
public education where paint-spattered smocks spilled into the
hallways and even middle-class parents begged for admission. She
became something of a local hero, taking her best students to
perform at a triumphal concert at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Now Meryl Streep portrays Ms. Guaspari in a new movie, ``Music
of the Heart.'' In this version, she is the formidable teacher of
real life but plies her craft in a cultural wasteland of a school,
marred by drive-by shootings, lazy teachers and hostile parents.
</P>
<P>
   The change may seem harmless enough to a Hollywood screenwriter
looking for dramatic tension. From ``To Sir, With Love'' to
``Blackboard Jungle,'' the valiant teacher who saves the gritty
ghetto school is a movie staple. This time the teacher comes armed
with a violin, not a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   But to many educators and to those associated with Central Park
East, which is prominently named in ``Music of the Heart,'' the
dramatic license is a reminder of the nasty image that public
schools hold in the public imagination, perpetuated by movies,
books and politicians. The movie, they say, feeds the myth that any
teacher willing to be both strict and demanding will succeed, even
in the harshest of conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Ms. Guaspari, who still teaches at the school,
succeeded not as a lone ranger in a hostile environment, but by
thriving in a school marked by strong leadership, a collective
willingness to take chances and a shared sense of mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of me thinks, just ignore it, people will know that
Hollywood is fiction,'' said Deborah Meier, the founder of Central
Park East, who has since left New York to become the principal of
another progressive public school, the Mission School, in Boston's
inner city. ``But it rubs off. If they want to pretend she was in a
typical school, then invent a name, because a school lives by its
reputation and the faith that its families and communities feel in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meier, the mother of the small-schools movement, is herself
a Wild-West-style crusader, winner of a MacArthur ``genius'' grant
for her work in creating Central Park East, a group of three
elementary schools. She took a chance on Ms. Guaspari because she
saw a kindred spirit. ``Her existence depended on the unique nature
of these three schools,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, violence strikes like clockwork. A small child
brings a knife to school; a boy is killed in a drive-by; a
grandmother is murdered in a mugging, and a promising young
violinist tearfully gives up her instrument when her mother goes
into hiding in a battered women's shelter.
</P>
<P>
   A black mother pulls her son out of the violin program because
she objects to his learning ``dead white men's music.'' The tenured
music teacher (many schools do not have music teachers at all)
gleefully marks grades _ mostly F's _ while hapless students play
the recorder. In fact, the school does not give grades.
</P>
<P>
   There were no knives, no dead grandmothers and no drive-by
shootings _ though a student did die in a car accident in the
period the film chronicles. The black principal in the movie who
hired her, played by the glamorous Angela Bassett, was actually Ms.
Meier, a white woman more character actor than leading lady. No
parents complained about teaching classical music, Ms. Guaspari
said, although there was a vague feeling in the air that more
ethnic music might be a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the only public school I can think of where I
would send my children,'' Nancy Martinek, an administrative
assistant at a Wall Street investment firm, whose daughter, Katie,
and son, Adam, are in Ms. Guaspari's violin class, said in
disbelief, when told of the fictitious knife-wielding incident.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Stackhouse, whose son, Toussaint, 10, is in Ms.
Guaspari's class, agreed. ``This is not a stereotypic public
school,'' said Stackhouse, who is a teacher at another New York
school.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guaspari said that almost every calamity that befalls
schoolchildren in the movie was a fabrication. She agreed that the
neighborhood was dangerous. Until recently, she said, she heard
gunshots nearly weekly and couldn't use her backyard, which had
been comandeered as a dump by crack addicts in the building next
door. But she said the school had always been a refuge from the
filth and violence, and that was one of its main sources of
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to know that the environment that they portrayed is
not like our school,'' Ms. Guaspari said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meier said David Bensman, an outside researcher, traced the
first four graduating classes of Central Park East and found that
none of the students had died of violence, even 10 years later. In
a rough neighborhood like East Harlem, she said, that was
extraordinary. ``It was luck, but not only luck,'' she said. ``The
school keeps kids' hopes alive, which I think Roberta is a part
of.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, based on a 1996 documentary ``Small Wonders,'' tells
the story of how in 1991, after 11 years, the local school board
threatened to cut off Ms. Guaspari's funding. She enlisted the aid
of violinists Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman and Arnold Steinhardt who
played side by side with her students in a benefit concert at
Carnegie Hall in 1993. A foundation, Opus 118, now helps keep the
violin program alive. (Ms. Guaspari served as a consultant to the
new movie and spent most of the money she earned to buy an Italian
cello for her older son, Nick, and to fix up her backyard.)
</P>
<P>
   In her basement classroom last week, Ms. Guaspari, as in the
movie, was a strict but passionate teacher, more interested in
nurturing discipline and craft than self-esteem for its own sake.
``Stop! Stop! I can't stand it! You're out of tune!'' she yelled at
her class of 8- and 9-year-olds, their violins cushioned with
kitchen sponges, as they screeched through an etude in G major.
``Jordan, you need more sleep,'' she scolded a girl who kept
yawning. ``I always see the inside of your mouth in violin class.''
</P>
<P>
   Some drop out. Others take it in stride. ``She only yells for
special reasons,'' Katie Steinbach said. To Shakirah Gittens, the
result is worth it. ``I feel kind of good when I play the violin,''
she said. ``It feels like I'm on another planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guaspari, ever the idealist, hopes some greater good will
come of the movie, despite its oversimplification. ``I became known
because I was asked to leave and I didn't want to go,'' she said,
adding that it could all too easily happen again if people forget
what makes schools like Central Park East succeed.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Dozens of Israeli police officers briefly surrounded
the elegant American Colony Hotel Tuesday, turning a converted
pasha's palace _ an institution in the Arab part of the city _ into
a short-lived front line in the battle over Jerusalem's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were summoned after a showdown between Israeli and
Palestinian security officials over who should guard the British
foreign minister, Robin Cook, during a meeting with Palestinian
officials. The meeting is to be, in fact, on the very topic of
Jerusalem's contested identity.
</P>
<P>
   In an absurdist scene that lasted over an hour, well-heeled
guests were barred from entering or leaving the luxury hotel, and
Palestinian waiters pleaded with Israeli officers to let them
deliver room service trays to outlying rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, whose last trip to the Middle East was marked by
controversy, visited the hotel to attend a meeting with Faisal
Husseini, the Palestine Liberation Organization's representative in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Husseini, who runs Orient House, the PLO headquarters a block
from the hotel that the previous Israeli government tried to shut
down, is always accompanied by security guards.
</P>
<P>
   The incident began when Husseini's guards refused entrance to
the grand Pasha Room to an Israeli security officer assigned to
Cook for his trip. They declared the meeting a British-Palestinian
diplomatic event closed to the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   An argument, including shoving, began, after which the Israeli
security official called the police for help.
</P>
<P>
   As the police arrived to encircle the hotel, whose lobby held
Palestinian and British flags, Cook ended his meeting and left
without comment about the tensions inside.
</P>
<P>
   The British were eager to avoid a diplomatic incident. Cook had
split his time between the Gaza Strip and Tel Aviv, between Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime
minister. He almost avoided getting mired in Jerusalem politics,
but not quite.
</P>
<P>
   After Cook's departure, a high-ranking police official pleaded
with Husseini to turn over his guards for questioning and keep the
incident from getting out of hand. The police appeared ready to
enter the hotel and seize the guards. But Yair Yitzhaki, the local
police chief, persuaded Husseini to surrender the guards, who
Yitzhaki later said had attacked the Israeli security officer.
</P>
<P>
   The incident ended.
</P>
<P>
   Husseini charged that the Israelis were trying to humiliate not
only the Palestinians but also the British delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened simply because the Israelis are feeling that they
don't control the city,'' he said. ``The only way to deal with us
is through power, they think.''
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawing the security cordon from around the hotel, Yitzhaki
said, ``I don't want to talk politics.''

DONAHUE TO BECOME HEAD COACH?

   LOS ANGELES _ Will Terry Donahue be the next former UCLA coach
to become a head coach in the NFL?
</P>
<P>
   Donahue, an assistant with Vermeil who would have followed him
to the Eagles in 1976 if he had not been named his successor at
UCLA, is now in his first season as the 49ers' director of player
personnel under Bill Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are suddenly in decline and people assume Donahue
wants to be an NFL head coach. Speculation is rife in the Bay Area
that Walsh has set up Donahue to become the 49ers next coach should
Steve Mariucci falter.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue gave it his best non-denial denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't worry about what people think or say, or what their
opinions are,'' Donahue said. ``I learned long ago you never rule
out anything. I mean, who knows what's going to happen? Right now,
I'm on a track to become a general manager. I'm learning the ins
and outs of being a general manager from Bill Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm doing right now, today. Now will I be doing
that two years from now? Who knows? But I'm having a good time and
I'm enjoying this. It's been interesting.''

ANXIOUS WIFE TRIED TO CALL STEWART DURING FATAL FLIGHT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Payne Stewart's wife, Tracey, was one of the
millions of people transfixed by television reports Monday about
his Learjet flying uncontrolled across the United States, and she
tried to call him on his cellular phone, a family member said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She tried to ring Payne on his cell phone, but she couldn't
raise him,'' said Mike Ferguson, a brother of Mrs. Stewart, whose
husband, the golf champion, died with five others in the plane,
which crashed in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators began a tedious search for clues, the
electronic age added another twist to the old-fashioned tragedy of
a plane crash: an advertisement offering the doomed plane for sale
was still posted Tuesday on the Web page of the operator, Sunjet
Aviation. The plane had a new interior installed in July 1998,
including a compact disc sound system and ``medium gray carpet
w/gray accents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft is in premium condition inside and out,'' the
advertisement said.
</P>
<P>
   Crash investigators said Tuesday that the Learjet, which flew
1,400 miles before it crashed near Mina, S.D., had buried itself
deeply in the soft mud, promising a laborious task. The plane
apparently hit the ground at a high angle, creating a compact field
of debris, and Robert Francis, the vice chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board, speaking near the crash site, said it
would take time to recover the pieces in a way that preserved all
possible information.
</P>
<P>
   Francis said investigators would pay special attention to the
seals around the doors and windows, among other parts. Asked about
identifying parts in the wreckage, he said, ``I was amazed this
morning, standing at the side of the pit out there, that the folks
from Lear could say, `that's the horizontal stabilizer, that's part
of the aileron.'''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the two pilots
stopped responding to air-traffic controllers some time after
reaching 37,000 feet, and Air Force jets called out to chase the
Lear found that the windows were fogged. The plane's mechanical
systems kept working, including the autopilot and a radio beacon
that faithfully broadcast the flight's identity and altitude.
</P>
<P>
   The Lear, which can carry up to eight passengers, had a cockpit
voice recorder, but it had not been found by Tuesday evening. Even
if it is found, the recorder is unlikely to have any voices on it,
because the plane flew for four hours. The recorder's tape is only
30 minutes long, and newer conversations record over earlier ones.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with most corporate jets, this one did not carry
a flight data recorder. Francis said on Tuesday evening that
investigators had picked up wreckage, including human remains from
the area around the crater created by the crash, and would begin
work in the crater itself on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Air Force planes had shot video of the Lear at
the end of its flight, but that the quality was not good enough to
make it useful.
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota officials said that they would order tests on the
human remains but that there was no specific toxicological test to
determine if the two pilots and four passengers had been knocked
out or killed by a lack of air. Loss of cabin pressure is one
possible cause of the crash. Smoke in the cockpit is another, and
that can be determined from blood tests, as well as from evidence
in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were also interviewing the pilots of military
chase planes, and asked if any member of the public had made a
videotape of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other investigators were poring over maintenance
records of the plane, which was built in 1976 and had made about
7,500 flights. One question was whether the operators had complied
with an order from the FAA in November 1995 to replace the valve
that controls the flow of air out of the cabin. The valve, under
the co-pilot's seat, is one place where a cabin pressure problem
could develop, if that is what happened to this plane. The aviation
agency ordered planes using the valve not to fly above 41,000 feet
until the repair was done, and to do the work within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   David Franson, a spokesman for Lear, a subsidiary of Bombardier
Inc., said the order, which amounts to a recall, began when Allied
Signal Aerospace, which supplied the environmental control system,
found a defect in the manufacturing process. It was not triggered
by a failure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane that crashed had been bought in September by Jetshares
One, a company that sells fractional ownership in planes, Franson
said. He said Stewart owned a fractional share, though it was in a
newer Learjet, a 31A, not the one that crashed.

THE JUGGLING ACT _ CHILDREN, WORK AND HOLIDAYS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LISA BELKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a small gift to working parents on the calendar this
year. Halloween falls on a Sunday. That means no racing home for
trick-or-treat. No sending the kids off with someone else because
we can't make it back in time, and no starting out so late that the
youngest ones, already overwhelmed by the anticipation of it all,
fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   We have four overworked calendars at our house _ my husband's
electronic pocket ``brain,'' my old-fashioned leather datebook, the
school-issued version that hangs near the desk in my office and the
jumbo one on the back of the kitchen door. Put them together and
they are an argument for human cloning. I hear they now design Palm
Pilots that can ``talk'' to each other. OK, that's a start. But
what I need is technology that can allow me to meet with my editor
and the third-grade teacher at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, there are countless reasons not to be at work. The
first day of school. Yearly check-ups, especially ones that include
shots. Columbus Day, when schools are closed but so many businesses
are open. (Last-minute tickets to Opening Day _ but that's a whole
other category.) It has been almost a year since I left my father's
bedside in the cardiac-care unit to talk about turning my book into
a movie with a producer who would only be in town for a few hours,
and the guilt still lingers. (Her interest turned out to be
fleeting; my father, I'm relieved to report, is now faster on the
treadmill than I am.)
</P>
<P>
   True, flex time, job sharing, four-day workweeks and the Family
Leave Act have all been created to address the problem, but what
I'm talking isn't really about rules. However many sanctioned days
off we're given, there will always be one more worthy distraction,
not to mention the small matter of getting the work done. So the
squares of the calendar will continue to be an oversized board
game, a daily accumulation of choices that shape a life. Do I use
my ``get out of jail free'' card for the class play, or the class
trip? I'll trade my Martin Luther King's birthday for the baby's
first birthday and a holiday to be named later.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, the answers are obvious. They jump off the
calendar in sharp relief, putting everything else in perspective.
At a recent dinner meeting, a group of us who thought our lives
were busy listened in sobered silence as one woman described her
eight-year legal battle with the doctors whose mistakes, she
believes, left her young son heartbreakingly handicapped. The
malpractice trial was to begin the next day and would last for
weeks. ``I will be there,'' she said with uncluttered certainty,
even though her own business would fall into chaotic limbo while
she spent all those days in court. ``No question. I will be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time the choices are murkier. We can do any given
thing, but we can't do everything, which is why over-the-counter
ulcer medications seem to sell so well. When I began this column I
received a note from Sherri Steinfeld, a freelance book publicist,
who wondered: ``Is this what parenting in the early 21st century
comes down to _ choosing the option that makes us feel the least
guilty?'' Yes. It often is. The scale that balances work and life
is weighted by two questions: How many events can I tuck in and
still get the job done? How many can I miss and still feel
complete?
</P>
<P>
   So we do what we always tell our children to do _ only the best
that we can. On Tuesday of this week, my husband and I were both at
the third-grade parent-teacher conference, but we missed the
kindergarten trip to the pumpkin patch on Monday. This morning, I
will find a way to spend an hour at ``Pumpkin Pal Day'' when the
kindergartners invite a friend (read: parent) to help decorate the
pumpkins. The costume parade across the soccer field on Friday _
the same day I have a magazine deadline _ is still up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday my two scary skeletons will go trick-or-treating
and my husband and I will take them. The grandparents will come
over early to snap some photos, and we might even make a party of
it all. The next morning we will turn the clocks back and the
calendar forward to face the questions of November. Is the Friday
after Thanksgiving a holiday, or what?

REPUBLICAN PLAN FOR SPENDING CUT COMES UNDER INCREASED ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS lede and following 3 grafs to recast and to clarify
Republicans' motivations; subs 14th graf (bgng `The White
House...') to move up comments by Podesta; subs 15th graf to

 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders of Congress scaled back their
plan to cut spending across the board to balance the federal
budget, but the plan still drew opposition from within their own
ranks as well as from the nation's top military officer.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, reluctant to cut military spending and wary of
political attacks on cuts in social programs, tried to walk a fine
line between their promises to balance the budget without tapping
Social Security funds and the desires of members to spend money on
pet programs.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois made two concessions as
he sought to quell dissent among Republicans and win passage of the
plan as early as Wednesday. He said that the cut could be as low as
1 percent, instead of the 1.4 percent proposed on Monday, and he
agreed that the cut would include lawmakers' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the concessions were made after criticism that
included a veto threat from the White House, the Republican whip,
Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, warned President Clinton that he would be
blamed if the plan failed and a government shutdown resulted.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing budget negotiations between the White House and
Congress are aimed at seeking ways to pass the remaining five of 13
spending bills to run government agencies without dipping into
surplus Social Security funds and without scuttling programs dear
to President Clinton. The two sides are separated by about $10
billion worth of programs, including money to hire teachers and
police officers, and a thicket of thorny policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert vowed to stake his job and Republican control of the
House in next year's elections on passing a budget without spending
surplus Social Security funds, a goal that now relies on an
across-the-board cut.
</P>
<P>
   In chorus, the most senior Democrats in Congress and the White
House chief of staff on Tuesday denounced the cuts as ``mindless.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn, DeLay personally challenged Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find the billions in savings if you want to keep the
government open,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   The clear implication was that if the president vetoed the cuts,
he would have to cut the budget himself if he wanted to avoid a
government shutdown, and take the heat if he failed.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said he was not threatening to shut the government down, a
strategy that proved politically disastrous for Republicans when
they reached a similar spending impasse with Clinton in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have said, `Mr. President, you've told the American
people you don't like this way of keeping the budget balanced,'''
Delay said. ```If you don't like our ideas, then the American
people need to know what your ideas are.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he vetoes it, the American people should expect him to come
up with his own solutions,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House chief of staff, John Podesta, said that although
the president might propose ways to find savings, it was up to
Congress to cut its own budget. ``They've put together a budget
that is full of pork _ boats that the Pentagon didn't request,
planes that the Pentagon didn't request,'' he said. ``Before we
start cutting meals on wheels, and veterans, and education, they
ought to go back and look at the things they've already put into
the budget that have fattened this thing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even members of Delay's party said on Tuesday that they did not
strongly support DeLay's solution.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William F. Goodling of Pennsylvania said the cut would not
pass without support from Democrats _ a highly unlikely event _ and
that its passage would be political fodder for Republicans'
opponents in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the Republican caucus believe it's not the
way to go,'' Goodling said. ``It's the easy way, but it gives the
opposition all sorts of opportunities to demagogue the issues _
health care, school lunches, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the plan's prospects were damaged on Tuesday when the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton,
testified that even a 1 percent cut at the Pentagon _ about $2.7
billion _ would cripple the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be devastating,'' he told the Senate Armed Services
Committee. ``It would be disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans argued that a 1 percent across-the-board cut _
as opposed to the 1.4 percent reduction they proposed on Monday _
could be easily obtained by identifying ``waste, fraud and abuse''
in government programs, including military spending.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert also said the 1 percent cut would shave back the
salaries of members of Congress, who just raised their own pay to
$141,300 from $139,900 in January, but should not affect other
government workers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Senate Republicans were less enthusiastic than their House
counterparts. ``If forced to do it, I will accept 1 percent across
the board,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska. The majority leader,
Trent Lott of Mississippi, said the cuts ``may be necessary,'' but
should be ``as small as possible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most Congress is allowed to spend for fiscal 2000 under the
rules it set for itself is $594 billion. Its auditors at the
congressional Budget Office say the Republican-written spending
bills add up to at least $609 billion, or $15 billion in spending
that would have to come from surplus Social Security revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans contend that they are only about $5 billion over
the limit, a sum that would be covered by a 1 percent
across-the-board budget cut. Both parties have vowed not to touch
the Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans cannot force an across-the-board cut, they
have three choices left: break their pledge and spend Social
Security surpluses, eliminate billions in spending, or compromise
with Clinton in negotiations on spending and policy issues, a
prospect they dread.

LUCENT AND NORTEL REPORT STRONG QUARTERLY EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Profiting from the revolution in communications, North America's
two titans of telecommunications equipment, Lucent Technologies
Inc. and Nortel Networks Corp. of Canada, each reported strong
quarterly financial results Tuesday that exceeded analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in global demand for wireless and data
communications services has helped make the communications
equipment industry one of the world's healthiest. Lucent and Nortel
have certainly benefited from the trend; together, the two
companies increased quarterly revenue by more than $3 billion over
the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Both reported strong increases in their sales to communications
carriers. Yet both companies also reported stagnation in their
units that sell equipment directly to businesses and other
institutions, a trend that Nortel attributed largely to concerns
about Year 2000 computer concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Tuesday's figures were more important to Lucent
than to Nortel. Some analysts have recently pointed to the fact
that Lucent's inventory and receivables ballooned over the last
year as a sign that the company could have difficulty maintaining
the torrid growth that has become one of its hallmarks since
splitting away from AT&AMP;T in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Lucent seemed to come through, posting a 23 percent
increase in revenue for the quarter, a total of $10.575 billion
compared with $8.574 billion in the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's earnings grew even more robustly. Excluding
one-time charges and gains, Lucent earned $972 million, or 31 cents
a share, a 50 percent increase from earnings of $647 million, or 21
cents a share, in the comparable period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted
earnings of 29 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report was the last in Lucent's 1999 fiscal year, and
its stock rose $3 in very heavy trading, to $62.875, after the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucent enters the new millennium with momentum,'' Richard A.
McGinn, the company's chairman, said in a statement. ``This was the
strongest quarter and the strongest year in Lucent's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven D. Levy, who follows Lucent for Lehman Brothers, has been
a skeptic about the company for months. He said Tuesday that while
Lucent's balance sheet had not noticeably improved, its operations
did not seem to have been hurt. ``I was a little surprised,'' Levy
said. ``The balance-sheet issues notwithstanding, the company seems
to be generating the revenues they need to grow at the rates they
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Including one-time events, Lucent reported earnings of $948
million, or 30 cents a share, up from $220 million, or 7 cents a
share, in the 1998 quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of revenue growth, Nortel Networks' results were even
stronger than Lucent's.
</P>
<P>
   Using Canadian accounting standards, Nortel's revenue increased
more than 30 percent, to $5.393 billion (United States) from $4.141
billion in the corresponding period last year. Canadian accounting
standards differ slightly from those in the United States, notably
in how they treat joint ventures. Under United States accounting
standards, Nortel's quarterly earnings increased almost 27 percent,
to $5.027 billion from $3.960 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel intends to report financial results solely under United
States rules beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time events, Nortel reported earnings of $380
million, or 28 cents a share, compared with $220 million, or 21
cents a share, in the comparable period last year. Analysts polled
by First Call had predicted earnings of 26 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great quarter,'' John A. Roth, Nortel's chief
executive, said in an interview, ``There is very strong demand from
carriers to put bandwidth in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Including all charges, Nortel under Canadian accounting reported
earnings of $1 million, or less than one cent a share. That was an
improvement from a loss in last year's quarter of $189 million, or
17 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel's results were announced after major financial markets
had closed. In regular-session Nasdaq trading Tuesday, its shares
fell $1.3125, to $55.50.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, in addition to financial results, announced a
reorganization and executive shake-up. Each of its four core
businesses will be run by an executive vice president. Patricia F.
Russo will run the unit that serves communications carriers.
William T. O'Shea will head the unit that sells to businesses that
are not communications carriers. John L. Drew will be in charge of
Lucent's consulting operation. John T. Dickson will run the
company's microelectronics business.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Verwaayen, a chief operating officer, will become vice
chairman. Daniel C. Stanzione, the other chief operating officer,
will become an adviser to McGinn. Arun Netravali will assume
Stanzione's job as president of Bell Labs.

OLD FLAME IS BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He was too old. Had been out of coaching too long.
A dinosaur who failed to realize he'd become extinct.
</P>
<P>
   And that was before Dick Vermeil took over the Rams three years
ago, and quickly proceeded to go 5-11 and 4-12 his first two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Critics didn't queue up, they stampeded. The Rams had lost more
games than any NFL team in the '90s. And here was laughable Rams
owner Georgia Frontiere's latest blunder. What was she thinking,
hiring some guy who'd been in a TV booth for the past 14 years?
</P>
<P>
   People wondered if he would return for a third season, or be
invited back. Even when he was left standing, there was little
reason to believe 1999 wouldn't be just more of the same dismal
fare.
</P>
<P>
   Only six weeks into the season and guess who's all the rage?
Guess who has the NFL's only undefeated team?
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil and the St. Louis Rams are a stunning 6-0. The guy
seemingly oblivious to his own Ice Age is the hottest thing in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Donahue, like Vermeil a former UCLA head coach and now the
49ers director of player personnel, was aware of the national
skepticism heaped upon his friend of over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of criticism, a lot of heat, pressure and
rumors as to what this year would hold if they didn't achieve
certain milestones,'' Donahue said. ``I'm particularly happy for
him because he's a great guy and a really outstanding coach. I'm
just pleased they're doing well. I wish it wasn't at our expense to
some degree _ they beat the stuffings out of us _ but at the same
time, you just have to be happy for Dick Vermeil.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil, 62, has the feel-good story of the year in Kurt Warner,
who is not a really old Seahawks running back but an unlikely
free-agent quarterback out of the World and Arena football leagues.
The coach has young and talented players at the skill positions. He
has a favorable schedule ahead. After two difficult years in
retreat, he has the NFL on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil, the man who almost invented the phrase ``burnout'' when
he left the Eagles as head coach in 1982, is now on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still the same person,'' Vermeil said. ``I'm very
emotional and probably too intense a guy. I was head coach at 39
(in Philadelphia) and at 46 I had pushed myself so hard for so long
in rebuilding that organization, I ran out of gas. But being older
now, I'm more mature. I have things in a better perspective and my
priorities in a better line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not embarrassed by having had that label. I was very
honest when I made the statement that I was emotionally burned out.
But I did not plan to coin a phrase or become a symbol of
something.''
</P>
<P>
   He was looking like the symbol of a man who failed to realize
his time had passed after he went 9-23 his first two seasons with
the Rams. Some players mumbled he was out of touch with the modern
game. That what turned the Eagles around when he went to
Philadelphia in 1976, wasn't going to work 21 years later. He
worked them too long.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if others wondered if he would continue to try and turn the
Rams around, Vermeil did not hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a thought in my mind of not coming back,''
Vermeil said. ``I am not a cocky guy. I have done this before. The
Philadelphia Eagles were a mess when we took that thing over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in the instant-gratification business. It takes time.
I thought I knew what I was doing. I made some mistakes. But we did
some right things and we drafted well. Ownership did a tremendous
job of motivating us to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any reason to think I should not come back. Now,
they may have thought that, but no one in this organization ever
suggested they weren't going to bring me back. But I know this: If
we were going to lose this year, I may not (have been brought)
back.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a learning experience for all involved, including
Vermeil. If he is doing things the way he did with the Eagles,
there have been subtle changes. Players seldom go in full pads
during practice, and practices are slightly shorter. There is no
team hotel at home the night before games. A new offensive
coordinator, Mike Martz, was brought in from the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Mike White, the former Raiders head coach now the Rams assistant
head coach, has known Vermeil since they were assistant coaches
together at Stanford in 1965. White said he has watched Vermeil
persevere through his difficult start here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it's been a two-year struggle,'' White said. ``As
we're finding out, this is a day when there are not any real
blueprints for success. There are a lot of new things happening in
football because of the salary cap and free agency and a whole
bunch of stuff. But people now understand Dick's instincts towards
management and relationships towards players have stood the test of
time. They're working now just as they worked when he was at
Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   His defense, led by a pair of No. 1 draft picks at defensive end
_ Kevin Carter and Grant Wistrom _ has been solid. But it is his
offense that has exploded. Add this year's No. 1 pick, Torry Holt,
to Isaac Bruce and Az-Zahir Hakim, and the Rams might have the most
explosive receivers in the league. Running back Marshall Faulk was
added on a draft-day deal. Warner emerged as if out of the mist.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rams are suddenly unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   White said it's simply taken Vermeil time to surround himself
with the kind of trusting players who understand commitment the way
he does. Only eight Rams remain from the team that fled Anaheim
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened the first couple of years, a lot of our players
spent more time trying to figure out what we were trying to do
rather than just go do it,'' White said. ``They wanted to complain
about different things and try to poke holes in what we were doing,
rather than just get with it and get going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was shaken. I never got that feeling and
we're pretty darn close. He's a real competitor and I think it
intensified his search for answers and his desire to get this thing
headed in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil still puts in the long hours but said he tries never to
leave the office after midnight. He promised his wife of 42 years,
Carol, when he took the job there would be no more sleeping in the
office. On Tuesday, he said he plans to retire after the 2001
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dick has really tried to adjust some of his own
feelings about things,'' Donahue said. ``He's tried to cut down a
little on his work load. Maybe he's more inclined to give (players)
the day off, as when he was at the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who's gone through a process like he has, kind of
goes through a metamorphosis. You certainly are the same as you
were 16 years ago. Your fundamentals are the same, but there are
subtle changes.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Rams lost eight consecutive games. Vermeil and
his Rams seemed to be going backward. This year, they are the talk
of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil hasn't taken to championing his cause, but White said he
can sense his quiet satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It justifies his coming back and that he has a pretty good way
of doing things,'' White said. ``There are going to be a lot of
people trying to figure out what we did right this year that a lot
of people aren't doing.''

COWBOYS' SANDERS KNOWS HITS DON'T MAKE CORNERBACKS GREAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So which of Deion Sanders' amazing feats against the Redskins
was most stunning?
</P>
<P>
   Coming back from a concussion to run back a punt for a
touchdown?
</P>
<P>
   Or his newfound tackling prowess, which he not only used to set
the tone for the game by dropping Redskins tailback Stephen Davis
for a 4-yard loss on the first play but finish the game as the
Cowboys' second-leading tackler?
</P>
<P>
   For many people, the latter is the big jaw-dropper.
</P>
<P>
   Though always electrifying, there's nothing shocking about
Sanders scoring a touchdown on a return. He is the NFL's all-time
leader in that category.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders' ability to tackle shouldn't come as a surprise.
He's a great athlete and pro football player, has been for 11
years. Last time I checked, 90-pound weaklings don't make NFL
rosters. And, at 6-foot-1 and 195 pounds, he has great size for a
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   No, ability has never been a question with Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   However, his willingness to tackle is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   As he said after the game, ``I let you know I can do that if I
want to.''
</P>
<P>
   So why doesn't he want to all the time?
</P>
<P>
   Because that's not what he gets paid to do.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' worth is measured by his status as the best cover
cornerback in NFL history. He knows more than anybody that Cowboys
owner Jerry Jones hasn't given him two contracts worth more than
$87 million to make bone-jarring stops on running backs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that might not be the politically correct response that
purists and romantics of the game want to hear. But it's fact. And
not only is it smart, but it's downright visionary.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the days of Dick ``Night Train'' Lane and Fred
``The Hammer'' Williamson, legendary corners of yesteryear who were
highly regarded hitters and covermen.
</P>
<P>
   The passing game has been the focal point of the NFL in the
1990s. Likewise, the premium on stopping the passing game has
increased as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was a willing tackler early in his career. Four of his
five best tackling years came during his first four seasons in the
league. And this was also a time when Sanders was at the height of
his double-duty stint as a baseball player. Now if that's not
wimp-free, what is?
</P>
<P>
   However, somebody pulled his coattail to two things. First,
cornerbacks don't make the All-Pro team for being tacklers. And
rare is the corner who gets cut for missing a tackle. Not being
able to cover, however, is the No. 1 cause of career death for
cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, cornerbacks who spend a lot of time tackling are more
susceptible to injury, which means shorter careers and a shorter
time span to reap financial rewards for being great.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders can be called a lot of things, but dumb is not one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the coverman philosophy speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has a cornerback impacted a game the way Sanders
has. He takes away half the field because quarterbacks are afraid
to throw in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of defenses running away from Dick Butkus. But
while they respected Mike Haynes and Lester Hayes, no one shied
away from throwing on them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his obvious greatness, Sanders' reputation takes a hit
in some corners for his stance on tackling.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of like the critics of NBA rebounding-wizard Dennis
Rodman who complain about his disinterest in scoring. Rodman played
to his strength and did it so well that he played a vital role on
five championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   The people (Phil Jackson and Michael Jordan) who know the game
respected Rodman. The same is true about Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his opinion about Sanders' attitude toward tackling,
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he has no problem with it because
``Sanders is smart. He doesn't turn down a tackle when he needs to
make one.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes he makes one to light a fire under a team reeling
from two consecutive losses.
Yardsticks
First down With the victory against the Redskins, Troy Aikman
became the winningest quarterback of any decade. He has 87
victories in the 1990s, surpassing the 86 by Joe Montana in the
1980s. John Elway, Dan Marino and Steve Young are at 84 for the
1990s. Roger Staubach had 84 in the 1970s.
Run down? Two years after supposedly being over the hill and a year
after Chris Warren was brought in the reduce his workload, running
back Emmitt Smith is carrying the ball more than ever. Smith, who
has 515 yards rushing on 150 carries, is on pace (377 in 1995).
Projecting his average of 25 attempts per game over a full season,
Smith would finish with 400 in 1999.
Third-and-long Since Chan Gailey took over last season, the Cowboys
are 4-6 on the road, including an 0-3 mark against nondivision
foes. The Cowboys face the Colts and Vikings in road games the next
two weeks.

COWBOYS' IMPROVED DEFENSIVE LINEMEN TAKE AIM AT MANNING 
HEADLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The nightmare factor was in full swing during
the preseason when talk centered around the Cowboys' defensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   No Leon Lett. Chad Hennings had a frightful 1998 season. Kavika
Pittman hadn't proven himself as a dependable every-down player.
Greg Ellis had just completed his rookie season. And no one could
predict which direction Alonzo Spellman might take after missing
last season due to a mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   However, come Halloween on Sunday, when the Cowboys take on the
young and rising Indianapolis Colts and maturing second-year
quarterback Peyton Manning, the Cowboys' coaching staff has
digested far more treats than tricks from the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about our group right now,'' defensive coordinator
Dave Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line coach Jim Bates described Hennings' early-season
showing, which includes a team-leading four sacks, as his ``best in
four or five years.'' Ellis already has two touchdowns, Pittman is
taking care of his business and Spellman has adjusted surprisingly
well to not only missing all of last season but to playing tackle
for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The unit has combined for 15 sacks in six games and believes the
key to beating the upstart Colts is to put Manning on his back, a
difficult task this season. The Colts have allowed only three sacks
in six games and enter Sunday's meeting with the NFL's fourth-best
offense (365.0 total yards per game) buoyed by the league's
top-ranked passing attack (277.2 yards per game).
</P>
<P>
   ``With more pressure, even if we don't get the sacks, but if we
put the pressure on and put some people in his face,'' Bates said,
``his completion rate is going to go down, and that is going to be
a big factor in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning, who ranks third in the AFC behind Seattle's Jon Kitna
and New England's Drew Bledsoe with an 89.4 rating, has thrown for
1,679 yards and 13 touchdowns, mostly to speedy receiver Marvin
Harrison, who has 45 receptions for 709 yards and eight touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is ... he doesn't take sacks,'' coach Chan
Gailey said. ``He finds a way to get the ball out, he's smart
enough to feel pressure and know where people are.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the Cowboys' defensive game plan will first look to
shut down rookie running back Edgerrin James and put Manning into
an uncompromising position. The trick then becomes wearing down the
Colts' interior and forcing Manning into mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a tall order this week,'' Gailey said. ``It's a good
philosophy if you can make it happen.''

BANGED-UP STARS NEED TO BUCKLE DOWN, HITCHCOCK SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Way up north in Toronto, across the border in
the homeland of hockey, they didn't read too much into the Maple
Leafs' 4-0 victory against the Stars on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto newspapers did not see it as a trouncing of the
defending Stanley Cup champions and therefore a sign that their
hometown team is a legitimate contender.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they saw it for what it was: a victory by a very good
team playing at home against a squad seriously depleted by
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the hockey literati looked at the Stars and saw
not the team that won the Cup last season, but a team missing seven
regulars because of injuries, and a team that dressed 11 players
who either were healthy scratches, in the minors or with other
teams when Brett Hull scored the trophy-winning goal against the
Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   And with three of the injured players _ defensemen Darryl Sydor
and Richard Matvichuk and center Joe Nieuwendyk _ on the verge of
returning for Saturday's game against Tampa Bay, if ever there was
a night to reach into the bag of excuses, that was it.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock, though, doesn't do excuses. The word
is not in his vocabulary, his dictionary, his thesaurus.
</P>
<P>
   His team lost, he said, not because of injuries but because they
didn't play the hard-working, gritty, grinding style of play he
demands for the full 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can use injuries as an excuse,'' Hitchcock
restated yesterday. ``We allowed frustration to control us, and we
can't do that. We lost because we got discouraged too early. I
thought if we'd stayed with it we could have won. That's what
bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw players stop playing hard when the Stars fell behind by
two goals early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frustration came into the group, and they didn't perform in
the second half of the game,'' he said. ``We can't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Hitchcock scrapped his original plan for practice
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   With the next game not until Saturday, when the Tampa Bay
Lightning comes to town, he intended for his team to go through a
light scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, despite not getting home from Toronto until about 3
a.m., the Stars were back on the ice yesterday for a full, one
hour-plus workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get right back on the ice, right back to
practice,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis was on defensive fundamentals, from positioning to
getting the puck out of the zone to going hard into the corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Toronto game was a lack of effort, a lack of
preparation,'' rookie defenseman Brad Lukowich said. ``We went over
some basic things, simplifying some things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's purpose wasn't just to simplify things after the
Stars gave up four easy goals against the Maple Leafs, but to
emphasize the point that good defense is a byproduct of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing in this league is being on the same page
defensively,'' he said. ``We've got a lot of new players, and we
need to get everybody on the same page. We have to keep the
foundation there for when players start to filter back.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the seven injured players could be back as soon as
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor (groin) and Matvichuk (knee) skated with conditioning
coach J.J. McQueen before practice yesterday, and are scheduled to
participate in the first half of today's practice. Nieuwendyk (back
spasms) is expected to skate with McQueen today.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hitchcock knows that won't be a magic elixir to fix all
that ailed the Stars against the Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that if we get three guys back, there's still
17 guys in the room who played \R Monday\S night who are going to
have to play again,'' Hitchcock said. ``Most of the team that
played \Ragainst Toronto\S is going to have to play for the next
six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars recognize that, and recognize Hitchcock's efforts to
re-instill the work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played good hockey without the injured players,''
forward Derek Plante said. ``We didn't play good hockey \R Monday\S
night. The team that's in this locker room can play well.''
</P>
<P>
   The team is going to have to play well. Excuses, even legitimate
ones, aren't worth points in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for excuses at all,'' Lukowich said. ``We're
happy with the guys we've got. We've got to be physical, do the
little things. That's what it comes down to. If we don't work hard,
we're not going to win games.''

SUPREME COURT WILL REVIEW USE OF ELECTRIC CHAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time in more than a century, the
Supreme Court will review the constitutionality of putting people
to death in the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding Tuesday to take up the issue, the court halted the
use of Florida's electric chair and granted an open-ended reprieve
to a prisoner who was to have been executed in Florida on Wednesday
morning and another convict who was scheduled to die next week.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few states still use the electric chair, and Florida has
already authorized lethal injection in case its chair is ever
outlawed. So it was far from clear Tuesday night whether the high
court's review of Florida's administration of death would have
effects outside the state's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Executions in Florida have been grisly of late. In July, blood
gushed from the face mask of Allen Lee Davis as he was executed.
The authorities noted that the man had weighed nearly 350 pounds
and had medical problems that could have contributed to the
bleeding, but death-penalty foes were not placated.
</P>
<P>
   New York became the first state to use the electric chair, in
1890, after the Supreme Court upheld its use. The prospect, however
slim, that the chair might now go the way of the guillotine
produced elation in Andrew Thomas, the lawyer for Anthony Bryan,
who was to have died on Wednesday for the 1983 killing of a
watchman.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven states now authorize use of the electric chair, although
most of those either allow for an alternative means of death or
have not carried out executions in many years.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the
state's use of the electric chair on Oct. 20, 1997, by a 4-3 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dieter, the executive director of the Death Penalty
Information Center, said Tuesday night that the Supreme Court's
review of the electric chair, while a ``secondary question'' in the
continuing debate over capital punishment, could lead to a wider
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the relatively conservative makeup of the
court makes a fundamental re-examination of capital punishment
unlikely. None of the justices have declared opposition to capital
punishment.

HELMS WOULD ACT ON NOMINEE IN RETURN FOR SENSITIVE PAPERS

   WASHINGTON _ Under criticism for his handling of a racially
sensitive nomination, Sen. Jesse Helms says he will hold a hearing
next week on the choice of former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun to be
ambassador to New Zealand if the Clinton administration supplies
internal documents on accusations that she used money from her 1992
campaign for personal use and never declared it as income.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Democrats and administration officials criticized the
offer on Tuesday, saying it amounted to an extraordinary demand for
sensitive data by Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. ``It's clear that Senator Helms does not intend to move
this nomination forward in the near future,'' said Barry Toiv, a
White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, R-N.C., inspired a partisan dispute over race and
nominations last week when he made clear that he opposed President
Clinton's choice of Moseley-Braun _ an Illinois Democrat who seven
years ago became the first black woman elected to the Senate _ in
part because in 1993 she successfully opposed a measure, supported
by Helms, that would have renewed a patent featuring a Confederate
flag. The chairman demanded an apology as a price for considering
her nomination, and indicated that he would not take up the matter
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   But after intense criticism by civil rights groups and
congressional Democrats, who accused Republicans of being
insensitive to minorities, Helms changed tack late Monday. In a
letter to the president, he promised to convene his committee for a
hearing on the nomination, and perhaps even a vote before Congress
adjourns for the year, if the administration provided sensitive
documents from the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue
Service related to Moseley-Braun's conduct. The senator gave a
deadline of next Monday, according to a copy of the letter provided
to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports last year disclosed that the IRS twice asked
the Justice Department in 1995 to open a grand jury inquiry into
whether Moseley-Braun had used 1992 campaign funds for personal use
without reporting the income and paying taxes on it. The Justice
Department refused each time, citing a lack of credible
information.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a Federal Election Commission audit in 1996 of
Moseley-Braun's 1992 campaign found sloppy bookkeeping, but the
commission levied no fines. With the five-year period under the
statute of limitations expiring, the commission dropped its case in
1997, saying it did not have the time or resources to finish the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Relations Committee is especially interested in
examining the internal administration documents related to the
Justice Department's refusal to impanel a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving them a chance to have a hearing on this, on the
merits,'' said Marc Thiessen, a committee spokesman. ``If she has a
clean ethical bill of health, she'll be confirmed as ambassador
next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides writing Clinton, Helms requested information from John
D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff; Attorney General Janet
Reno, and Charles O. Rossotti, the commissioner of internal
revenue. He sought legal opinions, prosecution memorandums,
requests for grand jury proceedings and a variety of other
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Thiessen said the administration had honored a similar request
for confidential documents in what had been the long-delayed
nomination of Richard C. Holbrooke to be chief delegate to the
United Nations. But Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the
committee's ranking Democrat, called Helms' request a ``fishing
expedition'' that went well beyond the paperwork required for
Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun, who after one term in the Senate lost her
re-election race last year, was nominated by Clinton to the
ambassadorship to New Zealand earlier this month. In light of what
they regard as Helms' continued resistance, administration
officials have begun thinking of the possibility of a recess
appointment by the president, which would allow Moseley-Braun to
take office once the Senate leaves town for the year and to hold
her post until the next Congress, more than a year away.

AILING ALCALA ITCHING TO PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Julio Alcala wanted to mask the pain. He wanted
the cortisone shot.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cal State Northridge football coaches vetoed the idea,
and Alcala, a senior offensive lineman who hadn't missed a game
because of an injury in his CSUN career, didn't play in the
Matadors' 24-21 win at Montana State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Alcala, a 6-foot-4, 285-pound center, returned to practice
Tuesday but didn't participate in most drills. He severely sprained
his left ankle on Oct. 16 against Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to end your senior season just watching,''
Alcala said. ``I love to play. I was really just mad, because I had
never beaten Montana State. I wanted to take it to those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I didn't play, I was just happy we beat Montana
State.''
</P>
<P>
   If his ankle doesn't get better, Alcala said he would ask
offensive line coach Bobby Connelly for a cortisone shot this
Saturday for the Matadors' home game against Weber State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told coach Connelly I have four more games,'' Alcala said,
``and the rest of my life to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kearin, CSUN's interim head coach, said he's hesitant to
let Alcala get the pain-killing shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a big fan of doing that,'' Kearin said. ``I think
(Alcala) will be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Gutty performance: Even without Alcala, the CSUN offensive
linemen had one of their strongest games against Montana State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got better without Julio, which is promising,'' Kearin
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors were forced into a quandary when Alcala's
replacement, Javier Ortiz, hurt his knee during the game and was
forced to leave. Right guard Tim Shoffeitt moved to center and the
pass protection didn't break down.
</P>
<P>
   __ Honored: Redshirt freshman kicker Derek Brown, who had a
season-high three field goals against Montana State, was named Big
Sky Special Teams Player of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was good on kicks of 37, 29 and 37 yards against the
Bobcats, is now 7 for 10 on field-goal-attempts this season. He
wasn't able to kick all summer because of an injury to his right
(kicking) leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to get back in the groove,'' Brown said. ``(The
injury) is not really bothering me that much anymore, but it's
still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown had a chance to become the second CSUN kicker in two years
to have four field goals in a game _ Manny Marquez did it last
year, also against Montana State _ but his final attempt was
blocked on what Brown called a ``horrible kick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it was just the mechanics, but it was low,'' he said.
``It was pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>
   __ New addition: Jason Mageo, a senior defensive lineman, and
his wife Kimberly had their second child, Josephine, on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Mageos have a 2-year-old son, Faleniko. Mageo missed two
practices last week to be with his family, then made the trip to
Montana State and got his third sack of the season in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's doing good,'' said Mageo, but then he added,
``It's been tiring the last week. . . . It's kind of hard to
balance everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The birth of Faleniko in October 1997 was also memorable, said
Mageo, who was playing at Oregon State at the time: Faleniko was
born during halftime of the Beavers' game against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were watching me on TV when he was born,'' Mageo said.
