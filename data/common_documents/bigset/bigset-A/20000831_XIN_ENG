<HEADLINE> Dawn-To-Dusk General Strike Passed Off Peacefully in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA , August 30 (Xinhua) -- A dawn-to-dusk countrywide
general strike called by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-
led four-party opposition alliance protesting price hike of gas
and petroleum products, Wednesday paralyzed normal life in the
country, but passed off peacefully.
</P>
<P>
No major disturbances were reported during the striking hours
except a few stray incidents.
</P>
<P>
Police and eyewitnesses said five persons were wounded by
homemade bombs during a clash between strikers and pro-government
activists in the capital. The violence erupted when about 300
opposition demonstrators were challenged by their rivals. "They
hurled bombs at each other. At least five persons were injured,"
said a police officer in the scene.
</P>
<P>
Normal life in the capital was paralyzed as transport service
went off the roads, but paddle rickshaws were as usual in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
The strike, the second in a week, disrupted banking sector and
shut schools and colleges and many offices in the country.
</P>
<P>
The BNP and its allies-- Jatiya Party, Jamaat-e-Islami and
Islamic Oikya Jote (IOJ), called the strike to protest against the
price hike of petroleum products and gas.
</P>
<P>
The government recently raised the prices of petroleum products
by 13 per cent and gas tax by 15 per cent. The opposition claimed
that the government raised the prices to ruin the economy, saying
the price hike will have a far reaching negative impact on the
cost of power, fertilizer, industrial and agricultural products
and above all, the cost of living.

Affairs summoned the Pakistani Deputy High Commissioner Wednesday

<HEADLINE> Parliament Seat of Bangladeshi Former President Vacated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The parliament seat of former
President and Jatiya Party Chairman H.M. Ershad was Wednesday
declared vacant following his conviction in a corruption case.
</P>
<P>
A parliament secretariat notification ordered vacating the
parliament seat of Ershad with retrospective effect from the date
of High Court verdict upholding his conviction.
</P>
<P>
The parliament secretariat said Ershad was found guilty in a
corruption case by the higher court that sentenced him to five
years' imprisonment on August 24.
</P>
<P>
"As per Article 66 (2) of the Constitution, Ershad is no more
eligible to remain as parliament member and the seat will fall
vacant from the date of the pronouncement of the verdict," the
notification said.
</P>
<P>
Ershad termed the notification of Parliament Secretariat as
illegal in a sharp reaction.
</P>
<P>
"It is illegal. Nobody can cancel my seat," said the former
President.
</P>
<P>
His counsel Barrister Rafiqul Huq, a former attorney general,
also termed the action of the parliament secretariat unseating
Ershad from the parliament as illegal.
</P>
<P>
"Parliament secretariat has no power to declare vacant the seat
of Ershad in Parliament. The case in question has not reached its
finality. A leave petition to move the Supreme Court against the
verdict of the High Court has already been filed," said the
counsel.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Article 66 (4) of the Constitution that says any
dispute over the parliament seat shall be referred to the Election
Commission to hear and determine, the counsel viewed that the
matter should be dealt in accordance with the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Government Refuses to Raise Retirement Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Minister of Social
Affairs and Pensions Frank van den Broucke said Wednesday that he
does not want the retirement age in the country to be raised from
65 to 68.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as some experts proposed the rise "in order to
keep the pension system affordable."
</P>
<P>
Describing the proposal as "asocial," the minister said many
people usually do not work toward the age of 65. Moreover, he said,
it is more appropriate to improve working conditions first so that
people can continue working at an older age.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said he will negotiate an arrangement with
trade unions and employers' organizations to discourage early
retirement schemes.
</P>
<P>
Employees should be able to take more breaks out of work, he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
watched a performance staged by the China Disabled People's
Performing Arts Troupe here tonight at Beijing's Century Theater.
</P>
<P>
The troupe is going to have a performing tour of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the performance tonight, Jiang, who is also
general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee,
met with the troupe's art supervisor and some artists, offering
them his congratulations for the success of their performance.
</P>
<P>
"Your performance is splendid and touching," he said, adding
that "It encourages people to make unremitting efforts to improve
themselves and display their dignity, value and potential."
</P>
<P>
It is of special significance to promoting the cultural and
ethic progress in China, and this, as a unique form of performing
arts, should enjoy the full support from all social sectors, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
The troupe is to perform in six American cities including
Washington, New York and San Francisco from September 5 to 27, at
a time when the Chinese president and leaders of other countries
will attend the UN Millennium Summit in New York. U.S. Vice-
President Al Gore wrote to China Disabled Persons Federation,
expressing his warm welcome to the troupe.

<P>
Jiang also met with an American delegation which made a special
trip to Beijing to welcome the troupe to the United States. Joseph
Prueher, American ambassador to China, presented Jiang a letter of
congratulations from U.S. President Bill Clinton on the troupe's
coming performing tour of his country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his thanks, saying that the performing tour by
these disabled artists and their special art will help enhance the
exchange and understanding between the people of China and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In reply, head of the U.S. delegation said that the American
people must better understand China and the troupe's coming
performing tour of the United States will help promote the
understanding between the people of the two countries and their
mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding 14 years ago, the troupe has performed in
some 30 countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Haci Group signed an
agreement with Shanghai today to grow, in large amounts, a new
variety of tomato, believed to be the first generation of bio-
engineered farm produce in China.
</P>
<P>
The new variety, called SOD tomato, was co-developed by the
Haci Group and the Chinese Agriculture University. It is pollution-
free and a dietetic.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the Haci Group will grow SOD
tomatoes in the form of a franchise on 40 hectares of land in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Yi Ying Huan, an agriculture expert, said SOD is a kind of
erythrocuprein, which will improve one's looks and prevent aging
and clear out impurities from the body.
</P>
<P>
To date, the group has built a SOD production base in Shouguang
of east China's Shandong Province. Other provinces including
Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan and Zhejiang are negotiating with the
group to produce SOD tomatoes.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Strengthen Banking Regulation, Audit Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A protocol was signed Thursday in
Turkey to transfer some authorities of the Central Bank and the
Treasury to the Banking Regulation and Audit Board (BDDK) and
adjust the cooperation principles among these three institutions.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Undersecretary Selcuk Demiralp, Central Bank Chairman
Gazi Ercel and BDDK Chairman Zekeriya Temizel signed the protocol
at the BDDK building, Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the protocol, the Treasury will transfer three
quadrillion Turkish Liras (TL) to the BDDK for the Savings Deposit
Insurance Fund.
</P>
<P>
This money is equivalent to almost 5 billion U.S. dollars and
the BDDK will re-pay this money back to the Treasury in every
three months.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials earlier announced that almost 5-billion dollar
finance is required for the rehabilitation of eight banks
transferred to the BDDK.
</P>
<P>
Temizel said that today is the beginning of a new era for
Turkish
banking system as the BDDK, an independent institution, will be
inspecting the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Temizel said the move also means that Turkey will fully obey the

international rules defined by Basel Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The new system will bring trustable inspection and monitoring
to banking sector which will be in line with international norms.
Individual and international investors will base their preferences
of banks on accurate and dependable information," he said.
</P>
<P>
Demiralp said Treasury which successfully regulated and
inspected the banking sector for many years is handing over this
responsibility to the BDDK as of Thursday, adding that his ministry
would assist the BDDK, especially in the necessary fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
But Temizel said, "His board did not aim to terrorize banks by
threatening them with fines. It aimed to make banks obey rules and
bring feasible regulations in the shortest time possible."
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of the protocol, Ercel said this was a
big step in the collection, evaluation and coordination of
information among the institutions.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the signing ceremony, the Central Bank Chairman said
that a healthy macro-economic environment should be formed for a
healthy banking system and an effective inspection system should
start.

Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat after their talks on the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process, and the Arab and
international efforts to push the process forward.
</P>
<P>
"We are good friends of the Palestinian people and we will
continue backing the peace process till a final and historic
solution is reached by the Palestinian and Israeli leaders," Hain
said.
</P>
<P>
The British minister added that he conveyed an invitation from
British Prime Minister Tony Blair to Arafat for a meeting to
discuss ways for pushing forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Arafat said the efforts being made by Blair were
very important for keeping the peace process on track.
</P>
<P>
Britain, an important member of the European Union (EU) and one
of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, is very
interested in the peace process. And Britain is an essential force
for the peace process, Arafat noted.
</P>
<P>
Hain arrived here on Tuesday in an effort to narrow the gaps
between the Palestinian and Israeli positions on the final status
issues. He is expected to hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak later this week.

CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's national carrier Turkish Airlines (THY)
suffered losses of 170 million U.S. dollars in 1999 and 65 million
in the first half of 2000, reported Turkish Daily News on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Turkish Association of Private Aviation
Companies Safi Ergin told reporters that private airlines suffered
a loss of 102 million dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that apart from the 1999 financial crisis, last year's
two devastating earthquakes, rising fuel oil prices and dollar/euro
parity also worsened the situation.
</P>
<P>
Ergin said that the government had paid for the losses of THY
and those of the private airlines should also be paid by the
government.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the government fails to take necessary
measures for next year, foreign tour operators will choose Egypt,
Tunisia and Greece over Turkey.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) saw its imports
volume from Britain during the first half of the year rose to 4.16
billion dirhams (1.14 billion U.S.dollars), up by 10 percent from
3.77 billion dirhams (1.03 billion dollars) the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, UAE's exports to Britain in the first six months of the
year recorded some unevenness, the official WAM news agency
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The exports volume from Dubai fell 12 percent to 1.40 billion
dirhams (300.5 million dollars), while those from the northern
emirates were down 169.95 million dirhams (46.43 million dollars)
from 180.4 million dirhams (49.3 million dollars) the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
But Abu Dhabi's exports to Britain increased 22 percent to 281.6
million dirhams (76.9 million dollars) from 231 million dirhams
(63.1 million dollars) in the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The World Bank has recently put off the release of the
first tranche of the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) of 390
million U.S. dollars to Turkey, reported Turkish Daily News on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
World Bank Financial Sector Desk Chief Lalit Raina told
reporters Thursday that the Turkish government had pledged that
state banks will be sold off, and the World Bank will wait until
this pledge is fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Raina said that Turkish government is reluctant to privatize
state banks, which account for 40 percent of Turkey's banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has pledged to give Turkey a total of 1.5 billion
dollars in FSAL.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The U.S.-based Exide Corporation recently announced
that it will build an automotive batteries manufacturing plant in
the Jebel Ali Free Zone of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
"The new facility in Dubai will help us reach customers with the
right product at the right time," Ravinder S. Sokhi, marketing
director of the Middle East Operations, was quoted by the official
WAM news agency as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plant, at an investment of over 18 million dirhams (4.92
million U.S. dollars), has a capacity to produce 750,000 batteries
per year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the new one in Jebel Ali, Exide has three other plants
in Saudi Arabia, one each in Muscat and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Exide has been supplying batteries to the UAE through its
authorized distributor, Al Kharbash Group of Companies. It has been
selling about 30,000 batteries a year in the UAE since it entered
the market in 1999.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Israel is stepping up preparations to purchase water
from Turkey following the visit by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to Turkey on August 28, reported Anatolia News Agency on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The construction of a 13-kilometer-long pipeline from the
discharging installations in Ashkelon, southern Israel, to the main
reservoir in Nohora has started. The project, which is expected to
cost 20 million U.S. dollars, is expected to be completed by mid-
2001. Meanwhile, it was reported that Turkey had agreed to cut
the price from 23 cents one cubic meter to 8-10 cents.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which has suffered severe drought, plans to purchase 45
million cubic meters of water at the first stage.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Resistance Party Asks for Foreign Troop Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Union of Congolese
Resistance Forces (UCRF) has appealed to Uganda, Rwanda and
Burundi to withdraw their troops from the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) to avoid unnecessary loss of lives on all parties
involved in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing journalists here on Thursday, Mulengwa Bagiel,
chairman of the UCRF, cautioned that should the plea fall in a
deaf ear, his union would mobilize people to make assault.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, we invite all political parties and armed
groups to join the UCRF platform in order to canalize all efforts
towards peace," said Mulengwa.
</P>
<P>
He called on several major warring factions in the DRC, which
he said are working for foreign interests, to come to their senses
and put the interest of the people first.
</P>
<P>
Rebels backed by Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, who have been
fighting the DRC government led by Laurent Kabila since August
1998, control large parts of the east and north of the country.
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia are supporting the Kabila government.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire agreement was agreed in the Zambian capital,
Lusaka, in July 1999, but it has not been respected by any of the
parties and the fighting has continued.

<HEADLINE> U.N. General Assembly President Sees IPU as Natural Ally of U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- President of the United
Nations General Assembly (GA) Theo-Ben Gurirab said on Thursday
that the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is a global organization
and a natural ally of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Conference of Presiding Officers of National
Parliaments which opened here Wednesday, Gurirab said this obvious
reality had for many years failed to hit a home run until every
recently.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab said the gathering is good for the United Nations and,
no doubt, for global good governance which itself requires some
hard knocking in the best interest of democratization,
transparency and accountability in international relations.
</P>
<P>
The international community is facing the same challenges
including the current unipolarity of the world, democratization,
challenges of globalization, regional cooperation, poverty
eradication, unemployment, the worsening gap between the rich and
the poor, HIV/AIDS, wars and armed conflicts, sustainable
development, protection of environment and U.N. restructuring and
democratization, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Against this background, the IPU has at last arrived on the U.N.
scene which would make this newly formalized relationship between
the U.N. and the IPU constructive and lasting, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to delegates from Cuba and Yugoslavia who were denied
entry visa by the United Sates, the president said "I am aware
that not all of you are present at this crucial conference."
</P>
<P>
"Some of the speakers who had wanted to be here were prevented
from coming and this for me is a source of deep distress. We can
never understand, nor condone, such unilateral actions. We must
speak up and take joint action against what we all clearly detest,
" he added.

<HEADLINE> Oil Producers, Consumers to Meet in Riyadh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Oil producers and consumers
will examine in-depth problems of the international market during
a meeting around mid November in Riyadh, OPEC President Ali
Rodriguez said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At this meeting, delegates will talk about adopting the price
band system planned by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
OPEC hopes that in line with the price band system, crude has a
minimum price of 22 U.S. dollars per barrel and a maximum of 28
dollars, for a balance between producers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
The Riyadh meeting will follow the OPEC summit programmed for
September 27 and 28 in Caracas, Rodriguez said. He is also
Venezuela's energy and mines minister.
</P>
<P>
Heads of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait and Libya declined
attending the summit due to security or health problems.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC, which was created in 1960, is made up of Venezuela,
Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Libya, Algeria, United Arab
Emirates, Indonesia, Qatar and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the band system, if price maintains itself
for 20 days above or below the limit, OPEC will increase or bring
down crude extraction.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman from Venezuela's Energy and Mines
Ministry, the Caracas summit statement will be prudent and not
promote the extreme defense of OPEC interests but rather the
understanding of producers and consumers.

LONDON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- An editor of Britain's tabloid

with the alleged theft of letters belonging to the late Diana,
Princess of Wales.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Ruling Party Wraps Up Caucus with Calm Optimism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Canada's ruling Liberal Party is
wrapping up a three-day caucus in Winnipeg, Manitoba, with calm
optimism about its leading position for the next election and an
imminent health deal with provinces.
</P>
<P>
Party pollster Michael Marzolini gave Liberal members of
parliament Wednesday a cautiously optimistic picture to urge them
to "stay down the middle" for the victory of the next election,
which could be expected at any time between the fall 2000 and the
spring 2001.
</P>
<P>
According to Marzolini's "snapshot of the nation," the
Liberals take a lead of 43 to 23 percent against its arch-rival,
the newly formed Canadian Alliance party.
</P>
<P>
The pollster put the rates of support for the country's New
Democrats (NDP) at 12 percent, the Bloc Quebecois at 11 percent
and the Tories at nine percent.
</P>
<P>
The optimism appeared cooler than another poll released on the
same day by local media, which showed 46 percent of support for
Liberals, 22 percent for the Canadian Alliance and 10 percent for
either the Tories or the NDP.
</P>
<P>
Marzolini claimed the ruling party still enjoys a commanding
lead in public opinion, Prime Minister Jean Chretien is still the
most popular leader and, if an election were held today, the party
would win a third consecutive majority.
</P>
<P>
But he also warned that Liberals cannot take victory for
granted simply on their record. They must better respond to
Canadians' priorities including health care, the environment and
tax relief, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chretien, who reiterated his confidence to lead the
party to a new victory Tuesday night at the opening of the caucus,
expressed a virtual certainty Wednesday for a health care deal
next month to end years of squabbling between the federal and
provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
"I think we're very close," Chretien told reporters after
meeting with Manitoba Premier Gary Doer, who is spokesman for the
provinces this year.
</P>
<P>
"Ninety to 95 percent of the road has been covered. We think
that if everything works well, there will be an agreement between
the first government and the provincial governments," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deal is expected at a meeting on September 11, when
Chretien and the premiers would work toward an agreement on the
demand that Ottawa increase the Canada Health and Social Transfer
to the provinces to 18.7 billion Canadian dollars (about 12.7
billion U.S. dollars) from 15.5 billion (about 10.5 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Former Russian Fleet Commander Deplores Poor Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A former Russian fleet commander
said Thursday all the misfortunes of the Russian Navy are due to
insufficient financing and that if the problem is not addressed
properly, tragedies like the sinking of the Kursk nuclear
submarine that killed 118 servicemen may reoccur.
</P>
<P>
Admiral Oleg Yerofeyev, who commanded the Northern Fleet from
1992-1999, said the lack of financing also reflects negatively on
prospects for the Russian Navy's development.
</P>
<P>
In an interview that appeared on the Thursday edition of the
Russikiye Vesti newspaper, Yerofeyev listed construction of the
Yury Dolgoruky new-generation strategic submarine as an example.
</P>
<P>
Because the project is going "far too slowly... a strategic
submarine equipped with expensive weapons is becoming obsolete
already on the docks," Yerofeyev said.
</P>
<P>
On what caused the Kursk to go down to the bottom of the
Barents Sea during naval exercises, Yerofeyev said he does not
believe that the sub had collided with another vessel.
</P>
<P>
A collision with another heavy object was one of the possible
reasons listed by a government commission investigating the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Yerofeyev said the region "is closed for 10 days" during
training exercises and that "the heads of all companies owning any
seagoing vehicles are informed of the training."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reports of a possible collision with a
British submarine, he said: "I do not believe that the
administration of Great Britain and its navy are so cynical as to
blatantly lie to the entire world community. It is impossible to
hide such a fact."
</P>
<P>
"A foreign submarine would have been seriously damaged and
there would have been submariners in it," Yerofeyev said.
Therefore, it should have either entered a dock for repairs or
been written off. "Americans have written off two of their
submarines after collisions with ours," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, a collision cannot be concealed. If it is
indeed confirmed, then the British prime minister will have to
resign at once," the Interfax news agency quoted the admiral as
saying in the interview.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, a recent poll show that 31
percent of Russians consider the Kursk sinking a tragic misfortune
while 28 percent see it as an indication of the technical
imperfection of Russian military technology.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Interfax reported the results of the poll, which
was conducted by the All-Russia Center for the Study of Public
Opinion on August 28 and involved 1,600 Russians.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, 21 percent of the respondents consider
the tragedy an indication of the government's poor control over
the situation in the armed forces, 20 percent see it a result of
mistakes made by the Navy command. Eighteen percent think it is
due to the command's inability to ensure necessary cooperation
with ships and rescuers.
</P>
<P>
Only 13 percent of respondents believe the catastrophe was
caused by hostile actions on the part of NATO military forces,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Of those polled, 19 percent say the commander of the Northern
Fleet must resign over the tragedy; 21 percent believe the
commander of the Russian Navy should step down.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and President Vladimir Putin
were also on the list. Nineteen percent of those polled say
Sergeyev should resign whereas 16 percent say Putin should stand
down.
</P>
<P>
On August 23, the national day of mourning for the 118
submariners, Putin told the Russians on national television that
he felt "fully responsible and guilty" for the tragedy, but he
refused to accept the resignations tendered by Sergeyev, Navy
Commander-in- Chief Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov and Northern Fleet
Commander Vyacheslav Popov.
</P>
<P>
He said the causes and circumstances of the sinking of the
Kursk should first be clarified.
</P>
<P>
To accept someone's resignation or fire someone "is the easiest
and most erroneous way out" of the tragic situation, but that "
does not change the essence of the matter," Putin said.

<HEADLINE> Iraqis to Be Able to Watch More TV Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqis will soon be able to
watch more television channels with more broadcast hours, a source
at the ministry of culture and information said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the ministry is negotiating with an
international company specializing in manufacturing satellite
antennas in order to upgrade Iraq's TV system within the coming six
months.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes smoothly, the TV channels that Iraqi people
can watch will be increased to seven at first, then to 14, from the
present three, which broadcast programs about 12 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
The broadcast hours will be ultimately increased to 24 hours a
day, the source said.
</P>
<P>
This surely sounds good for the Iraqi people, who suffered most
under the crippling sanctions imposed by the United Nations
following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
But the staggering price may make them balk at tuning in for the
service which, according to the source, will cost about 320 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The average income of government employees is about 50,000 Iraqi
dinars (25 dollars) a month.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Cabinet Approves 2001 State Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus cabinet on Thursday
approved the 2001 state budget, which projects 2,417.0 million
Cyprus pounds (4,834.0 million U.S. dollars) in expenditure and 1,
576.0 million pounds (3,152 million dollars) in revenue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a two-hour cabinet meeting, Finance Minister
Takis Clerides expressed his satisfaction with the performance of
Cyprus economy in 2000, and predicted "encouraging prospects for
2001" with an estimated rate of growth at 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit is estimated at 841.0 million pounds (1,682.0
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Public deficit is expected to show slight improvement and be
restricted to 190.9 million pounds (381.8 million dollars) in 2001
from 210.6 million pounds (421.2 million dollars) the year before.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, he said, is expected to rise to 4.2 percent compared
with 1.7 percent in 1999, due primarily to the increase in oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
Expenditures on development projects for 2001 are expected to
reach 292.0 million pounds (584.0 million dollars) compared with
286.8 million pounds (573.6 million dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Some 55 million pounds (110 million dollars) will go to
improving the road network, another 23 million pounds (46 million
dollars) to water projects, 7 million pounds (14 million dollars)
to infrastructure at the island's two airports and about 25 million
pounds (50 million dollars) will go to education.
</P>
<P>
The budget has no provision for the creation or upgrading of new
posts in the civil service, Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
The budget will be tabled to the House of Representatives for
approval.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Entitled to Join European Army: DM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has both the right and the
obligation to join the European Union (EU) Common and Foreign
Security Policy, Defense Minister Socrates Hasikos said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made in response to loud criticism from the
Turkish Cypriot side in the north of the divided island about the
Cyprus government's attempt to join the European army.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the island's southern Larnaca airport before heading
for Athens for a private visit, Hasikos said Cyprus' EU accession
course is a one-way street and a strategic policy choice, adding
that "our effort to be part of the European army must be seen
within this context."
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash has threatened to leave the U.N.-sponsored proximity
talks, due to resume next month in New York, if the EU makes any
further move to bring Cyprus closer to joining the European army.
</P>
<P>
Hasikos pointed out that Cyprus is already engaged in the
process of participation in its capacity as a candidate country,
and is set to attend in November a meeting of the 15-member EU with
other candidate states, one of which is Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said Denktash's remarks targeted the EU and not the Cyprus
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Denktash's threats would affect the talks, Hasikos
hoped this would not be the case.
</P>
<P>
"What will affect the talks is the approach Ankara and Denktash
will adopt and whether the Turkish Cypriot leader will go with a
sincere disposition and will to find a peaceful, lasting and viable
settlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides
since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of
the island following a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have held three rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity
talks in an effort to find a solution in the island, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved. The fourth round of talks are
scheduled to start on September 12 in New york.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba expressed the hope on Thursday that all countries
afflicted by armed conflicts in Africa and other parts of the
world will observe an "Olympic Truce" during the Sydney Olympic
games billed for middle September.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the Olympic Games "plays a vital role and
contributes to building a peaceful and better world by educating
the youth through sports, the necessity of mutual understanding
with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fairplay."
</P>
<P>
"It is my sincere understanding that a peaceful solution
through sports will be found to the war torn areas of Angola,
Democratic republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Eritrea
and Kosovo," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking when he received an International Olympic 2000
trophy from the Zambia Olympic Commonwealth and all Africa Games
Association (ZOCAGA) at the State House.
</P>
<P>
Dawson Lupunga, Acting Sports, Youth and Child Development
Minister, presented the trophy to Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
" The Olympic ideal, is therefore, a hymn to tolerance and
understanding between people and culture. It is an athletic event
and invitation to competition but the focal point is based on
respect for others.
</P>
<P>
" The Olympic Movement in its own way is a school of democracy
which acts as a natural link between the ethics of the Olympic
Games and the fundamental principles of the United Nations," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland's Implementation of Bilateral Treaties with EU Face Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The bilateral treaties that
Switzerland has negotiated with the European Union (EU) will not
come into effect as scheduled in January 2001, according to local
reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's German-language Swiss radio (DRS) quoted a
spokesman for the country's European integration bureau as saying
that the treaties would not be implemented before next spring at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
The seven mainly commercial accords, covering issues such as
transport, the free movement of people and research, had to be
ratified by the parliaments of all 15 EU member states this year
if they were to come into effect in January.
</P>
<P>
Several countries, including France, have told Switzerland that
their parliaments will not consider the issue before their winter
sessions, DRS said.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss people gave the treaties the go-ahead in a referendum
in May, and since then government ministers have been rallying
support for early ratification in European capitals.
</P>
<P>
The delay could cause further problems between Berne and
Brussels. Switzerland is intending to introduce a heavy vehicles
road tax for EU trucks transiting the country in January, as part
of the accords.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland will not now be able to take part in European
research programs until 2002, DRS added.
</P>
<P>
There has been no comment so far from the Swiss authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, Swiss Foreign Minister Joseph Deiss has already
started discussions with EU leaders on the next set of treaties to
be discussed. It is not known how the delay in introducing the
bilateral accords will affect these negotiations.

<HEADLINE> France to Cut 120 Billion Francs of Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The French government will cut a
total of 120 billion francs (17 billion U.S. dollars) of taxes
from 2001 to 2003, including a general lowering of income tax.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry Laurent Fabius
announced at a press conference that in three years from 2001, all
the rates in income tax will be cut by a total sum of 45 billion
francs (6.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Although people with all levels of income will benefit from the
measure, it will most benefit those with the least income,
according to the minister who announced the budget project for the
year 2001 at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Next year alone, taxes will drop by 60 billion francs (8.5
billion U.S. dollars), according to budget project.
</P>
<P>
The government has already decided to cut 80 billion francs (11.
5 billion U.S. dollars) of taxes for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Due to the rise of fuel prices, the road tax disc for
automobiles will be cancelled for individual car owners from
November but will be maintained for vehicles belonging to
companies.
</P>
<P>
Those with a minimum income guaranteed, also called SMIC, will
have their income increased by 540 francs (77 U.S. dollars) --
about 10 percent of their salary -- each month by 2003, because of
tax cutting.
</P>
<P>
Other measures will include lowering taxes on social
contributions by people of low income and the tax on consumption
of certain oil products because of their rising costs, and the
cancellation of a 10 percent extra tax on the income of companies.

<HEADLINE> Russia Airs Surprise at U.S. Position on Alleged Spy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Moscow expressed surprise
Thursday at statements made by the U.S. State Department on Russia
's s detention of an American citizen on charges of espionage.
</P>
<P>
"What is most surprising is the attempts made by U.S. officials
to assert his innocence, something that only investigating and
judicial bodies can do," the Interfax news agency quoted the
Russian Foreign Ministry as saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Hints made by State Department officials about a possible link
between Pope's case and the development of Russian-U.S. trade and
economic links are especially worrying," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian statement came after U.S. State Department
Spokesman Philip Reeker's remarks Tuesday that Washington was
examining the implications for U.S. business travelers of the five-
month long imprisonment of Pope, a retired U.S. Navy intelligence
officer.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) accuses Pope of
having made contact with a Russian scientist, saying he was
gathering data on a Russian underwater missile.
</P>
<P>
"Russian law-enforcement agencies have evidence that Pope
collected secret data on Russia's defenses. The investigation has
been brought to completion, Pope and his attorneys are studying
the case that will be sent to court," the Russian Foreign Ministry
statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. State Department said that Pope should be
released because "no evidence exists that he has violated Russian
laws.
</P>
<P>
Washington also expressed concern over the treatment of Pope,
who is reportedly in remission from bone cancer, but a Moscow
court rejected Pope's request to be released on bail after Russian
physicians' conclusion that Pope was fit enough to stand trial.
The Moscow city court would hear Pope's appeal on September 11.
</P>
<P>
"The investigation met the requirements of Russian and
international law. In particular, Pope has an attorney, members of
the U.S. embassy staff have seen him on several occasions and
meetings with his wife are being organized," the Russian statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Pope has had regular medical examinations. Russian doctors say
they think his health is satisfactory. His medical history, made
available by the Americans as late as August 23, is being studied,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The document said Washington's "attempts to put pressure on the
investigating and judicial bodies do not add to the prestige of
the United States, which has declared that law is its overriding
principle."
</P>
<P>
"What we are witnessing is a new manifestation of double
standards," the statement said. "The U.S. authorities show no
leniency to people convicted on similar charges inside the United
States, whatever the state of their health, but want other
countries to use a different approach."
</P>
<P>
"This policy is unacceptable," the statement said, noting that
Russian judiciary bodies must have the last say in the matter.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted the FSB as saying that Pope, after his
retirement from the U.S. Navy intelligence establishment,
regularly visited Russia as a representative of the University of
Pennsylvania and later as the head of the TechSource Marine Group
Ltd. private company.
</P>
<P>
It said Pope visited research institutes in Moscow, St.
Petersburg, Novosibirsk and other Russian cities, which were
involved in creating high-speed underwater and above- water
objects.
</P>
<P>
The FSB public relations center said Pope was especially
interested in a high-speed underwater rocket adopted by the
Russian Navy. When launched from a submarine, such a rocket can
move at a speed of over 100 meters per second.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted experts as describing the weapon as the most
effective one in a so-called "boat duel," and even light boats
equipped with such a rocket are capable of destroying a modern
warship.

<HEADLINE> Britain Angry Over France's Domestic Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- France's domestic dispute over
rising oil prices has made Britain angry because thousands of
British tourists are stranded in France by fishermen's protests,
European Union (EU) officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Britain has made clear that it was angry at being caught up in
a domestic French dispute which prevented thousands of tourists
from returning home.
</P>
<P>
The British travelers had to try to cross the Dover Channel
these days at Ostend and Zeebrugge, the port cities of Belgium.
They are joined by hundreds of trucks queuing to get into ferries
at Zeebrugge.
</P>
<P>
In the past two days, shipping company Sea France diverted its
vessels via Ostend. P&AMP;O Stena Line, another shipping firm, added
extra ships to the Zeebrugge-Dover link.
</P>
<P>
French fishermen had blocked most of France's major ports in
protest against high oil prices. They want supportive measures
from the government. Their actions caused problems at ferry ports,
including Calais, this week.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, French fishermen agreed to end their
blockade after reaching agreement with the government. However,
British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott is planning to meet
French ministers and the European Commission, the European Union's
executive arm, to discuss whether such a protest action was legal.
</P>
<P>
"Holding Britain to ransom because of an industrial dispute or
a dispute in France is totally unacceptable to us," Prescott said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU is worried about the high oil prices
throughout its member states. A spokesman for the European
Commission told a news briefing here that the commission will
discuss the issue at its first meeting after the summer break on
September 6.
</P>
<P>
A number of EU governments, faced with growing protests, have
announced or are planning to compensate sensitive sectors, such as
transport, for the rise in prices.

<HEADLINE> New U.N. Weapons Team For Iraq Ready to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The new U.N. weapons team
for Iraq said on Thursday that it is ready to begin its work in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a written report to the United Nations Security Council,
Hans Blix, head of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) for Iraq, gave an account of
recent recruitment, training and organizational activities.
</P>
<P>
Blix, former head of the Vienna-based International Atomic
Energy Agency, said UNMOVIC's first training course for 44 people
representing 19 nationalities was held from July 11 to August 10,
mostly in New York.
</P>
<P>
In addition to weapons-related instruction, he said,
participants received cultural training from Columbia University
academics on such topics as the history, economy, politics and
society of Iraq as well as on regional, social and religious
themes.
</P>
<P>
Preparations are under way for the second training course,
which is planned to be held in France form November 7 to December
8, Blix said.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the first course and the recruitment of
a sufficient number of professional and trained core staff, the
commission could plan and commence a number of activities in Iraq
which would be necessary to prepare for monitoring, verification
and inspection envisaged by the United Nations Security Council,
Blix said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspection team has been away from Iraq since the
U.S.-led military strikes against the country in December 1998.
Iraq has reiterated that lifting the sanctions is the precondition
for the weapons team to return.
</P>
<P>
UNMOVIC was established in December 1999 to replace the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq'
s weapons of mass destruction. UNSCOM was accused by Iraq of
working for the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to the relevant resolution of the United Nations
Security Council, sanctions against Iraq cannot not be lifted
until the U.N. clarifies that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons
of mass destruction. Iraq has been under stringent U.N. sanctions
since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Fall by Record 7.5 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- New orders to U.S. factories
plunged by a record 7.5 percent in July, led by the biggest-ever
monthly drop in demand for airplanes and other transportation
equipment, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Total factory orders fell to a seasonally adjusted rate of 377.
6 billion U.S. dollars in July, down from 408.1 billion dollars in
June.
</P>
<P>
In June, factory orders rose a revised 5.2 percent. That was
slightly weaker than the government reported one month ago.
</P>
<P>
Orders for transportation equipment fell a record 31.8 percent
in July, thanks to a drop in demand for airplanes and aircraft
parts. In June, transportation orders rose a huge 41.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile transportation category, factory orders
fell a modest 2.6 percent in July. The transportation sector
swings widely from month to month because it includes costly items
such as airplanes, ships and tanks.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods, big-ticket manufactured items
expected to last at least three years, fell by a record 12.4
percent after a 9.2 percent increase in June. Demand for
nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, fell 0.3 percent, after a
0.1 percent decrease in June.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a barometer of current production, fell by 1.2
percent last month after posting a 0.8 percent increase in June.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times over
the last 14 months to slow the economy and keep inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Commerce Department said consumers spent
5.5 billion dollars shopping in cyberspace during the second
quarter of the year. That was 5.3 percent higher than the 5.2
billion dollars posted in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce sales in the second quarter accounted for 0.68
percent of total sales, down from 0.7 percent in the January-March
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The government in March began issuing quarterly estimates of
such sales in an effort to show the impact the Internet is having
on the American economy.

BRUSSELS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB)
on Thursday raised its key interest rate by 0.25 percentage points
to 4.5 percent in a bid to ease the pressure of a rising inflation
in the 11-nation single currency area.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that medium-term upward pressure on prices be
contained, said the bank in a statement after a Governing Council
meeting.
</P>
<P>
It hoped the rate hike could "support the favorable prospects
for high economic growth in the euro area.
</P>
<P>
The ECB has warned of medium-term price instability and
possible rises in inflation in the eurozone as a result of the
euro's weakness and the high oil prices on world market.
</P>
<P>
However, there are worries that the rate rise could choke off
recovery of the German economy, which is Europe's largest.
</P>
<P>
The rise is the sixth in 10 months in the ECB benchmark minimum
bidding rate. The bank is charged with maintaining price stability
in the eurozone, which it has translated into keeping annual
inflation below 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In July, the eurozone's average consumer price inflation
remained unchanged from June at 2.4 percent. This prompted the ECB
chief economist Otmar Issing to say that the chance to keep
eurozone's inflation within the 2 percent limit is little.
</P>
<P>
Further evidence of inflationary pressure came during the past
week with news that German producer prices are growing at their
fastest pace in nine years, chiefly due to increase in the cost of
imported energy.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the ECB's dilemma is that a rate rise could dampen
economic growth across Europe.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rate rise, the euro is at the moment still near its
record low against the U.S. dollar at the level of 0.89.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Should Rely on Itself in Economic Development: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 31 (Xinhua) -- First Vice-Premier Yuri Yekhanurov
said Wednesday that Ukraine should readjust its policies of
economic development and rely on its own efforts.
</P>
<P>
Yekhanurov pointed out that Ukraine has already been living
without external borrowings for almost one year and essentially
reduced its external and internal debts, the Interfax-Ukraine news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the International Monetary Fund's wait-and-see
attitude toward Ukraine, he said: "I believe Ukrainians should,
first of all, think how we can survive on our own efforts. I
believe we can do a good job in 2001."
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended the funding for Ukraine on the Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) program in September 1999 due to Ukraine's failure
to meet a number of its terms.
</P>
<P>
It is reported the Ukrainian government expects the IMF Board
of Directors to resume the funding in October.

<HEADLINE> European Court Rejects Request of Former Turkish PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Strasbourg-based European
Court of Human Rights Thursday rejected a request from former
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan for suspension of a one-
year prison sentence handed down to him by Turkish courts.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted the defense attorney of Erbakan,
Laurent Hincker, as saying that the Second Section of the European
Court judged that the circumstances did not justify a suspension
of the sentence.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Supreme Court made definite on July 5 the
condemnation of Erbakan by the Court of Security in Diyarbakir in
southeastern Turkey, which convicted him of agitation for racial
and religious hatred and pro-Kurdish remarks during an election
campaign in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, 74, was forced to quit premiership by the Turkish army
in 1997 which launched an anti-Islamic campaign.
</P>
<P>
His Islamist party was also dissolved in May 1998 and he was
deprived of the right to run in a legislative election in July
1998.
</P>
<P>
On July 28, Erbakan resorted to the European Court of Human
Rights, calling for a balanced new trial in his case because of
the presence of a military judge at the Court of Diyarbakir.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the Turkish authorities of depriving him of the
freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan will begin serving his prison term in 2001. According
to the Turkish criminal code, he will stay in jail for four months
and will be definitely banned from politics.

<P>
LHASA -- Statistics show that 185,000 people from home and
abroad visited Tibet Autonomous Region in the first half of the
year, an increase of 57 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of overseas visitors rose by 40 percent to reach 35,
000 in the six-month period.
</P>
<P>
Local tourism department predicted that Tibet will become one
of the top choices of worldwide travelers in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Sources from local tourism department attributed the increase
in visitors to the facts that Chinese people now have more
holidays, which enable them to visit places as far away as Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Opening up of the region is cited as another factor which
attracts more and more overseas travelers. The Potala Palace once
received some 600 visitors daily.
</P>
<P>
In Lhasa, Xigaze and Shannan, visitors have to live at the
homes of local residents because local hotels are booked out.
</P>
<P>
Tibet boasts rich tourism resources which include 50 mountains
with an elevation of over 7,000 meters, seven peaks which are more
than 8,000 meters high, the Yarlung Zangbo River valley, the
longest in the world, colorful landforms and special wildlife
resources. The region also has typical traditional culture, the
Potala Palace and several hundred temples and monasteries.
</P>
<P>
The Potala Palace has been included in the World Culture
Heritage list, and the Johkang Monastery in Lhasa is applying to
be included in the list.
</P>
<P>
At present, Tibet is constructing eight tourism routes which
will connect Lhasa and other major cities in Tibet with
neighboring Sichuan, Yunnan and Qinghai provinces and Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, and also with neighboring Nepal.

July 2000, the highest ever for any month in history and up 12.2
percent compared with the same period of last year, Singapore

HONG KONG -- Bank of China (BOC) Group registered the pre-tax
profits of 4.8 billion HK dollars (615 million U.S. dollars) in
its commercial banking business in the first half of 2000, a
growth of 58.3 percent compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Net interest income rose by 560 million HK dollars (71.8
million U.S. dollars), representing an increase of 7.3 percent
over the same period of 1999, said Liu Jinbao, chief executive of
the BOC Hong Kong-Macao Regional Office, when he announced the
group's 2000 Interim Results here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increase mainly to the strengthening of both
the asset and liability management, as well as fund management.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the buoyant stock market, the BOC group also got an
increase of 121 percent in brokerage income over the same period
of last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, total deposits stood at 658.5 billion HK
dollars (84.4 billion U.S. dollars), a rise of 4.5 percent over
June, 1999 and a growth of 2.9 percent compared with the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Loans and advances of the group totaled 355.5 billion HK
dollars (45.6 billion U.S. dollars), basically the same as those
of the corresponding period of 1999, but a slight growth of 0.6
percent from the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The loan to deposit ratio was 54 percent at end-June, a
reduction of 1.2 percentage points compared with the end of 1999,
Liu said, adding that this was due mainly to the group's higher
deposits growth rate than that of loans, in addition to the
constraints of the still sluggish credit market.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" Works Well in Macao: Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Anybody who has been to Macao
since China resumed the exercise of sovereignty can see that Deng
Xiaoping's great political concept of "one country, two systems"
is working well, visiting Macao Chief Executive Ho Hau Wah said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon hosted by the Singapore Chinese Chamber
of Commerce and Industry and Singapore International Chamber of
Commerce, Ho said Macao enjoys a high degree of autonomy, its
existing capitalist system will remain intact and the area
continues to be a free port and a separate customs territory, Ho
said.
</P>
<P>
"Our national leaders in Beijing have given us their maximum
support since the reunification," Ho said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "it has been made clear time and again that
it is up to us in Macao to chart our own course in line with our
political constitution, the Macao Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
"We all deeply cherish the memory of Mr. Deng Xiaoping and his
great political vision and extraordinary wisdom that created the
right way for the peaceful settlement of the questions of Hong
Kong, Macao and eventually Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said everything that has happened in Macao since its return
to China rests on the shoulders of all its residents and the body
politic -- the government, the legislature, the judiciary -- and

Consequently, Ho said, Macao continues to pursue a policy of
free enterprise and free trade, including the free movement of
goods, assets and capital.
</P>
<P>
On Macao's economic outlook, Ho said there are signs that the
recession is finally bottoming out as Macao's total export value

months this year.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Explore Peaceful Means for American's Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
explore peaceful means to secure the safe release of American
Jeffrey Schilling from the Abu Sayyaf group, National Security
Adviser Alexander Aguirre said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Aguirre noted that the government will
not appoint a special negotiator for the release of Schilling as
this is a "normal police action."
</P>
<P>
"We are not talking about the military option. We want a
successful resolution, that's why we are not thinking about that.
We are not doing anything but to conduct peaceful negotiations,"
Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the agencies concerned will have their own
appropriate initiatives. This is an operational matter that should
not be discussed in public, and we will see what will happen."
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said the law enforcement community is now looking into
reports from the field that Schilling may have been a willing
victim because he is a Muslim convert.
</P>
<P>
Citing reports reaching his office, Aguirre said Schilling has
no connection with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, as
claimed by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf abducted Schilling On Monday and threatened to
behead him unless Washington releases Ramzi Yousef and two other
international terrorists jailed in the United States in connection
with the World Trade Center bombing several years ago.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. Embassy said in a statement that it does not deal
with terrorists, and instead demanded Schilling's unconditional
release.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aguirre said the government is optimistic that chief
negotiator Robert Aventajado can successfully complete
negotiations for the release of the remaining hostages in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is still holding more than 20 Filipino and
foreign hostages in Jolo, including five hostages they abducted
from Malaysia on April 23.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka's Ruling Coalition Secures Vital Support from Muslim Ally By Lian Guohui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's ruling People's
Alliance (PA) has secured vital support from its Muslim ally in
the run-up to the 11th general elections, party sources said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader and Ports Minister M.H
M. Ashraff has pledged to President Chandrika Kumaratunga that his
party will continue to support the PA at the elections due on
October 10.
</P>
<P>
Although some 35 political parties and independent groups are
expected to have joined the race for the 225-member parliament,
the main contest is between the PA and the main opposition United
National Party (UNP). The SLMC's support will surely be a shot in
the arm for the PA to win the reelection.
</P>
<P>
Ashraff, who resigned from the cabinet last week in protest
over criticism against him from a fellow Muslim minister, held
lengthy talks till early Thursday with President Kumaratunga to
agree on their electoral arrangements for the elections, party
sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, SLMC has decided that it will contest alone in four
out of the 22 electoral districts under the National Unity
Alliance (NUA). The NUA is a popular front of the SLMC formed two
years ago in a bid to give the party a national image,
transcending its eastern province based Islamic roots.
</P>
<P>
Rauf Hakeem, who was appointed on Wednesday as deputy leader
for the NUA, said the reason behind this was because the PA has
consistently lost these seats to the UNP.
</P>
<P>
Hakeem said that if the NUA were to contest alone it was
confident it would make a dent in the UNP vote bank in these areas
and be able to secure a bonus seat for the PA.
</P>
<P>
The rift between the SLMC and the PA began last week when
Transport Minister A.H.M. Fowzie issued a statement slamming the
SLMC over the party's demand for a higher quota of seats at the
elections. He said the party was a spent force which cannot get
more than five seats in the elections unless they contest with the
PA.
</P>
<P>
Ashraff resigned and went to Mecca in a huff last week although
his resignation was not accepted.
</P>
<P>
Party sources said President Kumaratunga had requested Ashraff,
who returned from Mecca on Tuesday, to continue with the PA and
assured him that there would be a disciplinary hearing against
Fowzie. Earlier, Ashraff had insisted on Fowzie's sacking even
before entering talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
However, the row has somewhat abated after the meeting with the
president until early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The SLMC, which won seven seats in the August 1994 elections,
provided crucial support which allowed Kumaratunga to form a
government even though it had only a one-seat majority.
</P>
<P>
It is rumored that the president has promised the SLMC leader
two cabinet portfolios including the post of two deputy ministers
in the event the PA is returned to power.
</P>
<P>
Hakeem said the SLMC is confident Minister Fowzie will not be
returned to cabinet in the event the PA is again voted into power.
"The president is exasperated and very bitter with him and his
constant tantrums and it is a foregone conclusion that he will not
be returned to her cabinet again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nominations for the election opened Monday and will be kept
open by noon next Monday. Some 12 million people are eligible to
vote on October 10 to elect the next parliament under a system of
proportional representation.

<HEADLINE> French Fishermen Lift Blockade of Channel Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- French fishermen blocking vehicle
access to the Channel Tunnel in protest against high fuel prices
lifted the blockade at Coquelles, Pas-de-Calais, early Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The lifting came after French Minister of Agriculture Jean
Glavany announced a comprehensive plan of compensation for the
fishermen, including a cut of social charges and costs for using
port facilities by the fishermen.
</P>
<P>
However, the ports of Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer near the
Channel Tunnel remained blocked early in the afternoon, shipping
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
Ferry services between France and England had been forced into
a standstill because of the blockade.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen have been blocking major ports across France,
including those on the North Sea, the Atlantic and the
Mediterranean, since early this week.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Eurotunnel said that owing to the blockade,
hundreds of British tourists have been prevented from returning
home. It would take three hours to clear up the traffic jam in the
area, they said.

<HEADLINE> Way for China's Largest Economic Zone Back on Fast Track: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Opening up resource-rich
industries is considered an effective way to run Hainan's economy,
an island province and China's largest special economic zone in
the southern most part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chi Fulin, a renowned economist on regional economy, said if
Hainan could lead the country in opening up agriculture, tourism
and marine industries, it could regain a fast growth rate boosted
by overseas capital, technology, managerial practices as well as
overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is still suffering from the aftermath of a bubble
economy in 1995, when its gross domestic product dropped to 4.3
percent, the lowest among all provinces in the country that year.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also the head of China (Hainan) Reform and Development
Institute, said China's gradual incorporation into the global
economy, especially the country's anticipated accession into the
WTO, has provided Hainan with unprecedented opportunities.
</P>
<P>
For example, Hainan accounts for one-third of the country's
tropical land coverage and has the advantage of developing a high-
yield tropical agriculture. So far, Hainan, one of China's
designated agriculture cooperation zone with Taiwan, has
introduced 95 percent of Taiwan's high-grade tropical fruit
strains.
</P>
<P>
The province, surrounded by the South China Sea, is considered
the most important processing center for tapping into abundant
marine resources, such as fishing, offshore oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Chi said although Hainan is designated as an economic zone,
over half of the island is farmland, orchards and forests. The
only effective way of boosting the local economy is to open up
resources for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1988, the Hainan economic zone has attracted a
large sum of capital from at home and abroad, amounting to 136
billion yuan (16 billion US dollars). This capital accounts for
two-thirds of the province's total fixed infrastructure
investments.
</P>
<P>
In the next 15 years, Hainan needs to draw in 900 billion yuan
(108 billion US dollars) in order to sustain a double digit growth,
said Chi.
</P>
<P>
He said unlike many inland provinces, Hainan has laid a solid
and sound free market economy, since the province was turned from
virgin land into an investment magnet.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has the potential of further attracting foreign
investment.

<HEADLINE> Nature Reserve To Protect Rare Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A nature reserve to protect 1,000
brown-colored rare birds will be built in forest area in Hancheng
City of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
These rare birds--crossoptilon mantchuricums--confirmed as an
endangered species, only live in China and are on the national
protection list, according to ornithologists.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve is expected to cover an area of 56,500
hectares.
</P>
<P>
The adult bird weigh some five kg with a body length of one-
meter and a tail resembling a tail of a horse. In recent years,
more than 1,000 such birds have appeared in the Leisizhuang forest
area in central Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
Groups of crossoptilon mantchuricums have been often witnessed
flying around in the forest with an estimated number of
approximately 1,000.
</P>
<P>
The city has applied to the provincial government to build a
nature reserve and to conduct further researches on these birds
and other 100 species of wild animals living in the forest.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Reports Plunge in Lichee Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in south
China reported a plunge in lichee export but a drastic surge in
import of the fruit in the first seven months.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that from January to July, Guangdong's
lichee import and export totaled 11,200 tons valued at 5.16
million U.S. dollars, down by 21.5 percent and 2.5 percent,
respectively, at an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Lichee exports plunged by 80.6 percent year on year, while the
imports, mainly from Thailand and Malaysia, went up by 47.3
percent, according to customs sources.
</P>
<P>
The situation is due to the fact that imported lichees were
ripe earlier and cheaper. Guangdong saw a drop in lichee output,
which in turn drove up purchasing prices for locally produced
lichees.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong produces a half of the world's total output of the
sweet fruit which is cultivated in warm climates.

<HEADLINE> China-Made Subway Cars to be Used in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Changchun-based Anda Railcars
Co. Ltd., a Sino-German joint venture, won a bid today to produce
subway cars to be used on the No. 2 subway line in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The company signed the contract today, which is worth 1.54
billion yuan, the largest project in the construction of Guangzhou
's subway. It also indicates that China is able to produce its own
subway cars.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 18-kilometer-long No.2 subway line in
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, is in full
swing. The first section is expected to be completed by 2002 and
begins its trial operation in early 2003.
</P>
<P>
The subway was constructed with a provision from the State
Development Planning Commission that 70 percent of the subway
equipment should be made in China.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 18.48-kilometer-long No.1 subway in
Guangzhou cost 12.72 billion yuan because all the equipment was
imported from Germany. A local subway official estimated the cost
to build the No.2 subway will be reduced by a big margin because
more China-made equipment will be used.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, Anda Railcars Co. will provide 26
trains with 156 carriages, which will run at a speed of 80
kilometers per hour. The first cars will be delivered in September
2002.

percent of China's re-exports," said Cheung, Hong Kong's principal
economic and trade representative in Tokyo, during her four-day
visit to Japan's Kyushu region, which ended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong companies employ some five million people in wholly
or partly owned ventures in neighboring Guangdong Province and
there are more than 1,800 mainland companies operating in Hong
Kong," she said.
</P>
<P>
She told the Japanese business circle that with China's entry
to the World Trade Organization, there are forecasts that within
six years China's foreign trade and foreign investment would
double and its GDP is estimated to be 13 percent higher by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"These figures point to enormous opportunities for Hong Kong
and the entire trading world," she said.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Injures 13 in S. Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen people were injured in
an explosion in the southern Philippines Thursday afternoon, the
ABS-CBN television said in a report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a bomb made of five mortar shells
exploded at around 4:50 p.m. outside a bus terminal in Kabacan
town of Cotabato province.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Kabacan police chief Jimmy Nabit as saying
that 13 people were injured in the blast. He said the victims have
been sent to nearby hospitals and one of them was in serious
condition.
</P>
<P>
Nabit noted that he suspected the separatist Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) was behind the blast which came after six
other bombings in Kabacan this year.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, MILF guerrillas ambushed a group of soldiers
near the town of Matanog, killing one and wounding nine others.
</P>
<P>
The MILF leadership has called for a "holy war" against
government forces following a military campaign in Mindanao which
resulted in the falling of most of the rebel's camps.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF has been fighting for an independent
state in Mindanao for more than two decades.

<HEADLINE> Zambia University Closed Due to Campus Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The biggest university in Zambia,
the University of Zambia ,Thursday saw an unusually large number
of buses, jeeps, pickups and cars flocking to and rushing out of
the campus, which were busy taking students home.
</P>
<P>
The students have been ordered to leave the university before
13 hours (local time) of Thursday or face arrest.
</P>
<P>
Temporary closure was announced Wednesday night after the
students turned their protest against full payment of tuition and
accommodation fees into violence on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC)
reported Wednesday evening that Zambian police had arrested over
30 students on charge of inciting violence.
</P>
<P>
But government newspaper Times of Zambia reported Thursday that
more than 300 students were arrested on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Students went on an orgy of destruction, blocking traffic and
pedestrians from entering the campus and throwing stones at
passers-by and police, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
ZNBC quoted a police officer as saying that four vehicles were
damaged in the violence.
</P>
<P>
Another government newspaper Zambia Daily Mail reported
Thursday that 30 students were injured as police beat them up with
shot batons. Police also fired teargas to disperse the angry
students.
</P>
<P>
The management of the university demands that the students pay
130,000 Kwacha(about 40 U.S. dollars) for accommodation while
tuition fee ranges from two million Kwacha to 2.5 million Kwacha (
about 600 dollars to 760 dollars) per academic year.
</P>
<P>
The country's per capita GDP is about 400 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Registrar of the university, Susan Kapena who announced the
closure of the university, said that "the students have caused
damage to public and private property and injury to innocent
members of the public in order to coerce the administration into
changing the conditions for admission in their favor.The
university administration strongly disapprove the unruly conduct
of those students who have been misled into acts of lawlessness."

<P>
"This was very trying for the country as a whole and everybody
has been very concerned," Mbeki said at the presidential guest
house in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Callie and Monique were also given a chance to express their
thanks.
</P>
<P>
"It is unbelievable for us to sit here with you (Mbeki). We can
't really express our emotions," Callie said.
</P>
<P>
However, they did not want to give too many details on the
situation on the island for fear of jeopardizing the remaining
hostages.
</P>
<P>
She said they will definitely have a reunion with the other
hostages, but they were concerned about those who were still being
held captive.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma
thanked Callie and Monique for being so strong and courageous
during the past four months.
</P>
<P>
"We also want to say thank you to the parents for their
strength and support, but I think the greatest thanks should go to
the South African nation," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Paris Subway Derailment Most likely Caused by Speeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Wednesday derailment of a
subway train in Paris was most likely caused by excessive speed,
investigators said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"No definite conclusion can evidently be drawn at this stage
but the hypothesis of an excessive speed at the moment of the
derailment appears the most likely," Agence France-Presse quoted
sources close to investigation as saying.
</P>
<P>
The investigators spent the whole night at the scene of the
accident in the subway station of Notre-Dame de Lorette in
northern Paris.
</P>
<P>
They had interviewed about 30 witnesses as well as the driver
of the train, who was injured in the ear and is being treated in
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Police first suspected that something was placed on the track.
President of the Paris public transport management RATP, Jean-
Claude Bailly, said three hypotheses are the most likely --
problem with the track, mechanical failure, and fault by the
driver.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four people were injured in the accident, but none
seriously.
</P>
<P>
The first wagon of the train derailed as it was approaching the
platform of the subway station. It then overturned onto the track
of the opposition direction, stopping just one meter from another
train waiting for passengers on the platform.

<HEADLINE> Brian Grant Traded to Detroit Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Portland power forward
Brian Grant, who turned down about 200 million US dollars in deals
during this summer's NBA free-agent frenzy in an attempt to
control his own destiny, landed Wednesday in Miami.
</P>
<P>
The Heat, Cleveland and Trail Blazers pulled the trigger on a
five-player deal. Miami gets Grant, Portland gets Shawn Kemp, and
Cleveland gets Chris Gatling, Clarence Weatherspoon and a
conditional first-round pick from the Heat and Gary Grant from the
Blazers.
</P>
<P>
"There were bigger deals out there," said Brian Grant, who
signed a seven-year 86 million dollars contract in a sign-and-
trade deal, "But I didn't want to go from a first-class
organization that was a contender to an organization three or four
years away from being a contende. That's why I put myself out on a
limb to wait on a deal like Miami."
</P>
<P>
Grant who earlier was willing to take the 2.25 million salary-
cap exception to play in Miami, walked away from 40 million
dollars to become a free agent, fixed a 93 million deal with
Cleveland and turned down a 70 million offer to return to Portland.
</P>
<P>
"I did want to go back to Portland," said Grant, 28, who has
career averages of 11.8 points and 7.5 rebounds, "But as the
summer went along and I got more information, I felt I would be
used as a trading piece to acquire another big name."
</P>
<P>
His signing makes the Heat the NBA's big free-agent winner.
They've signed three new starters of Grant, Eddie Jones and
Anthony Mason from Charlotte to play alongside Alonzo Mourning and
Tim Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
Kemp, 30, has four years and 72 million dollars left on his
contract. The six-time All-star, criticized for being
overweighted and for his work ethic, will back up power forward
Rasheed Wallace and center Arvydas Sabonis.
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are making salary cap room. Weatherspoon and
Gatling are entering the last year of their deals. Gary Grant who
got a guaranteed 1.4 million dollars as part of the sign-and-trade
deal, likely will be cut.

missed a turn. Andreu avoided the car, but it hit Armstrong and
Hamilton head-on.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong and Hamilton will compete in the road race and time
trial in the Olympic Games next month.

<P>
PARIS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Stephane Diagana, French former
400 meters hurdles world champion, is struggling to recover full
fitness for the Sydney Olympic Games, which start September 15 to
October 1.
</P>
<P>
Diagana, world champion in 1997 and the European record holder
(47.37 seconds), told Thursday's edition of sports daily L'Equipe
that he is still troubled by tendinitis in his right knee but
hopes to shake it off during pre-Games training in Perth, Western
Australia.
</P>
<P>
"It is getting better slowly," Diagana said. "The last few
days, though, I haven't trained a lot but I've been undergoing
physical therapy."
</P>
<P>
Diagana has only run one race this season and is anxious to
avoid missing a second straight Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old finished fourth in the 1992 Barcelona Games
but missed Atlanta with a stress fracture in a foot.

<P>
PRAGUE, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Despite of his injury, Czech Jan
Zelezny is aiming for a javelin golden treble at the Sydney
Olympics next month.
</P>
<P>
World record-holder Zelezny, who took gold in Atlanta and
Barcelona, told reporters on Thursday before leaving for Brisbane
that he suffered a nagging rib injury.
</P>
<P>
"At the last (examination), doctors could not believe I am
throwing 90 meters while I could successully apply for a pension
as an invalid," said the 34-year-old who will compete in Sydney
even if the pain does not go away.
</P>
<P>
Zelezny has won the world championship twice and lost out on
gold in his first Olympic Games in Seoul by just 16 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no clear-cut favourite in the event, which
starts on September 23, and his main rival will be his own
physical condition.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Individual Tax Revenue Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Local Taxes Bureau has
levied 2.807 billion yuan of individual taxes during the first six
months of this year, up 23.8 percent compared with the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The taxes mainly came from industries, commercial and financial
sectors, and the real estate trading sector. Most of the
individual taxes, or 92 percent, were levied from individuals.
</P>
<P>
Taxes levied on non-salary items, such as interest, stock
dividend, and bonus, increased sharply by 137 percent to 73.06
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that the sound performance of Beijing's
economy and growing income of Beijing residents contributed to the
rise of taxes.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has witnessed the most rapid growth of GDP over the
past four years. Statistics showed that the Chinese capital has
realized 104.41 billion yuan in GDP during the Jan-June period
this year, 3.8 percentage points higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly salary of Beijing employees was 1,215 yuan,
18.8 percent more than the same 1999 period.
</P>
<P>
The consuming market has been vigorous as the consumer sales
volume hit 69.02 billion yuan with a net increase of 7.47 billion
yuan compared with the same 1999 period.
</P>
<P>
The real estate was no longer sluggish. Beijing has sold 1.62
million square meters of housing during the first five months of
this year. The sales volume which reached 6.48 billion yuan
directly made employees of real estate rank the fourth on the list
of the most paid employees in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Beijing Local Taxes Bureau said that all the
factors have contributed to the growth of individual taxes.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Museum of
Coastal Defense opened to the public here Thursday, marking a new
era of Hong Kong's museum services.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Secretary for Home Affairs
Lam Woon-kwong said the museum was an important cultural
institution of a community and the development of museum services
could mirror the quality of the cultural life of that community.
</P>
<P>
The Museum is developed from the old fort which was built in
1887 to defend the eastern approaches to the Victoria harbor. As
the fort was the most sophisticated coastal fortifications at that
time, it became an important battlefield when Japan invaded Hong
Kong in 1941.
</P>
<P>
The new museum is made up of three main areas, namely the
reception area, the redoubt and the historical trail.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Officer Resigns Over Operation Mishap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- One of Israel Defense Forces'
top officers resigned Thursday in the wake of the botched operation
last Saturday in which three Israeli solders were killed by their
comrades.
</P>
<P>
Shlomo Oren, the commander of Judea and Samaria (the traditional
Jewish appellation of the West Bank) Brigade, told Israel Radio
that he decided to step down to assume the responsibility for the
operation mishap. However, it is still unclear whether his
resignation had been accepted.
</P>
<P>
Three soldiers of the elite Duvdevan unit, or special troops in
the West Bank, were killed during an operation Saturday night to
catch a top Hamas terrorist while their comrades mistakenly
identified them as terrorists and shot them down.
</P>
<P>
The hunted Hamas man, Mahmud Abu-Hanud, managed to flee from the
scene with wounds and surrendered himself later to the Palestinian
forces in Nablus, an Arab city 60 kilometers north of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Oren's resignation comes only hours before IDF Chief of General
Staff Shaul Mofaz's scheduled receival of interim military
investigations into the incident. Mofaz will later present the
investigation outcome to Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
According to the investigation report leaked to Israel's Channel
Two, the inquiry found that a misunderstanding between a junior
officer and the soldiers who were killed was the apparent cause of
the tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Youth Wounded by Israeli Gunfire at Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers shot and wounded
a Lebanese youth at the border flashpoint of Fatma Gate Thursday
afternoon, security source said.
</P>
<P>
Aly Fakhreddine, 20, was shot in the foot after hurling stones
at an Israeli army outpost across the barbed wire fence separating
Israel and Lebanon. He has been sent to near hospital.
</P>
<P>
The defunct border crossing of Fatma Gate become a trouble spot
since Israel ended its 22-year occupation of south Lebanon in May
and pulled its troops back behind the frontier.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people flock to the old crossing every day. Some
hurl rocks or bottles and shout insults at the Israeli soldiers,
who occasionally fire back. Several civilians have been wounded.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, the army issued a statement saying that after a
warning, soldiers had shot at the legs of civilians, wounding two
people. The army "stressed it will react to every attempt to attack
the routine and well-being of northern Israeli residents," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has complained to the United Nations about the stone-
throwing incidents. The world body, which has troops stationed at
various positions along the border but not at Fatma Gate, has asked
the Lebanese authorities to seal off the area.
</P>
<P>
Fatma Gate is still controlled by the Hezbollah, or Party of
God, which spearheaded the guerrilla war against Israeli
occupation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Diplomat Labels Washington's Warning as Unwise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Ambassador to Beirut
John Kelly said that his country's warning to Americans of the
risks traveling to and in Lebanon was both "ill-timed and unwise,"
An Nahar newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"I feel quite safe in Lebanon," Kelly told reporters after a
visit to President Emile Lahoud at the presidential palace
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I have noticed, since my visit last year, a positive change in
Lebanon's status abroad. There was the Israeli withdrawal from the
south followed by the visits of foreign dignitaries such as
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah
(Ibn Abdul-Aziz)," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that it is quite clear that Lebanon has regained its
former regional and international prominence after the difficult
years of the civil war that ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his country's warning, he replied that "I was
surprised to hear about it when I arrived at Beirut Airport".
</P>
<P>
He also described the first round of general elections as "fair
and square and the Lebanese can be proud of them".
</P>
<P>
Kelly, who is also a former assistant Secretary of State, was
Ambassador to Lebanon from August 1986 to September 1988.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department warned Americans on Monday of risks
while traveling to and in Lebanon and urged U.S. citizens in Beirut
to take special security precautions. The department said in a
statement that in case of such hazards U.S. officials may be unable
to help, saying that the situation is still unstable in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Salim Hoss Tuesday
rejected the saying and asked U.S. government to withdraw the
warning.

<HEADLINE> Manila Says American's Abduction Not to Affect Other Hostages' Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that the kidnapping of American Jeffrey Schilling by the
Abu Sayyaf will not affect the negotiations involving the release
of the remaining six European and one Filipino hostages.
</P>
<P>
According to Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo
Puno, the assurance was given by Abu Sayyaf leader Ghalib Andang,
alias Commander Robot, to chief government negotiator Secretary
Robert Aventajado in their latest talks involving the release of
the Jolo hostages.
</P>
<P>
Puno said Aventajado was also informed by Commander Robot that
his group was in no way involved in the kidnapping of the American
in Zamboanga City on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Robot assured him (Aventajado) that the American's kidnapping
will not pose an obstacle to the release of the balance of the
hostages being held in Jolo, in accordance with the so-called
global agreement reached to secure their freedom," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
Washington has demanded Schilling's unconditional release and
stressed that the United States does not deal with terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy belied the Abu Sayyaf's claims that Schilling
was a spy from the Central Intelligence Agency, pointing out that
records show that the 24-year old American was an ordinary
civilian traveling as a tourist.
</P>
<P>
Puno said that according to Aventajado, his office has received
reports that Schilling was married to Ivy Osani, a widow of a
former Abu Sayyaf member, who is a nephew of the group's slain
leader Abdujarak Janjalani.
</P>
<P>
Schilling's wife, according to reports culled by authorities
from the field, is a cousin of Abu Sayyaf leader Abu Sabaya.
</P>
<P>
"Authorities are also verifying reports that Schilling had been
staying in Zamboanga for six months as well as the reasons for his
being there during that period. There were also reports that
Schilling himself had been seeking out the Abu Sayyaf," Puno added.
</P>
<P>
Puno said Aventajado has indicated that he would probably not
get involved this time in the negotiations for Schilling's release.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado, along with former Libyan envoy Rajab Azzarouq,
negotiated the safe release of several Western hostages and
Malaysian nationals kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf from Sipadan
island, Malaysia almost five months ago.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Resolves to Strengthen Control of Small Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have ended a three-day
workshop on the control of small arms in the sub-region, pledging
to curb the menace caused by an estimated eight million of these
arms available in the west African states, local media reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Secretary of ECOWAS Lansana Kouyate was quoted as
saying on Wednesday in Nigerian capital Abuja that security forces
of the 16-member organization have the responsibility of
monitoring the flow of arms within and outside national borders
with a view to ensuring legitimate utilization of these arms.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate said the curriculum, adopted by the workshop for the
training of security personnel on the control of small arms, would
cover general information on the diffusion of small arms, modern
techniques for the maintenance of law and order and methods of
collecting these arms and dealing with drug traffickers in the sub-
region.
</P>
<P>
The curriculum would also deal with cross border crime,
effective ways of maintaining national weapons arsenals and the
development of an information network and strategy for controlling
the menace, said Kouyate.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the workshop was a priority element of
the sub-region's plan of action for the implementation of the
ECOWAS moratorium on light weapons.
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was declared by the regional leaders for an
initial period of three years in 1998 and later followed with a
plan of action by the foreign affairs ministers at their meeting
in Bamako, capital of Mali last March and approved by the 22nd
ECOWAS summit in Lome, capital of Togo last December.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the military, police, customs and
gendarmerie of the ECOWAS member states attended the workshop.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Finds Objects Belonging to Viking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian archeologists have
discovered objects belonging to a Viking trader dating back to the
10th century in the flood-lands of the Berezina River in Borisovo
region, the Interfax news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The finding includes a set of weights for weighing silver, 183
intact coins and 77 fragments of high-quality silver coins, a
silver bracelet and a sword with a silver-encrusted hilt, Interfax
said, citing senior researcher Oleg Iov.
</P>
<P>
Iov works at the Medieval Archeology Department of the History
Institute of the Belarussian Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The articles were not buried, but "were most likely lost" by a
Viking, Iov said.
</P>
<P>
Belarussian archeologists are inclined to believe that the
items sank as a result of the death of a medieval trader, who
could have fallen victim to an attack or gone overboard when he
was returning from a successful trade, Iov said.
</P>
<P>
The objects make it possible to determine the Viking's social
status, Iov said. In the Middle Ages, silver coins, weights for
weighing silver and a sword were a standard set belonging to a
trader, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Viking's things confirm the scientific hypothesis that the
way from the Varangians (Russian Vikings) to the Greeks lay not
only along the Dnieper, but along all Belarussian rivers," Iov
said.
</P>
<P>
Dnieper is a river rising in west-central Russia near Smolensk
and flowing about 2,285 kilometers southward through Belarus and
Ukraine to the Black Sea. It has been a major commercial waterway
since the ninth century.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- France will sell Singapore sea-to-
sea missiles to equip the frigates it will sell to the Asian
country, La Tribune reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The French company Aerospatiale Matra Missiles will sell these
missiles as part of a package of agreements between Singapore and
French armament groups, the newspaper quoted its sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The missile contract followed an announcement in March by the
Direction des Chantiers Navals that it would sell six Lafayette
frigates to Singapore, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Aerospatiale Matra Missiles has so far refused to confirm
whether the country it has signed the contract with is Singapore
or not.
</P>
<P>
The news was first reported Wednesday by an Israeli newspaper,
the Haaretz. The paper said that Aerospatiale Matra Missiles won a
competition with two Israeli armaments groups in a bid to sell 700
million U.S. dollars worth of sea-to-sea missiles to a "secret
Asian country."
</P>
<P>
The French company, which is affiliated to the European
Aeronautics, Defense and Space group, confirmed that it has won
the contract but refused to reveal the name of the client country.

<HEADLINE> Forerunners of Developing Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 31 (XINHUA) -- Wang Chuande, 73, still loves
talking about ploughing his farmland and growing crops at his home
in Hotan, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
where he and more than 1,800 People's Liberation Army (PLA)
soldiers settled down to develop the Taklimakan, the biggest
desert in China, over five decades ago.
</P>
<P>
What makes him feel more happier is that he and 40 of his
former comrades-in-arms have moved into new houses which Wang
found out to be the best in the region.
</P>
<P>
Local government and the No. 47 farm where they used to work
invested one million yuan (about 120,000 U.S. dollars) to build
the new houses for them.
</P>
<P>
A group of more than 1,800 PLA soldiers traversed the
Taklimakan Desert on foot and settled down at Hotan County in
December 1949. They put down their guns and took up hoes to turn
some 666 hectares of desert into fertile farmland.
</P>
<P>
Many of the farms built by them have become major grain and
cotton production bases of China.
</P>
<P>
Even now, Wang and his former comrades-in-arms love to grow
vegetables in their courtyards, and they often recall the days
when they first set foot on the barren land in most western part
of China.
</P>
<P>
They usually say only those who have trekked through the
Taklimakan Desert can understand the saying "A journey of no
return". They are described as the first group of heroes who have
passed through the "sea of death" on foot.
</P>
<P>
They are more concerned about what happens at the No. 47 farm
today, and they watch TV programs to learn more new things.
</P>
<P>
These forerunners in developing western China have a doctor who
takes care of their health day and night. Shu Wanfu is assigned to
buy rice, flour and liquefied gas for the elderly people and take
them to scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wenyi, 68, plans to visit Beijing some day. "I want to see
Tian'anmen Square, and to see Chairman Mao," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Today, most of the people who are working there are the
children of these veteran developers of western China.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Dayong is one of them. Zhao is now the head of the No. 47
farm which employs more than 4,000 workers. "Our fathers have
turned desert into fertile farmland, we will make it much better,"
Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao's father Zhao Chengzhang, 82, loves to hear his son
talking about the on-going development of western China. He
expects the western China will become much better in future.

GUANGZHOU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Reconstruction on China's
longest Dayaoshan tunnel on the Beijing-Guangzhou railway running
north to south across the country, was completed today after 19
months' hard work.
</P>
<P>
The 14.26-km-long tunnel was built in 1988 in Shaoguan City of
Guangdong Province, south China. However, the complex geological
structure has forced trains to run at a limited speed to ensure
safety.
</P>
<P>
Engineers in charge of the project said that since early 1999,
the local railway department has invested more than 40 million
yuan in upgrading tunnel facilities and the double-track railway
in this section.
</P>
<P>
After using new rail materials and installing advanced alarm
system, trains now travel at a speed of 80 kilometers per hour,
compared with 60 kilometers in the past.

SHENYANG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Shenyang Smeltery, which
announced bankruptcy early this month for causing heavy industrial
pollution, made an open invitation for bids today for the
regrouping of public assets to get cash for its laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Tang Jiyue, an official in charge of the bankruptcy settlement,
said they will persist in a multi-lateral investment policy and
regroup public assets in a flexible way.
</P>
<P>
"We will sell the copper and lead workshops, which were heavy

required standard on pollution control after treatment," he said.
"The new enterprise will build the modern enterprise system and
prevent it from causing pollution again."
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Shuts Down 100 Channels of Wireless Paging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Information
Industry (MII) announced here today that it has shut down over 100
channels of wireless paging services due to interruption of
aviation and navigation communications.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Information Industry Zhang Chunjiang told a
national televised conference in Beijing today that the ministry
and relevant authorities have asked all paging stations in the
country to register again since July last year.
</P>
<P>
At present China has 389 registered channels and 51,827 base
stations of paging services. They are operated by 1,479 owners
around the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China has already become the largest user of
wireless paging in the world. The rapid growth of paging services
has led to some problems, such as interruption of aviation and
navigation communications. In some of the cases, the interruption
almost caused serious accidents.
</P>
<P>
The closing of over 100 of the interrupting paging channels has
greatly reduced the occurrence of interference. However, Zhang
said that the problem has yet to be totally resolved because there
are still many potential risks.
</P>
<P>
He said that through the new round of registration of paging
stations, the authorities will develop a complete data bank about
the channels used by paging services in the country. With the help
of a wireless electronic monitoring system, the authorities will
detect unregistered paging services and sources of interrupting
signals.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Lions Club International (
LCI) announced here today it plans to hold its 2000 "World Sight
Day" on October 12 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Tam Wing Kun, a board appointee of the Lions Club International
and chairman of "SightFirst China Action", made the announcement
at a ceremony to see off a medical team to treat cataract patients
in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The "World Sight Day" programs include check-ups on local
schoolchildren in eight urban districts of the national capital
and a mid-term evaluation meeting on the implementation of "
SightFirst China Action" to be held at the Great Hall of the
People in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"SightFirst China Action" is part of the LCI's worldwide
program of "SightFirst" and a total of 146 million US dollars has
been raised for the program, according to Tam.
</P>
<P>
The other two co-sponsors of "SightFirst China Action" are the
China Disabled Persons Federation (CDPF) and the Ministry of
Health.
</P>
<P>
Under the five-year Chinese program, which was initiated in
1997, 1.5 million cataract Chinese will recover their sight

</P>
<P>
Official figures show that China has nine million blind people,
of them four million have lost their sight for cataracts.
Meanwhile, there are 400,000 new cataract patients in China every
year. Tam said he hopes the program will help 500,000 Chinese
cataract patients regain their sight a year.
</P>
<P>
So far, 1.2 million Chinese blind people have regained their
sight thanks to the program.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong compatriots including many aged people have donated a
lot of money, according to Tam.
</P>
<P>
Deng Pufang, chairman of the CDPF, spoke highly of the
charitable activities by the LCI and domestic and overseas people.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lethal Injection Introduced As Form of Execution in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A senior official from the
Supreme People's Court disclosed today that China will adopt
lethal injections in execution of death sentence across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Executing criminals by shooting will also continue, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Shen Deyong, a vice-president of the Supreme People's Court,
made the remark in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said the Supreme People's Court has entrusted the Chinese
Academy of Medical Sciences to make a research on the medicine for
execution, and the research is close to an end.
</P>
<P>
Trials have been conducted by the people's courts in such
cities as Kunming, Wuhan, Chengdu, Hangzhou and Luoyang, according
to the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Supreme People's Court has outlined a draft on
regulations concerning several key issues related with adopting
injection method in executions, which has been submitted to the
Adjudging Committee of the Supreme People's Court for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Currently, shooting method has been widely used across China in
executions.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, China's top legislature, revised and further perfected
the Criminal Procedural Law, which was formulated in 1979, in
which lethal injections were included into China's legal clauses
for the first time and became effective on January 1st 1997.
</P>
<P>
On March 28 of 1998, China's first trial of execution by
injection was conducted in Kunming, capital city of southwest
China's Yunnan Province.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dissatisfied Reactions to Failure of Soeharto Trial (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
... a spectator screamed outside the court room.
</P>
<P>
But Soeharto failed to appear. The people's hope for the
supremacy of law, which had been high over past two years, seemed
to be dashed again.
</P>
<P>
Now they would have to wait for another month or even longer to
see the completion of Soeharto's trial.
</P>
<P>
Observers here predicted that the trial process will take a
long time before a verdict could be reached. If the trial in the
end fails to meet the people's demand, it would not be beneficial
for the country.
</P>
<P>
The trial of Soeharto will be the first test case for the
country in upholding the supremacy of law. If it is successful it
will clear the way for speeding up the reform process, but if it
fails it will trigger fresh social turbulence in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, economically, the trial has affected the country's
currency and share prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX).
</P>
<P>
The rupiah and the JSX composite index have been under pressure
over the past three days ahead of the opening of Soeharto's trial.
Dealers said widespread worries over possible unrest to be caused
by Soeharto's supporters have triggered panic among investors and
market.
</P>
<P>
But, in fact, on the opening day of the Soeharto trial, the
rupiah edged up and traded at 8,295/8,315 per U.S. dollar on
Thursday morning, compared with 8,370/8,400 on the previous day.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dissatisfied Reactions to Failure of Soeharto Trial (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Dissatisfaction arose here
following the absence of Indonesia's former President Soeharto on
Thursday from the court for the trial of a corruption case.
</P>
<P>
The 79-year-old man was reportedly still not in a good shape
after a series of stroke attacks. His communication skills as well
as his nervous system and memory were obstructed, according to a
medical team report read out by Soeharto's lawyers in the opening
of Soeharto's trial.
</P>
<P>
The court room, located at the Agriculture Ministry building in
South Jakarta district, early in the morning had been packed by
hundreds of journalists, both from foreign and local media as well
as hundreds of attendants, who were interested in getting a look
at the former ruler in the court room.
</P>
<P>
However, they felt very disappointed when Soeharto, who ruled
the country with an iron hand for over three decades before
stepping down in May 1998, failed to appear before the court for
medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Speaker of the Indonesian Parliament A. M. Fatwa said, "
I am sure that the public also felt disappointed due to the
absence of Soeharto."
</P>
<P>
Such disappointments were understandable perhaps, as the reform
movements in the country have strongly demanded the trial of the
ailing former ruler.
</P>
<P>
And the absence of Soeharto from Thursday's hearing also seemed
to be hard to accept by students in the country. They even
threatened to stage what they called a "people trial" of Soeharto
and demand that he take responsibility for the many mistakes in
his three decades of rule.
</P>
<P>
It seems that most of the "reform parties" here refused to
accept the medical reasons issued by Soeharto's medical team.
</P>
<P>
"We don't care about the health condition of Soeharto. We just
want him to be tried and jailed," a protester screamed when
joining a rally near the Agriculture Ministry building, where the
hearing was taking place.
</P>
<P>
The opening day of Soeharto's trial had been originally
scheduled to hear the reading of charges by prosecuting attorneys,
but the agenda was canceled as the defendant did not show up
before the court.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, a former five-star general known as "the smiling
general," faced serious health troubles, in particular in terms of
communication skills as he could not speak very well due to a
series of strokes after stepping down from the presidential office.
According to a doctor observing Soeharto's health, the former
strong man's brain has also suffered damage, but he is "physically
healthy."
</P>
<P>
The doctors also said Soeharto also has problems with his
kidneys.
</P>
<P>
The South Jakarta District Court earlier had already received
at least two boxes and a suitcase filled with documents confirming
Soeharto's misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
The former president has been charged by state prosecutors with
allegedly misusing some 1.4 trillion rupiah (155 million U.S.
dollars)and 416 million U.S. dollars of state funds that had gone
to his seven tax-free charity foundations.
</P>
<P>
He is principally charged with violating article 1 (a) of
Corruption Law No. 3/1973 and he is also subject to a subsidiary
charge under article 1 (b) of the same law with abuse of power,
which causes losses to the state.
</P>
<P>
Based on the country's criminal code, Soeharto, if convicted,
faces a maximum life sentence and a minimum of 20 years in jail
plus a maximum fine of 30 million rupiah.
</P>
<P>
If this happened, Soeharto would be the first former leader in
the country who probably would spend the rest of his life in jail.
But it seems that such a "historical story" will not come true as
President Abdurrahman Wahid has promised to pardon him.
</P>
<P>
Most people here want a fair and open trial process, free from
any government intervention.
</P>
<P>
"Soeharto's trial should be carried out independently," a
spectator screamed outside the court room.

MOSCOW, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday condemned
Estonia's decision to expel two Russian diplomats for what Tallinn
called activities incompatible with their status, saying it would
evict two Estonian diplomats in response.
</P>
<P>
"Estonia has blamed two Russian diplomats for 'activity not
befitting their status' and proposed that they leave the country
within 48 hours," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We bluntly reject the accusations addressed toward the Russian
diplomats as unfounded," the statement said. "It is a deliberate
provocation that seriously damages Russian-Estonian relations.
</P>
<P>
"In response, Russia will expel two Estonian diplomats whose
activity is not befitting their diplomatic status within 48 hours.
The Estonian ambassador was summoned to the Russian Foreign
Ministry and informed of this today."
</P>
<P>
The identities of the diplomats involved have not been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Moscow said it regretted that "the recent positive dynamics of
bilateral relations is being sacrificed to the ambitions of the
Estonian secret services," the statement said. "Estonia bears the
full responsibility for this."

MACAO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Postal Services of China's
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) government will on
Friday issue a set of new stamps featuring the life of tricycle
drivers.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Ways of Life -- Tricycle Drivers," the set has six
stamps, each of which has a face value of 2 patacas (about 25 U.S.
cents), Lau Wai Meng, an official with the Postal Services, said
at a press conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 750,000 sets of the stamps will be issued. Other
postal products include a souvenir sheet, the first-day cover and
an introduction paper.
</P>
<P>
Tricycles used to be the principal means of transport in Macao
from the 1950s to the 1970s, when there were hundreds of tricycles
in an area of about 10 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1970s, however, competition from taxis and buses has
led to the decline of tricycle service. At present, there are only
about 70 tricycles in Macao and the patrons are mainly tourists.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Accuses India of Escalating LoC Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday accused
India of escalating tension on the Line of Control (LoC), which
divides the two neighbors in the disputed Kashmir region and urged
New Delhi to show restraint and defuse tension.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman Riaz Mohammad Khan told a
press briefing here that Pakistan has lodged strong protest
against escalation of tension along the LoC, which has resulted in
killing of innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
Scores of people were also injured because of a number of
incidents of shelling from the Indian side, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Pakistan has always exercised restraint on
the LoC. "There have been violations and escalation on the part of
India."
</P>
<P>
During the past weeks, there were frequent reports about
shelling and military conflicts on the LoC between Pakistan and
India.
</P>
<P>
Khan said Pakistan believes that tension should be de-escalated
along the LoC and India should show restraint and sense of
responsibility to the world community's concern."It is not only
the responsibility of Pakistan but also of India to reduce tension.
"
</P>
<P>
Asked about the refusal of India to receive the dead body of an
Indian soldier after it was alleged that the body was mutilated,
Khan said, "Absolutely no question of any mutilation arises. These
are tendentious allegations. We reject them. It is the obligation
of the Indian side to receive the body."
</P>
<P>
He said Indian soldiers crossed the LoC and attacked a
Pakistani post on the night between August 23 and 24. "Pakistani
soldiers retaliated and Indian soldiers were killed and they left
a large quantity of ammunition and equipment."

BRUSSELS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of British travelers
left stranded in France by French fishermen's protests are still
trying to cross the Dover Channel Thursday at Ostend and Zeebrugge,
port cities of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
They are joined by hundreds of trucks queuing to get into
ferries at Zeebrugge. At the same time, Sea France shipping
company has diverted its vessels via Ostend. P&AMP;O Stena Line,
another shipping firm, is adding extra ships to the Zeebrugge-
Dover link.
</P>
<P>
French fishermen are blockading most of France's major ports in
protest against high oil prices. They want supportive measures
from the government. Their actions caused problems at ferry ports,
including Calais, this week. According to the BBC, truck drivers
and farmers are also threatening to take similar actions.
</P>
<P>
In Belgium, the prices of diesel and household fuel are rising
sharply again, for the fifth time in two weeks. This is attributed
to limited supplies, the expensive dollar and speculations on oil
markets.
</P>
<P>
Now the European Union is worried about the high oil prices
throughout its member states. Saudi Arabia has said it is prepared
to pump up more oil to curb the prices on the international

BRUSSELS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU), still

has made its fear clear to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), EU sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
EU Energy Commissioner Loyola de Palacio expressed the EU's

North Sea oil benchmark Brent price has reached a new record of
31 U.S. dollars per barrel, way above the 25-dollar per barrel

The EU Commissioner would like to see the price come down below
28 dollars per barrel. She also said that current price levels
penalize both producers and consumers.

<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share Index shed
6.95 points, or 5.50 percent, on a daily basis to close at 119.41
points on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Turnover extended to 196.68 million HK dollars, which was 91.94
million HK dollars, or 86.98 percent, more than that of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and
securities company, the market continued Wednesday's downward
trend and failed to revive from its tumble due to lack of investor
's bullish sentiment. At the same time, the turnover was broadly
extended for heavy selling pressure.
</P>
<P>
Declining shares overwhelmingly beat advancing issues by 53 to
two, with one unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Livzon Pharm climbed up 0.84 percent to 2.39 HK dollars, while
Weifu Fuel added 0.31 percent to 3.19 HK dollars.

<P>
Zhong Lu fell 9.14 percent to 3.38 HK dollars, and Chiwan Wharf
declined 9.06 percent to 2.61 HK dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai B-share Index
plunged 4.64 points, or 6.55 percent, the largest tumble in a week,
to a nearly one-month trough of 66.18 points on Thursday, unable
to hold above the 70-point mark in the wake of Wednesday's brief
correction.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was 35.76 million U.S. dollars, an increase of 101.46
percent from Wednesday's total.
</P>
<P>
According to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and
securities advisory company, the market spent the whole session in
negative territory and gradually deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
With earnings season for the six months ended June 2000 due out
today, investors did not have much to rely on as sort of momentum
because one out of every ten Chinese companies had reported half-
year losses.
</P>
<P>
Only one issue rose, while 53 fell, with three unchanged.
</P>
<P>
China 1st Pencil lost 1.45 percent to 0.280 U.S. dollars.
Dajiang Group lost 9.93 percent to 0.272 U.S. dollars, while
Phoenix fell 9.88 percent to 0.310 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts note that the market can barely hang on to
positive territory with general weakness in broad areas. It has
been the usual concern about bad performing fundamentals that are
dragging B shares lower.

BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- China's T-bond market ended
mixed as the weak domestic stocks represented a boost for bonds
while several new stock subscriptions and placements tightened the
money supply. Transaction value expanded by 196 million yuan to 1.
85 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Of the six current treasuries on the market, two slipped by 0.

two stayed unchanged, according to Homeway, China's leading on-

Bond 009908 shed 0.14 percent to close at 102.99 yuan, driving
the yield up 0.03 percentage points to 3.32 percent. Meanwhile,
the turnover on the bond swelled to 663 million yuan, versus the
313 million yuan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009704 tumbled another 0.08 percent below its ten-day
average price to 145.61 yuan, so the bond will probably dip
further under the pressure from the ten-day average. Its yield
picked up 0.02 percentage points to 3.84 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009905 closed the session up 0.02 percent and the mew
floating-rate 010004, whose coupon rate is 2.87 percent this year,
paced up 0.04 percent to 104.85 yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's repo market saw a tame boom, fueled by the stock
subscriptions and placements. Trade volume of three-day, seven-day,
14-day and 28-day repurchasing transactions totaled 5.77 billion
yuan, up 2.45 folds from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the repurchasing interest rates rallied. The interest

BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Composite Index
plunged 17.72 points, or 2.79 percent, to 617.42 points on
Thursday, while the sub-index ended at 4,881.05 points, down 2.12
percent from its previous close.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was 14.53 billion yuan (1.75 billion US dollars),
which was 12.20 percent more than Wednesday's total.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Shenzhen Composite Index, seeing the largest one-
day tumble since March 16th, nose-dived to hit its lowest level in
one month and a week, according to Homeway, China's leading on-
line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
An extreme lack of investor confidence, hurt by gloomy
corporate profit outlook, was the major reason triggering an all-
around sell-off. Market players could hardly see any positive
signs from the fact that one in ten Chinese listed companies
reported losses for the first six months ended June 2000 to end
the half-year earnings season today.
</P>
<P>
Losers overwhelmingly beat gainers by 523 to 35, with 12
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Chenzhen Universe Industrial Stock Co., Ltd. bucked the main
trend, advancing 9.97 percent to 17.31 yuan as the market
bellwether.
</P>
<P>
Jiujiang Chemical Fiber Co., Ltd., the biggest loser, dropped 7.
03 percent to 15.73 yuan.
</P>

Analysts note that the market is expected to be on the volatile
side, as direction seems vague ahead amid vulnerable sentiment.
Investors will be watching the fundamentals that are critical in

However, over 170,000 laid-off workers that were registered in
the re-employment service centers did not receive basic living aid
due to a number of reasons.

</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Ministry officials believe Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat will not unilaterally
declare a Palestinian state on September 13, a ministry official
said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Palestinians are likely to delay the date

Liberation Organization (PLO) declaration of independence in the
West Bank, Gaza, and east Jerusalem, issued in Algiers in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- An upgrade of U.S.-Israeli strategic and security relations
is expected to be declared next Wednesday, following a meeting

Minister Ehud Barak in New York.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the president will announce that he is making a
special aid package available to strengthen the Israel Defense
Forces (IDF).
</P>
<P>
The condition for the upgrade in relations will be an agreement
signed by the two countries to tighten U.S. supervision over
Israeli arms sales.
</P>

Ma'ariv:

-- A misunderstanding between an Israeli junior officer and
soldiers was the apparent cause of the botched operation in which

<P>
But night negotiations to enable the opening of the school year

HONG KONG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong official Cheung Man-
yee urged Japanese companies to pay attention to Hong Kong's
springboard role in helping international companies to establish a
foothold in China, according to a report by the Hong Kong
Government Information Services Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Already the Chinese mainland's trade with Hong Kong represents
about 40 percent of our total external trade. We handle some 40
percent of China's re-exports," said Cheung, Hong Kong's principal
economic and trade representative in Tokyo, during her four-day
visit to Japan's Kyushu region, which ended Thursday.
</P>

"Hong Kong companies employ some 5 million people in wholly or
partly owned ventures in neighboring Guangdong Province and there
are more than 1,800 mainland companies operating in Hong Kong,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
She told the Japanese business circle that with China's entry
to the World Trade Organization, there are forecasts that within
six years China's foreign trade and foreign investment would
double and its GDP is estimated to be 13 percent higher by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"These figures point to enormous opportunities for Hong Kong
and the entire trading world," she said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt Pushes for Long-Term Thai-Cambodian Cooperation Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Cambodia have
agreed to strengthen long-term bilateral cooperation through an
economic cooperation action plan, the Thai News Agency (TNA)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has employed the Research and Development
Institute of Kasetsart University and a group of foreign experts
to conduct a comprehensive study to be used for the drafting of
the planned long-term Thai-Cambodian Economic Cooperation Action
Plan, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Council of the Economic Ministers approved a 20 million
baht (500,000 U.S. dollars) budget for the purpose at its meeting
this week, it stated.
</P>
<P>
The move coincides with the occasion of the 50th anniversary of
diplomatic relations between the two neighboring countries this
year.
</P>
<P>
The idea to draft the 10-year Thai-Cambodian Economic
Cooperation Action Plan was an initiative of the Office of the
National Economic and Social Development Board and related
agencies, aiming to seek a systematic framework for the
development of Thai-Cambodian relations in the fields of trade,
investment, industry and tourism in the long run, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The move has been endorsed by the Council for the Development
of Cambodia and the Cambodian Commerce Ministry, which have also
invited Thai delegates to discuss the issue officially, it said.
</P>
<P>
The action plan is expected to provide a sector-by-sector
strategic and operational guideline crucial to the development of
economic cooperation between the two countries in short, medium
and long terms, it added.
</P>
<P>
The study of the drafting of the plan was scheduled to be
completed by next year and the cooperation guided by the action
plan, to be completed over the next years, would be implemented
through the Joint Commission on the Thai-Cambodian Cooperation, it
noted.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Trial Adjourned to Mid-September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Owing to the absence of the
defendant in the court, the South Jakarta District Court finally
had to adjourn on Thursday the trial process against former
Indonesian President Soeharto to September 14.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was absent from Thursday morning's hearing on his
corruption case, according to a medical team report which was read
out by Soeharto's lawyers in the court room, due to his bad health
condition.
</P>
<P>
Chief Judge Lalu Mariyun said the trial will be resumed again
at 10:00 a.m. (local time) on September 14, at the Ministry of
Agriculture building to hear reports from Soeharto's medical team
on the condition of the former ruler.
</P>
<P>
The first trial of Soeharto was opened on Thursday morning at
about 10:00 a.m. (local time) at the Ministry of Agriculture
building. The trial only lasted around one hour, with 10 minutes
of suspension.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's hearing was dominated by reports on the 79-year-old
man's health condition delivered by his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued by Soeharto's doctor team, said the former
president who ran the country with an iron hand for more than
three decades was still not in a good shape to appear before the
court for questioning.
</P>
<P>
"Soeharto's nervous system is still obstructed due to a series
of stroke attacks," the medical report read out by Mohamad Assegaf,
one of Soeharto's lawyers, said.
</P>
<P>
It also said Soeharto has a big problem in his communication
skills as well as his memory system.
</P>
<P>
"And his kidney also has been suffering from a mild disturbance,
" the report said, adding that the blood pressure of the former
president has also risen.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the medical report, chief prosecuting attorney
Muchtar Arifin then asked the presiding judge to set up an
independent doctor team to examine the former president's health
condition and then release what he said will be "a second opinion
on the health condition of Soeharto."
</P>
<P>
"The setting up of the independent doctor team is intended to
get an independent opinion on the health condition of the
defendant. It will be fair if such a thing is considered (to be
realized)," Arifin said.
</P>
<P>
But chief judge Mariyun has not yet decided whether the court
will meet the prosecuting attorney's demand for the establishment
of the independent medical team.
</P>
<P>
Generally, the first day of Soeharto's hearing ran smoothly
with no clashes reported.
</P>
<P>
Some student groups staged a rally supporting the trial process
against "the smiling general" who is alleged to have misused some
500 million U.S. dollars of public funds in the seven tax-free
foundations he chaired when he was in power.

CANBERRA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Most Australians have got too
lazy to do enough exercise to stay healthy, according to a report
issued here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, published by the Australian Institute of Health and
Welfare, showed that 88 percent of Australians aged between 18 and
75 believed they could be healthier by being more active.

The study found that the time spent by Australians in vigorous
activity had dropped from an average of 91 minutes per person each
week in 1997 to 65 minutes in 1999 and the proportion of
physically inactive people increased from 13 percent to 15 percent
in the same period.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Elections Commission to Talk With Party Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Elections Commission
will hold several rounds of talks with political party leaders on
ways and manners to conduct a free and fair general election on
October 10, a senior official of the election secretariat said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed official said Commissioner of Elections Dayananda
Dissanayake will discuss with political parties the possibility of
inviting foreign observers to monitor the upcoming 11th
parliamentary elections and a final decision regarding this matter
will be taken soon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier a local media report said two election monitoring
bodies are seeking an undetermined number of international
observers and up to 10,000 local volunteers to monitor the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Movement for Free and Fair Elections and People's Alliance
for Free and Fair Elections were involved in the election
monitoring process during last December's presidential elections
which President Chandrika Kumaratunga won for another six-year
term of office.
</P>
<P>
The official said Dissanayake had already issued instructions
to law enforcement authorities requiring them to prevent unruly
incidents and impersonation as well as to maintain law and order
during the elections.
</P>
<P>
Dissanayake briefed senior polling officers in a meeting on the
procedures to be adopted to prevent vote riggings and other poll
malpractice.
</P>
<P>
The election secretariat has also made arrangements to engage
presiding officers and other election officers in polling booths
to be set up in their residential areas for their convenience.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's 45 recognized political parties and several
independent groups have indicated that they will contest the
general elections. There are altogether 22 electoral districts
islandwide.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that more than 20 political parties have already
confirmed their desire to contest the elections but the number of
independent groups is yet to be revealed.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the parties contesting the elections are currently
in the process of finalizing their nomination lists which have to
be handed in before September 4.
</P>
<P>
Some 12 million voters are to cast their ballots at more than
10,000 polling booths to choose 225 members to the next parliament.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Still Uganda's Big Problem: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A French scientist has said that
in spite of the highly praised success story about Uganda's
campaign to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS, more effort is still
needed.
</P>
<P>
Luc Montagnier was quoted by Thursday's New Vision daily as
saying that "Uganda has done a lot and the infection rate has gone
down, but this is not enough."
</P>
<P>
Montagnier, who discovered the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus
causing AIDS, said he is prepared to work with Ugandan scientists
in helping them understand the mysteries of the disease.
</P>
<P>
While scientists have learnt a lot about the disease, a lot
more still remains "mysterious", like why the infection rate is
higher in sub-Saharan Africa, why treatment cannot reduce the
infection rate and how to find out alternative treatment to those
already infected, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Director of Health in Uganda's Ministry of Health
Francis Omaswa, "Uganda has reached a very critical stage in its
efforts to combat AIDS."
</P>
<P>
"We have been able to raise awareness and have had a reasonable
level of success, but there are more challenges," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Advances, Norman Aims Returning No. 1 ranking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras showed his form by
a 214-kph (133-mph) serve and a easy win of 6-3, 6-1 and 6-3 over
Justin Gimelstob in the U.S. Open tennis here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras' serve snapped the upset wave at the U.S. Open after
two-time champion Patrick Rafter tumbled out the night before.
</P>
<P>
Since he turned pro four years ago, the 6-foot-5 (1.93-meter)
Gimelstob has carried the promise, or the hope, that he would be
the next great American men's player. But the 29-year-old Sampras,
four times the U.S. Open champ, is still capable of making young
compatriot Gimelstob, ranked 80 in the world, look like an
awkward amateur.
</P>
<P>
Norman used to jump to the top of the ATP Tour rankings and new
he could take over the leading spot in the year-end race without
even winning a major tournament. In fact, only Norman and Sampras
are in position to pass No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten, a first-round loser,
when the U.S.Open ends.
</P>
<P>
Norman moved another step closer to the top spot as he beat
Paul Goldstein 7-5, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
In the women's competition, it was a day of routine second-
round victories for all the top seeds as No. 1 Hingis breezed
crushed Kristina Brandi 6-1, 6-1; No. 3 Williams beat Kveta
Hrdlickova 6-1, 6-1 in 48 minutes; No. 6 Seles beat Anne Kremer 6-
3, 6-4; No. 8 Nathalie Tauziat beat Maria Alejandra Vento 6-3, 6-1;
No. 9 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario beat Sonya Jeyaseelan 6-4, 6-1; No.
11 Sandrine Testud beat Iroda Tulyaganova 6-4, 6-3; and No. 15
Capriati advanced 6-2, 6-2 against Henrieta Nagyova.
</P>
<P>
Among the men, No. 6 Marat Safin beat Thierry Guardiola 7-5, 6-
7(5), 6-4, 6-4; No. 10 Cedric Pioline beat Sargis Sargsian 6-3, 6-
3,6-1; and No. 15 Philippoussis downed Albert Portas 6-3, 6-2, 6-3.

<HEADLINE> China's Film Industry Woos Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 31 (Xinhua)-- Overseas investors may find new
opportunities in China's film industry as the nation rebuilds its
cinemas with more advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent document from the State Administration of
Radio, Film and Television and the Ministry of Culture, overseas
investment is now welcomed in film production, technology
upgrading and construction of existing cinemas in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has 5,000 cinemas and most of them
were built between the 1950s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Two Hong Kong-sponsored film cities in Wuhan, capital of
central China's Hubei Province, earned 13 million yuan (about 1.57
million U.S. dollars) in the first year after they were put into
operation, accounting for 80 percent of income generated from
cinemas in the province.
</P>
<P>
Other overseas-funded high-grade cinemas in Shanghai and
Chongqing have also recorded remarkable profits in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Cinema development is booming in large cities such as Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimated that China still needs about 20,000 film
screens to cater to the growing demand for films.
</P>
<P>
During the latest Fifth Changchun Film Festival, some 240,000
fans in the country have taken part in the voting for their
favorite films. Watching films is also the most popular
entertainment in the rural parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, some 300 cinemas will go online to
sell tickets. More efforts are being made to improve cinema
facilities and equipment. Film quality will also be enhanced by
digital film producing companies.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jianzhong, director of the Film Department under the State
Administration of Radio, Film and Television said upgrading cinema
equipment and film-producing technology will further the
development of China's film industry.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong-based film corporation plans to invest about 50
million yuan (over 6 million U.S. dollars) in China within a year
to produce films.
</P>
<P>
China's film market has unlimited opportunities for overseas
investment. Experts estimate that the film industry will flourish
in the near future and become a new economic growth area.
</P>
<P>
Wen Yuxu, chief supervisor of Asia with the Twentieth Century
Fox Film Corp., said he is confident about their business
development in China and China's flourishing film industry.

<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- China has an adequate supply of
plasma for clinic use and does not need to import any plasma from
foreign countries, today's Beijing Youth Daily cited an official
source as saying.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper recently reported that plasma polluted by HIV and
hepatitis virus had been transferred from an African country to a
number of countries in the past 20 years, including China.
</P>
<P>
"This is groundless," the daily cited an official from the
State Exit-Entry Quarantine Administration as saying, "we have the
world's advanced equipment and any plasma polluted by HIV will
absolutely be checked out."
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the administration is now
investigating the rumor and will make a formal statement if
necessary.

<HEADLINE> Soaring Profits for Listed Oil Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, August 31 (Xinhua) -- China's largest overseas listed
oil company, PetroChina Company Ltd., announced today that it made
a net profit of 23.07 billion yuan in the first half of this year,
an increase of 106 per cent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the increase in profitability to price
rises in crude oil and refined oil products and decreases in
financial expenses.
</P>
<P>
According to the company's interim results report, PetroChina
produced a total of 384 million barrels of crude oil and 241.2
billion cubic feet of natural gas in the first half of this year.
The company also processed 270 million barrels of crude oil, of
which 95 per cent is produced by the company's exploration and
production segment. The company produced 20.66 million tons of
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.
</P>
<P>
 The Board of PetroChina has decided to pay an interim
dividend of 0.059 yuan per share to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the company aims to continue to focus on
enhancing efficiency and cutting costs through on-going
restructuring and rationalization of its operations. To achieve
this, the company plans to shift its focus from increasing crude
oil production to maximizing return on capital. It will also shut
down inefficient refining facilities while striving to optimize
product mix for bigger market shares.
</P>
<P>
PetroChina conducted its initial public offering in both New
York and Hong Kong in April this year and issued 10 per cent of
its total equity shares.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Judiciary Orders Investigation Into Khoramabad Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran's judiciary chief Ayatollah
Hashemi Shahroudi has ordered the investigation into the riots in
the western city of Khoramabad, which have left one policeman dead
and many others injured.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Inspectorate General Hojjatoleslam Ebrahim Raisi
will head a delegation to probe the unrest and reveal the "behind-
the-scenes factors" in the violent incident, said a decree of the
judiciary chief, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The results of the investigation should be provided as soon as
possible to a judge to unveil the scandals of the rioters seeking
to strike a blow to the national security, the decree added.
</P>
<P>
The unrest broke out in Khoramabad, capital of Lorestan
province, on Saturday after two leading intellectuals were blocked
from entering the city to address a nationwide conference of the
Office to Foster Unity (OFU), the largest student group backing
President Mohammad Khatami's reform programs.
</P>
<P>
The incident touched off days of violence between supporters of
the pro-reform group and the country's conservative radicals. A
policeman was killed and many people, including Governor-General of
Lorestan Norollah Abedi, were wounded in violent attacks by the
conservative assailants.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami's reformist allies condemned the "calculated"
and "well-organized" attacks which, they said, aimed to weaken the
authority of the government.
</P>
<P>
They urged the judiciary authorities to make a rapid probe into
the incidents and bring the trouble-makers, who were also
responsible for many previous anti-reform riots, to justice.
</P>
<P>
The OFU students, who were forced to cut short the conference,
claimed on Tuesday that some "known elements" were involved in
beating the students and wounding more than 100 of them.
</P>
<P>
In an implicit way, they were referring to the pro-conservative
armed Basij (voluntary Islamic militia) and the elite Islamic
Revolution Guards Corps, who are under direct control of the
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The recent attacks marked the start of a new wave of suppression
and obstruction by the conservatives to confront the reformist
movement, which has been fostered by President Khatami since his
election in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The reformist movement also managed to end the long-time
conservative control of the Majlis (parliament) in February's
election.
</P>
<P>
However, despite their loss of the executive and legislative
branches of the system, the conservatives still control most of the
other important state organs, including the judiciary, the armed
forces and state-run radio and televisions.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, the conservative judiciary has ordered
to close more than 20 pro-reform papers and journals and imprisoned
a number of reformist figures on charges of violating Islamic
principles and advocating American-style reforms.
</P>
<P>
Conservative radicals, particularly members of the Ansar-e
Hezbollah (Friends of God Party) and the Basij, have frequently
launched violent attacks on pro-reform allies and beat students and
people attending the reformist rallies.
</P>
<P>
In face of the powerful conservative offensive, President
Khatami and his reformist allies have urged the reformist movement
to exercise restraint in case the situation gets out of control,
which is clearly to the benefit of the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
However, with the 2001 presidential election drawing near and
President Khatami's recent announcement that he will seek a second
term, the conservatives are expected to exert more and more
pressures on the reformers to avoid another humiliating defeat.

<HEADLINE> Lankan President Charges Opposition Leader Aware Of Assassination  Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has charged that main opposition leader Ranil
Wickremesinghe was aware of details of the assassination attempt
on her life by a Tamil Tiger suicide bomber during last December
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Uva Province convention of her Sri Lanka Freedom
Party on Wednesday, Kumaratunga challenged the opposition United
National Party (UNP) leader Ranil to deny this allegation publicly
and clear his name, if the allegation was false.
</P>
<P>
She further charged that a UNP Parliament Member was also
involved in the conspiracy and had constant talks with the
leadership of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to
commit this crime.
</P>
<P>
She said she escaped death on that occasion but still risked
her life to assure a peaceful Sri Lanka for future generations
which she was committed to till peace was achieved in her country.
</P>
<P>
She added that the LTTE never wanted peace and the UNP had
aligned itself with them to eliminate ruling People's Alliance (PA)
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said that the PA would never do anything secretly
nor would they discuss or enter into any negotiation till the LTTE
laid down their arms.
</P>
<P>
She pledged to destroy terrorism and implement the political
solution to end the war and achieve lasting peace. She hoped the
people would give her the required two third majority in the
Parliament to fulfill that task.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga narrowly escaped an assassination attempt but lost
her vision in her right eye on December 18 last year when a LTTE
woman suicide bomber struck after an election rally in Town Hall.
</P>
<P>
LTTE has been fighting a 17-year bloody war against government
forces in the north and east of the country in an attempt to
create an independent Tamil state. Numbers of high-ranking
government officials have been targeted on top of their lists.

<HEADLINE> IMF Pledges to Continue Supporting Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF has vowed again to continue supporting Indonesia despite
signs that Indonesia's new chief economic minister wanted some
changes in the IMF-sponsored economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was expressed by IMF Asia Pacific deputy director
Anoop Singh Wednesday after a meeting with Coordinating Minister
for Economic Affairs Rizal Ramli here, the Jakarta Post daily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to convey a message that the IMF is committed to
strongly support Indonesia, there is no doubt about it," said
Singh, adding that his meeting with Rizal focused on ways to
increase "the government ownership of the program."
</P>
<P>
The IMF promised in January this year 5 billion U.S. dollars to
support Indonesia's economic recovery. So far, it has disbursed
some 700 million U.S. dollars to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The previous economic ministers said in July that the IMF was
expected to disburse another 400 million U.S. dollars in late
August.
</P>
<P>
However, since his appointment as the top economic minister,
Rizal has said that he wanted to make some changes in the roles of
the IMF and other multilateral lending institutions in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Rizal has yet to disclose what exactly was on his mind, but he
said recently that the IMF should not be too involved in the
development of economic sectors such as the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The core competence of the IMF was in monetary stability, noted
Rizal who has been one of the strongest critics of the IMF reform
program in the country.

<HEADLINE> Austrian President Urges End to EU Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Austrian President Thomas Klestil
Wednesday urged the EU to lift its sanctions against the Austrian
government, which currently includes members of the far-right
Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
Austria's EU partners imposed sanctions on Austria after the
far-right Freedom Party joined a coalition government with the
conservative People's Party in February.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the 14 (EU) countries lift the unjust measures taken
against the Austrian government as soon as possible," Klestil said
at the opening ceremony of an agricultural exposition in the State
of Upper Wels, Austria.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has tried in the past at various times
to persuade Austria's EU partners to ease sanctions against his
country. He will also attend the U.N. Millennium Summit next week
to try and end Austria's isolation by EU, Klestil said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the three-person expert panel currently
working in Austria sent by EU will probably take the first steps
to break the impasse between Austria and EU.
</P>
<P>
The panel, led by former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari,
began on July 28 to evaluate Austria's political situation. The 14
EU countries will decide whether to lift its sanctions according
to a final report by the panel.

<HEADLINE> Strange Slopes Found in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 31 (Xinhua)-- Seven strange slopes were
discovered recently in Yanggao County, Datong City in north China'
s Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Without any power supply, automobiles could run up the slope at
the speed of 30 kilometers per hour. Water flows to the top of the
slope in the same fashion. People also feel hindered while riding
bicycles down the slope.
</P>
<P>
The slopes, each from 40 meters to 100 meters long, are part of
a mountain path between two villages of the Yanggao County. The
average elevation of the slopes is approximately 20 degrees.
</P>
<P>
The slopes in Datong city are not the only mysterious slopes in
China. The "strange slope", found in 1990 in Shenyang, capital of
northeast China's Liaoning Province, is more widely known.
</P>
<P>
Drivers have to accelerate when driving down the 80-meter-long
slope and drive upward with the brakes on, otherwise the vehicle
will accelerate on its own.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, more than four million tourists including
over 50,000 from abroad have visited the strange slope in Shenyang.
The latest discovery of the seven slopes is expected to attract
more visitors to Datong, China's major coal production base.

but it is also a good opportunity for foreign insurance companies
which want to get involved with the Chinese market," said New

<HEADLINE> Sydney Hotel Workers Rally Against Olympic Raffle Ticket Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Around 60 workers rallied
outside the Inter-Continental hotel in Sydney Thursday to protest
against an offer of raffle tickets instead of a cash bonus for
extra work during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Chanting "more pay" and "the Intercon sucks", the workers
raffled off three matchbox cars in protest at the five-star hotel'
s offer.
</P>
<P>
The Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union (LHMU)
said the workers were appalled by the offer from hotel management.
</P>
<P>
The union is asking all Sydney hotels to pay workers a 550-
Australian dollar (324.5 U.S. dollars) Olympic allowance to work
during the Games.
</P>
<P>
The protest was peaceful but two police did ask the protesters
to keep the streets clear.
</P>
<P>
LHMU Assistant Secretary Mark Boyd said earlier the Olympic
bonus incentive included a ticket in the car raffle and a 50-
Australian dollar (29.5 U.S. dollars) gift voucher for full time
staff.
</P>
<P>
Casual staff have been excluded from the gift voucher offer, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The union said the Inter-Continental was charging 2,000
Australian dollars (1,180 U.S.dollars) a night and would be home
during the Games to senior executives, producers and journalists
from American media giant NBC.

Zenden will not be playing for Italian champions Lazio this season,
Lazio Chairman Sergio Cragnotti said Wednesday, confirming press

Championships, would have received 4.4 billion lire net for four
years, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Lazio badly wanted Zenden to replace Portuguese player Sergio
Conceicao, who joined Parma in the summer's biggest package deal,
the world record 50 million U.S. dollars signing of Argentinian
striker Hernan Crespo.
</P>
<P>
As well as Conceicao and cash, Parma also got non-stop
Argentinian midfielder Mattias Almeyda.
</P>
<P>
Zenden would have completed a glittering front line, playing
alongside Crespo and his fellow Argentine Claudio Lopez, another
summer signing from Valencia.
</P>
<P>
Lazio also has Chilean ace Marcelo "The Matador" Salas, a
recent match-winner against Brazil.

<HEADLINE> China's "Graybeard Internet Users" Growing: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The number of Chinese "graybeard
Internet users" who are above 50 years old has increased to 140,
000, a latest survey indicates.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Chinese Internet Information Center,
shows that the number of internet users of this age group has
increased by 55 percent in the past six months, accounting for 1.6
percent of the total number of Chinese Internet users.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that 6 percent of Chinese Internet users
in cities are below 18 years old and 4 percent are above 55.
</P>
<P>
The report based on this survey said, "Surfing on the Internet
has become a sweeping vogue in China."
</P>
<P>
In a test which required the participants to spend 72 hours
with Internet as their sole connection to the outside world, the
oldest applicants were, 73, from Beijing , and 67, from Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
However, some experts pointed out that the number of graybeard
Internet-users are still insignificant compared with 126 million
senior citizens in China.
</P>
<P>
Min Dahong, an scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, admitted that no influential website is able to provide
comprehensive service for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of Chinese Internet users has
reached 11 million, and the figure would exceed 30 million by the
year 2003.

<P>
QINHUANGDAO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- An ancient gingko tree,
believed to be 2,800 years old, has been discovered in a village
in Qinhuangdao of north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The trunk of the tree has a perimeter of over four meters, and
its crown covers about 0.07 hectare.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yuntao, an expert on ancient trees, said that it was the
suitable geological position, weather and soil that enabled the
tree to survive so many years.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the tree's survival to the strong protection
consciousness of local people.
</P>
<P>
The gingko is a dioecious plant species -- comes in both sexes -
- which survived the glacial period over 2 million years ago in
China.
</P>
<P>
The tree is also known as the "longevity tree" because it can
live up to 1,000 years. Gingkoes are highly valued for their
medicinal properties.

<HEADLINE> Improved Ticket to Ride for Tourists: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- China's top tourism
administration and several provincial tourism departments have
signed an agreement with 65 travel services to guarantee the
rights and interests of Chinese mainland tourists in Singapore,
Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
He Guangwei, director of China National Tourism Administration,
said the tourism market and travel agencies would be inspected
regularly to eliminate any malpractice, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We must take effective measures to regulate the tourism market
of Chinese outbound tour groups as soon as possible," He said.
</P>
<P>
China has become one of the top tourism generating countries in
Asia since its opening up in 1978; the number of Chinese going
overseas hit 9.23 million last year.
</P>
<P>
Previously, travel agencies at home and abroad joined to offer
extremely low charges as a way of attracting tourists. To try to
make up for these losses, travel agencies in the destination
countries and regions urged tourists to spend their money in
shopping centers and sought commission from retailers. Tourists
would eventually find their costs were much higher than usual.
</P>
<P>
Such practices by travel agencies "not only seriously infringed
the tourists' rights and interests, but also damaged tourism and
the interests of law-abiding travel services," said Wang Suqi,
manager of Outbound Tour for the Chinese Citizen Department of
China International Travel Service.

<HEADLINE> India Refuses to Accept Its Soldier's Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Military
authorities have refused to accept the body of an Indian soldier
from the Pakistani side, the spokesman of the Pakistani Inter
Services Public Relations said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian soldier was killed when Pakistani Army repulsed an
Indian attack on one of its forward posts on the Line of Control (
LoC) in Rawalakot Sector, Kashmir, on the night between August 23/
24 and it was recovered by a Pakistan Army Patrol on the LoC, four
days later, under heavy Indian automatic and artillery fire in a
difficult terrain.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, the spokesman stated that the
refusal to accept the body of its own soldier was utter disregard
to the martial tradition. Apparent reason for this refusal and
insensitivity towards their fallen soldiers was due to the fact
that the Indians had been denying attack on the Pakistani Post and
acceptance of the body would expose them to the world as having
attacked and failed in their bid to capture it.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has unilaterally offered cease-fire and a safe passage
to the Indian troops or the recovery of other bodies lying in the
area. These Indian soldiers were killed while retreating after the
same unsuccessful attack on the night of August 23/24. However,
The Indian military authorities have not yet responded to the
offer despite reiteration of this offer from the Pakistani side,
the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> South China Tiger Reportedly Found in Guizhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese wild animal researchers
recently claimed that they have found the traces of South China
tigers in primeval forest along the banks of the Chishui River in
southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said that they have found footsteps of a tiger in
the Xishui Nature Reserve in June. The footsteps, each 13
centimeter long and 16 centimeter wide, were believed to be the
footsteps of the endangered south China tiger.
</P>
<P>
Local people also often reported that they have located hair
and dung from tigers.
</P>
<P>
Animal experts said that it is very possible that such tigers
live around the nature reserve because the reserve has many wild
animals and water resources which could solve tiger's food and
drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are only 20 to 30 wild South China
tigers in China which used to live in east, south and southwest
China.

<P>
The stone forest is located in Taiyanghe Township, Shi'en of
Hubei Province. It occupies a total land area of about 10 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
All the stones are grotesque in shape, and some look like
flying dragons and angry tigers, while others look like blooming
flowers, a local source said.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the best thing for the stones is that they
are in the middle of a real forest and the "trees, grasses and
flowers make the stones even more beautiful."
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Xiaoping, a famous expert on tourism, the
newly discovered stone forest is good enough to become an
international tourist attraction.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebels Make New Demand for Hostage Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean rebel group, The
West Side Boys, which is currently holding seven hostages, has put
forward new demands following the  earlier release of five of its
captives, according to reports reaching here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the rebel group Colonel Cambodia was quoted as
saying in Freetown, the capital of the war-torn west African
country, that the rebels wanted a review of the Lome Peace Accord,
their reintegration into the government army as well as the
release of their supporters from jail.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said their captives were well treated and being
properly fed and provided with adequate medicine and shelter,
adding that the rest would not be released until their new demands
were met.
</P>
<P>
Twelve soldiers including 11 Britons and one Sierra Leonean
were taken hostage by the West Side Boys last Friday when they
were patrolling along the Freetown-Masiaka highway.
</P>
<P>
Following the abduction of the soldiers, the rebel group had
demanded food, medicine and the release of one of their leaders in
return for the release of the hostage.
</P>
<P>
Five British soldiers were released on Wednesday by the
abductors and returned safely to their barracks in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for the release of the remaining soldiers were
reportedly under way among the Sierra Leonean government, the
United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, the British and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, no response was yet available to the new demands of
the rebels.

<P>
LAGOS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian health officials have
decried the high baby mortality rate in the country, where five
out of every 100 babies die yearly under the age of five.
</P>
<P>
The high mortality rate was attributed to preventable childhood
diseases and poor health care delivery, the News Agency of Nigeria
Thursday quoted the officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Grace Delano, executive director of the Association for
Reproductive and Family Health, said that the government should
take practical measures to check the increasing baby mortality
rate through improved education and sound technology.
</P>
<P>
"The earlier we act the better for our future," Delano said at
an academic workshop in the southwestern city of Ibadan.
</P>
<P>
Describing nurses and midwives as the bedrock of the primary
health care system, Delano said it was necessary to continuously
educate them and improve their skills and competence.

<P>
HAVANA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government confirmed
Thursday the detention of three alleged Swedish journalists
because they "promoted subversive acts" and violated Cuba's
internal laws.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez
Roque said the Swedes carried out illegal acts to contribute to "
desperate attempts organized in the United States to promote
internal subversion."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister emphasized that Cuba will defend its right
to uphold internal security and stability and will prevent trouble-
makers and hired agents invading Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Swedish citizens Birger Thuresson, Peter Geoetell and Helena
Soederquist came to Cuba as tourists last Thursday and were
stopped Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"These three people have been arrested by way of warning as is
done in any country wherever the laws of the country are broken,"
the top Cuban diplomat said, adding that the Swedes have been
cleared to leave Cuba Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sweden Wednesday formally protested against the arrests to the
Cuban deputy foreign minister, who was on a visit to Norway, it

<HEADLINE> Traffic on Move as French Protests End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- British holidaymakers began
arriving home Thursday after French fishermen who were angry at
rising fuel prices called off their two-day blockade.
</P>
<P>
Tension between the protesters and holidaymakers had reached
near the boiling point at ports around the French coast before the
blockade was called off. The fishermen ended their protests after
the French government agreed to cut social security payments in
compensation.
</P>
<P>
Furious British tourists, some of whom had been stranded for
more than 36 hours, lost their tempers as they faced the prospect
of another night sleeping in their cars.
</P>
<P>
Lorries which had blocked the tunnel entrance outside Calais
were moved, as were the fishing boats blocking the port entrance.
</P>
<P>
Stranded holidaymakers were allowed through all eight lanes of
the Eurotunnel terminal within 20 minutes of the blockade being
lifted and the threats of violence subsided.
</P>
<P>
Protest leaders said they were "satisfied" with the outcome of
talks with French Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany but British
holidaymakers returning home were not so happy.
</P>
<P>
British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott told BBC that a
long-term strategy should be introduced to prevent the British
being affected by "what is essentially a French problem."
</P>
<P>
"It is totally unacceptable that Britain could be held to
ransom in this kind of blockade raising out of a dispute in France,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Prescott called on the EU Transport Commissioner Loyola de
Palacio to arrange an urgent meeting with UK Transport Minister
Lord Macdonald to discuss new rules of engagement to handle future
disputes.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Thursday
ruled out mediation by a third party to help release a U.S.
hostage held by Muslim rebels in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"We're not interested in third-party mediation, we're not
seeking mediation efforts by third countries," State Department
Richard Boucher said, responding to a question that whether the U.
S. accepts the help offered by Libya.
</P>
<P>
Boucher said U.S. officials had close contact with the
Philippine government which is in charge of the effort to win the
release of Jeffrey Schilling, 24, who has been held by Abu Sayyaf
rebels on the remote Philippine island of Jolo since Monday.
</P>
<P>
Boucher urged the Abu Sayyaf group to release Schilling on the
grounds that he had "long-term health problems" and needed
prescription medication.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to specify Schilling's illness, the spokesman said
that "we see no advantage to continuing to hold Mr. Schilling. And
for humanitarian reasons alone, we think he should be released
quickly and safely."
</P>
<P>
Libya, which had earlier help secure the release of six of a
group of western and Philippine hostages held by Abu Sayyaf, said
on Tuesday that it would also be prepared to work for Schilling's
release.

<HEADLINE> Bush Attacks Gore in TV Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush on Thursday prepared to release a TV ad
mocking his Democratic rival Al Gore with clips of the vice
president at a Buddhist temple fund-raiser and claiming to have
invented the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The Republican ad, which will run in 17 states starting Friday,
showed an image of Gore at the Buddhist temple in California,
speaking about campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996, some 60,000 dollars in illegal donations were
raised in connection with the event Gore attended at a Buddhist
temple, but Gore denied that he knew the event was a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
The ad comes as polls show the November 7 presidential election
race has become neck-and-neck.
</P>
<P>
Local media said this is the latest and most striking
development in this year's ad war, capping a summer in which about
60 million dollars were spent to influence an uninterested
electorate.
</P>
<P>
Gore's presidential running mate Joseph Lieberman accused the
Texas governor of breaking his own promise to run a clean campaign
and changing the tone of politics.
</P>
<P>
"This drags us back to the worst politics of the past,"
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said Bush was taking a big risk because he
had repeatedly promised to run a positive campaign.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of the tough race ahead, Texas Governor Bush is
also sharpening his rhetoric against Gore.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who has been hammered by Gore this week over his lack of
specifics on issues such as prescription drugs, accused Clinton-
Gore administration Thursday of "flowery speeches," big talk and
failed leadership.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who is devoting this week to education reform, visited a
high school in Toledo, Ohio, where he pushed his message of
accountability and local control.

remains tame after six hikes in interest rates in the past 14
months.

Noting the traditional friendship and the progress made in

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Illegal drug use among teen-
agers continue to fall in the United States for a second year, a
government survey said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, 9 percent of 12-to-17-year-olds questioned said
they had used an illegal drug such as marijuana or heroin within
the previous month, down from 9.9 percent in 1998, and 11.4
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse was released by
Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's drug policy adviser, and
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to go down again for sure next year," McCaffrey
said. "These prevention and education programs are working."
</P>
<P>
However, the survey showed that drug use among young adults of
18-to-25-year-olds climbed from 14.7 percent in 1997 to 18.8
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
"None of us can afford to let down our guard in the fight
against drug, tobacco and alcohol abuse, especially when it comes
to our children," President Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He urged Congress to fund his administration's substance abuse
and treatment programs when it returns next week.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Says Forces Maybe Not Ready for Two Wars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. armed forces are
mostly ready to perform wartime missions, but if the country had
to fight two major wars at the same time, it would run a high risk
of increased casualties because of shortfalls in logistic support,
the Pentagon said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Most major combat and support forces are ready to meet
assigned taskings under this scenario (two wars at the same time),
although there are force readiness and capability shortfalls that
increase risk in executing operations," the Pentagon said in a
periodical assessment report to the Congress.
</P>
<P>
The term "risk" in this context means the risk of not meeting
field commanders' timetables for moving forces to a theater of war
and executing the war plan, the Associated Press said. It does not
mean the risk of failing to win the war, but rather the risk that
longer timelines for starting combat operations would mean high U.
S. casualties.
</P>
<P>
The assessment, required by the Congress every three months,
also said the U.S. military services are facing training problems,
personnel shortages and aging equipment. Even so, it concluded
that "America's armed forces remain capable of executing" the
military strategy of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
The report comes amid growing debate between the presidential
campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W.
Bush about whether the Clinton administration has sapped the
strength of the U.S. military.
