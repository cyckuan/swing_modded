<HEADLINE> UN Chief Reports Sources of Conflict in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Different histories and
geographical conditions, different stages of economic development,
different sets of public policies and different patterns of
internal and international interaction are the main sources
causing conflict in Africa, UN Secretary-General said on Thursday
in his report on Africa.
</P>
<P>
For the historic and geographical reason, Annan said in the
report that the colonial Powers in 1885 partitioned Africa into
territorial units, in which kingdoms, states and communities in
Africa were just as arbitrarily jointed together. In the 1960s,
the newly independent African States inherited those colonial
boundaries, together with the challenge that legacy posed to their
territorial integrity and to their attempts to achieve national
unity.
</P>
<P>
The nature of political power in many African States, together
with the real and perceived consequences of capturing and
maintaining power is a key internal factor for conflict in Africa,
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said during the cold war, external
efforts to bolster or undermine African governments were a
familiar feature of super-power competition. With the end of cold
war, external interventions has diminished but has not
disappointed. In the competition for oil and other precious
resources in Africa, interests external to Africa continue to
play a large and sometimes decisive role, both in suppressing
conflict and in sustaining it.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said despite the devastation that armed conflicts
bring, there are many who profit form chaos and lack of
accountability, and who may have little or no interests in
stopping a conflict and much interest in prolonging it.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the broader sources of conflict in Africa that
have been identified, a number of other factors are especially
important in particular situations and subregions. they include
the competition for scarce land and water resources in densely
populated areas.

WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The launch of U.S. space
shuttle Columbia, which was scheduled on Thursday afternoon, has
been postponed until Friday afternoon because of a failed data
processor.
</P>
<P>
Columbia has two modem-like processors and both must be working

<HEADLINE> Iraq Demands Lifting of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Thursday called for
immediate implementation of paragraph 22 of the U.N. Security
Council's resolution 687 as a prelude to lifting sanctions against
the country "once and for all."
</P>
<P>
The call was pronounced Thursday in a statement issued at a
joint meeting of the powerful Revolutionary Command Council and
Iraq's Command of Arab Socialist Baath Party chaired by President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that it is high time for the Security
Council, when reviewing the sanctions regime later this month, to
effectuate paragraph 22 of the resolution 687 without delay as a
step toward the complete lifting of sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The paragraph 22 stipulates that all sanctions on Iraqi exports
are to be lifted after its dangerous weapons are removed.
</P>
<P>
The statement of Iraqi leadership came as the U.N. Security
Council is to begin a half-yearly review of Iraq's implementation
of relevant U.N. resolutions, which will surely be factored in
before an end to the sanctions can be declared.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed the need for putting into effect this
paragraph "if relationship between Iraq and the Security Council
was intended to strike a balance and keep on the right track."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been cooperative to U.N. inspections of its eight
presidential compounds suspected of harboring proscribed weapons,
which had been at the center of its latest standoff with the
U.N..
</P>
<P>
The is a result of a deal stricken by U.N. chief Kofi Annan and
Iraqi government in February, which defused the crisis over
weapons inspections and averted an imminent air strike against
Iraq by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. special group of senior diplomats and arms experts
inspected the presidential sites two weeks ago and found no banned
weapons. But this does not prevent further inspections in the
future because of their open-ended nature.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Iraqi leaders thoroughly reviewed the
"unjust" sanctions the gross harm done to Iraqi people as a
result. "Iraq cannot tolerate criminals' manipulating this issue
of destiny any longer. Iraqis' patience proved to be of no avail,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership "held those with ill intentions for the
crises that will likely follow, and for the consequent harm the
people of Iraq would sustain, should they object to lifting the
sanctions," it said.
</P>
<P>
The crippling U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq since its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990 can not be lifted until U.N. arms inspectors
certify that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Dalian Wanda
paced their way in the Chinese football first division league
after Thursday's 4-1 cushion of Shenzhen Pingan in Dalian,
Liaoning Province, while Chinese Army thrashed Guangzhou Songri
3-0 at home in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's matches were the third round ties which were
postponed because Wanda played in the Asian Club Champions final,
and Chinese Army played an international tournament in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Wanda began to extend their lead in the overall standings to
three points from four wins and one draw over second Qingdao
Hainiu, while Chinese Army moved onto the mid-table after
Thursday's victory.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian striker Tomou Berfin Bayard scored the sole goal in
the 53rd minute for Pingan, which is the only one conceded by the
title-holders so far this season.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tao found the net twice in the second half of the one-side
match. Wanda had almost secured the victory on two first-half
goals from Hans Eklund and Hao Haidong.
</P>
<P>
Wanda coach Xu Genbao, who took the pole at the start of the
season after left Shenzhen Pingan, which finished fourth last
season in the second division, said his club began their campaine
of winning the title for the third consecutive time after the win.
</P>
<P>
Hu Yunfeng scored once and created another, but Chinese Army
played apparently a better defence than their attack in their
first home victory this season.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lei opened the mark seconds before the half-time on a
right flank cross from Hu, who extended the lead to 2-0 in the
70th minute.
</P>
<P>
Tao Pei sealed the match with a sole run in the 88th minute,
but his teammates squadered a dozen of gold opportunities to
change the mark.

<HEADLINE> Egypt-Syria Summit Promotes Arab Solidarity: AL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Ahmed
Esmat Abdel-Meguid said on Thursday that the latest Egypt-Syria
summit has promoted the Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Middle East News Agency, Abdel-Meguid termed
the summit as "a strong phenomenon" further deepening inter-Arab
relations for the good of the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting mirrored the Arab unity in support of the Lebanese
and Syrian stances and the sustained rejection of Israeli attempts
to empty U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 from its kernel," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his Syrian counterpart
Hafez al-Assad held talks here on Wednesday on Israeli proposal of
a conditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders stressed that the withdrawal should be
unconditional. Mubarak assured al-Assad that Egypt sides with
Syria and Lebanon on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided on April 1 to endorse the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 425, which calls for a unilateral Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon. But meanwhile, it said that no troop
pullback would be conducted unless security arrangements are
reached with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Both Lebanon and Syria, which agree not to make peace
separately with Israel, have rejected Israel's offer.
</P>
<P>
Syria has been seeking the return of the Golan Heights, which
Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The summit further underscored the importance of honoring
agreements the previous Israeli government agreed upon,
Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab nation's choice of peace as a strategic option and
objective does not mean that it gives up the Arab rights. But
rather this choice came to prove that it is bent on achieving a
just and comprehensive peace in the Mideast, in accordance with
the U.N. resolutions and the land-for-peace principle," he said.

<HEADLINE> ESCAP Session Opens With Agenda to Promote Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The 54th session of the United
Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific
(ESCAP) opened here Thursday with a forward-looking agenda to
promote social and economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP's Executive Secretary Adrianus Mooy said in his opening
statement that the session came against a backdrop of
"considerable uncertainty in the region's economic picture with
the crisis in the financial and monetary sector having adversely
affected the growth performance and prospects of several
economies."
</P>
<P>
He told the delegates from 40 Asian and Pacific countries that
their task was "particularly onerous."
</P>
<P>
ESCAP senior officials will meet for three days to prepare for
a ministerial-level meeting scheduled to begin on April 20, with
the theme of "Asia and the Pacific Into the 21st Century:
Prospects for Social Development."
</P>
<P>
Among the issues debated Thursday were the financial crisis in
the Asia-Pacific and its implications for regional economic
cooperation. Access to an adequate supply of capital to finance
industrial and technological development was also of serious
concern.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-1997, a number of the best performing economies of
the region have been facing an acute financial crisis. Despite
commitments of large-scale financial assistance, the crisis
deepened throughout late 1997 and early 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, some delegates said they felt there have been signs of
a possible turn-around in these economies. They underscored the
need to stabilize the financial flows to the developing countries
of the region.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening regional economic cooperation was another topic.
The delegates discussed how to strengthen strategies based on open
trading arrangements to the year 2000 and beyond. They presented
their views on electronic commerce and trade negotiations under
the World Trade Organization agreements and the need for a
diversification of trade and investment of Pacific island
economies.
</P>
<P>
Some delegates pointed out that there is a tendency to bypass
or marginalize the Pacific island developing countries, mainly due
to "logistical difficulties and difference in the level of
development."
</P>
<P>
They suggested some ways to overcome the problems. They include
intensifying trade and investment information network activities,
institutional capacity building for market information gathering
and dissemination on target markets and human resource
development.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also discussed environment and natural resources
development. They stressed that energy and fresh water were two
issues that required urgent attention in view of the high rates of
population increase and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
They called on the ESCAP to develop both national and regional
strategies for energy and fresh water management.
</P>
<P>
The officials will continue their discussion Friday on
socio-economic measures to alleviate poverty in rural and urban
areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides will visit Athens on April 24 to have talks with Greek
Prime Minister Costas Simitis on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing Thursday, government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said the meeting aims at further
strengthening common understanding in view of renewed efforts for
solving the protracted Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is set to follow a visit here by U.S. State
Department special coordinator Thomas Miller, who is expected in
town on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Miller will have separate meetings with President Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, who, correspondingly, will
hold consultations with Turkish leaders on April 22-23 in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Presidential emissary for Cyprus, Richard Holbrooke,
is expected to visit the island early next month in a bid to get
the Cyprus peace talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has upped his quote for resuming negotiations to
settle the Cyprus problem by demanding his Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus be recognized as a sovereign entity.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 the
breakaway state, which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

Richardson said the U.S. government has moved away from the single
item agenda of Pakistan's nuclear program and is seeking to build
new linkages in diverse fields, with particular emphasis on trade,
commerce and investment.
</P>
<P>
In this context, Richardson referred to the preparations
already underway in Washington to examine new initiatives that
could be explored during President Bill Clinton's forthcoming
visit to Pakistan later this year.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed that the Clinton Administration was
determined to find a mutually acceptable solution to the F-16
problem at an early date.
</P>
<P>
He recognized that the continued denial of the planes, as well
as of the money paid by Pakistan, was a serious embarrassment to
the United States and an unnecessary irritant in the bilateral
ties between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> OAU Hails UN Deployment in Central Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) Thursday commended the United Nations Security Council for
its decision to deploy a U.N. peacekeeping force to the Central
Africa Republic to replace an outgoing African regional force.
</P>
<P>
By sending the 1,350-strong U.N. mission in Central Africa,
the U.N. has assumed its rightful role as defined by its charter,
OAU Chairman and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said in a
statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force will be the first U.N. peacekeeping force to be
deployed in Africa in five years, which is tasked to strengthen
security, collect weapons and maintain order in the Central
Africa Republic's capital of Bangui which was hit by mutinies in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The UN force has a pivotal role to play in maintaining peace
and stability in the Central Africa Republic and thereby create
conditions conducive to the holding of elections in September in
1998, the Zimbabwe News Agency quoted Mugabe as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The UN force is to replace the outgoing inter-African Mission
for Surveillance of the Bangui Accord (MISAB) which played a
critical role in arresting conflict and anarchy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe described MISAB as "another shining example of Africans
seeking to solve African problems through sub-regional and
regional efforts."
</P>
<P>
MISAB received financial, material and logistical support from
the French government to help fulfill its objectives.
</P>
<P>
President of the Central Africa Republic, Felix Alinge Patasse
has made the request, through UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
for having the peacekeeping mission in the country until the 1999
presidential elections, Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that the UN Security Council will give
sympathetic consideration to this request," Mugabe said.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Says Fear of Euro Groundless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Thursday said the fear of European single currency euro
"groundless and excessive" and expressed confidence in the
capability of France to adapt to the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the statement at a press conference in one of his
last moves to push a widely divided National Assembly to vote for
a series of moves for adapting to the European monetary union by
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly will begin the final debates on European
single currency next Tuesday with a speech by Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin. The debates are expected to see sharp exchanges
between those who support the euro and those who condemn it.
</P>
<P>
"People have fear of the change of money. People fear the
collapse of the frontier, the opening of the economy, the
competition, the role of the financial market, the free
circulation of men and, more perhaps, of capitals," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Chirac was referring to many parliament deputies of both the
right and the left who are afraid that the adoption of the euro
will result in a loss of national independence in monetary field.
</P>
<P>
"But I consider them groundless or excessive if we are
vigilant and active in Brussels and Strasbourg, and if we are
serious in the management of our national affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also rejected a request by the Communist Party, which is
opposed to the euro, to hold a national referendum on the
Amsterdam Treaty which fixes the deadline of introducing euro.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a revolution, it is a technical adaptation" said
Chirac, adding that the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty
organized by President Francois Mitterand has already given
"legitimacy" to the Amsterdam treaty, the follow-up version of
the former.
</P>
<P>
He said that France has all the trumps to fend off the shock
from euro, such as its excellent education system, infrastructures
and good geographical position.
</P>
<P>
But Chirac also admitted that France has many "handicaps,"
including gigantic public spendings, a persisting bureaucratic
machinery in government, and heavy income taxes.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, France must carry forward its reforms in
social and economic fields, which are "inevitable."

<HEADLINE> Africa Produces Scant Amount of World Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Africa, with 13 percent of
the world's population, only produced 1.7 percent of the world's
total wealth, according to statistics from the Pan-African
Productivity Association.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Organization of African Unity's (OAU)
labor and social affairs commission this week, the association
said that Africa's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was
only 620 U.S. Dollars in 1995, compared to a world average of
4,880 U.S. Dollars, the South Africa Press Association reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
From 1985 to 1995, Africa's GDP per capita declined at a rate
of 1.1 percent every year, said Jan Visser, the president of the
association.
</P>
<P>
High productivity was important for job creation because
economic growth was impossible in the global economy unless firms
were competitive, he said.
</P>
<P>
Visser said that the globalized economy should not be seen
only as a threat - it was also a huge opportunity because it
opened markets for African entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The OAU meeting was presented with a World Economic Forum
report on African competitiveness in which South Africa came the
7th. But compared to 46 other developed countries, it ranked
only the 44th.
</P>
<P>
However, Pan-African Employers' Confederation
Secretary-General Azad Jeetun said there were signs that the
continent had re-awakened, with 19 countries recording growth
rates exceeding five percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The World Band had admitted that Africa was on the way to
sustained growth, said Jeetun.

<HEADLINE> US for Balanced Policy on Nuclear Issue in S.Asia: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government, while
working for non-proliferation in South Asia, would approach the
issue in a fair, balanced and non-discriminatory manner, visiting
U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who is at the head of a high-level U.S. delegation,
made the remarks during his two-hour talks with Pakistani Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub Khan.
</P>
<P>
On Pakistan-Indian relations and peace and security in the
region, Richardson, who arrived here Wednesday from New Delhi,
said the U.S. appreciated the measures Pakistan had taken to meet
its defense needs, according to a press release issued by the
Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. Administration was deeply appreciative of
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's offer to resume dialogue with India,
and that he had urged the new Indian leadership to respond
positively to it.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan issue, Richardson expressed his deep appreciation
for the major initiatives taken by Prime Minister Sharif to
promote a peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict in that
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the U.S. wish to promote a serious dialogue
amongst the many factions in Afghanistan and recognized that
Pakistan had to play a major role in this process.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar said the traditional
friendship between the two countries provided the foundation for
building a new and strong partnership.
</P>
<P>
He explained at length Pakistan's policy in promoting peace and
security in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to seeking peace in South
Asia on the basis of a fair and just settlement of all outstanding
issues between Pakistan and India, including the Jammu and Kashmir
issue which is at the root of all problems afflicting the region.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the U.S. delegation on the latest developments
in Afghanistan and the initiatives taken by Pakistan to bring the
Afghan factions to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
He said it was important to recognize that a settlement of the
Afghan issue could emerge only from the Afghans themselves.

JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) --The Zimbabawe Posts and

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes EU Position on Ties with Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government welcomed the
European Union (EU) position on its relations with Turkey,
believing it would help facilitate efforts to break the deadlock
in the peace process in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides told his daily press
briefing Thursday that "we assess the statements made by Hans Van
den Broek, the EU External Relations commissioner, as helpful in
breaking the deadlock and resuming bicommunal talks."
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Washington after meeting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, the commissioner said he had asked the U.S.,
which enjoys good relations with Turkey, to make clear to Ankara
what the offers exactly are that came out from EU's Luxembourg
summit last December.
</P>
<P>
The EU Luxembourg summit declared that relations with Turkey
would improve if Ankara backs efforts to settle the Cyprus
problem, works toward its relations with Greece, improves the
human rights situation and helps solve the Kurdish problem.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek said the summit gives Ankara "pretty much room to
capitalize on" and hoped the U.S. is prepared to encourage Turkey
to go in that direction.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus is included in the first batch of countries with which
the EU opened accession negotiations on March 31. This deeply
disturbed Turkish Cypriots, who refused to resume peace
negotiations unless their breakaway state, unilaterally declared
in 1983 in northern Cyprus and recognized only by Turkey, is
regarded as a sovereign entity.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of
the island following a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman expressed hope that international
efforts would help bring about a change to enable a new round of
negotiations to begin and a solution to be reached to the
long-standing problem.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no indication so far that Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash has moved from his intransigent positions,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Party Adopts Abacha as Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nigeria Congress Party
(UNCP), the country's largest political parties, Thursday adopted
General Sani Abacha, the head of state, as its sole candidate for
the forthcoming presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Some two hours after the party's national convention began
Thursday morning in Kaduna, an industrial base in northern
Nigeria, party delegates from across the country agreed
unanimously the normination of General Abacha, said a report from
the north.
</P>
<P>
"General Abacha is invited and should be invited to contest
the fundamental presidential election in Nigeria as a member of
the United Nigeria Congress Party as its sole candidate," a party
leader announced at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
UNCP is the first among Nigeria's five political parties to
produce its candidate for the August 1 presidential polls, the
last step of the military's three-year transition to civil rule
program scheduled for ending October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The other four parties are expected to hold their national
conventions to norminate flagbearers in the next couple of days.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the UNCP convention, according to observers,
just came to confirm reported plans of the party to adopt Abacha
whether the head of state still holds his military title.
</P>
<P>
Only Wednesday, UNCP National Chairman Alhaji Isa Mohammed
reportedly said the national convetion would mainly deal with the
issue of adopting Abacha as its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
There also have been reports that the other four parties are
keen on doing the same.
</P>
<P>
A joint meeting of the five political parties was held earlier
to discuss whether to adopt Abacha as their consensus candidate
for the presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
As the crucial election is approaching, pressure has been
mounting throughout the country demanding the head of state to
contest the election, amidst allegations that these pressure
groups are backed by the government.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, tens of thousands of Abacha supporters held
a successful rally in the capital Abuja to call on Abacha to
contest, while another anti-Abacha gathering in Lagos was
dispersed by police who claimed the rally was not approved.
</P>
<P>
The second pro-Abacha rally took place in the western city of
Ibadan on Wednesday ended with the death of three people when
police and pro-democracy activists went into violent clashes.
</P>
<P>
Abacha's supporters have said earlier that they will hold
rallies to ask the head of state to contest in every major cities
of the country before he announces his intention.
</P>
<P>
UNCP is the largest political party in Nigeria which has won
victories in the elections of local government councils and state
assemblies.
</P>
<P>
Since UNCP has decided to adopt Abacha as its presidential
candidate, the other four parties are expected to follow suit,
observers said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Proposes Measures on Preventing Conflict, Assisting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- UN secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Thursday recommended to the Security Council of the
United Nations measures on preventing conflict and assisting
economic development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The key recommendations of the Secretary-General include the
following:
</P>
<P>
On arms and arms trafficking:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Member states should pass laws enabling
prosecution in national courts of violations of Security Council
arms embargoes.
</P>
<P>
-- The Security Council should urgently consider how the United
Nations might help compile,track and publicize information on
arms and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
-- African Governments should reduce purchases of arms and
munitions to 1.5 percent of gross national product, and maintain
zero-growth on defense budgets for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
On sanctions:
</P>
<P>
-- Economic sanctions are too often a blunt instrument, and
should be better targeted, for example, by freezing the assets of
decision makers, their organizations and their families and
through restrictions on travel.
</P>
<P>
-- Combatants should be held financially liable to their
victims under international law, where civilians have been
deliberately targeted; international legal machinery should be
developed to help find and seize the assets of the transgressors.
</P>
<P>
On refugees:
</P>
<P>
-- An international mechanism should be established to help
host Governments maintain the security and neutrality of refugee
camps. Such camps should be located away from borders; combatants
should be separated from genuine refugees.
</P>
<P>
On structural adjustment:
</P>
<P>
-- The Bretton Woods institutions should consider providing
"peace-friendly" structural adjustment programs.
</P>
<P>
-- Conditionalities must not be antithetical to a peace
process; donors should not cut off funds from a week government
making good-faith, popularly supported efforts to implement peace
agreements.
</P>
<P>
-- Aid should be restructured to focus on high-impact areas and
to reduce dependency.
</P>
<P>
-- Donors should strive to ensure that at least 50 percent of
their aid to Africa is spent in Africa.
</P>
<P>
-- New sources of funding are required from donor countries.
</P>
<P>
On debt and trade:
</P>
<P>
-- The scope of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries initiative
of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund should be
greatly expanded, since only four African countries have so far
met its conditions.
</P>
<P>
-- All credits should convert into grants to all remaining
official bilateral debt of the poorest African countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Creditors should consider clearing the entire debt stock of
the poorest African countries.
</P>
<P>
-- The next summit of the group of 8 industrialized countries
should consider eliminating trade barriers to African products.
</P>
<P>
On the Security Council:
</P>
<P>
-- The Security Council should meet every two years at
ministerial level to assess efforts undertaken and actions needed
to support peace and development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
-- The Council should consider convening, within five years, a
summit-level session for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
On international business practices:
</P>
<P>
-- Countries implementing the convention combating bribery of
Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions
should set a timetable for early enactment of national
legislation.
</P>
<P>
-- The Organization of African Union should draw up by the year
2000 an African convention on the conduct of public officials and
the transparency of public administration.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Dissolve Duma if PM Nominee Refused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Russian president must
dissolve the State Duma (the lower house of parliament), if it
turns down his candidacy of Sergei Kiriyenko as prime minister,
chairman of the Constitutional Court Marat Baglai said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted Baglai as saying, under the
Russian Constitution, the dissolution of parliament is not a duty
but an imperative for the president. Yeltsin will certainly do so,
the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Baglai stated that any early election would be held strictly in
line with the old legislation. The procedure to amend the
Constitution does not depend on the opinion of one person, even
the head of state, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma on Wednesday passed a document challenging the
Constitution on president's right to nomination.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the second vote for his candidacy of Kiriyenko to
premiership, Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday made
several long telephone calls to leaders of Duma factions,
according to presidential press secretary Serge Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin had particular talks with head of the "Our Home is
Russia" faction, the president's spokesman said, but declined to
give details.
</P>
<P>
Other report said Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov on Thursday
stated after a meeting with Kiriyenko that Communists have decided
not to support the Kiriyenko's candidature on Friday. "It is
necessary to advance an experienced and politically mature
candidate," Zyuganov said.
</P>
<P>
On his meeting with the PM candidate Zyuganov said that there is
nothing new in principle from Kiriyenko, and therefore "for the
time being we are not ready to back him".
</P>
<P>
However, Chairman of State Duma Gennady Seleznyov on Thursday
confirmed his determination to save the lower house from being
dissolved. "I view a dissolution of the Duma as a 'dissolution of
Russia', and therefore I believe that the State Duma should be in
office during its entire constitutional period," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Jordan's King Hussein met unexpectedly near their
border on Thursday and discussed ways of breaking the impasse of
the Middle east peace process.
</P>
<P>
The previously-unannounced meeting took place in a hotel in
Israel's Red Sea resort of Eilat near the border with Jordan,
where Netanyahu has been vocationing. Hussein was reportedly
chairing a cabinet meeting in Jordan's Red Sea resort of Aqaba,
just a few kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's advisor David Bar-Illan told the Israel Radio the
two leaders took up the issue of the peace process, but he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
This was the first meeting between the two leaders since
Israel's failed assassination attempt of Hamas (Islamic Resistance
Movement) leader Khaled Mashaal in Amman last September. The
operation angered Hussein who ordered a suspension of security
cooperation with the Jewish neighbor.
</P>
<P>
But ties have picked up since Danny Yatom, head of Israel's
state intelligence and spy agency Mossad, who had ordered the
operation, resigned last month.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic activities on the Israeli-Palestinian track are to
resume next week with the return to the region of the U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross, and a tour by British Prime Minister Tony
Blair.

technicians with the medical team.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles have been equipped with laboratory, X-ray machine and
dispensary, Garcia said, adding that they offer services in

<HEADLINE> Police Confirms Japanese Terrorist in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot police on Thursday
confirmed reports that a leading member of the Japanese doomsday
cult, responsible for killing 12 people and poisoning thousands of
others in a gas attack in Tokyo in 1995, is in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Glafcos Xenos told reporters that Toshiyasu
Ouchi arrived here on March 12 from Russia, where he had been
planning terrorist activities since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the International Criminal Police Commission
(Interpol) has informed the Cypriot authorities of Ouchi at the
request of Japanese police. Cypriot police are cooperating closely
with the Japanese authorities, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that there is no extradition agreement between
Cyprus and Japan, and for this reason, Cypriot police are trying
to find "alternative measures of dealing with the matter."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also noted that police are taking all necessary
measures to make sure that Ouchi will not cross into the northern
part of Cyprus controlled by Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the cult has around 2,000 followers and 20
branches across Japan. Its leader, Shoko Asahara, is currently on
trial for 17 charges, including murder stemming from the subway gas
attack.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Shell Moves to Stop Gas Flaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Shell Petroleum Development
Company of Nigeria has announced a major move toward ending
associated gas flaring in its areas of operation in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
A Shell statement issued Wednesday said that the company,
which takes about 60 percent of oil production in the west
African country, has signed a 6-million-U.S.-Dollar joint venture
contract with an Italian firm to this effect.
</P>
<P>
The contract, signed with Nouvo Pignone of Italy on behalf of
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Elf and Agip, two
big-name foreign oil companies, is aimed at fabricating three
modules at the Odidi Associated Gas Gathering Project in the
Niger Delta, southern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The project, launched in 1996, will involve the collection of
80 million standard cubic feet per day (scf/d) of associated gas
currently flared from five oil stations.
</P>
<P>
The gas will then be transported via a low pressure pipeline
system to a central processing facility to be compressed and
conditioned to sales specification.
</P>
<P>
The project, scheduled to be commissioned in the year 2000,
is one of several specifically designed to eliminate
gas flaring from Shell's operations by 2008.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Shell flares about one billion scf/d of gas from
its operations, representing about half of the gas flared by the
oil industry in Nigeria and an energy equivalent of some 180,000
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Africa's leading oil producer and exporter, also has
rich natural gas resources. But lack of utilization has led to
waste and environmental pollution through gas flaring.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the use of natural gas, the Nigerian government
has, in this year's budget, decided to reduce the company levy on
enterprises utilizing natural gas from 35 percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government has also increased the penalty on gas flaring
by 20 times.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The South African Foreign
Department Thursday confirmed that a South African pilot, Roby
Byrd, has been abducted in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"Unidentified armed elements surrounded the passengers and
crew and abducted 10 people, including the South African pilot,"
the department spokesman said in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
announced that a South African pilot, Roby Byrd, was this week
abducted along with a group of foreigners by renegade Somali
clansmen.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted ICRC spokesman Jose
Anselmo as saying that efforts to secure their release were
underway.
</P>
<P>
"We have no direct contact with them, but we do know that they
are being kept in good conditions," Anselmo said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he had no further details about Byrd, who
was flying a King Air beechcraft chartered by the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has had no central government since the civil war
began in 1991 when the country disintegrated into a fiefdom of
warring clans. Kidnapings of aid workers were not unusual in Somalia.

<HEADLINE> International Conference on NATO Held in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Russian speakers had their own
view of NATO's expansion, believing the expansion is not directed
against any specific country, the State Duma press service
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, at an international
conference devoted to European security and NATO held here on
Thursday representative from the German parliament Heinrich Lummer
said NATO's eastward expansion does not imply confrontation with
Russia, as the world will result in redistribution of power.
</P>
<P>
Lummer, member of the Foreign Relations Committee in the
German parliament, noted that joining NATO would be the dreams of
numerous countries that are coming true. He asked rhetorically
"Why did Russia fail to convince its former Warsaw Pact allies not
to join NATO?"
</P>
<P>
At the conference entitled A New Architecture of European
Security and NATO, Jan Peterson, Norway, chairman of the North
Atlantic Assembly's Political Committee, said that Russia has no
right to ban the expansion of NATO which is designed to counter
potential sources of instability.
</P>
<P>
Russian deputy foreign minister, for his part, noted that what
is especially alarming is that certain countries call for revision
of the Russia-NATO Act's provisions on the nonstationing of
nuclear weapons or large NATO units in new members of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The alliance chose "the fallacious policy of expansion" to
justify its existence, and "attempts at making NATO the core of
security would imply militarization of Europe", Valery Manilov,
first deputy chief of the General Staff of Russian Armed forces,
noted.

NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Executive Director of the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Carol Bellamy is scheduled to
arrive here Friday on a five-day visit to Kenya, Somalia and
Southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here Thursday by UNICEF regional office
said that she would review UNICEF's humanitarian activities in
the three east African countries.
</P>
<P>
During her visit, the UNICEF boss will discuss with local
leaders a series of issues including the demobilization of child
soldiers and the humanitarian aid access to children and women
caught in the cross fire of civil conflicts.
</P>
<P>
She is scheduled to visit Garissa and Lokichoggio in Kenya and
Barbera in Somalia and to confer with Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi and other top government officials.
</P>
<P>
During her stay in Kenya, Bellamy will launch a Private Sector
Fund-Raising Initiative on behalf of children in need of special
protection, which is a nationwide drive to address the plight of
seriously disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Wednesday in the United Nations, Bellamy
said that UNICEF wants to declare recruiting children into
armies, sending them into combat zones or forcing them into
prostitution a war crime.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 250,000 children under the age of 18 are
estimated to be involved in wars around the world, she noted,
adding that "to allow this to continue would constitute a
complete violation of child rights."
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that inducing children under 18 years of age
into prostitution should also be on the list of war crimes, along
with murder, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence.

WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin warned Thursday that Asia's full recovery from the financial
turmoil cannot be achieved unless Japan does more to pull its
economy from recession.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the welcome signs of stability now emerging (in Asia)
... we must guard against complacency," he told the Interim

</P>
<P>
The committee, the fund's policy-setting institution, opened a
one-day session, focusing on the financial crisis in Asia and
Japan's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the world's second largest economy, accounts for more
than half of Asia's output, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that Japan "must generate substantial growth to help
maintain a growing world economy and to absorb a growing share of
imports from emerging markets."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan will make a 11-day 8-country official visit to Africa
in May to explain his ideas about peace and development promotion
in the continent, his spokesman announced here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came shortly after Annan submitted his 21-page
report on the subjet to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
In the report which was made in response to the Council's
request at its ministerial session last September and will be
debated at a session on April 24, Annan analyzed the causes of
African conflict and made recommendations on peacekeeping and
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
During his tour of Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda,
Burundi, Uganda and Eritrea from April 29 to May 10, he will talk
to regional leaders about his ideas of his report, spokesman Fred
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Besides calling on U.N. member states to take measures to check
arms flows to Africa, to eliminate trade barriers and ease debt
burden of African countries, the report also urges regional states
to maintain zero growth on defense budgets and reduce arms
purchases.
</P>
<P>
Matters Annan will discuss include good government, economic
regulations which would encourage private investment and regional
peacekeeping such as the formation and going into action of a
regional peacekeeping team, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"In Rwanda and Burundi, there is on-going conflict, what he is
going to be talking to the leaders about would be ways to share
power in order to defuse the conflict," he added.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Bring Cyprus Issue to Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia is continuing efforts for
a U.N. Security Council discussion on the protracted Cyprus issue,
Russian ambassador to Cyprus Georgi Mouradov said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nouradov, who had met with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
and Speaker of the House of Representatives Spyros Kyprianou, told
reporters that Russian proposed such a discussion with the aim of
promoting a resolution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
He pledged Russian support for a settlement based on U.N.
resolutions and the two agreements reached between the Greek and
Turkish communities in 1977 and 1979 that call for establishing a
bizonal and bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's position is that all efforts must be made under the
aegis of the Security Council and between its permanent members,"
Mouradov added.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council must reaffirm that negotiations for a
settlement in Cyprus should take place between the two
communities, and must reinforce the good offices mission of the
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his special advisor for
Cyprus, Diego Cordovez.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has demanded peace talks
be held between "two states," meaning his breakaway state, the
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" unilaterally declared in
1983, should be recognized.
</P>
<P>
Mouradov supported Cyprus' right to its defenses, saying he
sees no possibility of a war breaking out because of Cypriot
government's decision to deploy Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air
missile system later this year.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government purchased the missiles early last
year. Turkey has threatened pre-emptive strikes if they are to be
deployed on the eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkey landed its troops and took over 37
percent of the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in
Nicosia.

CAIRO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Representatives for the families of
the British victims of a Pan Am jet blown up over Scotland left
for Tripoli on Thursday to present a plan on ending the crisis
over the trial of two Libyans suspected in the blast.
</P>
<P>
Jim Swire, who represents the British victims, told reporters
that he is carrying a proposal to Libya on bringing the suspects
to trial before an international panel of five judges presided
over by a Scottish judge in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
London and Washington insist that the suspects be tried either
in Britain or the United States. But Libya, fearing that its
citizens will not get fair trial in the two countries, has refused
to hand over the suspects.
</P>
<P>
The 1988 bombing of the U.S. Pan Am flight killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Robert Black, the lawyer of the families of the victims, said
the current political atmosphere in Britain is suitable for
putting pressure on the British government to be flexible in its
stances.
</P>
<P>
He warned against the possibility of an explosion of situation
unless a compromise is reached during this year to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Swire and Black held talks on Wednesday with Arab League
Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid on the issue.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Abdel-Meguid told a news conference that there
is a "serious dialog that has started and I certainly appreciate
it."
</P>

"But the decision has to come from our brothers in Libya. This
(the proposal) will be communicated to them. Our objective is
truth and justice and respect of Libya's sovereignty and dignity,"

second expert-level meeting ahead of establishing a peace-keeping
multi-national force in South-Eastern Europe, chief of Romanian
General Staff, division-general Constantin Degeratu said in a

Degeratu said the meeting, now under way, was largely a
military one, gathering military experts and also diplomats in the
foreign ministries from states seeking to join the force, Albania,
Bulgaria, Greece, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey
and Romania, participating are also observers from Italy and the
United States, said Degeratu. Slovenia, which had voiced special
interest in participating in the meeting, could not attend due to
circumstances beyond control.

ADDIS ABABA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), has
discussed with some African ambassadors the situation in the
Comoros, an OAU press release said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The release said that ambassadors from Kenya, Madagascar,
Mauritius, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and
Burkina Faso attended the meeting Wednesday which reviewed the
situation in the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
They reviewed the Comoros situation in light of the recent OAU
ministerial delegation to the archipelago and the latest meeting
at the ambassadorial level of the OAU's central organ held on
April 1, which appealed to the neighbors of the Comoros to
consider all possible options that would ensure the preservation
of its unity and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, concern was reiterated over the
intransigence and lack of cooperation shown by the Anjouan
separatists despite the continued efforts made by the OAU to find
a peaceful and lasting solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassadors stressed the importance to preserve the unity
and territorial integrity of the Comoros and address the genuine
socio-economic and institutional problems of all the islands.
</P>
<P>
It was observed that consultations were going-on on the
measures to be taken to put an end to the crisis within the
context of the mission report of the ministerial delegation to
the Comoros, the press release added.
</P>
<P>
Anjouan and Moheli, which along with Grand Comore won
statehood from France as the Federal Islamic Republic of the
Comoros in 1975, broke away a year ago complaining of neglect by
the central government.
</P>
<P>
Anjouan secessionists said they would still reject any OAU
effort to reintegrate Anjouan with Grand Comore and help Moroni
authorities "reduce our people to slaves."
</P>
<P>
The OAU ministerial delegation visited the Comoros from March
18 to 20.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief On Lessons of Peacekeeping in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (xinhua) -- The United Nations
peacekeeping in Africa could achieve much if "deployed with a
credible deterrent capacity, equipped with appropriate resources
and backed by sufficient political will", UN Secretary-General
kofi Annan stressed on Thursday in his report on Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Annan said the credibility of the United Nations
in Africa to a great extent depends on the international
comminity's willingness to act and to explore new means of
advancing the objects of peace and security on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said it is important that the United
Nations experience in Africa re-examined and lessons extracted can
guide it for the future.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said the international community's perception of
peacekeeping has been greatly shaped by the United Nations
experience in Somalia, with the memories of that operation
continuing to hobble the United Nations capacity to respond
swiftly and decisively to crises.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the United Nations Operation in Somalia was the
first United Nations operation to be withdrawn by the Security
Council before completing its mission.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said hundreds of thousands of lives were
lost in the course of the genocide in Rwanda that was perpetrated
in full view of the international community. That experience
highlighted the crucial importance of swift intervention in a
conflict and of political will to act in the face of a
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said the horrifying suffering of the Rwandan
people sends the clear and unmistakable message that the
international community must never again tolerate such inaction.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the United Nations experience in Mozambique showed
that in the right circumstances, peacekeeping operation can offer
a flexible and uniquely adapted means to confront conflict in
Africa. Its success testifies to the contribution that the United
Nations can make as an impartial and legitimate actor for peace.
It also indicates the Organization's potential to strengthen and
direct international engagement within a conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said the successive United Nations deployments in Angola
have shown the vital role that can be played by a United Nations
operations sustaining a peace process in even the most adverse
circumstances, but they also indicated the crucial need for
realistic peace agreements, and the importance of having a
credible deterrent capacity within a peacekeeping operation in
situations that remain dangerous and volatile.

<P>
He further expressed Zambia's determination to overcome its

</P>
<P>
Zambia, Chiluba said, is willing to learn from other

<HEADLINE> Russia Seeks for US Help in Teaching Latvia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Ministry on
Thursday expressed hope that the United States will help to
improve Latvia's human rights, the Intar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the ministry Valery Nesterushkin said Moscow hopes
that the bilateral contract between Washington and Riga will once
again help convince Latvian representatives that humanitarian
problems in their country concern not only Moscow, but also a
majority of the world's capitals.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has repeatedly attracted the attention of U.S. diplomats
to the fact that many social and economic problems facing a
considerable part of the Latvian Russian-speaking population
remain unsolved, Nesterushkin said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that in view of the activity of U.S.
diplomats in the field of human rights protection, Russia hopes
that their authority and influence will be respected everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on possible changes to Latvia's law on citizenship,
the Russian spokesman said that it was undoubtedly a step in the
right direction, though made with delay.
</P>
<P>
The changes to the law call for granting Latvian citizenship to
children born in Latvia after August 21, 1991, when the Baltic
country announced independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to another report, Latvian president
Guntis Ulmanis admitted that a political crisis has taken place in
the country due to deterioration of the relations with Russia and
other countries. "We have provoked general criticism", the
president said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Lithuania and Estone!h}wxwZ{+_+ support
Latvia in the relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian acting prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko last Thursday
said the government had prepared a number of economic sanctions
against Latvia for its "discrimination" against ethnic Russians.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries have become tense since
early March when Latvian police forcefully dispersed a
Russian-speaking rally in Riga, the capital of Latvia.

<HEADLINE> Rubin: Japan's Economic Growth Key to Asia Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Full recovery in financially
troubled Asia cannot be achieved without Japan's efforts to pull
its economy from recession, warned U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the welcome signs of stability now emerging (in
Asia)... we must guard against complacency," Rubin told the
Interim Committee, a policy-setting committee of the 182-nation
International Monetary Fund, which is holding its 50th meeting in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Japan, the world's second largest economy, accounts
for more than half of Asia's output. It "must generate substantial
growth to help maintain a growing world economy and to absorb a
growing share of imports from emerging markets."
</P>
<P>
He also urged nations, such as South Korea, Thailand and
Indonesia, whose financial systems have been rescued with more
than 100 billion U.S. dollars from the IMF, to stick to their
reform programs.
</P>
<P>
British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said that the
IMF must be modernized to keep up with fast-changing economic
markets.
</P>
<P>
Brown said the agency needed to be more forceful in exposing
risky economic practices of member countries and should also
establish an outside unit of experts to audit its performance.
</P>
<P>
IMF discussions were held following a meeting Tuesday of the
Group of Seven industrial countries -- Japan, Germany, Britain,
France, Canada and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 said in a statement that the challenges facing Japan
are serious and have intensified in recent months and urged Japan
to "implement quickly a strong program" of economic stimulus.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 indicated their support of Japan's effort to protect
its currency from excessive depreciation.

<HEADLINE> Resolution on ACP-EU Ties Approved in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's parliament, the
House of People's Representatives, Thursday approved a resolution
on relations between African, Caribbean and Pacific countries
(ACP) and the European Union (EU) beyond the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the resolution
recognizes the contribution of the Lome Convention to the
economic, political, social and cultural development of ACP and
observes that the future ACP-EU cooperation constitutes one of
the effective and coherent frameworks for facilitating the
achievement of the ACP's socio-economic development projects.
</P>
<P>
Although there are certain groups rejecting the necessity of
the Lome Convention after the establishment of the World Trade
Organization, Speaker of the House Dawit Yohannes noted that "We
are on the side of those groups which support the continuation of
the Lome Convention."
</P>
<P>
The resolution on the ACP-EU relations will be submitted to
the ACP-European Parliament Joint Forum at Port Louis, Mauritius
scheduled on April 19 to 23.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the House Thursday also approved a resolution on
issues of debt cancellation and rescheduling.
</P>
<P>
Africa's economic performance has for long been very sluggish
due to political instability, ethnic conflicts and the vagaries
of weather, said the resolution, adding that the international
community is expected to make a more flexible stance and to
ensure the availability of adequate resources to alleviate the
debt problem.

<HEADLINE> World Bank: Life in Developing Countries Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- People in the developing
countries are healthier, better fed and more educated than ever
before, but progress is uneven, according to World Bank's report
of key development facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
The report, World Development Indicators 1998, said that since
1970, people's living standards have risen dramatically. Life
expectancy has risen by 10 years, infant mortality has nearly
halved; food production has outpaced population growth; illiteracy
has dropped by a third and most children, and more girls, are
enrolled in primary school.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the period 1965-96, the world's
fastest-growing economy was Botswana with per capita income growth
of 9.2 percent, followed by South Korea and China with 7.3 percent
and 6.7 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The world bank predicts that growth in developing countries
will continue until the end of the century, rebounding from the
temporary setback of the Asian financial crisis, as long as key
reforms, mounted in response to the crisis, are successful.
</P>
<P>
Using both long-term and 1995-96 data on average annual growth
in GNP, and estimates of 1997 growth for 37 developing countries,
the bank said, low and middle-income countries significantly
exceeded their long-term growth rates in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
It noted, low-income countries grew at an average annual rate
of 8.0 percent in the year, compared to 5.3 percent from 1965-96.
For middle income countries, the rates were 3.7 percent in 1995-96
and 3.3 percent from 1965-96.
</P>
<P>
In Sub-Saharan Africa, annual growth averaged 2.7 percent from
1965-96, but increased to 4.8 percent in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates of 1997 economic performance for 37
selected developing countries show that the fastest-growing
economies were China (9.0 percent) and Argentina (7.8 percent).
The worst performance was in Bulgaria (-7.4 percent) and Morocco
(-2.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
The Bank noted that while some regions are making huge strides
in improving the quality of life for their inhabitants, others
still show high infant mortality, poor nutrition, illiteracy, and
too many people living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
It said, infant mortality rates in Sub-Saharan Africa are well
above those found in East Asia 25 years ago, and in South Asia,
gender disparities in education mean that many more boys attend
primary school than girls.
</P>
<P>
The report also listed the international community adopted
targets for improving the lives and the environment of people in
developing countries by 2015.
</P>
<P>
The goals includes: halving the numbers of people living in
extreme poverty, achieving universal primary education in all
countries, reducing infant and child mortality by two-thirds, and
maternal deaths by three-quarters, achieving gender equality in
primary and secondary education, providing universal access to
reproductive health services, and reversing current global and
national los of environmental resources.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the goals could be achieved with right
policies in the developing countries. But the donor countries and
international development agencies must support those developing
countries that show determination to meet the challenge of the new
goals.
</P>
<P>
The Bank said, international agencies must take the lead in
helping developing countries boost their ability to monitor their
progress in reducing infant and maternal deaths or ensuring better
access to primary schools for young girls.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Capital Markets Record Meager Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The increase of the Romanian
capital market in the first quarter of this year was a meager 5,3
percent, compared with the 93,2 percent increase recorded for the
same period of the last year when the country being considered one
of the most performing of the Eastern European emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
The overall performance of the Romanian economy triggered a
reserved attitude of the foreign investors, which could not be
compensated by domestic economics, financial analysts argue.
</P>
<P>
According to the local securities officials, a reorienting of
interests was evident at industrial sector level, The rising
sectors of the previous year - cement, building materials, oil and
energy, metals and steel, were superseded by electronics and
electrotechnics, civil engineering and services.
</P>
<P>
Despite optimism of some brokerage companies over the relaunch
of the capital market in Romania, the Director of the General
Investment Group Vlad Vasiliu says 1998 "is yet a year of
compromise".

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Construction Starts Decline in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. housing construction
dipped in March from a 10-year high the month before but still
remained comparatively strong, the Commerce Department reported
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The builders started construction of new housing units at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.59 million, down 2.8 percent
from February, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
It was the seventh consecutive month that new housing starts
exceeded 1.5 million, the longest growth in nearly 11 years.
Despite the decline in March, starts for the first three months of
this year were 9.9 percent higher than the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Single-family housing starts fell 2.4 percent in March to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.24 million. Apartment
building starts declined 3.8 percent to 352,000 units.
</P>
<P>
By region, starts dropped 29.7 percent in the Northeast to a
rate of 142,000. They slipped 7.1 percent in the Midwest to
338,000 and 1.1 percent in the South to 718,000, but picked up
14.3 percent to 392,000 in the West.
</P>
<P>
Housing permits, a leading indicator of future building plans
declined 2.5 percent to a rate of 1.58 million in March.
</P>
<P>
The trend was attributed to high consumer confidence and low
mortgage rates. Consumer confidence is near its highest level in
three decades because of the lowest inflation apart from food and
energy in more than 30 years and an unemployment rate near a
24-year low.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, mortgage rates, which is at just above 7 percent for
a 30-year, fixed-rate loan, haven't been substantially lower since
the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report released today, the Labor Department said
first-time claims for unemployment benefits plunged 22,000 last
week to 289,000, the best in nine months. The level may be
unnaturally low because of difficulties adjusting for reduced
activity during the Easter and Passover holidays. However, it
indicates strong demand for labor.

<HEADLINE> Annan on UN Peacekeeping Roles in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- In the right conditions,
United Nations peacekeeping operations can make the difference
between peace and war in Africa, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said on Thursday in his report on Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the UN Secretary-General, the UN peacekeeping
operations in Africa can play the roles as following:
</P>
<P>
-- Separating the protagonists and monitoring their conduct.
Operations of this type function on the basis of a limited
agreement or understanding between the parties. They monitor
ceasefires and by their presence enable combatants to pull back to
a safe distance from each other.
</P>
<P>
--Implementation of comprehensive settlements. In Africa, the
United Nations has deployed a number of complex, multidimensional
peacekeeping operations incorporating a wide range of civilian
elements. Where a comprehensive settlement to a conflict has been
reached, the deployment of a multidisciplinary peacekeeping
operation may well represent the best chance to establish peace
and build a foundation for lasting development.
</P>
<P>
-- Preventing deployment. Taking action in a timely manner is
critical. In Africa, it can make a major difference. Such a
deployment can prevent the type of miscalculations that can lead
to violent conflicts, allow time for grievances to be settled
through political channels, making it possible to strengthen
peace-building institutions and be a critical confidence-building
measure for peace.
</P>
<P>
-- Protecting humanitarian interests. Humanitarian actors have
worked with peacekeepers to negotiate access and defend
humanitarian principles. They endeavor to provide support to
civilian victims of war wherever they may be.

MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian acting prime minister
Sergei Kiriyenko Thursday expressed hope that the State Duma will
not be dissolved, and noted that there is no need for early
parliamentary elections, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko told reporters after meeting with representatives of
parliamentary groups earlier in the day that early parliamentary
elections "would be very bad for Russia and their price would be
not only expenses on the polls but also political instability."
</P>
<P>
According to the acting prime minister, at the meetings with
parliamentary representatives there were more proposals than
questions.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the coming second ballot on his candidacy in the
Duma, Kiriyenko said he would not like to estimate his chances of
being approved as prime minister. On April 17, when the Duma votes
on the issue for the second time, he would try to tell deputies
more about the government's newly prepared program, Kiriyenko
said.
</P>
<P>
In his view, all debates in the Duma are an iceberg, "what is
underneath the water is discussions which are serious, interesting
and important for the government," the premier nominee said.

<HEADLINE> Austrian FM Hopes Cyprus Peace Talks to Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Vice-Chancellor and
Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs, Wolfgang Schussel, Thursday
expressed the hope that the present deadlock in settling the
Cyprus problem will be removed.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a press conference after official
talks with his Cypriot counterpart, Ioannis Kasoulides, during
which they discussed the latest developments in Cyprus problem
and Cyprus' European Union (EU) course.
</P>
<P>
Schussel expressed strong support to U.N., U.S., British and
other efforts to settle the protracted Cyprus question, and
stressed the need for "new formulas to bring the two
communities together."
</P>
<P>
The Austrian minister said a Cyprus solution should be
based on U.N. Security Council resolutions and added it could
be possible to reach a bicommunal federal solution, with one
sovereign state and civil citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the present deadlock in the peace process
could be lifted and we will do our utmost to support the
possibilities of hope in the future," he reassured.
</P>
<P>
Schussel described U.N. efforts, European Union (EU) accession
talks with Cyprus and EU relations with Turkey as the three
factors that could facilitate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian official welcomed President Glafcos Clerides'
invitation to the Turkish Cypriot community to nominate
representatives in the Cyprus official team that will carry
out accession talks with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Schussel expressed the view that the door should be open
to Turkish Cypriots as long as the EU talks with Cyprus
are taking place.
</P>
<P>
"We want to have the unified island in the EU. This is
a common hope and we should do our utmost to facilitate this
possibility," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has turned down
the invitation and refused to join the Cypriot team for EU
accession talks.
</P>
<P>
He also refused to participate in peace negotiations for a
Cyprus settlement in protest against the EU's decision to have
membership talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Asked about EU relations with Turkey, the Austrian minister
said Turkey is eligible for membership and expressed hope that
conditions could be created so that Turkey "could enter in a
new strategy" with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Cypriot government decision to deploy
Russian-made S-300 missiles, Schussel said that during his talks
here he reiterated "the common concern of all EU member
states."
</P>
<P>
He added that they believe the deployment of the S-300s
could bring new threats, new tensions to the region, but said
the right of Cyprus to have a safe defense cannot be
disputed.
</P>
<P>
His Cypriot counterpart reiterated the Cypriot government's
position that if demilitarization is agreed by the other side or
if meaningful negotiations between the two sides are taking
place, it would not deploy the defense missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island
following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Schussel's two-day visit to the island comes only three
months before Austria takes over the rotating presidency of the
EU.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Chief in Control of S. Leone Internal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Col. Maxwell Kobe, the ECOMOG
commander in Sierra Leone, has been appointed by the Sierra
Leonean government to assume control of the country's internal
security, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the government announcement, a presidential
spokesman said since the Sierra Leonean army has become
discredited, the government has to give the crucial job to Col.
Kobe, who will have a second person to help.
</P>
<P>
He will be responsible to President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, the
commander-in-chief of the Sierra Leonean armed forces, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Col. Kobe led the west African peace keeping force (ECOMOG) to
drive the military junta out of the capital Freetown in
mid-February, paving the way for the reinstatement of Kabbah's
government ousted in the coup last May.
</P>
<P>
The troops under the Nigerian officer are now carrying out a
mopping up exercise to flush out the remnants of junta forces and
allied rebels in eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman denied speculations that the
appointment, announced Wednesday night, has something to do with
compensation to his contribution in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"What he is simply doing is helping us restructure our army
and advise us of the assistance we need in the guideline of
equipment for the new Sierra Leonean army," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that Col. Kobe is a very popular person whom
Sierra Leoneans are proud of and fond of, adding that "I believe
he will do a wonderful job for us."
</P>
<P>
As for the situation in the eastern diamond-rich areas of the
tiny west African country, where the junta forces and allied
rebels take as their last strongholds, the spokesman said with
the "very certificate ECOMOG presence there", the whole situation
will be resolved shortly.
</P>
<P>
The only two districts which remain under the control of the
junta force will shortly be liberated, he said, adding that the
government will not abandon the ordinary people there.
</P>
<P>
What the government is doing is for the interest of the
country to ensure that the whole country is to be liberated, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Hold Local Elections in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon announced on Thursday that
it will hold local elections in May, the first such elections
since 1963, the official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,662 members of 646 municipalities, 2,041 mayors
and 3,693 counselors in 1,282 towns and villages will be elected,
Lebanese Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the polls are set to take place on May 24, 31
and June 7.
</P>
<P>
Al-Murr said that 20,142 public servants will be assigned to
oversee the balloting in 10,071 polling stations across the
country except the Israeli-occupied south.
</P>
<P>
There are 80 municipalities and 150 towns in the border enclave
with an area of 1,200 square kilometers, where Israel set up a
self-styled security zone in 1985 with the claimed aim of
protecting its northern areas from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese Muslim guerrillas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Angola to Expand Capacity of Luanda Refinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government will
invest 10 million U.S. Dollars this year to expand the capacity
of Luanda Refinery in a bid to meet the increasing national needs
for energy, the Angola News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wouter Raemdonck, director of the Luanda Refinery, told the
press Thursday that the investment will be used in importing and
installing new equipment and raw materials, including a steam
boiler and equipment for a newly-built diesel powered plant.
</P>
<P>
The renewal of the equipment in the refinery, he said, is
aimed to promote production and make full use of the fuel. At
present, he added, the production capacity of the refinery is six
tons of crude oil per day merely.
</P>
<P>
Luanda Refinery, the only refinery in the country, was founded
over 30 years ago. With more new oil fields discovered in
Angola, which has brought the country's daily oil production from
600,000 barrels in 1996 to the current 750,000 barrels, the
refinery could hardly meet the national needs.
</P>
<P>
In addition to expanding the capacity of the Luanda Refinery,
the Angolan government is also plann to construct a new
refinery in Lobito, a coastal city in central Angola.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Top Opposition Not to Participate in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The National Resistance of
Mozambique (Renamo), the largest opposition in the country,
Thursday reiterated its stand that it will not participate in the
local elections scheduled on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Thursday is the deadline set by the National Election
Committee (CNE) for registration by parties which are willing to
contest in the elections. But as Agostinho Ussore, a Renamo
official revealed to the Mozambique News Agency, his party has
not registered since its demand has not been met.
</P>
<P>
Renamo has required that opposition parties including Renamo
be admitted to the Technical Secretariat of Election
Administration (STAE), before they participate in the elections.
</P>
<P>
But Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano has noted that STAE
is a government institution. There is no legal base for the
admission of parties into the institution, he said.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Renamo and the Ministry of State
Administration in this regard has proved fruitless so far.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other 15 opposition parties including the National
Movement of Mozambique also announced that they would not
participate in the elections, citing lack of funds for
inspections over the election process.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Manuel Tome, general secretary of the Mozambique
Liberation Front party, stressed Thursday that the elections will
take place even if there is only one party, his party, which has
registered.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania
signed an agreement on Thursday to coordinate their fight against
organized crimes, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after Suleyman Demirel, Petar
Stoyanov and Emil Constantinescu, presidents of the three
countries, held a one-day summit in Turkey's Mediterranean city of
Antalya.
</P>
<P>
The three Balkan nations made it clear that they will join
hands in combating drug trafficking, money laundering and illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
The judicial and police departments of the three countries will
set up an effective mechanism of cooperation in dealing with the
matters, the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the organized crimes have reached an alarming
level due to certain political and economic elements and the
special geographic location of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the three presidents also discussed the
possibility of jointly fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that a Balkan peace force should be formed
in a bid to cope with any unexpected and emergent situations in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The Antalya meeting marked another positive step in enhancing
relations of the three countries and will give an impetus to the
cooperation in the whole Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
A similar summit was convened in Bulgaria's coastal city of
Varna last October.

<P>
ANKARA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen members of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed on Thursday in Turkish
troops operations in the southeastern region, according to the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
This brought the number of PKK militants killed by government
troops over the past two days to 81.
</P>
<P>
Fighting erupted in the mountainous regions of the
southeastern provinces of Van, Sirnak and Siirt near the Iraqi
border, when Turkish warplanes bombarded PKK positions.
</P>
<P>
The positions are suspected to be used by the rebels, who have
been fighting a separatist war over the past 14 years, for spring
attacks against government targets.
</P>
<P>
The latest military operations by government troops started on
Tuesday in the border areas near Iraq in a bid to wipe out the
rebels there.
</P>
<P>
More than 35,000 soldiers, rebels and civilians were killed in
armed clashes since the Kurdish group launched the bloody war for

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Deployed in East to Keep Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
deployed army and police in the east of the country to control
the security situation there, Radio Uganda reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deployment is among measures taken in the wake of a
Security Council meeting chaired Thursday by Prime Minister Kintu
Musoke.
</P>
<P>
Musoke is to meet all members of parliament from the eastern
districts next Monday to discuss developments in the region and
measures the government has put in place to contain the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The government has established a cabinet-level fact-finding
commission to investigate the immediate causes of the incidents.
</P>
<P>
The trouble in the east started from April 4 when some members
of Karimojong, a Momad tribe living in the northeast of the
country, raided adjacent areas in the east where some of their
children were missing, and cattles were rustled. The raids spread
thereafter southward in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Karimojong men killed 20 people including five soldiers
and looted about a thousand cattle during last week alone, said
William Omaria, State Minister for Internal Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The government has pledged to take measures to restore order
and law in the east, to rescue abducted people, return looted
cattle to their lawful owners and compensate for the victims.

<HEADLINE> Botha's Trial Postponed to June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president P. W. Botha's trial on charges of defying a Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) subpoena was postponed Thursday
to June 1, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The postponement will enable his lawyers to access additional
documentation introduced by the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
But Botha complained about the delay, saying in a statement
that he found it unacceptable that the case was delayed as a
result of unsubstantiated allegations having been made.
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Ernst Penzhorn, told reporters that Botha wanted
to settle the case as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The only witness the court has called so far was TRC Executive
Secretary Paul van Zyl, who testified Thursday that more than
2,000 people claimed to have been tortured in police stations
around the country between 1980 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
In light of these allegations, the TRC wanted to question
Botha about whether torture was state policy or was tolerated by
his government.
</P>
<P>
TRC research indicated that incidents of torture increased
sharply when a state of emergency was declared in 1986. The TRC
wanted to ask if there was a correlation between the state of
emergency and torture, and whether there were safeguards to
prevent it, van Zyl said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted from the minutes of a former State Security Council
meeting at which Botha said he was convinced the brain behind the
unrest situation was to be found within the country and had to be
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
TRC Chairman Desmond Tutu is supposed to be the next witness
when the trial resumes in June, Penzhorn said.

<HEADLINE> Study: U.S. Leads World in Gun Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States has the
highest rate of gun deaths among the world's 36 richest nations, a
government study found.
</P>
<P>
The rate for gun deaths in 1994 was 14.24 per 100,000 people,
according to the study by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study used 1994 statistics supplied by the 36 countries. Of
the 88,649 gun deaths reported by all the countries, the United
States accounted for 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
The study found that Brazil ranked second with 12.95 deaths per
100,000, followed by Mexico with 12.69, Estonia with 12.26 and
Argentina with 8.93.
</P>
<P>
Japan, where very few people own guns, averages 124 gun-related
attacks a year, and at 0.05 death per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The study found that gun-related deaths were five to six times
higher in the Americas than in Europe or Australia and New Zealand
and 95 times higher than in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The study would not specify the reason of the death rates, but
other researchers said easy access to guns and society's
acceptance of violence are part of the problem in the United
States, the Associated Press noted.
</P>
<P>
"If you have a country saturated with guns -- available to
people when they are intoxicated, angry or depressed -- it's not
unusual guns will be used more often," said Rebecca Peters, a
Johns Hopkins University fellow specializing in gun violence.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there are about 190 million private guns
in the United States, nearly one per person.

ATHENS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece decided Thursday to

The decision was made at a meeting which was attended by Greek

</P>
<P>
According to the meeting, 1,300 new police officers will be
recruited.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, this country has seen a sharp increase of
violent crimes, including murders, arsons, robberies and bomb
explosions, and many Greeks blamed foreigners, especially illegal
immigrants for the crime surge.

LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe fell
and ended sharply lower Thursday, depressed by a weak opening on
Wall Street and Asian markets', especially Tokyo's, heavy losses
overnight.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE-100 index of leading shares had dived 100 points
by mid-afternoon before closing the session down 72.1 points or
1.19 percent at 6,002.0 points, undermined by big losses in UK
banking shares and a sharp fall on Wall Street amid weak overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
Lloyds TSB was hit by profit taking and bearish press comment,
while HSBC fell in response to Asian woes.
</P>
<P>
However, despite downward pressure from global markets, traders
reported a huge amount of money still pouring into the market,
saying Thursday's slump was only a temporary blip and the market
still felt pretty solid underneath.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 index closed 38.67 points or 1.00 percent
lower at 3,845.94, as losses trebling during the afternoon as Wall
Street dragged the market lower.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt finished at 5,324.14, down 64.33
points or 1.19 percent, as profit-taking set in amid thin trading

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian delegation arrived
here Thursday and began talks with the Sudanese government in a
bid to improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese-Egyptian talks are taking place in accordance with
directives given by Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak for normalizing ties between the two
countries, Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese and Egyptian governments should overcome the
differences between them and make efforts to solve the border
disputes caused by colonialism, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese foreign minister described the differences between
the two sides as "summer clouds which will soon be clear."
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the Sudanese government will cooperate with
the 16-member Egyptian delegation led by Ambassador Fouad Ahmed
Youssef.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been strained after
Egypt accused Sudan of involvement in an assassination attempt on
President Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 1995. Sudan denied
the charge.
</P>
<P>
Sudan later confiscated all Egyptian properties in the country,
including 120 guest houses, a university and 11 secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
Recently, ties between the two have began to improve. Sudanese
President al-Bashir instructed on March 14 to return the seized
properties to Egypt.

The Sudanese foreign minister held talks with Mubarak and his
Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa last month.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam Thursday met with Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafiq Hariri to review the ongoing contacts between the two sides
and the latest development of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that Khaddam and Hariri followed up the
outcome of the Syrian-Lebanese summit held on Monday to coordinate
their stances on Israeli offer to withdraw from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the two countries reiterated their rejection
of Israel's offer, insisting that the withdrawal be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided on April 1 to endorse the United Nations
Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for a unilateral
withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But meanwhile, the Jewish state said that it would not pull
back its troops unless security arrangements are made for the
border areas with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa
and his Lebanese counterpart Farez Boueiz held a meeting to
discuss the Middle East peace process and Israel's offer over the
issue of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Boueiz said that Israel is attempting to
obstruct the implementation of the U.N. resolution 425, rather
than abide by it.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's visit here was part Lebanon's diplomatic drive to
expound a joint Lebanese-Syrian plan to confront Israel's attempts.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese officials will visit Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia,
France and China as of next week to explain the Lebanese
stance.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Violence Up on TV Shows in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Prime-time television in the
United States is getting more violent, according to a new survey
issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of prime-time network and basic cable channel
programs shown in June 1997 contained violent scenes, compared
with about half of such programs in October 1994, researchers from
four universities found.
</P>
<P>
Across the entire broadcast and cable schedules, the share of
programs containing violence remained about the same, 61 percent,
over the 32-month period.
</P>
<P>
Pay cable networks televised the highest percentage of programs
with violent content, averaging 92 percent since 1994, the study
found.
</P>
<P>
The study, the largest of its kind, was commissioned by the
National Cable Television Association. It was based on a sample of
10,000 hours of programs on 23 channels, including cable and
broadcast, from October 1994 to June 1997.
</P>
<P>
But the researchers said that they did consider the context in
which violence occurs. Not all violence on TV is bad, researchers
said. Depictions that show the negative effects of violence are
good and socially responsible.
</P>
<P>
The study concluded that age-based TV ratings do not provide
adequate information about the presence of violent content in
shows.

<HEADLINE> Germany's SPD Crowns Schroeder as Chancellor Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany's main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) Friday formally elected Gerhard Schroeder
as its candidate to challenge Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the
national elections in September this year.
</P>
<P>
The nomination was confirmed by an overwhelming majority of 93
percent of the vote at a special SPD party congress in the eastern
German city of Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, the 54-year-old premier of the western German Lower
Saxony state, has emerged as the greatest hope for the leftist
SPD, which has been in opposition for 16 years, to defeat Kohl in
the national elections on September 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
Declaring "the Kohl era is over," Schroeder told the 515
delegates at the congress that the SPD was now ready to take over
the German leadership to face challenges in a new century.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to make job creation the top priority of a SPD-led
government and to take a pragmatic approach to address the
problems now faced by Germany.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder has been widely seen as the most dangerous SPD
challenger to Kohl since the 1980s because he has more chances to
win vital centrist votes much needed by Kohl's centre-right ruling
coalition. He has also been leading Kohl in popularity in almost
all opinion polls over the past one year.
</P>
<P>
As an active proponent of high-technology investments and a
former board member of Germany's largest carmaker Volkswagen AG,
Schroeder often says that he understands the challenges faced by
German businesses in global markets and pledges to undertake
reforms to improve Germany's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
And as one of five children raised by a war widow who earned a
living as a cleaning lady, Schroeder also says he wants to promote
social justice at a time when Germany faces a post-war record
unemployment of about 4.8 million people.
</P>
<P>
With Schroeder as the SPD chancellor candidate, German
commentators are now predicting a much harder re-election battle
for Kohl who is already the longest-serving European political
leader.

<HEADLINE> Specialists Address China's IPR Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April (Xinhua) -- China is playing an emerging role in
the global intellectual property rights protection, a US IPR
specialist said here today.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of patent area, we have been very happy with the
progress in China," Lois Boland, an official with the US Patent
and Trademark Office, said "we even got some anecdotal evidence
from our companies operating here in this respect."
</P>
<P>
"The new title of the China Patent Office into the State
Intellectual Property Office is a very good development because it
will not only influence greatly on patents of trademarks but also
seem to embrace copy right policy," said the professor of law at
George Washington University's National Law Center.
</P>
<P>
"The training center recently established by the Chinese side
is something many of us from the developed countries are very
jealous of," Boland said.
</P>
<P>
SIPO set up China Intellectual Property Training Center two
days ago to train senior IPR professionals for the country.
</P>
<P>
"People from all regions of China are able to have the training
there as well as in other countries, it will be a benefit to
China," said Boland, who had supported the PTO's efforts in the
US-Japan bilateral negotiations and Uruguay Round implementing
legislation.
</P>
<P>
"Although the whole legislative structure is good, we're going
to wait and see down the road as to how those laws are enforced in
China," Boland said.
</P>
<P>
"I've heard good reports at least in the patent area that
enforcement is going very well," she added.
</P>
<P>
In an interviewed with Xinhua, Gao Lulin, SIPO's Commissioner,
said, "China now has a world-leading and integrated legislative
system on IPR."
</P>

more than 20 years, we have been greatly appreciated by lots of
foreign countries and international groups because of our
achievements," he said, "They all regard China as a best worker
and enforcer in the field, even better than some developed
countries."
</P>

spur their IPR development but also produce a positive effect on
the world," Gao pointed out.

<P>
TIANJIN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Luo Shuangyin, former deputy
director of the Tianjin Taxation Consultation Office, was
sentenced to life imprisonment today for embezzling public funds
totalling 623,000 yuan and accepting bribes of over 400,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Luo, 44, abused his power and embezzled the public funds
between December 1996 to April 1997.
</P>
<P>
In November 1996, Luo demanded 400,000 yuan from a Tianjin
company to squash a tax evasion investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin No.2 Intermediate People's Court confirmed the
illegal activities and sentenced Luo to life imprisonment, in
addition to the deprivation of political rights for life and the
confiscation of personal belongings valued at 50,000 yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott have reasserted
a western demand for unconditional dialogue between Belgrade and
Kosovo-Albanian leaders with the participation of an international
mediator, the German foreign ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
During their Friday meeting in Bonn, Kinkel and Talbott
stressed that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had so far
failed to meet the demands made by the six-nation contact group at
their latest meeting on March 25 in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
According to the German foreign ministry, Kinkel and Talbott
had agreed that the contact group, consisting of Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States, would move to impose
new punitive measures on Belgrade if Milosevic still refused to
put forward a trustworthy offer for dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Being wary about foreign intervention in the Kosovo conflict,
the Yugoslav parliament decided earlier to hold a referendum on
whether to involve a third party in a political dialogue over the
future status of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Blair Urges N.Irish People to Approve Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Friday urged the people of Northern Ireland to approve the
peace agreement reached last Friday to end the 30-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said on BBC radio that the success of the historic peace
accord depended on the support of the people in the province. A
referendum on the agreement will be held in Northern Ireland and
the Irish Republic on May 22.
</P>
<P>
"You have got to decide that you are going to enter into this
architecture of peace, if you like, and make it work. If people do
that, it will work," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Blair fell short of asking people to vote "yes" in the
referendum, but said people must make up their own mind.
</P>
<P>
"What we put together was a design for the architecture of
peace. We haven't yet constructed the building. The design I think
is a good one," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"If one part of the building collapses, then the rest of it
will collapse. So it is either mutually assured success or
mutually assured destruction and that is the choice that people
have got to make," he added.
</P>
<P>
A British government spokesman said finance minister Gordon
Brown would visit the province ahead of the referendum and
announce an aid package to support the deal.

Brokers said Friday was a slow session and punters covered

<HEADLINE> WIPO Official Praises China's IPR Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved "tremendous
progress" in protecting the intellectual property rights over the
past two decades, said Francois Curchod, director-general of the
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) today.
</P>
<P>
"China has made tremendous progress since taking steps to open
to foreign countries," said Curchod. "China has also promulgated a
number of laws, including the Trademark Law and Intellectual Property
Rights Law.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua today, Curchod said, "We
are highly impressed with the fact that China has developed a very
good legislative system in IPR protection."
</P>
<P>
"The WIPO is very happy about China's contributions and
development. And China's intellectual property system was
nonexistent 20 years ago," said Curchod.
</P>
<P>
The nation has adopted trademark, patent and copy rights laws
as well as regulations on the protection of computer software and
the law against unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
Curchod expressed appreciation to the Chinese government's
efforts in enhancing the awareness of the general public on
intellectual property rights protection. He noted that "related
efforts are extremely difficult in a country as large as China."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "the recent establishment of the China
Intellectual Property Training Center represents another big step
forward."
</P>
<P>
The center will provide intellectual property rights training
for senior professionals. Furthermore, the center, as an important
base in both the country and the Asia-Pacific Region, will
collect the most elite academic works in the field.
</P>
<P>
"China has promoted a greater awareness of intellectual
property, and the WIPO intends to continue and enhance close
cooperation with the nation," said Curchod.
</P>
<P>
"China should tell the WIPO what it expects and we will
certainly respond positively to related requests."
</P>
<P>
The WIPO was founded in 1967 as part of an endeavor to enhance
IPR protection throughout the world. China joined the organization
and has since signed nine international cooperation treaties.

<HEADLINE> Angola Aims to Wipe out Polio By 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Deputy Minister of Health
Teresa Cohen said Friday that the government has planned to
inoculate three million children under five years old against
polio starting from August or September.
</P>
<P>
Three million children under age of five years in 164 towns
and cities of 18 provinces will be vaccinated in 1998, Cohen
announced here at a meeting reviewing the work in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
Angola aims to wipe out the infantile polio by the year of
2000, she said, adding that about 2.8 million and 2.6 million
children received vaccination in 1996 and 1997 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that with the support of the international
organizations and enterprises based in Angola, her government is
determinated to greatly reduce the number of the polio cases, but
there are still difficulties for the southern African country to
meet the target set by the World Health Organization of wiping
out polio before 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, in 80 percent of the areas formerly
controlled by the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, local governments have been reestablished, making
vaccination much easier.
</P>
<P>
Besides strongly pushing for vaccination, Cohen stressed the
need for health institutions to strengthen monitoring of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
But she said since there is no specialistic laboratory in
Angola, the samples have to be sent to South Africa for analysis.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Key Railway Begins in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The construction of a multi-track
railway linking Zhuzhou City, the industrial center of central
China's Hunan Province, and Liupanshui, the major coal production
base in south China, commenced today.
</P>
<P>
The railway will stretch 1,141.75 km, with plans calling for
the 617-km section in southwest China's Guizhou Province to be
completed within five years at an estimated cost of 17.1 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Completion of the railway will "benefit the exploitation of
abundant resources in the region," according to Teng Yuhe,
director of the Railway Bureau in Chengdu, capital of southwest
China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The central government will allocate half of the total
investment, with the remainder coming from bank loans, said Teng.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways recently announced that China will
invest 250 billion yuan in railway construction over the next five
years. Experts say the central government's efforts will ensure
sustained economic growth based on expanded infrastructure
construction.
</P>
<P>
The massive project will place priority on west China,
particularly southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Railways Sun Yongfu said that southwest China
remains as the bottleneck of the nation's railway network, a fact
which has hampered rapid economic growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
Plans for the next five years call for investments of over 68
billion yuan to either construct or improve some 20 medium- to
large-sized railway projects in southwest China, or some 31
percent of the total investment in the national railway
construction.
</P>
<P>
Completion of related projects will form railway network in
southwest China and will in turn reduce current stress on the
regional network.

<HEADLINE> Imperial City Walls Unearthed in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Two sections of the ancient
Imperial City Wall dating back over 600 years to the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644) were recently discovered in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The wall sections, which are separated by some 700 meters, were
discovered during ongoing construction work on Ping'an Avenue near
the Imperial Gardens in the Dongcheng District.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists and historians have also unearthed a 50-meter
section of the wall's foundation which was constructed with four
layers of ancient bricks.
</P>
<P>
Archeologist Su Tianjun pointed out that four separate walls
formed concentric squares surrounding the imperial capital of the
Ming Dynasty. The recently discovered sections were part of
nine-km northern side of the second wall which surrounded the
famous Forbidden City, or palace complex for the imperial family.
</P>
<P>
The area between the second wall and Forbidden City was
occupied by imperial offices for military departments and dynastic
organizations, said Sun, adding that residents living outside of
the second wall were prohibited from entering the office compound.
</P>
<P>
The discovery has further verified the location of the city's
outer walls and will provide clues for further studies of the
structure and architectural designing of the imperial city, said
Sun.
</P>
<P>
"Scholars are currently examining wall bricks bearing the
construction date and names of craftsmen to prove the exact age of
the city walls," according to Sun.

Administrative Region (HKSAR) attending a high-tech symposium in
the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>

scientists, businessmen and government officials.
</P>
<P>
Participants shared the view that it is the best option for
the two sides to establish complementary cooperation in high-tech
development on the basis of their unique advantages.

<HEADLINE> Reunified Cyprus Will Be There, Says President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides Friday expressed his confidence in seeing a reunification
of Cyprus and the ensuing resurrection in the east Mediterranean
island.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we have what it takes to achieve our objective, we
are sure that at the end of the day justice awaits us," the
president said in his Easter message.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the island's accession negotiations with the
European Union (EU), which began last month, "gives a fresh
impetus to our hopes and strengthens our faith in our
resurrection."
</P>
<P>
The president said that "Cyprus has been suffering for the past
24 years as a direct result of the Turkish invasion and
continuing occupation of part of its territory."
</P>
<P>
Clerides expressed the hope that "next year we shall celebrate
Easter in a united, peaceful and happy Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led international community has been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island as a bizonal, bicommunal
federation through peace talks, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.

The 3,800-meter long and 52-meter wide moat encircles the city
walls of the Summer Palace.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the original drainage system diverts both
rainwater and wastewater into the moat has created severe
pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
The project, scheduled to begin no later than May, will focus
on restructuring the drainage system.
</P>
<P>
The project will include the construction of seven drainage
channels stretching a total of 7,500 meters. The new channels will
divert wastewater to the Gaobei Sewage Treatment Plant in east
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Related departments will also build projects to clean
up surrounding areas.

<HEADLINE> Four Million Female Condoms Sold in Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Four million female condoms have
been sold in the developing world in the first quarter of 1998,
thanks to a United Nations initiative to encourage their use.
</P>
<P>
Countries with substantial sales this year have been South
Africa, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe, the Joint United Nations
Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The female condom, made of polyurethane, is a sheath that a
woman inserts into her vagina, which offers a new barrier method
of protection to couples.
</P>
<P>
The condom, while protecting against sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs), also acts as a contraceptive.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between UNAIDS and the Female Health
Company, of the United States, the sole manufacturer of the female
condom, it is priced at 25 percent lower than in the developed
world.
</P>
<P>
The growing interest in the female condom has prompted the
UNAIDS, in collaboration with the World Health Organization and
other partners, to organize a meeting in Pretoria, South Africa,
on April 20-22, to discuss ways of encouraging greater use in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Army Adopts High-Tech Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior officer with the
Headquarters of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army
(PLA) said here today that the focus of military training has
turned to the acquisition of knowledge and skills in the realm of
high technology.
</P>
<P>
The new direction represents an important move to improve the
quality of the army and will promote military modernization,
according to the officer in charge of military training.
</P>
<P>
He said that military training has changed over the decades
with significant growth from low to high standards and from the
former focus on a single branch of the army to the integration of
various branches.
</P>
<P>
Military training in the early days of the People's Republic of
China focused on cultivating sharpshooters and developing special
skills.
</P>
<P>
Decrees, regulations and teaching materials compiled and issued
during the 1960s centered on standardizing military training.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese army began placing priority on the combination of
various branches of the armed forces in the 1980s in order to
enhance the command capabilities of officers and the coordinated
combat capability of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
At present military training focuses on ensuring that both
officers and men grasp an understanding of high technology in
accordance with the prevailing situation, according to the officer.
</P>
<P>
He said the three-year program introduced in 1997 urged
military officers to gain a wide understanding of high
technology.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Highest Rate of Deaths from Firearms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States has the
highest rate of peacetime deaths from firearms in the world,
according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
Firearm-related deaths numbered 14.24 per 100,000, said the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) in a survey of
36 countries published Thursday in the International Journal of
Epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
Brazil had the second-highest firearm death rate, with 12.95
deaths per 100,000 population, followed by Mexico and Estonia,
which also had rates above 12 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Japan had the lowest rate, with 0.05 deaths per 100,000
population.
</P>
<P>
The countries in the survey reported a total of 88,649 firearm
deaths during the one-year survey period. In 1993, firearms were
involved in the deaths of 39,395 people in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the researchers said firearm mortality rates were five
to six times higher in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil
and Argentina, than in European and Oceanian nations.
</P>
<P>
The United States also had the highest proportion of
firearm-related suicides and the third-highest rate of accidental
firearm deaths.
</P>
<P>
Firearms were also involved in 71 percent of murders in the
United States, the third-highest rate.

<P>
BONN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott have reasserted
a demand for unconditional dialogue between Belgrade and
Kosovo-Albanian leaders with the participation of an international
mediator, the German foreign ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting in Bonn Friday, Kinkel and Talbott claimed
that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had so far failed to
meet the demands made by the six-nation Contact Group at its last
meeting on March 25 in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the Contact Group, consisting of Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States, would move
to impose new punitive measures on Belgrade if Milosevic still
refused to put forward a trustworthy offer for dialogue, the
foreign ministry added.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav parliament, wary of foreign intervention in the
Kosovo conflict, decided earlier to hold a referendum on whether
to involve a third party in a political dialogue over the future
status of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Germany's SPD Crowns Schroeder as Chancellor Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany's main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) has formally elected Gerhard Schroeder as
its candidate to challenge Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the national
elections in September.
</P>
<P>
The nomination was confirmed by an overwhelming majority of 93
percent of the vote at a special SPD party congress in the eastern
German city of Leipzig on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, the 54-year-old premier of the western German Lower
Saxony state, has emerged as the greatest hope for the leftist
SPD, which has been in opposition for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Declaring "the Kohl era is over," Schroeder told the 515
delegates at the congress that the SPD was now ready to take over
the German leadership to face challenges in a new century.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to make job creation the top priority of a SPD-led
government and to take a pragmatic approach to resolve the
problems facing Germany.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder has been widely seen as the most dangerous SPD
challenger to Kohl since the 1980s because he has more chance of
winning vital centrist votes, which are also much needed by Kohl's
center-right ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
He has also been leading Kohl in popularity in almost all
opinion polls over the past year.
</P>
<P>
As an active proponent of high-technology investments and a
former board member of Germany's largest carmaker Volkswagen AG,
Schroeder often says that he understands the challenges faced by
German businesses in global markets and pledges to undertake
reforms to improve Germany's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
And as one of the five children raised by a war widow who
earned a living as a cleaning lady, Schroeder also said he wanted
to promote social justice at a time when Germany faces a post-war
record unemployment rate of about 4.8 million people.
</P>
<P>
With Schroeder as the SPD candidate for chancellor, German
commentators are now predicting a much harder re-election battle
for Kohl who is already the longest-serving European political
leader.
</P>
<P>
The national elections are scheduled to be held on September
27.

deport a Japanese terrorist suspect, who was allegedly involved in
the 1995 deadly gas attack upon Tokyo subways, Cyprus News Agency

<HEADLINE> African Renaissance Offers Opportunities to Asia: Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said here Friday that Asians and Africans
must reach across the great geographical divide, to build a
partnership of mutual respect and a mutually beneficial
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon hosted by the Hong Kong Center of the
Asian Society and the South African Business Forum in Hong Kong,
Mbeki, who is on a two-day visit to Hong Kong, said that he
believed that Africa's renewal through its native-born Renaissance
presents an opportunity to Asia to benefit from Africa's enormous
economic potential.
</P>
<P>
"The Africa of today is an Africa of hope, a continent that has
resumed its journey out of the period of despair," said Mbeki in
his speech titled "African Renaissance -- Opportunities and
Challenges for Asia."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said that South Africa belongs to the regional
inter-state organization, the Southern African Development
Community, whose combined population is 140 million people.
</P>
<P>
The member countries of the SADC are involved in negotiations
to transform the sub-continent into a free trade area which would
further enhance the attractiveness of the countries of the region
as an investment destination and a base from which to reach into
the larger African market, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is an important center of the world economy, Mbeki
said. "We are greatly encouraged by the fact that the Hong Kong
Trade Development Council opened an office in South Africa as well
as the existence in Hong Kong of the South African Business
Forum," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"As the government of South Africa, we are keenly interested to
cooperate with these bodies to look for and exploit all ways and
means by which we can increase our economic cooperation," Mbeki
added.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki arrived in Hong Kong on Thursday from Seoul following his
visit to Japan and China's inland areas. He is traveling with his
wife and a party of 14 senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Thursday evening, Mbeki attended a dinner hosted by Tung Chee
Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) of China.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki called on the HKSAR Financial Secretary Donald Tsang
Friday morning. He will depart Hong Kong for Johannesburg Friday
evening.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Quits Old Way of Pricing Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's longtime official pricing
system on cotton has been abolished as the government has decided
to adopt an indirect control over the field.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, the government will only issue directive
prices for cotton and the market will play a bigger role in
pricing.
</P>
<P>
This reform has been undertaken because of difficulties in the
domestic cotton market, which became a buyer's market in recent
years, according to officials from the State Development and
Planning commission.
</P>
<P>
The officials disclosed that the government purchase prices for
cotton will also be lowered to cool down the enthusiasm of local
cotton growers.
</P>
<P>
The current government-set cotton prices reportedly are much
higher than those of imported cotton, while grain prices in the
local market have been plummeting.
</P>
<P>
As a result, local farmers have found it more profitable to
grow cotton than grain, which has led to a surplus cotton supply.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, the country produced 4.3 billion
kilograms (kg) of cotton in 1997, 100 million kg more than the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The price cut is expected to affect local cotton growers, but
it will benefit them in the long term, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Officials expressed their hope that the pricing reform will
reinvigorate the country's lingering cotton market and boost
exports. It will not affect the country's cotton production as a
whole, they said.

<HEADLINE> Red Tide Afflicts Pearl River Mouth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
province is suffering its most serious red tide in history, with
150 tons of fish killed in Shenzhen and 50 tons in Zhuhai, local
government officials revealed today.
</P>
<P>
The economic loss to Shenzhen, a special economic zone
neighboring Hong Kong, is estimated at 20 million yuan (2.4
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Red tides, which occur frequently in the sea near the Pearl
River estuary, is caused by the explosive breeding of seaweed and
other planktons which cover the surface of the ocean and stop
oxygen in the air from going into the sea water.
</P>
<P>
Fish suffocate because of an oxygen shortage or from seaweed
clogging their gills.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the Guangdong Provincial Department of Ocean and
Aquatic Products say the red tide normally occurs in May
and June. This year, it quickly spread to a large sea area and
lasted longer than previous years, they said. Sea areas near
Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Hong Kong are all seriously affected by the
red tide.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen are now fighting against the disaster day and night,
trying to save fish by such measures as adding oxygen.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has also sent experts to the
disaster-hit areas to monitor changes of the red tide and try to
resolve the crisis.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin On Economic Work (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
stressed that the country's leading task at present is to boost
economic development to ensure an 8 percent increase in this
year's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also Chinese president and chairman of the Central
Military Commission, said during an April 13-17 visit to Chongqing
Municipality that in accordance with the essence of the second
plenary session of the 15th CPC Central Committee, China will
build a socialist economy, politics and culture with Chinese
characteristics, in line with its national conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We must correctly handle relations between reforms,
development and stability," he told local officials and people.
</P>
<P>
The leader also emphasized the importance of arming the whole
Party with the Deng Xiaoping Theory and using the theory to guide
all kinds of work.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called for faster development of high-tech industries and
speeding up infrastructure construction in the sectors of
agriculture, water conservancy, transportation, telecommunications
and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We should expand domestic demand, explore the
domestic market, appropriately increase investment and consumption
demand, adjust the country's economic structure and improve our
economic efficiency."
</P>
<P>
He also called for efforts to expand China's existing
international market, open up a new global market, strive for a
steady increase in exports and maintain the stability of the value
of Chinese currency.
</P>
<P>
To attain this year's economic development goal, he noted, it
is imperative to push forward the restructuring of state-owned
enterprises, the reform of the financial system, and the
restructuring of government institutions.
</P>
<P>
He also asked governments at all levels to make a success of
the reform of the grain circulation system, the reform of the
urban housing system, the reform of the medical insurance system,
and the re-employment of laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the restructuring of state-owned
enterprises is a major task for this year's economic work
assigned by the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on governments at all levels to make greater
efforts to help most of the large- and medium-size state-owned
enterprises which are running in the red to overcome difficulties
in about three years.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao and Zhang Delin,
secretary of the Chongqing Municipal CPC Committee, Jiang visited
a number of companies in automotive manufacturing, iron
and steel, ceramic and other industrial businesses in Chongqing.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that employment, as a major issue that must
be a long-term concern, requires hard work to handle well because
China has a large population.
</P>
<P>
Re-directing laid-off workers and their re-employment is
essential not only to the success of the reform of state-owned
enterprises, but also to the country's social stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that reducing staff and increasing efficiency
must be conducted along with re-employment, and laying off workers
and re-directing the layoffs must be taken into consideration
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
He said the government encourages enterprises to tap their
potential to diversify their operations in order to generate more
jobs for their redundant employees, while it will vigorously
develop the service sector to provide more employment opportunities
for the laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
"We should encourage laid-off workers to establish their own
businesses or become self-employed," he told local officials.
</P>
<P>
Referring to agriculture, the leader said the country must
strengthen the farming sector as the foundation of the national
economy, while accelerating the development of the rural economy
and solving the problem of rural poverty by and large by the end
of the century.
</P>
<P>
Basic policies on the rural areas, such as extending the period
of land contracts and lightening farmers's financial burdens, must
be carried out to the letter, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, efforts should be made to improve farm
production conditions by accelerating construction of agricultural
infrastructure, while readjusting the rural industrial
structure in accordance with market demand.
</P>
<P>
He also called for redoubled efforts in poverty relief work,
consolidating grass-roots organizations, and promoting democracy,
the introduction of a legal system, and ethical and cultural
progress in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Jiang fully acknowledged the sound beginning of each piece of
work since the establishment of the Chongqing municipality a year
ago, saying the decision to establish the municipality was
entirely correct.
</P>
<P>
He asked officials and people in Chongqing to emancipate
their minds and work hard to turn the municipality into a new
modern city in the not too distant future.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Gillette Company Thursday
reported a 13.6-percent increase in its first-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
Gillette said it had a net income of 268 million U.S. dollars
in the first quarter of 1998, compared with 236 million dollars a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Sales for the first quarter of this year were 2.02 billion
dollars, up 1.5 percent over the 1.99 billion dollars registered
in the same period last year, the company added.
</P>
<P>
Alfred Zeien, chairman of Gillette, said the strong quarterly
results were achieved despite an aggressive inventory clearance
ahead of introduction of razors of next-generation, a new
triple-blade razor called Mach 3.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to have a very strong new products program this
year," Zeien said in a statement. "With more than 20 new products
scheduled for launch in 1998, we have significant potential to

<HEADLINE> China's Auto Industry Takes Downward Turn in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The output and sales of China's
automobiles dropped slightly in the first quarter of this year
compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the State Bureau of
Machinery Industry, Chinese manufacturers turned out 364,700
automobiles from January through March, 2.72 percent down from the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In this period, 355,500 automobiles were sold, a decrease of
1.54 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the auto industry said that the slump was due to a
usually sluggish season combined with a sharp decrease in orders
from governments.
</P>
<P>
Most institutions of the central government have canceled or
halted plans to buy business cars, because of the on-going
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
However, industrial analysts said that the trend of China's
auto market remained optimistic this year. They said that, though
output and sales were sharply down in January, they began to pick
up in February and reached the highest levels this year in
March. Production and sales of automobiles in March stood at
155,000 and 157,000, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mini passenger cars for household use defied the downward trend
of the auto industry by respectively registering 17-percent and
3.43-percent increases in sales and output over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 62,000 mini-cars were sold while 57,800 were
produced in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Auto experts said that this is another indication that growing
demand for private cars has become a stable driving force of the
industry.

MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
announced here Friday that it has approved a 450,000-U.S.-dollar
technical assistance grant for translating its documents from
English into some Asian languages.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here, the bank said that the assistance
will help executing agencies better understand ADB's operational
documents, support the flow of information between the ADB and
non-governmental organizations, and foster their involvement in
the consultations, designing and implementation of ADB projects.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the bank said, difficulties have been encountered
in project processing and implementation by executing agencies due
to the unavailability of relevant bank documents in local
languages.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is particularly serious in the case of projects
where community involvement and participatory development are a
crucial element for successful implementation," it said.
</P>
<P>
English is the working language of the Manila-based bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that translations will be implemented initially
on a two-year pilot basis in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China,
Indonesia, Kazakstan and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Based on the pilot phase, the assistance may be expanded to
other ADB members, it said.

LUANDA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Industrial Minister
Maneul Duque held talks with the visiting Congo (K) industrial
Minister Babi Mbayi here Thursday, deciding to strengthen
industrial cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Duque said that after the meeting, the first contact between

plans, the State-run radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda for cooperation, he said, are the building
of industrial management institutions, the construction of
industrial areas, the training of talents and some other
programs.

The two countries also planned to cooperate in the Southern
Africa Development Community (SADC) and the UN industrial

Mbayi declared after the meeting that coordination meetings
would be held in turns in the two countries to discuss issues
concerning the cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Renominates Kiriyenko as Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Friday officially renominated Sergei Kiriyenko as his candidate
for prime minister for a third round vote, shortly after his young
protege was rejected by the State Duma (the lower house of
parliament) for the second time.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko, plucked by Yeltsin from relative obscurity last
month to form a new government, mustered just 115 votes in the
450-seat State Duma, with 271 deputies voting against. Eleven
deputies abstained.
</P>
<P>
He needed 226 votes in the 450-seat chamber to secure his
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Kremlin officials said Yeltsin had prepared the necessary
papers to resubmit Kiriyenko's nomination for a decisive third
round next week.
</P>
<P>
If the Duma rejects Yeltsin's choice as premier three times,
the president can dissolve the Duma and call early elections.
</P>
<P>
Deputies rejected Kiriyenko's candidacy in the first attempt on
April 10. He gained 143 of the 226 votes needed.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president abruptly dismissed veteran Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin and the entire government on March 23, and
formally named Kiriyenko as his choice for prime minister on March
27.

<HEADLINE> Korea Talks Expected To End Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) - The first inter-Korean high-level
contact will reopen and conclude here Saturday, as the North has
indicated it would no longer participate even if there is no
progress after seven days of talks.
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow would be the last day we're at the Beijing talks,
even if both sides cannot reach agreement," said Chun Kum Chul,
chief delegate of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
There was no obvious progress in the talks, he said, adding the
South should not link an economic and humanitarian issue, the
fertilizer aid, to a political one, the reunion of separated
families.
</P>
<P>
The fertilizer aid is an urgent issue, as the spring planting
period is approaching and the DPRK has suffered three years of
floods and drought, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chun said the reunion issue can be discussed later at Red Cross
talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning China's recent aid of 100,000 tons of grain and
20,000 tons of chemical fertilizer to the DPRK, he said China has
given all this without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
Jeong Se Hyun, leader of the Republic of Korea (ROK)
delegation, reiterated at a news briefing this afternoon his
position that the North should agree to a timetable to help
reunite separated families in return for fertilizer aid from the
South.
</P>
<P>
The 200,000 tons of fertilizer that the ROK offers can be
delivered this year, but the fertilizer aid and reunion issues
must be discussed simultaneously at the current talks, he
stressed, adding what matters most is that the substance of the
matter be dealt with on a basis of reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
Jeong said he hoped for a change in the North's position, and
the North could change its stance at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
The North-South talks on the reunion issue started in 1971 and
continued until 1973 with some progress, but eventually came to

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government to Hand Over Control of Internet: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States government
will hand over control of the Internet to an independent global
board, a senior adviser to U.S. President Bill Clinton said here
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ira Magaziner, President Clinton's information technology
policy adviser, said one reason for U.S. distancing itself from
the Internet was to reduce the government's legal liability for
companies that operated from the Internet, originally set up by
the U.S. Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
"What we are looking to do is to turn over all the authorities
we have to a neutral, private, non-profit organization that would
have a fully international board of directors which would be
constructed in a way so that it could withstand legal challenges
and not have to depend on the authority of the U.S. government or
any other government," the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
Magaziner said the government wanted the new entity in place by
mid-year and expected it would be based in the U.S. at first.
</P>
<P>
The new entity's functions included allocating blocks of
numbers (currently done by the U.S.'s Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority), protocol directives, and allocating domain names,
those suffixes on Internet addresses such as .com, .org and .net.
said Magaziner, who is in Australia for the nation's first
electronic commerce meeting which ended on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ownership of the .com, .org and .net databases would be handed
over to the new organization, which would set policy for these and
new domain names, he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said whether the new entity, envisaged by the United
States, will be accepted by other countries, particularly the
European Union, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department published a program last February
aiming to transfer the management of the Internet to a private
business.
</P>
<P>
The program was later opposed by the European Union and
Australia, arguing the program would strengthen U.S.'s control
over the Internet.

MOSCOW, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian acting Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko told the State Duma (the lower house of
parliament) on Friday that his government's economic program
submitted to parliament last week has not changed.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian press, Kiriyenko addressed the plenary
session of the Duma before the deputies started the second round
of voting on his premiership.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko said the economic program had been updated in the

the center of attention at the consultations, and the numerous
steps outlined in the programs have already been taken.

restructuring of debts incurred by factories was signed on April
13.
</P>
<P>

measures to stop organized crimes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Software Industry Doing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's software industry has
entered a period of rapid growth, dominating many areas on the
domestic market and follow global trends, according to Shen Shibo,
with the China Software Industry Association (CSIA).
</P>
<P>
Shen told Xinhua that the industry has developed software to
meet the special needs of the Chinese customers. CSIA and its
2,000 members chooses outstanding Chinese software every year, and
selected 59 out of more than 200 entries this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that convenience and cost are the reasons they are
popular in China. Yongyou accounting management software, for
example, is regarded by Chinese users as one of top ten software
items. And, a regional computer banking system developed by
Beijing University has greatly improved banking services in
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
A Ministry of the Information Industry official says that
China's software industry took only ten years to go from
practically nowhere to developing all kinds of software. The
industry's strategy, he said, is to develop specialized software
by using mature and popular software systems of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese information technology giants like Stone and Hope have
already allocated funds for developing software that can be used
with Windows and Unix, Shen said, and this type of software
suggests a huge Chinese software market.
</P>
<P>
China's software has had double-digit growth over the past few
years. In 1997, total software sales were 11.2 billion yuan (1.4
billion US dollars), more than 20 percent more than in
1996. Chinese software sales totaled 150 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Software for the insurance business, to take another example,
is relatively scarce, Shen says, meaning that software has great
potential in this area.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Loses Five Billion Dollars to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria loses about five billion
U.S. Dollars annualy, an equivalent of the country's annual
budget, to environmental degradation, according to a World Bank
study.
</P>
<P>
The content of the study, "Towards the Preparation of Nigerian
Environmental Action Plan", was disclosed by R.O. Adewole,
director general of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency,
at a recent workshop held in the oil-producing city of Port
Harcourt.
</P>
<P>
Adewole reminded the participants that besides the global
environmental issues, such as drought and desertification,
climate change, ozone layer depletion and toxic waste dumping,
Nigeria has many of its own environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Such problems, he said, include erosion, flooding, oil spills,
mining waste, gas flare, effluent discharges and municipal waste.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has realized the problems and is
taking measures to reverse the situation.
</P>
<P>
The efforts, he said, include evolving new environmental
policies, building legal and institutional frameworks, capacity
building and co-operation with international organizations.

CANBERRA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar finished

<HEADLINE> Credit Assets Classification Key to China's Financial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Classification of credit assets
in line with international practice is the key to China's
financial reform and risk prevention this year, said Dai
Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to directors of national PBOC branches at a recent
meeting, Dai said it is an urgent task for the financial sector to
prevent risks.
</P>
<P>
Although China has a fairly good macro-economic situation and
has avoided the direct impact of the Southeast Asian financial
crisis, latent risks in the financial sector should be clearly
noticed, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that the classification of credit assets will not only
significantly promote commercial banks' management, but will also
help enhance the central bank's supervision level and the
professional quality of banking staff members.
</P>
<P>
He added that the classification will make clear the degree of
risk and actual losses of various credit assets so as to create an
appropriate environment for developing a new loan-classification
system.
</P>
<P>
He said the money supply in the first quarter of this year is
basically suited to the economic growth, but problems still exist
in both economic development and money supply and demand. Efforts
should be made to readjust credit structure in line with the
state's industrial policies and improve financial services.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, foreign exchange supervision should be
further reinforced so as to maintain the balance of international
payments and protect the stability of the exchange rate of China's
currency, the Renminbi.

<HEADLINE> China to Standardize Companies' Cash-Flow Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Finance
today issued a new accounting norm, a cash-flow report, to
standardize enterprises' cash management.
</P>
<P>
The ministry demanded that all companies in the country must
implement this report in 1998.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry said that, with the transition of
enterprises' operating mechanisms, cash flow has been playing an
increasingly important role in the operation and management of
companies. The new norm is designed to meet the demand of
enterprises and tally with international accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the cash-flow report will become one of the
major public reports of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The cash-flow report enables enterprises to capture cash-flow
information and maximize the working efficiency of enterprise
funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cash-flow information is an important basis for
related government departments, especially the exchange market
supervision department, to supervise enterprises and prevent
latent risks.
</P>
<P>
A cash-flow report can also allow investors and creditors to
know how cash is used by the company and the enterprise's
capability for future cash return.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Insurance Companies Allowed to Do Business in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
announced today that three more foreign insurance companies have
been ratified to do business in China.
</P>
<P>
-- The British Royal Sun Alliance Insurance Group has been
approved to set up a branch in Shanghai to operate in the asset
insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian Colonial Mutual Group has been allowed to set
up a Sino-foreign joint venture in Shanghai for life insurance.
</P>
<P>
-- The French AXA-UAP Insurance Group also has been given the
green light to set up a life insurance joint venture in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the PBOC said that the latest move shows that
the Southeast Asian financial crisis has not affected China's
policy of continuing to open up its insurance market.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, China has opened the insurance market of Shanghai
and Guangzhou to foreign companies. So far, foreign insurance
companies -- mainly from the United States, Japan, Switzerland and
Canada -- have established seven offices in the two cities, the
spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Opposes Dramatizing Government Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said on Friday that he is opposed to dramatizing the cabinet
crisis and all government agencies should work in accordance with
the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The dismissal of the government is a rare event for our
country, but it happened within the framework of law, as provided
by the constitution," said Yeltsin in his regular radio address,
who sacked former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the whole
government on March 23.
</P>
<P>
Although Yeltsin admitted that Russia was in a state of
"political crisis", he refused to say that it was a disaster. "All
the ministries and government institutions are working, and a
normal political process is underway," Yeltsin added.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, is expected to
vote later on Friday for the second time on Yeltsin's prime
minister nominee Sergei Kiriyenko, who used to be the fuel
minister and appointed by the president as acting premier in March.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko did not pass the first round of vote in the Duma on
April 10.
</P>
<P>
But after that, Yeltsin immediately nominated Kiriyenko again
for the premiership.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's constitution, Yeltsin has the right to dissolve
the Duma if it fails to pass the three nominations he has raised
for the premiership.
</P>
<P>
Some Duma deputies have suggested that the constitution be
changed to make the chairman of the parliament's upper house,
rather than the prime minister, the number two in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin expressed his opposition to constitutional
amendment, saying that "it is very dangerous to alter the
constitution in the middle of reforms, because it is the basis of
the country's stability."
</P>
<P>
It is because of the guarantee of the constitution that Russia
has been away from upheavals and coups in recent years, Yeltsin
added.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who is due to leave for Japan just hours after the
second vote on his nominee Sergei Kiriyenko in the Duma, said that
the visit was very important and he saw "no grounds to postpone the
visit."

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Insurer Posts 32.5 Percent Premium Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's largest insurance company
reported stable business in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The People's Insurance Company of China (PICC) Group received
22.54 billion yuan in premiums in the first three months of this
year, up 32.5 percent from the same 1997 period, according to
company statistics.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown shows that the insurer's life insurance premiums
surged 55.4 percent in the first quarter to 12 billion yuan, with
premiums for property insurance up 6.65 percent to 9.57 billion
yuan and those for re-insurance rocketing 83 percent to 970
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Also in the first quarter, the PICC paid out 8.09 billion yuan
in insurance claims, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Company chairman Ma Yongwei said at a recent meeting that the
good business results of his company in the first quarter, which
is normally a rather slow season for insurance, came mainly out of
internal reforms and increased efforts to launch new services,
which include insurance for construction projects and
installation, housing and product quality.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the PICC wrote new life insurance policies valued at
8.1 billion yuan in the first three months for 59 million people,
up 9.8 percent over a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Get Bells from U.S. Before June 12: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Foreign Affairs
Secretary Domingo Siazon Friday said he was almost certain that
the Philippines will recover two controversial bells from the
United States before the June 12 independence centennial
celebration.
</P>
<P>
Siazon, who arrived here from the U.S. on Wednesday, gave the
assurance in reaction to news reports that even if a compromise
solution may have already been found, the bells may not be
recovered in time for the centennial observance.
</P>
<P>
According to the Presidential Palace, U.S. President Bill
Clinton has pledged his "best efforts" to Philippine President
Fidel Ramos during their meeting in Washington last weekend to
secure the return of the bells.
</P>
<P>
The bells were taken as war booty by U.S. soldiers from a
village in Eastern Samar at the height of the Filipino-American
War in 1901. The bells were used by Filipino fighters in alerting
their forces on the advance of American troops in their community.
</P>
<P>
The descendants of the U.S. soldiers who died in the war
opposed the return of the bells.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ramos and Clinton had agreed on a
compromise arrangement, according to which, the Philippines and
the U.S. will each have one original unit of the two bells and a
replica copy each to settle the issue.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said the Philippine government is willing to spend for
the replication of the bells, if necessary.

<HEADLINE> APEC Holds Science, Technology Roundtable Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian International
Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said Friday the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) should look at
developments in science and technology not only from within the
region but also in the global context.
</P>
<P>
APEC does not only strategize for intra-APEC cooperation in
science and technology but also seeks any form of cooperation with
others outside APEC in areas that can actually benefit APEC
members, the minister said at the opening of the Science,
Engineering and Technology Roundtable Meeting on the APEC Agenda
for Science and Technology Industry Cooperation into the 21st
Century here Friday.
</P>
<P>
She said that there was certainly much that was already
available within APEC in terms of scientific engineering and
technology development which could spur accelerated progress for
individual APEC member economies.
</P>
<P>
"However, there are also developments outside of APEC, such as
in Europe, that will result in breakthroughs that will
revolutionize current technology and have a global impact," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The APEC Agenda for Science and Technology Industry Cooperation
into the 21st Century is being mooted as an action program for
science and technology in APEC.
</P>
<P>
It must be translated into cooperative programs that would
benefit all 21 APEC economies, Rafidah said, adding this
particularly referred to access to new technology already
available in the APEC region, but the members should not expect
any handouts under the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The three-day roundtable meeting, organized by the Institution

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Allow Foreigners to Run 4 Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Finance Ministry would
allow foreign banks to take a 100-percent stake in four banks
taken over by the state in January.
</P>
<P>
The move would serve as an incentive to efficiency in
management of the banks and boost inflow of foreign capital into
Thailand which is suffering from a liquidity crunch.
</P>
<P>
A senior Finance Ministry official on Friday confirmed press
reports that the ministry would waive the current 10-year foreign
share-holding limit for the four banks to pave way for the move
towards a 100-percent share-holding.
</P>
<P>
Lifting the share-holding limit would be a key element for any
successful sale of the banks to foreign institutions.
</P>
<P>
Under the present regulation, foreign share-holders can hold a
majority stake in local financial institutions, but after 10
years, any new share issue would have to be offered to local
investors.
</P>
<P>
As required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Thai
government must announce by mid-year how it will privatize the
four ailing banks taken over by the state -- First Bangkok City
Bank, Bangkok Metropolitan Bank, Bangkok Bank of Commerce and Siam
City Bank.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said earlier that the Finance Ministry is
considering the change because of Thailand's past experience in
managing ailing financial institutions. Both Siam City Bank and
First Bangkok City Bank, for example, had been bailed out by the
government in the past before the January takeover.
</P>
<P>
However, the government takeover of the banks failed to lead to
any improvements in operational efficiency or management.
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks could better develop the ailing firms by
introducing new technology and efficient management which would
help boost their overall stability in the long-term, the official
said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
An announcement on the fate of the four banks is expected
within the next several months, according to press reports Friday.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Seeking Compensation in Wild Animals Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Three farmers in northeast
China's Jilin Province have asked the local government to
compensate them for three cows that were eaten by a wild Siberian
tiger in the Changbai Mountains early this year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Haiyun, attorney for the farmers, was told by the Jilin
Province Higher People's Court that the proper jurisdiction for
the suit was against the local government in Jiaohe City People's
Court. The Jilin court also said the farmers' attorney could seek
compensation directly from the local government.
</P>
<P>
Wu Songlin, mayor of Jiaohe City, said in an interview with
Xinhua today that "so far we have not received any information on
the suit."
</P>
<P>
The mayor added that "the tiger-eats-cow issue will be solved
according to law."
</P>
<P>
The Jilin provincial people's congress adopted a law in 1996
that local government will pay those whose crops or domestic
animals been damaged for protecting wild animals.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Zhengjie, expert on wild animals, said the planned suit
could be a landmark decision on the protection of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
Since August of 1997, at least 12 cows were eaten by wild
tigers in the Changbai Mountains. A United Nations-funded,
Sino-foreign investigation declared that four-to-six wild tigers
are residing in the Jilin part of the Changbai Mountains.
</P>
<P>
The three farmers, whose cows were eaten by tigers in the
maintains, have asked the village and township governments to
offer them 6,000 yuan (720 U.S. dollars) to pay for their property
loss. However, they have not received any reply.
</P>
<P>
The three then invited Wang Haiyun, who is considered one of
"China's Top Ten Lawyers" to be their agent.
</P>
<P>
Li Yi, one of the three farmers, said they are glad that the
tigers under top-level state protection have reappeared in his
area, adding: "We protect tigers and our interest should also be
guaranteed at the same time."
</P>
<P>
Hearing the news that farmers' cows were eaten by tigers, some
ventures and individuals have expressed the will to pay for the
farmers' loss.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang said, this suit must be lodged as it is not a
simple issue of farmers' compensation, but a test of the country's
legal system.

<HEADLINE> Declining Utilization Worries Nigerian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The capacity utilization in
Nigeria's manufacture sector declined from last year's 33 percent
to 25 percent in the first quarter of this year, media reports
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Ralph Alabi, vice-chairman of the Ikeja Branch of the
Manufacturers Association of Nigeria said at a business luncheon
Thursday that a survey of 100 companies show that the capacity
utilization hovered around 35 percent in January and February.
</P>
<P>
The relatively high utilization, he said, was due to the
euphoria generated by the government's 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
However, "Beginning from the month of March, the slow manner
of implementation of the budget began to take its toll on the
economy", he said, noting that the utilization rate slumped to
under 25 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Alabi criticized the poor performance of the country's ports,
where goods were piled up and the 48-hour ultimatum given for the
clearance of goods remained a mirage.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to speed up the privatization of
public parastatals, such as the National Electric Power Authority
and the Nigerian Telecommunications Limited, as promised in the
budget.
</P>
<P>
Other speakers agreed with him, saying that poor
infrastructure, including epileptic water and power supply, is
creating an unfavorable climate for business development.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Responsible for Smooth Transition in Macao: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres said here Friday that Portugal will take a responsible
attitude to ensure a smooth transition in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The PM made the remarks upon his arrival at noon today for a
three-day visit to Macao en route to his official visit to China's
inland areas.
</P>
<P>
"I pledge again that Portugal will take a responsible attitude
to make sure that a smooth transition will be achieved in Macao,"
he said, adding "so that everybody can face their future with full
confidence and freedom."
</P>
<P>
Guterres said he has full confidence himself in the future of
Macao, and he is deeply convinced that the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration signed by China and Portugal in 1987 will be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Macao will continue to be a place of stability,
harmony, prosperity and freedom," he said. "Macao is already an
open and multiple society, and enjoys wide autonomy in its
administration and legislation. Such a structure will be kept
under the Special Administrative Region after 1999."
</P>
<P>
Coming along with the prime minister are dozens of businessmen
and six cabinet ministers, including Foreign Minister Jaime Gama,
Economic Affairs Minister Pina Moura, Science and Technology
Minister Mariano Gago.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Takes Lead in World Economic Growth: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Botswana has the world's
fastest growing economy between 1965 and 1996 in comparison with
the Asian tigers, said a report released in Washington by the
World Bank Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Eric Swanson of the bank's development data group said the
report showed Botswana's per capita income had grown 9.2 percent
during the 31-year period, compared with 7.3 percent for South
Korea, the second fastest performer and number three, China's 6.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Swanson said the figures were statistical averages of the
countries' annual growth over the period. The bank does not have
figures prior to the period under review. Botswana's gross
national product (GNP) grew by 13 percent over the period.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank predicts that growth in developing countries
would continue until the end of the century, rebounding from the
temporary setback of the Asian financial crisis. This prediction
depended on the success of key reforms effected in response to
the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Korean Talks in China Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) - The first Korean government talks
are at a standstill again, according to the Republic of Korea's
chief delegate Jeong Se Hyun.
</P>
<P>
Jeong said in a media release, his first since the talks
started here April 11, that he hopes there will be a change in
North Korea's position and suggested that the North contact them
if there is any development.
</P>
<P>
Delegates of the two side had a fruitless morning session and a
dinner meeting on Thursday, and a 95-minute closed-door session
this morning.
</P>
<P>
"To our dismay, there was no change in North Korea's previous
position," Jeong said, and added that what matters most is that
the substance of the matter be dealt with on a basis of
reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
He said that the North attempted to clarify the issue of
fertilizer for the North and hinted at a deal for reuniting
separated families. North-South talks on the family issue started
in 1971 and continued until 1973 with some progress, but
eventually came to nothing because of the lack of a timetable, he
said.
</P>
<P>
A reunion center was clearly prescribed in the 1992 Basic
Agreement's Article 15, Clause 3, he explains.
</P>
<P>
A source at the ROK embassy says that it is difficult to say
when the Beijing talks will conclude, and the embassy of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea has issued no media release
on the talks.

<HEADLINE> Beijing University Centenary Celebrations Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Beijing University centenary
celebrations began today with a forum on Marxist development,
because "Marxism is the soul of the university," explains Ren
Yanshen, secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee in the
university.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 officials and scholars are attending the forum on
Communism's past, present and future, where they said they will
build Beijing University into a center for spreading Marxism in
the next century.
</P>
<P>
The university's birthday on May 4 is expected to be a major
holiday with banners and posters. There is even a countdown clock
in front of the south gate of the university. "Our department has
prepared a lot for the celebrations," says Xiong Meijuan, a
politics major.
</P>
<P>
Construction has been going on in the university since last
year. A centenary hall, a library, a museum, and teaching
buildings are all under construction, which will help provide a
solid basis for development in the 21st century, according to Chen
Zhangliang, vice-president of the university.
</P>
<P>
He explains that the celebrations will be enthusiastic but

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Opposition Urges Government to Enter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese rightwing National
Liberal Party leader Dory Chamoun has urged the government to
negotiate with Israel over its withdrawal offer from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star newspaper Friday quoting Chamoun as saying that
negotiating with Israelis did not mean accepting Israeli
conditions detrimental to Lebanon's interests.
</P>
<P>
Such negotiations should be held under U.N. auspices, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged all the parties concerned to call for a role of
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in helping implement the
Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Chamoun observed that Israel was determined to withdraw from
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Israeli cabinet endorsed Resolution 425, saying
that it would pull back its troops from south Lebanon if Beirut
agreed on its negotiated security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
villages and towns from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria which has great influence on Lebanon, flatly
rejected Israel's withdrawal offer, arguing that the
U.N. resolution calls for an immediate and unconditional Israeli
withdrawal and does not provide for any negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The resolution 425 was adopted after Israeli first invasion of
Lebanon in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Syria, with 40,000 troops deployed in Lebanon as peacekeepers,
was accused by Israel of holding south Lebanon as "a bargaining
chip" in forcing it to return Golan Heights Syria lost to Israel
in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Chamoun also criticized Lebanese officials for what he
considered an exaggerated reliance on Syria to solve their
problems.

the order, saying that the government is addressing the food
problem in the south and that certain measures have already been
adopted.
</P>
<P>
The food assistance operations are aimed at alleviating the
adverse effect of the El Nino-induced drought in Mindanao, where
at least 2.4 million people are suffering from food shortages and
43 of them had died.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Executive Secretary Alexander Aguirre ordered the
creation of an inter-agency committee led by the Department of
Social Welfare and Development for the food assistance operations.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh May Depend more on Wheat: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A well-known agricultural expert
has said Bangladesh may have to depend more on wheat in the future
to feed its increasing population, The Financial Express daily
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Norman E. Borlaug, a Nobel Laureate and a senior consultant
with the Mexico-based International Maize and Wheat Improvement
Center, said this while giving a lecture on food security at a
symposium titled "Vision for Agricultural Research and
Development" held here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Though Bangladesh had made a great success in increasing rice
production, but the country "many have to depend more on wheat in
the future to feed its ever growing population," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The farmers in Bangladesh, he noted, "have already responded to
the need by expanding and intensifying wheat production in the
winter season."
</P>
<P>
Yields of wheat increased with national wheat area expanding
rapidly -- from 125,000 hectares in 1976 to 600,000 hectares in
1981 -- and the production multiplied ever since, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996-97 season, the country had a record wheat harvest
of nearly 1.7 million tons from 700,000 hectares, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I understand that the 1997-98 crop will probably be better
than last year," he said, adding that some 1.9 million tons are
expected from 800,000 hectares this season with an average yield
of 2.4 tons per hectare.
</P>
<P>
While rice is certainly the preferred staple, more than 2.5
million tons of wheat are consumed annually in Bangladesh,
according to the symposium.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks on Sudan Set to Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Peace negotiations between the
Khartoum government and southern Sudanese rebels will resume in
Nairobi on April 30, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which broke off in November, are aimed at ending 14
years of civil war in the largest African country, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Ali al-Haj Mohammed, the Deputy Secretary General of the
Sudanese National Congress, the country's only legal political
organization, was quoted as saying Thursday in Khartoum that the
Kenyan government has informed the Sudanese government about the
exact date for the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Foreign Ministry said earlier Thursday that peace
negotiations between the Khartoum government and southern
Sudanese rebels would resume in Nairobi during the last week of
April.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed did not give details on the government delegation
that is to attend the Nairobi talks, nor whether he would himself
attend.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Khartoum would broach the issue of the
country's draft constitution which, he said, was in response to
southern Sudanese demands for self-determination and guarantees
of liberties.
</P>
<P>
In early November, delegations representing the Muslim-ruled
government of President Omar al-Bashir and the Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA) met for 10 days here under the auspices of
the regional Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD).
</P>
<P>
The two sides were meeting then for the first time since 1994.
Their war has dragged on since 1983 when the SPLA re-started
fighting for more autonomy and religion freedom in the animist
and Christian dominated south.

<HEADLINE> China Gets Its First Housing Price Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Planning
Commission and the State Statistics Bureau yesterday issued a real
estate and housing price index for the first time, according to
today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The three-part index covers housing sales, land transfers and
housing rents. The housing sales price index is 101.3, that of
land transfers is 101.7, and for housing rents, 103.7.
</P>
<P>
The index is based on the corresponding quarter of last year,
with a benchmark of 100.
</P>
<P>
The comparatively higher housing rent rate is related to
housing reforms and a rapid rise in housing rents, the two
departments say. They predict that with increasing housing
reforms, the housing sales index will drop and that for rents will
go up.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the average price of a sq.m. of commercial housing was
1,766 yuan, and in large and medium-sized cities, up to 3,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
People in the industry say that the price is still too high,
and that, to push housing construction and make it a force for
economic development, the country has to improve its real estate
price controls.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Main Opposition Names Shadow Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Mwai Kibaki, the chairman of
Kenya's main opposition Democratic Party (DP), has named a
20-member shadow cabinet to articulate DP policies on national
issues.
</P>
<P>
Kibaki, also the leader of the opposition in the parliament,
appears himself under the "office of the president," but his
specific duties are not spelt out.
</P>
<P>
The move should get parliamental members loyal to DP to focus
on specific areas in national affairs, said Kibaki Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kibaki said he could not form a shadow coalition cabinet of
opposition lawmakers because "the law does not allow this and the
realities of the day are such that we could not find a party to
work with."
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, DP lawmaker Martha Karua, who was named shadow
minister for home affairs, national heritage, culture and social
services, declined the role, saying she was not consulted.
</P>
<P>
"I feel that the manner in which the appointment was made,
with all the attendant lobbying and manipulations, makes it
difficult for me to accept the appointment," she said.
</P>
<P>
Kibaki took the second place after current President Daniel
arap Moi in Kenya's second multi-pary general elections held at
the end of December, 1997.

<HEADLINE> United Airlines to Suspend Two Flights to South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Airlines, which is
headquartered in Chicago, said Thursday that it will suspend two
flights to South Korea because of the recent Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The daily non-stop service between San Francisco and South
Korea's capital of Seoul will be suspended as from May 5, while
the service between the Japanese city of Osaka and Seoul will also
be suspended from July 8, said the company.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reason for the suspension, Chris Bowers, vice
president of the airlines, said in a company newsletter that "we
have been unable to achieve sustained profitability on these
routes" because South Korea has been particularly hard hit during
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Richard Martin, the company spokesman, said the airlines
already eliminated other Asian routes in recent months, including
those from Guam to Osaka and Manila to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that there are other Asian routes which had
been added or increased, including more than doubling the weekly
flights between Chicago and Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Company Develops New Embalming Material </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A new discovery in China is
expected to replace formalin, which has been used for a long time,
for embalming bodies, either humans or animals in museums.
</P>
<P>
After experimenting with a substance used to preserve corpses
during the Ming Dynasty (1368 to 1644), Chinese began to produce
it in the city of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province and managed to
preserve a body for half a year with the new technique.
</P>
<P>
Li Xingguo of Nanjing's Suyi Biological Embalming Factory said
that the discovery will change embalming significantly.
</P>
<P>
Formalin can have some bad effects on those working with it and
they are not allowed to come into contact with it. But, the new
process involves immersing the body in epoxy resin and polymers
for at least a week, after which it is placed on a special bed for
hardening.
</P>
<P>
The new method is considered better than formaldehyde treatment
for another reason, because the plasticized body does not have a
bad odor, it is non-toxic, and it cannot be damaged easily.
</P>
<P>
The technique has been used by Hong Kong University and the
Guangdong College of Pharmacy, and a number of medical colleges in
Beijing, Shanghai and other big cities are preparing to establish
new labs for using the method.

<HEADLINE> Angola Clears Zambia Over Support for Angolan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Angola has exculpated Zambia from
accusations of supplying arms to the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), an official of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
OAU assistant secretary general Daniel Antonio said that the
Angolan government has assured him that Zambia has not involved
in the alleged arms deal with UNITA, according to Times of
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Antonio, who held talks with both the Angolan government and
UNITA in Luanda before arriving here, said the OAU has not
received any official information on the alleged arms deals.
</P>
<P>
He said his mission to Angola and now Zambia is basically to
discuss the implementation process of the Lusaka Protocol signed
in 1994 by the Angolan government and UNITA.
</P>
<P>
"I met UNITA and the Angolan government and left Luanda more
encouraged. We now hope to see how Zambia can continue to support
the implementation of the peace process in Angola," Antonio said.
</P>
<P>
Angolan ambassador to Zambia Manuel Augusto charged on March 5
that Zambians are supplying arms to UNITA through Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He warned that whilst his country does not wish to have a
repeat of the Congo-Brazzavile and Congo Kinshasa incidents where
the Angolan government participated in dislodging the governments
there, "Angola does not rule out any option if UNITA does not
stop getting arms from some territories."
</P>
<P>
But Zambian president Frederick Chiluba on March 12 denied
that his government has any involvement in the supply of arms to
any country.
</P>
<P>
The president however said that his government will investigae
allegations that Zambia is being used as a transit point for arms
to UNITA, which fought a civil war of about 20 years against the
Angolan government after the country's independence in 1976.

<HEADLINE> Marxism to Be Like Evergreen: Say Scholars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The secretary of the Beijing
University Committee of the Communist Party of China, Ren Yanshen,
told a forum on Communism's past, present and future, that since
coming to China 80 years ago, Marxism has been proven to be a
scientific theory and will see even greater splendor in the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The forum marks the 80th anniversary of Communism in China and
it is considered a significant event here, according to Xu
Quanxin, a CPC Central Committee Party School researcher.
</P>
<P>
In 1918, Li Dazhao, then head of the Beijing University
Library, began research on Communism and started China's first
research group on Karl Marx's theory.
</P>
<P>
The university became a center of the CPC in its infancy in the
1920s, and many Chinese leaders, including Mao Zedong, worked or
studied there.
</P>
<P>
In 1840, China was humiliated when it lost the Opium War
against Britain, and subsequently many Western powers invaded the
country. "China was facing a serious crisis at that time, and a
group of progressive scholars decided to introduce Marxism from
Russia to save the nation," explains Xiao Chaoran, a historian at
Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
Scholars and statesmen had tried various methods, including
Anarchism, to regain national glory, but it was the October
Revolution in Russia in 1917 that gave them the greatest hope.
</P>
<P>
And Beijing University became the center of Marxism because its
president, Cai Yuanpei, pursued a policy of encouraging different
schools of thought, according to Shi Zhongquan, of the CPC Central
Committee's Party History Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Communism has been through ups and downs in China since then,
but has succeeded through self-improvement and will become
immortal, according to Bai Keming, deputy head of the CPC Central
Committee's Publicity Department. He says that Marxism has entered
a new stage of development because of Deng Xiaoping Theory, which
is known as "contemporary Marxism".
</P>
<P>
The theory as applied by the CPC will rejuvenate China, he
says, and a modernized China in the 21st century will further
prove the correctness of Marxism.
</P>
<P>
The Education Ministry has decided to push the study of Deng
Xiaoping Theory at all universities in China, and most
universities already have Deng Xiaoping Theory courses.

<HEADLINE> American Couple Collects Donations of Medical Books for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- An American couple has collected
donations of medical books and audio and visual materials worth
130 million U.S. dollars for China since 1981.
</P>
<P>
The 50th container of donated books was transported to Tianjin
earlier this month, bringing the total weight of donations he and
his wife have collected during the past 17 years up to 1,000 tons,
said Jordan M. Phillips today during an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said the donations include three million medical books and
numerous video tapes and films for medical education and
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 medical universities and colleges, research
institutes and hospitals in China have received those books and
materials, which are about the latest developments in medical
science and technology, said the 74-year-old U.S. physician.
</P>
<P>
Phillips and his wife, Mary, made their first trip to China in
1979. They found that medical libraries in the interior of China
were short of new medical books because of the destruction
during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the couple established a non-profit organization,
the Medical Books for China International, to ask for book
donations in the United States. They wrote letters to 1,200
medical libraries across their country, requesting extra books.
</P>
<P>
There was an immediate response and their room was piled high
with the donated books and materials.
</P>
<P>
They began to ship the donations to Tianjin with the help of
the China Ocean Shipping Corp. in 1984, and the books were
distributed all over China by an acceptance committee of the
Tianjin Medical University.
</P>
<P>
To date, seven centers have been established in Beijing,
Hengyang, Ji'an, Kunming, Urumqi, Xuzhou and Huhhot to distribute
the donated books to libraries across China.
</P>
<P>
Phillips and his wife have visited China 62 times. The Health
Ministry of China awarded Phillips a China Health Medal in 1991
for his contributions to medical developments in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese consul-general in Los Angeles, Feng Shusen, in 1996
delivered a medal to the couple engraved with the Chinese national
emblem and the characters "Chinese People's Old Friends." The
medal was awarded at a celebration of the 15th anniversary of the
founding of the Medical Books for China International.

<HEADLINE> Role Of Press As Watchdog Growing In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- When several officials in south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region were revealed by the
newspaper China Youth Daily earlier this month to be using their
power for extravagant wining and dining, the scandal led to a
clean-government drive in the region.
</P>
<P>
Cao Bochun, the autonomous region's Party chief, says that
problems need to be seen correctly and that the press should be
supported in its critical role. In today's China, more people are
taking a look at things in society.
</P>
<P>
Local observers say that the press in China is increasing its
role in the anti-corruption drive, and in ethical and cultural
progress and establishing the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, the Chairman of the National People's
Congress Li Peng urged the press to criticise government mistakes
and shortcomings more, and to expose corruption.
</P>
<P>
When Li visited Central TV earlier this year, he made special
mention of the program "Focus", which airs during prime time, and
which is supposed to draw the public's attention towards
corruption and the bad side of society.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection
of the Chinese Communist Party recently praised the press in its
fight against corruption in the past several years and said that
this year, there will be better conditions for press
participation, and more cases of corruption will be made public by
the press.
</P>
<P>
In a recent meeting, Xiao Yang, the President of the Supreme
People's Court, said that the courts across China need to put
themselves under the scrutiny of the press. All trials, except
those involving privacy, national security and a few others,
should be open, he said, and the press should be permitted to
cover them.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage journalists to do better work, the All
China Journalists Association is now preparing to set up a special
committee to protect the rights of journalists.
</P>
<P>
Journalists should have access to support when their rights or
their lives are in danger, says one association official, and this
needs improvement.
</P>
<P>
According to an official report, many representatives at the
Ninth National People's Congress said that a law on supervision
should be formulated as soon as possible.

</P>
<P>
Tian told his visitors that the two countries enjoy good

fields and the Canadian side expects to expand such cooperation in
the future, in which the two countries can learn from each other
and share useful experience.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Records Low Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Prices in New Zealand rose
only 0.2 percent in the first quarter this year, lower than
expected by market forecasts and the Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
Television New Zealand reported on Friday that the quarterly
consumer price index (CPI) put inflation in the year ending March
to 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank had expected the first quarter CPT to rise 0.4
percent, and economists had tipped on average 0.5 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Food prices, which went up sharply in the quarter because of a
drought, are the main contributor to the CPI increase. But CPI was
held down by lower petrol prices, cheaper international airfares
and lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The report expects that the low inflation will prompt the
Reserve Bank to further ease its monetary policy in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
The lower-than-expected CPI triggered off a fall on the
interest rates with the 90-day bill rates dropping nearly half a
percentage point to just over 9 percent shortly after the figure
was released.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Long-Term Development Goal for Power Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) --China has decided to build a power
industry set-up compatible with the development demands of a
modernized country by year 2050, today's "Economic Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the development goal would be
realized in three stages. On the basis of having a total installed
generating capacity of 290 million kilowatts (kw) and producing
1,400 billion kw/hours of electricity annually by 2000, China will
speed up power construction to increase its total installed
generating capacity to 500 million kw by 2010.
</P>
<P>
By then, a gigantic power production center will be in
operation at the Three Gorges Dam, and three large power grids --
north, central and south -- will be interconnected, with
electricity expected to be available in all rural
villages. Technical and economic indexes for power would be close
to advanced international standards.
</P>
<P>
China should have an installed generating capacity of
700-to-800 million kw by 2020, and expects to have in place a
rational structure of hydropower, thermal power, nuclear power and
new energy. It plans to form a nationwide united power grid, as
well as a rational distribution and sustainable development of
power resources in the country, eventually reaching the goal by
2050.
</P>
<P>
To realize the goal, efforts should be made to adjust the power
industry's internal structure and optimize resource distribution,
intensifying power-grid construction and advancing a nationwide
connection of power grids, an official with the China State Power
Corp. said.

quoted by today's Beijing Daily as saying that it is imperative to
combine economic growth with economic returns, further deepen

</P>
<P>
He said that it is of important political significance to
achieve this target since it has an important bearing on achieving
an 8 percent economic growth rate for the country.
</P>
<P>
Jia made these remarks at a meeting Thursday analyzing
Beijing's economic growth in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the first three months of this year,
Beijing realized 31.32 billion yuan (3.77 billion U.S. dollars) in
gross domestic product, 9.17 percent higher than that for the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter, retail sales hit a record 27.46

percent; revenues came to 6.14 billion yuan (739 million
U.S. dollars), up by 26.5 percent; increases of 9.45 percent and
6.6 percent were reported in per-capita wages of urban workers and
in the per-capital income of rural residents, respectively.
</P>

LUSAKA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will spend 91 billion
Kwacha (about 50 million U.S. Dollars) to rehabilitate the
railway from Kitwe to Livingstone.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Friday quoted Managing Director of Zambia
Railway (ZR) Robert Crawford as saying in Kabwe in central Zambia
Thursday that the program will start in about six weeks and run
for five years.
</P>
<P>
He said funds will have to be sourced from the World Bank and
other international donors, internal resources and the
government.
</P>
<P>
"We are under extreme financial pressure, but the
rehabilitation program will have to start. We are determined that
in six weeks, funds will be sourced," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the financial problems have been worsened with the
decline in traffic as the biggest single customer, ZCCM (Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines) has had its copper prices reduced on
the world metal market.
</P>
<P>
The current wooden sleepers will have to replaced with
concrete ones and the locomotives will have to be repaired, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The company expects to spend seven billion Kwacha on spare
parts every year, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the present 5,100 workforce, Crawford said the company is
looking for ways to improve manpower efficiency and did not rule
out the possibility of retrenching some of the employees.

at the same pace. The central government collected taxes of 92.96
billion yuan in the quarter, an increase of 9.7 percent, while
local governments collected 79.4 billion yuan, up 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The administration indicated that the growth rate of tax
collection during the quarter slowed compared to the same periods
of the last two years. The main reason cited was a decrease in
taxes from some key industries.
</P>
<P>
Taxes from petroleum, petrochemicals, coal and sugar dropped
more than 10 percent. This was attributed to the Southeast Asian
financial crisis, fluctuating oil prices in the global market and
restructuring of state-owned enterprises among other factors.

<HEADLINE> Johansson Says Rotation System Better for Host Selection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A rotation system among
confederations should replace the present bidding system for
selection of the future World Cup finals host, UEFA President
Lennart Johansson said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
When asked about a proposal to allow only one country per
continent to bid for future World Cup finals, Johansson said it is
up to the FIFA ruling Executive Committee to decide whether to
adopt it.
</P>
<P>
"But I personally think a rotation system among the
confederations could solve the problem," Johansson told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said he was concerned about the amount of campaign money
spent in the bidding system while a rotation system could save all
that.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch soccer association has proposed that one nation be
nominated from each confederation to be put forward as potential
hosts for future FIFA competition.
</P>
<P>
The German soccer federation, which is at present competing
with their English counterpart in the race for the 2006 World Cup
finals, said on Thursday that it had set aside 20 million marks
($11 million) to promote its bid.
</P>
<P>
Johansson told a news conference upon his arrival here that he
would advocate "transparency, democracy and solidarity" if he is
elected FIFA president in June.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the `United Nations of football'. I believe in
transparency. I believe in solidarity. If I become FIFA
President, I would prove that is not election tactics," said
Johansson, who is vying for the presidency against the other
candidate, FIFA General-Secretary Sepp Blatter.
</P>
<P>
He denied he had called Blatter "a puppet" of the reigning
President Joao Havelange in the previous war of words.
</P>
<P>
"That was not what I said." he said. "Dr. Havelange, whom I
highly respect, has served in the world football for more than 20
years. He was the right man in the right place in the right time."
</P>
<P>
"Among all these insults that I have to take from the president
today, he said I was a puppet-on-the-string of Germany and I only
went their way," he added.
</P>
<P>
Johansson said he respected Blatter as a candidate but "could
not respect after knowing he started campaign in Asia months ago."
</P>
<P>
"He never stood up in the ring," the European soccer boss
added. "He said 'perhaps', 'perhaps', 'not', 'perhaps'. Finally
the President announced Blatter's candidacy."
</P>
<P>
Johansson said, "Then with reference to what the President said
about me, I wonder who is the 'puppet-on-the-string.'"
</P>
<P>
FIFA will decide its new president on June 8 in its 51st
Congress in Paris, two days before the start of the World Cup.

<HEADLINE> China Launching New Securities Investment Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China will launch its third
securities investment fund on April 22, in another move to develop
institutional investors in the securities market.
</P>
<P>
The "Xinghua Fund" is expected to issue two billion units at a
face value of one yuan. The sponsors, the Beijing-based China
Securities Co. Ltd., the Beijing Securities Co. Ltd., and the
China Science and Technology International Trust and Investment
Co. Ltd. are expected to purchase 60 million units. The remaining
1.94 billion units will be offered to the public through the Shanghai
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The closed-end fund has a 15-year term and will invest its
capital in stocks and treasury bonds. The China Construction Bank
will be the custodian.
</P>
<P>
This shows the determination of securities authorities to
standardize and stabilize the market through institutional
investors, market analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The new fund's manager, the China Fund Management Co. Ltd.,
says it will run the fund in a standard way and minimize risks by
setting up two special committees to make investment and
risk-prevention decisions.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard the fund, the China Construction Bank has also set
up a new department staffed with high-calibre personnel, stronger
internal controls, advanced technology, and a market surveillance
system.

<HEADLINE> Credit Tightening May Help Solve Currency Woes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The prevailing credit tightening
scheme and the high interest rates imposed by commercial banks may
help solve the currency crisis in the Philippines, an economist
said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported on Friday that Emilio
Antonio, a senior economics professor at the University of Asia
and the Pacific, made the assessment in his study.
</P>
<P>
Antonio admitted that the economy can not be bailed out of its
present situation by simply tightening credit and raising interest
rates, but he agreed that the policies are normally recommended to
stabilize the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The only thing the monetary authorities must do is to keep the
credit tightening and high interest rate policies within
reasonable levels, he said in the study.
</P>
<P>
After the financial storm swept Southeast and East Asian
nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) required these
countries to tighten credit and raise interest rates while
providing financial assistances to them.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF's medicines gradually became unpopular in
these nations. In the Philippines, some economists said the
policies dealt a severe blow to the manufacturing sector and would
dampen the growth of economy in the long run.

<HEADLINE> UNDP, Zimbabwe Working on Local Medicines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Programe (UNDP) and Zimbabwe are working together to formulate a
project document on the sustainable use of traditional medicines,
a UNDP official said Thursday, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
UNDP resident representative Carlos Lopes told a workshop in
Kadoma of central Zimbabwe on biodiversity the project was being
handled in a professional manner together with the Zimbabwean
ministry of mines, environment and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Lopes said there was need for Zimbabwe to patent some of its
medicines to protect its intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
Most African countries were failing to access medicines from
the continent being sold overseas because they had to seek
permission from patent holders there, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Concern is increasing that uncontrolled access to forest
resources could be abused by outsiders especially in the case of
plants with intrinsic medicinal and economic value," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This can be avoided by instituting comprehensive and
effective legislative and monitoring mechanisms that recognise
intellectual property rights of the local people," Lopes said.
</P>
<P>
Lopes said there was need for Zimbabwe to sign conventions it
was familiar with to avoid misunderstandings in future.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a tendency to emphasise one component of
biological resources like wildlife at the expense of others.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive strategy, he said, should take into account
the physical, cultural, spiritual and economic needs of the
people.

<HEADLINE> Korean Talks Reopen; No Progress Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) - The inter-Korean talks adjourned
again following a reportedly fruitless closed-door session here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
"Little progress has been made, but we agreed to keep contact,"
said Chun Kum Chul, chief delegate of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), after the 100-minute working-level
session at the hotel where the Republic of Korea (ROK) delegation
stays.
</P>
<P>
"It's true, no progress is in sight so far," a source from the
ROK embassy said when asked to comment on a report that both sides
made a breakthrough last night on the issues of helping reunite
separated families and supplying fertilizer to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The source confirmed a new proposal by the DPRK delegation that
the ROK ship 200,000 tons of fertilizer to the DPRK by the end of
May, saying: "No agreement has been signed, as the South would add
conditions to the shipment."
</P>
<P>
The ROK still insisted that the DPRK fix a date for
establishing a meeting place to help facilitate reunions of
the separated families.
</P>
<P>
Sources claimed that both sides had agreed in principle to hold
Red Cross talks this month to discuss details for helping reunite
families.
</P>
<P>
The morning session, with the two head delegates attending, was
aimed at narrowing the differences following a fruitless dinner
meeting last night.

<HEADLINE> Huge Investment Aids Human Gene Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The National Natural Science Fund
Committee has decided to allocate another seven million yuan
(875,000 US dollars) in the next three years to a human genome
project to ensure that the research remains on the cutting edge in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The funding is the committee's biggest among its research
projects during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period from 1996 to
2,000, according to today's Wenhui Daily based in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The project, "Studies on Several Gene Loci Structure of the
Chinese Human Genome," was initiated in 1994 and comprises three
sub-projects.
</P>
<P>
The sub-projects include building a bank of immortalized cell
lines to reserve genes from representative ethnic groups and
endangered ethnic minorities, introducing and upgrading new
techniques of human gene science and studying the position of the
gene related to human diseases.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the project said they have made substantial
progress, which has laid the foundation for forming a cooperative
system for human gene studies in China.
</P>
<P>
With 22 percent of the world's total population, 56 different
ethnic groups and several isolated ethnic communities, China has
the diseases common among people in developing countries as well
as those associated with modern lifestyles such as heart disease
and certain types of cancer found in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
All these are considered good resources for the study of
diversity in human genes as well as human vulnerability and
antibodies.

HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Danish government has pledged
support for the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
organ for politics, defense and security and the region's efforts

"To conclude such a project as part of our development

this field, that a small country like Denmark can be of
assistance to these programs," said the ambassador.
</P>

He said peacekeeping and conflict prevention was needed for
sustainable economic and social development which his country
supported.
</P>
<P>
On cooperation with Zimbabwe, he said a private sector program
which involved twinning Zimbabwean and Danish private companies
was being introduced.

<HEADLINE> Circular Calls for Ensuring Light Industry Production Objectives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The State Economic and Trade
Commission's Light Industry Bureau recently called on local light
industry departments to adopt effective measures to reverse
falling industrial production.
</P>
<P>
The bureau issued a circular recently, requiring local
departments to help realize the targeted eight growth in gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the first two months of this year show that the
industrial production value for China's light industry, which
includes the textile, tobacco and household electrical appliances
industries, hit 339.5 billion yuan, up 10.9 percent on the 1997
period, but nonetheless an increase rate much lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
The total January-February production value for enterprises
administered by the light industry bureau stood at 77.4 billion
yuan, down 0.5 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Despite the upturn of production during March, the first
quarter growth figure is expected to hit a mere three percent.
</P>
<P>
The circular stressed that light industry production should
maintain a proper growth rate of at least eight percent, but
preferably 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The industry must actively explore the domestic market and
accelerate adjustments to the product structure.
</P>
<P>
The circular also called for efforts to tap the vast potential
of rural areas, and to improve the channels enabling light
industrial products to enter the rural market.
</P>
<P>
Steady export growth should be maintained, according to the
circular, which also stressed that businesses should target South
America, the Commonwealth of Independent States, East Europe and
Africa as new potential markets.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jian'an, the Light Industry Bureau official in charge of
production plans, said that light industry administrative
departments should proceed with government restructuring plans and
strengthen economic management.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the bureau has dispatched four fact-finding
groups to coastal areas and central and western regions to gather
first-hand information which is expected to facilitate central
government decision-making.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will grant favorable policies and special assistance
to loss-making industries, such as the sugar, canned-food and
papermaking sectors.

<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is increasing its
international cooperation in ecology, environmental, public
health, disaster relief and prevention, and city planning and
management projects.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that 49 percent of the city's cooperation
projects and over 90 percent of the international meetings held in
Beijing are related to the city's social development.
</P>
<P>
Zou Zuye, head of Beijing's Science and Technology Commission,
says that the capital will place greater priority on these
projects to help maintain economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said that this will also involve urban construction and
administration.
</P>
<P>
So far, the city has cooperative relations with more than 80
countries and regions and has joined 36 international
organizations.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of people identified as
AIDS patients in Poland has reached 620, of whom 364 have died,
the national AIDS prevention bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Just in the first two months of this year, 114 new cases were
reported, bringing the number of AIDS cases from last year's 579
to 620, said A. Novak, an advisor on AIDS to the Department of
Health and Social Welfare minister.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau, another 5,067 people in the country
are HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
The number of people with HIV, the virus which can lead to a
full-blown case of the AIDS disease, also has been rising rapidly
since 1985, when the country's first AIDS case was reported, said
Novak.
</P>
<P>
The advisor attributed the increase of AIDS cases and HIV
carriers to illegal drug use, saying that 65 percent of HIV
carriers in the country contracted the virus via drug use.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are 40,000 drug addicts in Poland.

<HEADLINE> South America Walking Towards Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The South American Common
Market (Mercosur) and the Andean Group Thursday signed a framework
agreement on establishing a free trade zone by the year 2000, a
step closer to the regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from member countries of the two groups,
including Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Ecuador, Bolivia,
Colombia, Peru and Venezuela, signed the agreement in the
Argentine capital.
</P>
<P>
The two groups have a population of 300 million and a total GDP
of one trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The framework agreement, which will replace all the existing
agreements between the two sides, will gradually eliminate trade
tariffs and barriers within the proposed free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, negotiations on preferential tariffs
should be finished before September 30.
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the two groups should reach a concrete agreement on
tariff reductions and elimination by the end of the century, so
that the free trade zone can take off in 2000.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed the establishment of the trade zone will
speed up the formation of the cross-America free trade zone, also
known as ALCA.
</P>
<P>
The merger will also fortify the negotiating weight and
positions of the two groups in regional and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Argentine President Carlos Menem, who hosted the signing
ceremony, said the merger was not only an economic but also a
political event with far-reaching effects. The merger was the
first step towards building a South American free trade
zone.

<HEADLINE> G-22 Agrees to Strengthen World Financial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Finance officials from the
Group of 22 countries and regions agreed on Thursday to strengthen
the international financial system in transparency, market
structure and the role of private sectors in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
The officials announced the formation of working groups to
contribute to international dialogue on how to proceed in these
areas.
</P>
<P>
United States Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin told the meeting
that creditors, investors and policy makers need more types of
information than in the past because of the complex global
financial markets of today.
</P>
<P>
"They also need to use that information well, and appropriately
balance risks and rewards," he added.
</P>
<P>
A brief statement, issued after the meeting, emphasized that
sound domestic policies are fundamental to healthy and robust
national economies and financial sectors, and increasingly to the
prospects for other countries and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis has been the focus of the spring
meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank. Crisis prevention and management are high on the agenda of
the meetings.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening, the Interim Committee of the IMF
adopted a series of guidelines in financial crisis prevention and
management.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Foreign Reserves Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's official foreign
reserves at the end of March were 27.7 billion U.S. dollars,
showing an increase of 900 million dollars from March 13,
according to the figures released by the Bank of Thailand
available Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the restructuring plan negotiated with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), Thailand must maintain official foreign
reserves of 23-25 billion dollars by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in reserves should be attributed to the foreign
capital inflows.
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks of March, the Bank of Thailand drew 300
million dollars in funds from the IMF rescue package, while
foreign capital inflow stood at 600 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> IMF Adopts Guidelines for Coping With Crises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) said on Thursday there was an urgent need to strengthen
the architecture of the international monetary system to prevent
and resolve any Asian-style currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the IMF's policy-setting Interim Committee, at
its 50th meeting, noted that strengthening the monetary system was
needed in light of globalization, which had brought clear benefit,
but at the same time posed challenges.
</P>
<P>
The committee stressed the importance of sound macroeconomic
policies and strong financial systems to guard against
vulnerability to shifts in market sentiment, and the contagious
effects of policy weaknesses in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The committee said action was also needed to strengthen
domestic financial systems by developing supervisory and
regulatory frameworks consistent with internationally accepted
practices, and strengthened standards for bank and non-bank
financial entities.
</P>
<P>
The committee called on the Fund to work with other concerned
institutions and organizations responsible for the development of
standards and guidelines. This would be in areas to consider how
best the Fund could assist in the dissemination of such standards
to the membership and to encourage members to adopt them.
</P>
<P>
The financial officials called for strengthened Fund
surveillance and recommendations. They said the Fund should
intensify its surveillance of financial sector issues and capital
flows, give particular attention to policy interdependence and
risks of contagion, and ensure that it is fully aware of market
views and perspectives.
</P>
<P>
The committee also suggested greater availability and
transparency of information for grading economic data and
policies. It underscored members' obligation to provide timely
and accurate data to the Fund.
</P>
<P>
The committee said the Fund should provide a timely response to
a crisis by playing a central role in crisis management. It
supported the establishment of the Supplemental Reserve Facility
and the use of emergency procedures in the Fund's rapid response
in support of countries in crisis.
</P>
<P>
On other issues, the committee also adopted a code of good
practices on fiscal transparency.

<HEADLINE> Preventing Fires in China's Largest Forest Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's largest forest zone, in
the Dahinggan Mountains, is on alert against forest fires, and
vehicle checkpoints have been set up at all entrances to check
individuals and motor vehicles entering the forest.
</P>
<P>
There are 12 forest protection airbases in northeastern China
that do overflights every day to spot possible fires and people
living in the zone have to abide by fuel usage regulations
strictly, especially on windy days. And, the forest police are
always on the alert.
</P>
<P>
Because of the El Nino effect, temperatures in the Dahinggan
Mountains at this time of year are two or three degrees higher
than normal. In addition, the ice and snow have melted more
quickly than usual because of dry and windy weather. As a result,
the threat of forest fires is growing, says Shi Yufeng, a fire
control official at the Dahinggan forest office.
</P>
<P>
A very large forest fire broke out in the forest zone in 1987,
and since that time, a number of small fires have been reported,
so the Chinese government is keeping a close eye on fire
prevention in the region.

TIRANA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Albania and the International
Monetary Fund signed a memorandum of understanding on Wednesday
that will lead to greater cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian Telegraphic Agency said the memo is designed to
pave way for the expected approval of a three-year bilateral
cooperative agreement named ESAF2. The ESAF2 is to be reviewed by
the IMF this May in Bonn, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The memo spelled out the macro-economic policy and economic
restructuring the Albanian government should carry out in the
first year of enacting ESAF2.
</P>
<P>
On October 7, 1997, Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano signed
a guarantee promising to satisfy all conditions set by the IMF and
other contributors in six months from the date of signature.
</P>
<P>
In consideration of the fact that Albania has delivered on its
promise, the IMF decided to sign ESAF2, a pact that would provide
hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in aid in three years.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Address Waste Problem on Earth Day '98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- In observance of Earth Day '98,
the Anti-Waste Import Society of Indonesia will hold a public
dialog on Indonesia's role as an importer of waste materials, an
official said.
</P>
<P>
Chairperson of the Earth Day '98 organizing committee Nur
Amalia said here Thursday the dialog will focus on the impact of
foreign waste materials on the Indonesian environment and people,
Antara News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that scavengers are particularly susceptible to
the dangers posed by foreign waste dumped in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Amalia said 40 percent of imported waste products, most of
which contain toxic substances, cannot be recycled and are
therefore a serious threat to man and the environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Environmental Impact Assessment Agency found about
500 containers of imported waste at several seaports.
</P>
<P>
The government and the House of Representatives responded
positively to the problem by issuing an environment law in 1997
which banned the import of industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists fear some unscrupulous Indonesians are
still making money by illegally importing waste.
</P>
<P>
To observe this year's Earth Day, artists, intellectuals and
non-governmental organizations under the umbrella of the
Indonesian Alliance for Better Earth and Human Life will hold a
program called "Earth Cleansing to Dispel Disasters".

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The 14 people injured in
yesterday morning's train-bus collision here are in stable
condition, according to a doctor at Fengtai Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed and four seriously injured at about
7:00 a.m. yesterday when a mini-bus carrying 17 people collided
with a locomotive at Wulidian near the Fengtai Railway Station on
the southwestern outskirts of the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation indicated that the cause of the
accident was the bus driver attempting to beat the oncoming train
to the road crossing.
</P>
<P>
The mini-bus was overturned and thrown to the side by the
violent impact, but trees at the side of the road prevented a
greater number of people from being killed, some experts believe.
</P>
<P>
All of the bus passengers were farmer-workers from Hebei
Province who were on their way to work. The injured people were
rushed to nearby Fengtai Hospital and the Beijing Emergency
Medical Center soon after the accident, and four are in serious
condition and one in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing government and various departments were involved in
the operations after the accident.

<HEADLINE> IMF Adopts Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund on Thursday adopted a code of good practices on fiscal
transparency as a step to averting future Asian-style currency
crises.
</P>
<P>
The action by the IMF's policy-setting Interim Committee
followed day-long discussions focusing on preventing and resolving
financial crises.
</P>
<P>
In a 15-page closing communique, the communique said, the new
code would "serve as a guide for members" on increasing the
quality and timeliness of reports on key economic indicators, such
as the amount of foreign debt a country holds, its trade deficit
and the size of its currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the IMF's spring meeting also discussed going much
further to give the institution more power to expose risky
financial practices.
</P>
<P>
The code requests government sector to be clearly distinguished
from the rest of the economy, and policy and management roles
within government should be well defined.
</P>
<P>
Under the code, there should be a clear legal and
administrative framework for fiscal management, and public should
be provided with full information on the past, current and
projected fiscal activity of government.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that budget documentation should specify fiscal
policy objectives, the macroeconomic framework, the policy basis
for the budget, and identifiable major fiscal risks.
</P>
<P>
On other practices, the code said, procedures for the execution
and monitoring of approved expenditures should be clearly
specified; and fiscal reporting should be timely, comprehensive,
reliable, and identify deviations from the budget.

<HEADLINE> Decorative Bricks Found In Ancient Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered a large number of bricks with moulded designs in
newly-uncovered tombs in northwest China's Shaanxi Province that
are believed to have been made 1,800 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 4-meter by 2.5-meter tombs are along a two-kilometer
stretch of road. They were built during the early Eastern Han
dynasty (25-220).
</P>
<P>
Ancient craftsmen carved rectangular caves in the rocks to keep
the tombs from the prying eyes of grave robbers, according to
archaeologists, who say that the most attractive thing is their
wall bricks, 50 cm. by 16 cm. by 6 cm., with moulded-on designs of
diamonds, dragons, fish, birds, pillars and palaces. They also say
that using moulded bricks for tomb decorations was quite rare in
early China. Some 1,000 such bricks have been found, the
archaelogists say.
</P>
<P>
A large number of funerary objects were also unearthed, like
pottery cooking utensils, bronze mirrors and ancient coins.

<HEADLINE> IMF Committee Urges Japan to Lead Asia Out of Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Leaders at an International
Monetary Fund committee meeting Thursday urged Japan to take
decisive action to stimulate their economy in an effort to help
Asia recover from the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said that a sustained
global expansion and recovery in Asia cannot be achieved while
Japan, the second largest economy in the world and accounting for
more than half of Asia's output, is in a recession and suffering
from a weakened financial system.
</P>
<P>
Rubin told the IMF's policy-making interim committee that
"Japan must generate substantial growth to help maintain an
expanding world economy and to absorb a growing share of imports
from emerging markets."
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus also said the
deterioration of Japan's position was clouding Asia's economic
prospects.
</P>
<P>
"To lift the Japanese economy and allow it to support activity
elsewhere in the region, forceful and credible actions are needed
to strengthen confidence, restructure the financial system and
move forward on the structural reform agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Vice Finance Minister Shozaburo Nakamura told the
committee that the Japanese government would do its utmost to help
its economy recover.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, which focused on finding ways to prevent future
crises in Asia, some officials suggested an expanded role for the
IMF, which stepped in with billions of dollars last year to help
out Asia's troubled economies.
</P>
<P>
Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Ciampi said the recent crises
have shown that we need better surveillance at the national,
regional and global levels over country macroeconomic policies.
</P>
<P>
The committee meeting also highlighted transparency, the need
to strengthen financial systems and the prospects for global
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Some major industrial countries called for reforms designed to
shore up a global financial system and give the IMF more power to
expose risky financial practices of member countries.

MEXICO CITY, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the past
few days:
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Mexican crudes for export registered a slight
rise after Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Mexico agreed to reduce the
amount of oil extracted.
</P>
<P>
The price of light crude went from 10.63 U.S. dollars to 10.92
dollars per barrel on March 15, while the Olmeca crude rose from
13.56 dollars to 13.93 dollars.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazilian oil production reached 1.3 million
barrels a day in March, a 1.37 percent increase over the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
The authorities plan to extract 1.7 million barrels a day
during the next five years. Oil consumption totals 1.7 million
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
MANAGUA -- Nicaragua banana exporting firms say they have lost
at least 400,000 U.S. dollars recently because of trucks being
blocked by former employees who were affected by an insecticide
used in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The former workers are demanding 10 million dollars for damages
caused by being exposed to nemagon, an insecticide used in the
1970s by the U.S. transnational company Standard Fruit Company.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Argentine agricultural production lost 1.5
billion dollars due to rains and floods caused by the "El Nino"
climate phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The damages affected 10 million hectares in the country and
50,000 producers, said Felipe Sola, minister of agriculture,
livestock, fishing, and food.
</P>
<P>
Sola estimated that Argentina will lose one million tons of
agricultural products in export, especially cotton and sunflower
seeds.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Chilean domestic sales of cement increased 13.2
percent during the first quarter of the year, compared with the
same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The sales of the product reached 25.3 million bags in the first
three months, but cement consuming is expected to diminish after
the second quarter because of the deceleration of the real estate
sector.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- The Brazilian government plans to triple the wheat
harvest in the next few years to meet the internal demand and
reduce imports.
</P>
<P>
The wheat harvest is expected to go from 2.3 million tons in
1998 to six million tons.

Wheat imports surpass five million tons and national consuming
is eight million tons a year.

<HEADLINE> Retrial For Former Italian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Italy's highest appeals court, the
Court of Cassation, annulled on Thursday an eight-year jail
sentence handed to former Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi
for kickbacks paid on construction work on Milan's metro.
</P>
<P>
Craxi's role in the 50-billion lire (29 million U.S. dollars)
corruption scandal will now be re-examined by Milan's Appeals
court, which upheld the sentence of eight years against Craxi in
June 1997.
</P>
<P>
Craxi, the Italian prime minister from 1983 to 1987, has been
living in self-imposed exile in Tunisia since 1993 when he fled
Italy amid several corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
He was also charged with receiving bribes in the short-lived
Enimont public-private chemicals merger between Eni and
Montedison, and the bankruptcy of the Bank Ambrosiano.
</P>
<P>
In annulling the sentence and ordering a retrial, the Court of
Cassation accepted Craxi's lawyers' argument that a revision in
the penal code made the previous ruling invalid.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Italian parliament approved changes to Article
513 of the penal code, making testimony given to prosecutors
during investigations invalid as evidence unless it is repeated in
court.
</P>
<P>
The key witness in the case against Craxi, alleged middleman
Silvano Larini, did not testify in any of the three trials.
</P>
<P>
"This ruling is crucially important," said defense lawyer Enzo
Lo Giudice.
</P>
<P>
"It paves the way for similar rulings in the Enimont and
Ambrosiano cases," he said.

Overseas Cooperative Fund. It will add three 20,000-dwt deep-water
berths with an annual handling capacity of 1.2 million tons to the
port.
</P>
<P>
Yangpu completed its first phase of construction work in 1991

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Enhances Supervision of Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Beginning this month, the Central
Bank of the Philippines will examine all banks annually to include
not just their parent companies but their subsidiaries and
affiliates.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Today reported on Friday that the measure,
approved by the central bank's policymaking Monetary Board, is
designed to further strengthen the central banks' supervision of
the banking sector and enhance transparency in the entire system.
</P>
<P>
"We need to see the extent of the exposure of one bank to any
risks," central bank deputy governor Alberto Reyes said, adding
that the central bank can't determine a bank's real level of
exposures and risks because it only looked at the financial
statements submitted by the bank's parent company.
</P>
<P>
The new rule will require central bank examiners to audit the
financial statements of parent banks and their subsidiaries and
affiliates simultaneously in case the banks could hide some of
their non-performing loans (NPLs) in the subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
NPLs are loans that are not paid in three consecutive months,
either in interest or principal. Too much NPLs in the banking
system is the cause of the financial crisis plaguing East and
Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> Vehicle Sales Drop to Lowest Level in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Vehicle sales in the first quarter
this year dropped to 23,475 units in the Philippines, the lowest
level since 1994, as a result of the current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Journal Friday reported that the figure was 39.4
percent lower than the year-ago level, saying this was a
reflection of the continuing impact of the financial storm and
high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
After the financial crisis began to plague the country last
July, bankers raised lending interest rates to the automotive
industry while reducing loans to customers.
</P>
<P>
Mario de Grano, secretary general of the Chamber of Automotive
Manufacturers of the Philippines, said the biggest drop was
registered by the passenger car sector with a significant 47.2
percent decline to only 11,085 units.
</P>
<P>
Commercial vehicle sales also went down by 30.1 percent as
total sales reached only 12,390 units.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Romania's national women's
gymnastics coach Octavian Belu said on Thursday he would leave his
country because he felt disappointed of the future of Romanian
gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
Belu, who would extend his national coaching to the European
championships in St. Petersburg next month and the Goodwill Games
in New York in July, said that Romanian gymnastics no longer has a
future.

Belu denied the suggest that he is to leave because of more
lucrative jobs offered abroad, saying that he was studying
proposals from Britain and the United States.

States, where he runs a specialised school now after he coached

<HEADLINE> Web Site Offers Details on US Companies' Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A Web site unveiled Wednesday
it could put more pressure on U.S. industry to reduce pollution
levels.
</P>
<P>
Assembled by the non-profit Environmental Defense Fund offices
in Oakland, Northern California, the new site allows Americans
with Internet access to locate polluting industries in their
neighborhood, research the amount of chemicals being released and
learn the risk. During its first five hours online, the site which
cost the fund one million dollars and a year of work, received
300,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
The site combines more than 150 government and university
databases onto a single location.
</P>
<P>
One of them is a list of 31,000 manufacturing plants and more
than 700 chemicals. The list, called the Toxic Release Inventory,
came from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has
since 1988 required all companies emitting pollutants into the
air, water and solid waste systems to submit annual reports
totaling the amount and type of emissions.
</P>
<P>
Now the new Web site delivers the information in a
user-friendly package. Users can enter the name of any company in
the United States and see whether it has released significant
amounts of pollutants. They can call up maps showing where all
major toxic polluters are in their towns, counties and states.
</P>
<P>
The user also can access rankings of the largest polluters by
any region, and link to peer-reviewed studies spelling out the
health risk of chemicals being released and what type of
government rules affect those chemicals. For major polluters, the
user can click on a form of letter that sends a free fax to the
company's plant manager, informing the firm that the user is aware
of the amount of pollution being put out and requesting that those
levels be reduced.
</P>
<P>
Public pressure has played a big role in urging industries to
reduce their pollution. Big industry, partly because of
accountability and public pressure, has dramatically reduced its
pollution levels over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Defense Fund was founded in 1967 by a group
of scientists and lawyers working to ban DDT. Now the group has
300,000 members, one-fifth of them in California.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Canadians are expecting to live
longer thanks to declines in the mortality rates for the leading
causes of death, Statistics Canada reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Canadian life expectancy at birth reached 81.4 years
for women and 75.5 for men, representing gains of 0.1 and 0.3
years over 1995 respectively.
</P>
<P>
And the gap in life expectancy at birth between men and women
continues to narrow, from 7.5 years in 1978 to 5.7 years in 1996,
the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
For men, the mortality rate declined for all major causes,
including cancer, heart disease, strokes, accidents, suicides and
HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
Yet, "the picture for women was somewhat less favorable," the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
While mortality rates dropped for heart disease, strokes and
accidents, cancer deaths continued to climb, especially lung
cancer. The suicide rate for women also rose in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Cancer and heart disease remained the two leading causes of
death in Canada, accounting for over half of all deaths in 1996.
</P>
<P>
They were followed by strokes, which accounted for seven
percent of all deaths.

<HEADLINE> Romania to negotiate new loan agreement with IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 16 (Xinhua) -- New Romanian government might
negotiate a new loan agreement with International Monetary Fund
(IMF), during talks with Poul Thomsen, IMF chief negotiator for
Romania, Minister of Finance Daniel Daianu told the press
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thomsen is expected in Bucharest next week. The current loan
agreement between Romania and IMF is to close in May, Daianu said.
The stand-by loan agreement was approved by IMF, on May 22, 1997,
for a 13 month period.
</P>
<P>
The loan is divided in five instalments. These instalments are
to be delivered only if economic and legislative criteria are
satisfied. So far, Romania has drawn two instalments. Late last
year, a political crisis occurred in Romania, and negotiations
with IMF were suspended.
</P>
<P>
Thomsen's February's visit to Romania ended without result.
Thomsen stated then that IMF's mission was to come back when
Romanian authorities would have a clear economic program.
</P>
<P>
Romania's new Prime Minister Radu Vasile declared IMF mission
was expected in Bucharest after Easter Holidays.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Calls for Africa's Debt Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday called on creditor countries to covert into
grants all the remaining official bilateral debt of the poorest
African countries.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was included in his 21-page report on Africa
submitted to the Security Council here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Africa's external debt totaled 328.9 billion U.S. dollars in
1995 alone, of which about 45 percent was owed to official
bilateral sources, 30 percent to official multilateral sources and
25 percent to commercial lenders, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Annan also urged creditors to consider clearing the entire debt
stock of the poorest African states as requested by the
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
He recommended that the next summit of the group of
industrialized countries consider eliminating trade barriers to
African products.
</P>
<P>
He requested that the Security Council meet every two years at
the ministerial level to assess efforts undertaken and actions
needed to support peace and development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The council, he said, should consider convening a summit-level
session for the same purpose within five years.
</P>
<P>
The council requested at its session last September that the
secretary-general make a report to analyze the causes of African
conflict and to recommend ways of keeping peace and sustaining
development in the continent.
</P>
<P>
It will debate the report Friday next week.

<HEADLINE> Increase of Drug Abuse in Moldova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 27 tons of opium poppy
circulates illegally every year in the Republic of Moldova, of
which only 10 percent is confiscated by the police, according to
sources of the Moldovan Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Tudor Sabii, chief of the Judiciary Police Direction within the
ministry, said that 1,769 persons in Moldova have been found using
opium poppy.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the police confiscated
132,546 kg of opium poppy and 225 kg of opium extract, which are,
according to Sabii, not an important quantity.
</P>
<P>
According to the same source, some 80 percent of the drug
abusers are between 15 and 34 years old, and 70 percent of them
are out of work. A total of 209 crimes influenced by drug abuse
have been registered since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Alexandru Maleev, chairman of the Drug Free Foundation,
considered that the total number of drug abusers in Moldova
outruns 170,000.

<HEADLINE> Starr Wants Discussion with Reno on Whitewater Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr Thursday asked for a meeting with Attorney General Janet
Reno to resolve issues about a possible conflict of interest
between Starr and a key Whitewater witness.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Reno, Starr said both he and the Justice
Department may appear to have a conflict of interest if they
launch an investigation into whether Arkansas attorney David Hale
"received cash and other gratuities from individuals seeking to
discredit the president."
</P>
<P>
He said he has ideas for "alternate mechanisms" for
investigation, which he would like to discuss with Reno.
</P>
<P>
Hale, who ran a firm that handled Small Business Administration
loans, said then-Governor Bill Clinton pressured him into making
an improper loan that benefited the governor and his business
partners.
</P>
<P>
His testimony was key to the convictions of former Arkansas
Governor Jim Guy Tucker and Clinton's friends.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. attorney in Arkansas had conducted an investigation into
media reports that Hale received cash payments from wealthy
conservative publisher and Clinton foe Richard Mellon Scaife from
1994 to 1996. But last week, Reno's deputy attorney general, Eric
Holder, told Starr a probe of the allegations must, by law, be
done by the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, in an effort to avoid the appearance of
conflict of interest, Starr withdrew from a post being held open
for him at Pepperdine University because it was largely funded by
Scaife.
</P>
<P>
Holder advised Starr in a letter last week that he could refer
the investigation back to the Justice Department if he deemed
there were a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
In today's letter to Reno, Starr said, "all FBI-supervised
contacts" between Hale and the man who allegedly made the payments
occurred before he became independent counsel in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
But Starr said after reviewing the allegations, he concluded
that any investigation by his office "may involve at most the
appearance of a conflict of interest."
</P>
<P>
Starr said conflicts would arise in any Justice Department Hale
probe because the department is by law banned from investigating
the independent counsel's office, because Hale provided
"information damaging to the president of the United States," and
because department officials supervised the FBI agents prior to
August 1994.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends Permit for Iraq's Import of Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday recommended that Iraq be allowed to import 300
million U.S. dollars worth of oil facilities to promote its oil
export capacity.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council of the United Nations,
the secretary-general said Iraq's oil facilities have been
dilapidated and even if emergency repairs were carried out, it can
only export 3 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over any six
months in 1998, far less than the 5.2 billion dollars agreed by
the Security Council under the new "oil-for-food" program.
</P>
<P>
Annan also recommended the Security Council lower Iraq's oil
export allowance to 4 billion, beginning in June and ending in
December, and review the sum again later in the year, depending on
the arrival of the needed equipment.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief's recommendations were based on the report by a
group of U.N. oil experts who visited Iraq in March.

NEW YORK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose sharply

changed hands at 131.79 yen, up from 129.36 yen.
</P>
<P>
Finance officials of the major industrial nations met in

financial crisis and Japan's ailing economy in particular. They
urged Japan to produce more forceful plans that convince
international markets or authorities about its ability to revive
the economy, but failed to offer concrete help.
</P>

However, Japan did intervene aggressively in foreign exchange

BONN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
on Thursday criticized Belgrade's continued resistance to foreign
intervention in the Kosovo conflict and threatened new sanctions
against Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German radio Deutschlandfunk, Kinkel

foreign participation in a political dialogue over the future
status of Kosovo was "a step in the wrong direction and a new
obstacle to the end of the conflicts".

Kinkel also warned that the international contact group could
move to impose new punitive measures on Belgrade if their demands
were not met.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Ljubisa Ristic, who chairs the foreign committee of
the Yugoslav parliament, said in Bonn on Thursday that a foreign
part in the solution of Kosovo conflict would be only acceptable
when Yugoslavia was admitted back into international
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Asks Passengers to Remain Buckled Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Air Canada, the largest airline of
the country, said Thursday that its passengers will now be
required to stay buckled up throughout the flight.
</P>
<P>
The new seat belt requirement, the first for an airline in
Canada, becomes effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
The new rule is meant to reduce the chance of injuries
resulting from clear-air turbulence, unpredictable air currents
caused by distant storm clouds and wind passing over mountains,
the airline said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a United Airlines flight from Tokyo to Hawaii ran
into unexpected severe turbulence, causing one death and several
severe injuries.
</P>
<P>
"Air Canada has always recommended that people remain buckled
up while in their seats," said Robert Milton, executive vice
president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
"Ensuring our customers' safety at all times is our number one
priority and today's announcement reflects that commitment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Transport Canada requires passengers to ensure
their seat belts are fastened during take-off and landing, and at
any time they are asked to do so by the pilot-in-command.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Party Pledges Job Creation, Tax Cut, Social </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party Thursday pledged to push
forward major tax and social welfare reforms and to attach top
priority to combating the country's record-high unemployment after
winning the general elections in September this year.
</P>
<P>
In an economic program presented by CDU politician and German
Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann, the CDU stressed that it
would hold on to its ambitious 30 billion mark (16 billion U.S.
dollar) tax cut package which was foiled by the main opposition
Social Democratic Party (SPD) last year.
</P>
<P>
If it won the September elections, the CDU would also seek to
reduce the social security contributions from the current level of
42 percent to below 40 percent within four years, Wissmann said.
</P>
<P>
The top priority for the party's future economic policy would
be job creation, Wissmann told a news conference in Bonn Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the current economic upswing, Germany's unemployment
has been hovering at record levels of around 4.8 million for more
than one year and has become a major rebuff for Kohl's ruling
party which has been in power since 1982.
</P>
<P>
Apart from tax and social welfare reforms, the CDU Thursday
also proposed a number of other measures to help create jobs,
including more state assistance to small- and medium-sized
enterprises and high-tech companies, and to encourage young people
to take risks to found their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Local communities were also called upon to create jobs for all
social welfare recipients in a bid to reduce their dependence on
the state.
</P>
<P>
Despite their policy differences, both the CDU and the SPD have
chosen unemployment as the top issue for their election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the SPD is due to hold a one-day party congress in
the eastern German city of Leipzig to formally endorse Gerhard
Schroeder as the party's chancellor candidate and to adopt the
party's election platform.

<HEADLINE> Jones to Appeal Case Against Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Paula Corbin Jones said
Thursday she will appeal a federal judge's decision to dismiss her
sexual harassment lawsuit against U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Jones made the announcement at a news conference called by her
attorneys in Dallas, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Jones said she was "shocked" by U.S. District Judge Susan
Webber Wright's decision to dismiss the suit on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Jones alleged that Clinton propositioned her in a hotel room in
Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1991, when he was governor and she was a
state employee. She said she refused his advances and that her
career suffered as a result. The president strongly denies the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
Jones said her attorneys advised her that there are "very
strong" grounds to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Wright dismissed the case, saying that even if Jones's
allegations are true, she failed to prove she had been materially
damaged by rebuffing Clinton's advances.
</P>
<P>
The president's supporters anticipated the appeal. "We are
confident that the appellate court will not permit Paula Jones and
her supporters to pursue this case," Clinton's attorney, Robert S.
Bennett, said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that our legal system can nonetheless
continued to be abused by Mrs. Jones' political and financial
supporters who wish to harm the president," Bennett said.

<HEADLINE> Moldova: Misappropriation, Main Cause of Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 80 percent of all grave
crimes in the Republic of Moldova are committed for the purpose of
misappropriation, the Moldovan news agency BASA-PRESS quoted a
report of the Interior Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, the state and the
population have lost more than 29 million Moldovan lei (6.17
million U.S. dollars), of which only 1.31 million lei (278,723.4
dollars) was recovered by the police.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that 60 percent of crimes and offenses
registered by the police are thefts from private property, in
particular from apartments. According to statistics, individuals
lost in thefts since the beginning of this year at least 11.5
million lei (2.45 million dollars). As compared with the same
period of 1997 this sum was 4.5 million lei (957,446.8 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Many criminal groups in Moldova are specialized in car theft on
order, according to Andrei Vataman, deputy chief of the criminal
police direction at the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The rate of discovery is too low, the police complain, only 24
percent.
