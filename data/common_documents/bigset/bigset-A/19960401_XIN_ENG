<HEADLINE> Continued Efforts Urged To Eradicate Guinea Worm In Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Participants in the African
Conference on Guinea worm at the week-end in the Ghanaian capital
Accra called for financial an political commitments in a renewed
crusade to stamp out the disease in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The participants, who made the call at the end of a three-day
meeting, jointly organized by the WHO, global 2000 and UNICEF,
also called for the continued support from the various partners
and donors in the fight for Guinea worm eradication.
</P>
<P>
They said that communities should be provided with safe water
supply systems, while all endemic countries which are nearing
eradication should each consider establishing a national
committee for certification.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that in countries where there are civil strifes,
appropriate authorities should initiate talks to negotiate peace
and accelerate program activities, as Guinea worm is difficult to
eradicate in the presence of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
They recommended that imported cases of Guinea worm should be
reported to the WHO and as for the exporting country, each should
also establish a reward system to ensure that no Guinea worm case
escaped detection.
</P>
<P>
Although the WHO and African countries set 1995 as the target
date for the complete elimination of the disease, the 16 endemic
African countries have achieved 95 percent reduction since
intervention began in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Hijackers Say They Want Political Asylum in Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The three Egyptian hijackers who
commandeered an EgyptAir plane to Libya Wednesday said today that
they had wanted to request political asylum from the Libyan
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Mahmoud Hamid, his teenager son and nephew seized the
Airbus A320 of EgyptAir after boarded the plane in Egypt's
southern city of Luxor. They later surrendered to the Libyan
authorities, which turned them over to Egypt Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to their confessions today to Higher State Security
Prosecutor Hisham Saraya, Hamid asked his son and nephew to help
him take an action that would give credit to his clan, Beni Hilal.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor charged the three men with air piracy,
possession of explosives and endangering the lives of passengers,
Egypt's state-run Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported. Saraya
ordered them detained for 15 days pending further interrogation.
</P>
<P>
The charges could carry the death penalty, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The son and the nephew said they bought the explosives from an
arms dealer.
</P>
<P>
The two teenagers were also quoted as saying that Hamid put
gunpowder, fuses, inflammables, three bottles of brandy and a
knife inside his suitcase.
</P>
<P>
They said that only after they boarded the plane and took first
class seats then Hamid told them that they were to hijack the
plane to Libya.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers also said to the prosecutor that Hamid and his
son entered the cockpit and ordered the pilot to fly to Libya,
according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
The pilot obeyed after Hamid and his son sprinkled some
gunpowder on the cockpit's floor, put some more in bottles and
fitted one with a fuse to make a Molotov cocktail, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that only Hamid forced his way into the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers said that they started to negotiate with Libyan
officials after the plane landed. They surrendered although their
request for political asylum was turned down, they told the
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
The hijacked plane was on its way from the Saudi Arabian city
of Jeddah to Cairo with a stopover in Luxor.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Interior Minister Hassan Mohamed el-Alfy has said that
Hamid, the 42-year-old owner of a restaurant in Luxor, is mentally
deranged and an addict of narcotics and alcohol.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Chairman Meets Russian Duma Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao Shi
said here today that strengthening friendly, good-neighborly and
mutually beneficial cooperative ties with Russia is a major part
of China's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, made the remark when meeting Gennady Seleznev,
chairman of Russia's State Duma, or lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said frequent exchange of visits and contacts between
leaders of the two countries have laid a solid foundation for a
lasting good-neighborly relationship.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev, for his part, said developing friendly and
cooperative relations with China is one of the priorities of
Russia's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the State Duma's stance that there is only one
China and that the Duma's contacts with Taiwan are unofficial.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, who arrived here Sunday after concluding a four-day visit
to Ukraine, said developing a Sino-Russian constructive
partnership with a strategic view towards the 21st century would
not only benefit both countries and peoples, but would also
conduce to peace, stability and development in the Asia-Pacific
and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
He said both the NPC and Russia's parliament are playing a very
important role in constructing a lasting and stable
good-neighborly relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said China and Russia, both permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council with major influence in world affairs, hold the
same or similar views on many international issues.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, the two sides have strengthened consultations
and dialogues on many important issues," Qiao said, citing
Russia's vote last year in favor of China during the U.N.
conference on human rights and expressing China's thanks.
</P>
<P>
After Moscow, Qiao will also visit St. Petersburg before
leaving for a stop over in Greece to continue his current tour,
which will also take him to Cuba and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Peres Visits Oman, Holds Talks with Qaboos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres and Sultan Qaboos of Oman today affirmed their commitment to
a "just, comprehensive and permanent peace" to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who is currently on his first visit to Oman, held talks
today with Qaboos in the Sultanate's southern resort city of
Salalah, some 1,000 kilometers south of the Omani capital Muscat,
reported the Omani News Agency monitored here.
</P>
<P>
Peres is the second Israeli government head to visit the
Sultanate, with which Israel has not yet established diplomatic
ties. His predecessor, the late Yitzhak Rabin, secretly visited
Oman in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued after the summit said the Qaboos-Peres
talks focused on regional issues and ways to boost bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both Qaboos and Peres have expressed their willingness to
support the Middle East peace process and to promote bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
The Qaboos-Peres talks also focused on the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations and the need to provide urgent regional and
international assistance to the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Qaboos expressed his deep concern over the current condition of
the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
following a wave of suicide bombing attacks in Israel since
February 25. The closure, which barred at least 60,000
Palestinians from getting to their jobs in Israel, has paralyzed
most Palestinian industry and provoked food shortages.
</P>
<P>
Peres expressed his determination to find ways and means to
overcome these circumstances, said the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
Peres is scheduled to visit Qatar Tuesday to meet with Qatari
Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani. It will be the first ever
visit by an Israeli leader to Qatar.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Oman and Qatar announced the establishment of
commercial ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Oman and Qatar are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) which also groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE).

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon Facing Internal Embarrassment  before French President's Visit (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Only three days before a
historical visit by French President Jacques Chirac to Lebanon, a
Lebanese confederation of trade unions took a further step in its
preparation for a protest sit-in in front of the Parliament on
April 4.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese powerful General Workers Confederation (GWC)
handed over today to the Interior Ministry and the Council of
Deputies a notification on the sit-in, which was deliberately
timed to coincide with an speech to be made by Chirac in the
128-seat Lebanese Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"To protest againt the government's failure to meet demands of
the workers and the people, the GWC Executive Committee, in its
meeting on March 29, took the decision to call a protest sit-in on
April 4 starting from 4 o'clock in the afternoon," said the
written notification to the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In a similar notification to House Speaker Nabih Berri, the
GWC defended its choice for the venue where the sit-in will take
place.
</P>
<P>
"The General Workers Confederation sees in the Council of
Deputies the competent authority capable to correct the track of
the government and its intention to ignore the righteous
demands," it argued.
</P>
<P>
It called on the Parliament to give instructions to keep a
peace character of the sit-in and show the "democratic face" which
characterizes Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But the notification refrained from clarifying why the GWC
decided to stage the sit-in on the occasion of Chirac's visit to
the Lebanese Parliament rather than on other days.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued following a meeting of the GWC leaders
today, President of the confederation Elias Abu Rizk expressed a
"strong astonishment" for a wide-scale campaign led by the
authority againt the decision of the GWC Executive Committee to
stage the "peaceful" protest sit-in.
</P>
<P>
"The GWC is astonished by this organized campaign against it
and it reminds the government and all the officials that Lebanon
is a democratic free country allowing the freedom of expression in
all forms, and the sit-in is nothing but the simplest of these
forms," the GWC president said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the workers' demand for a 76 percent increase
of the wage with a retroactivity to January 1, 1996, and the
doubling of the minimum level to 500,000 Lebanese pounds (313
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the GWC decision, House Speaker Berri stressed the
significance of the "historical" visit by French President Chirac
to Lebanon as well as to the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The visit from April 4 to 6 will be the first by a French head
of state since Lebanon's independence in 1943 from the French
mandate.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the sit-in planned by the GWC is "wrongly
timed" and vowed to prevent it from taking place.
</P>
<P>
Berri was quoted by the private Central News Agency as saying
that the sit-in would damage the reputation of Lebanon and the
Lebanese, noting that he is ready to receive the protectors at
any time to listen to their demands in order not to let the
sit-in interrupt Chirac's visit.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the visit and to avert the embarrassment
threatened by the GWC sit-in plan, Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi, House Speaker Berri and Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri
held a meeting Sunday night, the first gathering of the "troika"
since last December.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed official sources said that the three top
leaders discussed possible concessions the government could offer
to the trade unions.
</P>
<P>
The sources said a regular session of the Council of Ministers
to be held Wednesday will be decisive to avoid the embarrassment
for the government before its French honored guest.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 1 (Xinhua)-- Zambian cabinet has approved the
lease of state-owned lodges and camps situated in national parks
to boost tourism in the country, Tourism Minister Gabriel Maka
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Maka said the leasehold period of the lodges had been put at
25 years while undeveloped seasonal camps could be leased for
five years.
</P>
<P>
Three major lodges currently managed by the National Hotels
and Development Corporation (NHDC), namely the Kasaba By, Nkamba
and Mfuwe lodges, had successfully been negotiated by a local
investor and two others from Europe and South Africa separately,
Maka said.
</P>
<P>
However, he observed that some amount of value in the lease of
the lodges might have been lost because of the delay in approving
the leaseholds.
</P>
<P>
He also advised the successful bidders to conduct their
business within the specified agreements or risk their leaseholds
be withdrawn without exception.
</P>
<P>
In the past several months, local tourist operators have urged
the cabinet to approve the lease of state-owned lodges and camps
in various national parks so as to inject new vitality into the
sector. enditem

<HEADLINE> Brittan Calls for Stronger EU Business Presence in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Leon Brittan, Vice President of the
European Commission, admitted here today that European investors
have underestimated growth potential in Asia and their lukewarm
attitude towards the fastest growing region so far has placed them
at a disadvantage in the battle for global competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Brittan made the comment towards more than 40 European
businessmen and experts attending a half-day seminar here Monday
which was designed to analyze EU investment practice in Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued in March jointly by the European
Commission and the UN Conference on Trade and Development, which
co-organized the seminar, the EU has lagged behind the United
States and Japan in its direct investment in Asia, the fastest
growing region which has attracted over half of all foreign direct
investment in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Europe has been increasing its share of investment flows in the
case of some Asian economies such as Korea and Singapore, but its
share of new investments in countries such as China has declined
in the past 10 years as has the European share in Southeast Asian
countries overall, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the analysis of the report, Brittan admitted that
European companies, which preferred to invest closer to home and
relying more on direct exports to Asia than on building on
extensive sales networks there, was in fact "slow in recognizing
that important changes had taken place" in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"It reflects strategic decision-making rather than an inability
to invest," Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the EU enlargement and the economic reforms of
Central and Eastern Europe had created "large pools of potential
new business close to home, which European companies were right to
explore".
</P>
<P>
"This has not always been a losing strategy," Brittan stressed,
but adding that "overall this has placed European firms at
something of a disadvantage in the medium term battle for
survival, because those firms which have networks throughout the
region will have a continued competitive edge over those firms who
only trade in the Asian region".
</P>
<P>
In order correct the current trend, Brittan called on European
firms to take a more offensive attitude in Asia, and consider
several ways of increasing their presence in the region, notably
by:
</P>
<P>
-- Building on existing strong positions in some Asian
countries and making use of their knowledge of neighboring
markets and cultural linkages to facilitate entry to unexplored
parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
-- Making use of the openings provided by the substantial
infrastructure projects in Asia in order to establish a long-term
presence in the region in stead of "a transient presence on the
spot".
</P>
<P>
-- Exploiting the potential of technological partnerships,
joint ventures and other sorts of strategic cooperation. In this
field in particular small and medium-sized companies can be as
well placed as larger firms to develop long-term strategies.
</P>
<P>
-- Closer cooperation with local partners as a way to make full
and efficient use of the various investment promotion progrms
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
As for the policy of the European governments, the EU
vice-president advocated more official contact between the two
regions, such as the European-Asia Summit took place in Bangkok in
March, as an effort to promote mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
He also encouraged European governments to fund the training of
European managers in countries such as China and Korea as well as
the establishment of one or more Europe-Asia Management Center in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Beyond all those initiative, he said, there is also a need for
further liberalization of foreign direct investment, through the
creation of a better international framework of rules.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Substances of Human Organism Soon to Be Decoded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Scientists will soon be able to
decode the full genetic substances of the human organism allowing
them to prevent diseases and expand the human life span, Greek
researcher Dimitris Nanopoulos told reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
Nanopoulos' theory, based on the latest discovery that neurons
have a similar structure to atoms thus allowing the use of quantum
mechanics in the decoding of human brain operations, will provide
the key in the immediate future to the understanding of such
operations as memory and decision making and lead to new ways to
deal with the quantum disease.
</P>
<P>
Nanopoulos, a U.S.-based genetic researcher, said the use of
quantum mechanics equipped modern scientists with the ability to
decode the secrets of the human brain operations.
</P>
<P>
"Today, researchers are in a position to apply simultaneously
for the first time the laws of physics, microcosm and brain
biology," Nanopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
Nanopoulos' theory is based on the interaction of the basic
substances of neurons. It has been recently discovered that
neurons have a similar structure to atoms which comprise a
nucleus and electrons, thus allowing for the application of
quantum mechanics.
</P>
<P>
This discovery will help scientists understand the operation of
the brain and provide greater insight to the treatment of
neurological ailments, Nanopoulos added.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- At least 1,353 people were
murdered in South Africa's Gauteng Province in January and
February this year and 1,088 in Kwazulu/Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
A report from the South African Press Association said today
that Kwazulu/Natal has a nickname as the killing field of South
Africa due to the political, ethnical and other criminal
violences.
</P>
<P>
Official figures said 6,792 people were murdered in
Kwazulu/Natal in 1994, as compared with 7,254 last year.
</P>
<P>
However, this was disputed by Kwazulu/natal's police
spokesman, who said political killings in the province peaked
before the 1994 general elections, but had since then fallen
significantly.
</P>
<P>
Reports say the political violence between the African
National Congress and its rival Inkatha Freedom Party in
Kwazulu/Natal had claimed about 20,000 lives since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
The police claimed that a pattern was being developed with the
approach of the local government elections in the province
scheduled for May 29, political murders were again on the rise.

<P>
BEIRUT, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Canadian Senate
Gildas Molgat pledged here today his country's support for
U.N. resolution 425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Molgat said that Canada always holds the position supporting
the U.N. Security Council resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Molgat also said that his visit to Lebanon would help promote
parliamentary relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Molgat made the remarks after meeting with Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik al Hariri and Foreign Minister
Fares Boueiz. He will be present at a banquet held in his honor by
Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri this evening.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with the Lebanese president, the Canadian
speaker disclosed that the meeting was focused on the ongoing
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that talks dealt with the problem of Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon, and Canada hopes that an agreement satisfying
all the parties would be reached.
</P>
<P>
He added that the basic reason for his visit to Lebanon is to
strengthen the parliamentary relations between the two
countries. "We are of course concerned with the problems of
economy and labor," he said.
</P>
<P>
On a settlement to the problem of refugees, the Canadian
official underlined that a continuity of work in order to reach
the peace in the region is "basic" for a solution to of this
problem.
</P>

Syria and Israel would resume soon.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a Lebanese fear of a possibility that a
re-settlement of the Palestinian refugees is imposed on Lebanon,
Molgat said that an agreement acceptable to all parties should be
found.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, Canada is working effectively within the
peace program here and in the Middle East region," he
emphasized. Canada is currently chairman of the refugee committee
of the multi-national peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Molgat is scheduled to leave this country Tuesday night for

<HEADLINE> UK Anti-Terrorist Laws to Be Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
plans this afternoon for the extension of the Prevention of
Terrorism Act.
</P>
<P>
UK Home Secretary Michael Howard said in the parliament that
police on mainland Britain would be given some new power as police
in Northern Ireland already have to combat terrorism following the
shattering of the truce by the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
Howard told the House of Commons that he proposed five changes
to the Act, including measures on stop and search of pedestrians
and on searches of premises and unaccompanied freight, to set up
cordons to block access and to restrict parking and remove
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
He said these measures arise from police experience during the
last IRA bombing campaign as well as more recent attacks in
London.
</P>
<P>
Howard said these measures could enable police to detect small
bombs that would be carried out in a coat pocket.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "a real threat of a continuing IRA campaign of
murder" still existed, and "it is the government's clear duty to
take every step possible to meet that threat".
</P>
<P>
The IRA shattered its 17-month cease-fire with a bomb explosion
in east London on February 9, killing two and injuring more than
100.
</P>
<P>
Since than the IRA planted another three bombs. One donated on
a bus, killing the bomber himself, wounding eight, another
exploded in a litter bin. A third was found unexploded in a
telephone box in central London.

<HEADLINE> Death Of "Deputy Minister" Causes Confusion In Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The death of a senior official
of the selfstyled government of Mohamed Farah Aidid has created a
lot of confusion in the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
Elmi Nur Sharmarke, 68, Deputy Minster of the Resettlement and
Rehabilitation Ministry of Aidid died two days ago in South
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Radio North Mogadishu supporting faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed has said Sharmarke was murdered deliberately by the
supporters of Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the politically motivated killing followed
Sharmarke's hesitation in collaboration with Aidid over the
ongoing war in Bay and Bakol regions between the forces of Aidid
and the Rahanwein Resistance Army.
</P>
<P>
The funeral of Sharmarke was attended by high ranking
officials from the Aidid administration, including "Deputy
President" Mohamed Nur Aliyow and "Justice Minister" Hussein Abdi
Alasow.
</P>
<P>
At the funeral, both Aliyow and Alasow said Sharmarke's death
was a natural one and it was a great loss of their "government".
</P>
<P>
However, Omar Ibrahim Ali, 35, the nephew of Sharmarke
challenged. He said he observed a puddle of clogged blood at the
head of his uncle's bed, a bruise and swell on the forehead of
his uncle and a sign of a rope tightly tied on the shoulders of
the body, while washing his uncle's body.
</P>
<P>
"All these evidenced me that my uncle was killed," he said,
adding that his uncle was obviously tortured before dying.
</P>
<P>
Ali said his uncle was against the continuous occupation of
Aidid's forces in Baidoa and Huddur. "I believe my uncle has
asked General Aidid to withdraw from the Rahanwein territories."
</P>
<P>
The family of Sharmarke had asked the Aidid government to let
them bury Sharmarke's body. However, Aidid said the man should be
buried as a national figure by his government.
</P>
<P>
The family of Sharmarke had also asked for a legal doctor to
examine the body or an autopsy to be performed before the burial,
but this was also refused by the Aidid administration.
</P>
<P>
Aidid's supporters said if Sharmarke was killed, the
perpetrators should be the United Somali Congress Peace Movement
(USC/PM), who supports North Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
Sharmarke was lonely and felt isolated when all his clansmen
refrained from the Aidid government following their bitter
fighting for the control of Hiran Region with the Habar Gidir
militiamen of Aidid in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Sharmarke, from the Hawadle clan of Hawiye, which both Ali
Mahdi and Aidid belong to, left Somalia only three days after the
late dictator Siad Barre came to power on October 21, 1969.
</P>
<P>
Sharmarke, a former lieutenant colonel in the national army of
Somalia, once studied in Russia and later on took specialization
courses in the Military Academy of Cairo, Egypt. He returned back
to Somalia after Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991.

HEFEI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Insurance is still new to most
Chinese farmers, but some two million farmers in east China's
Anhui Province have already bought old-age policies, with
premiums totalling 220 million yuan (about 27 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Buying old-age insurance is reportedly popular in 95 percent of

province, with people paying mainly with their own funds and
supplemented by local collective economies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Down in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Construction spending in U.S.
fell by 0.9 percent in February, the biggest decline in nine
months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that spending on residential,
nonresidential and public projects totaled 534.9 billion dollars
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in February, down from 539.8
billion in January.
</P>
<P>
It was the first decline since the spending fell 0.5 percent in
November and the biggest since a 1.5 percent drop last May.
</P>
<P>
The department also revised the U.S. construction spending in
January to an increase of 0.9 percent, stronger than the 0.3
percent announced earlier. Spending had risen 0.6 percent in
December.
</P>
<P>
In February, residential spending, 45 percent of the total, was
unchanged after slipping 0.2 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Nonresidential spending was down 1.2 percent, including drops
of 2 percent for industrial buildings and 1.6 percent for the
other commercial building that includes shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
Government outlays, another volatile sector, plunged 2.2
percent after rising 1.9 percent in January. It was the biggest
drop since spending fell 3.8 percent in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
Outlays for public projects are expected to remain weak this
year because of cutbacks in government spending.

<HEADLINE> Pneumonia Is Main Killer of Children in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 1 (Xinhua) -- About 75 percent of Acute
Respiratory Infections (ARI) deaths in children below five in
Pakistan are caused by pneumonia, said Dr. Abdul Bari at the
Pakistan Institute of Medical Science (PIMS) here today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to local reporters, Bari, who is deputy national
program manager of Federal ARI Cell in Children's Hospital of
PIMS, said about 250,000 children below five in Pakistan die of
pneumonia annually.
</P>
<P>
He said diseases including diphtheria, whooping cough,
tuberculosis and measles were directly or indirectly linked with
deaths due to pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
The causes of pneumonia were chilly weather, low birth weight,
pollution, over-crowding and lack of immunization and deficiency
of Vitamin A, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
On the ARI program, Bari said it was launched in November 1989
by the Ministry of Health with the cooperation of the World Health
Organization (WHO) and has two main objectives.
</P>
<P>
The first is to reduce the mortality of children below five due
to pneumonia and the second is to rationalize the use of
antibiotics and other drugs in ARI.

<HEADLINE> UK Has Unanimous EU Support over BSE Crisis: Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
told the parliament today that Britain has received unanimous
support from the European Union over the BSE crisis, known as the
mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Major said all heads of government at the Inter-Governmental
Conference in Turin voiced readiness to see the EU share the
financial burden of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He told the parliament members that he had also urged the EU to
create conditions speedily to lift its worldwide ban on British
beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister once again stressed that British beef was
safe and he criticized the "unnecessary hysteria" in Europe over
the BSE scare.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg raised
proposals today for the slaughter of up to 15,000 cattles a week
for the next six years in a bid to wipe out BSE.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with his EU partners in Luxembourg, Hogg said all
animals over 30-month-old would be killed and incinerated, and
this move would help restore public confidence.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Hogg was also seeking financial help from the
EU to pay for the slaughter policy and called for an end to the EU
ban on British beef exports.

<HEADLINE> Three MQM Activists Killed in Karachi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 1 (Xinhua) -- An party activist of the ethnic
Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), Zubair Chota, was killed in an
encounter with police in Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Associated Press of Pakistan, Zubair,
a sector officer of the MQM (Altaf Group) in Karachi, and his
followers were busy taking "protection money" from shopkeepers
when the police, on a tip, reached the area.
</P>
<P>
The police were reportedly fired upon by the MQM activists and
Zubari was killed when police returned fire.
</P>
<P>
His followers fled under the cover of fire.
</P>
<P>
According to police files, Zubari, allegedly a hard-core
terrorist of MQM (A), was involved in killing of 33 people,
including members of law enforcing agencies.
</P>
<P>
He was wanted by police for involvement in 14 different cases
of killing, kidnapping, dacoity and sniper firing.
</P>
<P>
Another two MQM (A) activists were killed in a different
encounter with police in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Both of them were wanted in different cases and one of them was
a follower of Zubair.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said weapons were recovered from their bodies.
</P>
<P>
Since last Thursday, four MQM (A) activists, all of them wanted
in different cases, were killed in separate encounters with the
police.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have accused the Pakistani government of
resorting ex-judiciary killings in Karachi, a violence-gripped
city where more than 1,800 people were killed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government has denied the accusations and is determined to
restore peace in Pakistan's largest city and economic center.
</P>
<P>
The violence stems from differences between the government and
the MQM (A).
</P>
<P>
The government has blamed the MQM (A) for the city's violence
while the MQM (A) has accused the government of political
victimization.

CHANGCHUN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China plans to increase its
spring corn output by 2.5 billion kilograms this year, according
to a working conference on corn production held here recently.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chengguo, vice-minister of agriculture, said that local
governments have paid close attention to spring planting and
farmers are enthusiastic for farm prodution, which will lay a
strong foundation for the harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there are still problems in the planting,
such as drought and lack of input from farmers.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, he added, farmers complain of low prices of corn
but high prices for agricultural goods.
</P>
<P>
Calling the spring planting a "key task", Liu urged local
governments to make a greater effort.
</P>
<P>
Difficulties in the selling of corn are a temporary phenomenon
and can be solved, and that corn is a major raw material for
animal husbandry and for some industrial production, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> UK Teaching Union to Stress School Discipline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain's one of the leading
teaching unionis will stressed the importance of school discipline
and security today in its annual conference in the wake of growing
violent assaults on Teachers.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) in its annual
conference to be convened in Torquay, Devonshire, will bring into
focus violence against teachers and measures to be combat it,
according to reports here.
</P>
<P>
A survey issued last week by ATL revealed that nine of ten
teachers believe pupils behavior is getting worse and 50 percent
of those questioned said that pupil behavior is worse than it was
15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 293 assaults by pupils and parents have
occurred across Britain in the past year.
</P>
<P>
And in the past three months, a teacher and her 16 pupils were
killed in Dunblane, central Scotland, and a headmaster in London
was murdered outside his school gates as he tried to protect a
pupil from attacks by a gang.
</P>
<P>
The ATL wants the government to compile national statistics on
assaults on teachers as the first step to addressing the problems
of security and discipline in schools.
</P>
<P>
The association will also call for new investigative procedures
to protect teachers against malicious allegations of abuse by
pupils as these accusations often perpetrated by pupils who have
been disciplined for a misdemeanour are becoming increasingly
common.
</P>
<P>
Peter Smith, general secretary of the ATL, said: "Teachers
realize we cannot make schools into fortresses with armed guards
at every gate. But we are coming to the conclusion that school
security is an issue the whole community needs to address with
legislative back-up from the government."

affairs, told reporters that the meeting will help boost public
confidence although it will not result in any miracles.

<HEADLINE> Certification for Insurance Agents Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- One of the latest measures to
standardize the life insurance business in China's financial hub,
is the use of certification, according to the Shanghai branch of
the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The American International Assurance Co. Ltd. began setting up
the agent system in the municipality back in 1992, and was
followed by the Shanghai branch of the People's Insurance Company,
the Pacific Insurance Company, and the Ping'an Insurance Company.
</P>
<P>
The number of agents of the four firms in the city has now
reached 8000.
</P>
<P>
But, the door-to-door selling methods of the agents, while
promoting the development of life insurance in the city, lead to
problems such as fraud, disclosure of private information on
clients, and misuse of premiums.
</P>
<P>
As part of its effort to standardize the insurance agents'
work, the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China developed
some regulations last year, urging insurance companies to stop
advertising for sales personnel and to train them instead.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also say that no one can work as an insurance
agent unless he or she has passed a certifying exam.
</P>
<P>
The life insurance business has reported rapid growth in
Shanghai over the past several years. Statistics show that in
1995, its volume was 1.71 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Kazakh President Stresses Principles of CIS Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev today stressed that integration within the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS) should be based on the principles of
mutual benefit, equality and preservation of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking after the signing in Moscow on March 29 of a
package of comprehensive cooperation accords by the presidents of
Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kirghizstan.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on the accords today, Nazarbayev said
that a proposal he made two years ago for what he called a
"Eurasian Union" was becoming reality and emerging as the ideal
framework for relations among independent countries.
</P>
<P>
The integration process, advancing at different speeds and on
various levels, was beginning to show signs of success, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was becoming clear that a core of deeply integrated states
should be formed within the CIS to quicken their pace of
modernization, especially economically, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the accords, the four countries agreed to complete the
establishment of a tariff union by 1996, which will be a model for
other CIS states.
</P>
<P>
They will also coordinate their policies to create markets for
their goods, services, capital and labor.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev also said that the four nations had agreed to
simplify procedures for obtaining citizenship in each other's
country to encourage cultural and educational exchange.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Popularize Traffic Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China plans to increase public
awareness of traffic regulations and to improve traffic order over
the next three years, according to a forum on Publicity Week for
Traffic Safety, here earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The first week in April will be China's first Publicity Week
for Traffic Safety, with all sorts of activities to be held across
the country to make people aware of traffic regulations.
</P>
<P>
Since China's opening to the outside world in late 1970s, the
economy has grown by leaps and bounds, and the number of vehicles
has grown, as has the number of traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that last year alone, traffic departments under
the Ministry of Public Security handled more than 270,000 traffic
accidents, up 7.2 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
More than 70,000 people were killed and some 160,000 injured,
resulting in a direct economic loss of more than 1.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The relevant departments predict that by the year 2000, the
total volume of freight and passengers on China's roads will
increase by 34 percent and 35 percent, respectively, over the
figures for 1995, making the country's traffic situation grimmer
still.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia, the country's
central bank, has introduced an on-line credit information system
for all private banks operating in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia,
informed bank sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The system, which will go into effect on April 20, is expected
to prevent private and state-owned banks from giving double loans
to the same borrowers, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia will provide data on both the individuals and
the groups that borrow money from all banks.
</P>
<P>
It will also use the system to monitor the growth of loans at
banks, allowing the central bank to know which banks have
surpassed their credit ceilings.
</P>
<P>
For data collecting, Bank Indonesia has instructed both private
and state-owned banks to submit comprehensive data on their
borrowers, including names, addresses and credit amounts, to the
central bank every month.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has set the 20th of every month as the
deadline for data collection. Any banks violating the deadline of
reporting will be fined.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the system will also provide information on the
sources of funds for loans, including offshore loans, credit
cards, bonds, commercial papers and standby letters of credits,
said the sources.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Medical Sciences
University today became the first "smoke-free university" in
Shanghai, the largest city in China.
</P>
<P>
At 11:00 this morning, the university's president, Yao Tai,
added his signature to those of more than 2,000 professors, staff
members, and students to a 20-meter-long piece of cloth, marking
the beginning of a campus-wide ban on smoking.
</P>

The university began efforts to prohibit smoking last autumn. A
ban-smoking group was set up to disseminate information about the
hazards of smoking and to provide nicotine substitutes for smokers
to help them give up smoking.
</P>
<P>
With these aids, a large number of chain smokers have begun to
change their deeply-rooted habits and have been able to stop
smoking.
</P>
<P>
The ban-smoking group has also pushed for restrictions on the
sale of cigarettes in shops at the university. They also say that
students with smoking habits will not be sought by the university
when it is enrolling new students.
</P>
<P>
Some hospitals affiliated with the university have also ruled
that university students with smoking habits cannot be employeed
in them.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta to Check Fire Systems in Public Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Jakarta administration will
inspect fire safety systems in all public buildings, such as
amusement centers, cinemas, markets, supermarkets and shopping
complexes, according to an Antara news agency report today.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta Governor Soerjadi Soedirdja issued the instruction over
the weekend, saying that the evaluation program would be carrying
out as soon as possible, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The governor made the decision following a fire that claimed 77
lives Thursday in Bogor, 60 kilometers away from Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to evaluate the fire safety systems in
Jakarta and to take measures to prevent fires in the Indonesian
capital, which has a population of more than nine million.
</P>
<P>
He said the authorities should check the existing fire
equipment in the public buildings, such as ladders and fire
hydrants, as well as fire escapes and sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
According to the governor, some 4,679 fires occurred in Jakarta
from 1989 to 1994, an average of 937 fires a year.
</P>
<P>
Head of the city fire brigade Suharso said many public
buildings in Jakarta are prone to fire because their fire safety
systems do not function well.
</P>
<P>
Experts blamed confusing public safety regulations for a recent
spate of fire, road and sea disasters in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The disasters include the fire last Thursday, a bus accident
that left 32 dead and a sunken ferry that claimed over 300 lives
in northern Sumatra in January.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The final Main Draw Wild Card
entry to the Salem Open '96 tennis tournament in Hong Kong has
been awarded to the 1994 Salem Open finalist Pat Rafter of
Australia, the tournament's title sponsor R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
International (HK) Ltd., announced here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Rafter was runner-up to Michael Chang of the United States in
the 1994 Open final and was runner-up in the same year's doubles.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Australian reached the quarter-finals in
Adelaide and won the doubles there with American Jim Courier.
</P>
<P>
He made the fourth round of the Australian Open, losing to
Andre Agassi of the United States.
</P>
<P>
After a successful hardcourt circuit in the summer and three
consecutive doubles semi-finals, he had an operation in October on
a wrist injury that had plagued him throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
From there Rafter started working on his fitness after the
inevitable recuperation period from the Tour.
</P>
<P>
After six months out of competition, the 23-year-old is said to
 be emotionally re-charged and ready to fight back to the court.
</P>
<P>
He said he was very excited to begin his comeback in Hong Kong
and his climb into the top ten. He has his sights set firmly at
the top.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Wild Cards were awarded to China's national champion
Pan Bin and Carl Chang of the United States, the elder brother and
coach of Hong Kong favorite Michael Chang.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong tournament could prove to be exciting if Carl
qualifies for the main draw, with the two brothers appearing at
the Victoria Park's Center Court.
</P>
<P>
Should the brothers come head-to-head, it would be the first
time ever the two tennis stars of the Chang family have competed
against each other.
</P>
<P>
The Salem Open '96 runs from April 6 to 14, with the qualifying
rounds on April 6-7.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Introduce Anti-Child Labor Policy in Carpet  Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Nepal is to introduce a new
policy to control child labor in the carpet industry which is one
of the country's major sources of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government will issue child labor free certificates
to carpet factories which do not use child labor in their
production, an official of the Industry Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The government had been inspecting carpet industries and taking
action against those employing child workers since last year in
the wake of child labor complaints from Germany, the major
overseas market for Nepalese carpets, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had decided to issue child labor free
certificates to members of the Central Carpet Industry Association
of Nepal, which has claimed no use of child labor.
</P>
<P>
The carpet industry, which earns some 200 million US dollars
equivalent of foreign exchange every year, has seen major setbacks
in recent years as its export was suffering from the alleged
involvement of child labor, low quality and use of the hazardous
azo dyes.
</P>
<P>
Nepal exported carpets worth 160 million dollars last year and
the German market alone accounted for over 70 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are underway to find alternative markets for Nepalese
carpets, industry sources said, adding that prospective markets
included the United states and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Le Beaten at Chinese Olympic Swimming Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 1 (Xinhua/OANA) -- World champion Le Jingyi was
upset by teenager Shan Ying in the women's 100-meter freestyle
here Monday night at the Chinese Champions' tourney, which served
as the Olympic trial for the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Le, winner in the heats, dashed forward with a flying beginning
but was surpassed by Shan who clocked at 54.59 seconds for the
laurel.
</P>
<P>
Both Le and Shan are the two top Chinese short-distance
freestyle specialists.
</P>
<P>
Shan, 16, took the gold medal in the event at the Asian Games
in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Le, who skipped the Asian Games, swam home as the runner-up in
54.69 in Monday's event.
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, Le is at her top form," said coach Zhou Ming after the
competitions. "Her two times (in the heats and in the final)
weren't slower than we expected. She has been making a great
comeback."
</P>
<P>
All the results at the trials, even those three months before
the Olympics, "show nothing for the Olympics," Zhou added.
</P>
<P>
"We all know the results of the U.S. Olympic trials, but we
could not deny the power and potential of the American swimmers,"
Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Olympic trials last month produced the slowest of its
history since 1920, with no national records.
</P>
<P>
Han Xue, who twice shattered the world short course 50m
breaststroke earlier this year in Hong Kong and Beijing
respectively, tailed in the final.
</P>
<P>
Olympic gold medalist Lin Li, who finished out of top eight
after the heats of the women's 400m individual medley, was lucky
enough to gain a spot in the final Monday night when Sha Sha,
sixth placer in the heats, withdrew before the final.
</P>
<P>
However, Lin didn't show her form and had to settle for the
third place with a lowly four minutes 42.02 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The gold was pocketed by Chen Yan, a new face from northern
Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 200m freestyle final, Chen Zhou from Shanghai gave
the fans something to cheer as he smashed the national record with
a time of 1:51.49.
</P>
<P>
The previous mark of 1:51.73 was set by Xie Jun at the Asian
Championships in Hiroshima on April 25, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The men's 100m breaststroke title went to Zeng Qiliang who
clocked 1:04.13.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yiwu, the first Chinese man swimmer with a world crown,
was sixth at 1:04.58. Wang won the men's 200m breaststroke laurel
at the World Short Course Championships in Rio de Janeiro in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
The seven-day tournament will run till Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Huge GDP Gap between West, Central, Eastern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- There is a huge gap in per capita
gross domestic product (GDP) between the 15 European Union (EU)
member states and the 15 central and eastern European countries, a
EUROSTAT report said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the highest-ranking country is
Luxembourg with a per capita purchasing power index of 143, and
the lowest-ranking is Moldova with an index of 12.
</P>
<P>
EUROSTAT said that using the purchasing power index to compare
GDP levels is a more accurate measure because it eliminates the
distorting effects caused by price level differences in various
countries.
</P>
<P>
The report is based on the results of the 1993 European
Comparison Program, conducted jointly by EUROSTAT, the Statistical
Office of the European Communities, the Austrian Central
Statistical Office, Statistics Finland, the Organization for
European Cooperation and Development and the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe.
</P>
<P>
The program set the per capita purchasing power index in
Austria as 100, using this country as a "bridge" between east and
west Europe.
</P>
<P>
The indices for the other 14 EU countries are as follows:
Belgium (103), Denmark (101), France (98), Germany (97), the
Netherlands (93), Italy (92), United Kingdom (89), Sweden (88),
Finland (81), Ireland (73), Spain (69), Portugal (61) and Greece
(56).
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 central and eastern European countries, the
highest index is that of Slovenia, 48.
</P>
<P>
The others are: the Czech Republic (44), Hungary (31), Slovenia
(30), Russia (26), Belarus (26), Poland (24), Bulgaria (22),
Croatia (20), Estonia (20), Romania (19), Lithuania (19), Ukraine
(17), Latvia (16) and Moldova (12).

HOHHOT, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Ruins of a capital city in the
northern grasslands dating from the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), is
trying to get itself included on the World Heritage list.
</P>
<P>
North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where the site
is located, recently sent an application to the State Bureau of
Cultural Relics and UNESCO.

forbidden city which was in the inner town. The city walls were
built with rammed earth and enclosed with bricks.
</P>
<P>
After the dynasty moved its capital to present-day Beijing,
Shangdu prospered as an imperial summer resort until 1358 when it
was destroyed by war.
</P>
<P>
Shangdu was a cultural center which attracted tourists,
religious representatives, and businessmen from other Asian
countries and from Europe.

<HEADLINE> Fourth Trial of Former South Korean Presidents Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The fourth trial session on mutiny
and treason charges involving former South Korean Presidents Chun
Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo as well as 14 former army officers was
held at the Seoul District Court here today.
</P>
<P>
The 16 defendants have been indicted on charges of mutiny or
treason, or both. Mutiny and treason charges stem respectively
for their roles in the arrests of several loyal generals including
Army Chief of Staff Chung Sung-hwa on December 12, 1979 and in the
military crackdown on the civil uprising in Kwangju, Capital of
South Korea's South Cholla Province, on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
During today's trial, prosecutors focused on the May 17, 1980
decision to expand martial law and the forced merger of press
medias in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Roh and five other defendants were questioned by the
prosecution. Roh answered all questions in a firm voice.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he knew of the plot by officers led by Chun to seize
power, Roh said, "I didn't hear about that at the time."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the military group put pressure on cabinet
ministers to agree to an expansion of martial law in May 1980, Roh
said, "We believed that the new government had limited power to
settle the turmoil and the existing degree of martial law was not
effective. So we thought that an extension of martial law was
required."
</P>
<P>
Regarding the forced merger of press medias in 1980, Roh said
that he was not aware of the merger plan beforehand.
</P>
<P>
Hur Hwa-pyung, former chief secretary of the Defense Security
Command, and two other defendants contended that there was no
scenario whatsoever to seize power.
</P>
<P>
"We had a plan to settle the then political tensions under the
martial law, but there was no plan to usurp power, " Hur claimed.
</P>
<P>
In the previous three trial sessions last month, Chun, Roh and
other co-defendants alleged that their arrests of Chung and
several other loyal generals on December 12, 1979 was not a
mutiny, but a legitimate and unavoidable action needed to
investigate the assassination of President Park Chung-hee.
</P>
<P>
Chun said that it was he who had decided to arrest Chung and
other generals, adding that only he was responsible for the action.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who loomed large as the army strongman after the 1979
military mutiny, seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the
nation until February 1988. He was followed by Roh who stepped
down in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two former presidents, who were arrested last year, have
also been indicted for graft charges as they received huge bribes
from businessmen while in office, in addition to the mutiny and
treason charges.
</P>
<P>
Chun has stood trial once and Roh three times respectively
already on the graft charges.
</P>
<P>
The fifth trial session on mutiny and treason charges will be
held on April 22.

<P>
Qian met separately with leaders of three political parties --
Tomiichi Murayama of the ruling coalition partner Social
Democratic Party, Ichiro Ozawa of the leading opposition
Shinshinto (New Frontier Party) and Masayoshi Takemura of the
smallest coalition partner New Party Sakigake -- for talks on
issues of mutual concern, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Qian was quoted as saying in the meetings with the three
leaders that "Sino-Japanese relations become occasionally troubled
in connection with the Taiwan issue and the acknowledgement of our
bilateral history."
</P>
<P>
The three leaders said their parties will stick to the
"one-China policy" which stipulates that Taiwan is an inalienable
part of China, the official said.
</P>
<P>
They said Japan should support China's policy on the Taiwan
issue of "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two systems,"
adding that foreign forces should not interfere in China's
internal affairs, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The three vowed to build future-oriented relations between the
two nations based on Japan's correct historical perception.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived in Japan on Sunday for a four-day official
visit, today also met separately with Deputy Prime Minister and
Finance Minister Wataru Kubo, former Foreign Minister Yohei Kono
and other key politicians as well as a group of business leaders.

<HEADLINE> Pan Pacific Rugby Series Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The 15-a-side rugby has obtained
new steam as the inaugural Pan Pacific Series was officially
launched here on Sunday to make the sport more dynamic.
</P>
<P>
The Series has attracted eight countries and regions, with the
sport highly developed on the home soil. They comprise South
American champions Argentina, Canada, specialists in the Sevens
Fiji, Hong Kong, Japan, Tonga, the United States and powerful
Western Samoa.
</P>
<P>
Grant Fox of the Auckland-based Carnegie Sports International,
the event's current title sponsor, promised to back the Series
until a new title sponsor is secured.
</P>
<P>
The first of the 31 test matches will be held on april 27 and
the Series runs through to the semi-finals and finals on July 27
this year.
</P>
<P>
It is highly possible that the Pan Pacific could challenge the
current balance of world rugby power as the event offers huge
possibilities for the development of the sport. The popularity of
the game has increased substantially in recent years in the Pan
Pacific rim.
</P>
<P>
All the participating countries and regions border the Pacific
and include some of the world's most dynamic economies.
</P>
<P>
Each of the participating Associations (Unions) has indicated
its commitment to the Pan Pacific Series for five years.
</P>
<P>
With such arrangement, each of them can therefore plan its
future with a guaranteed schedule of seven Test matches
annually.
</P>
<P>
They will also have at least three (some will have four) home
matches in the Series in addition to having the chance to tour in
the Pacific Region.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Achieve 9 Percent Price Increase This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is expected to end up with
a retail price growth rate of about 9 percent this year, a rate
lower than its economic growth rate, said Mayor Li Qiyan, in his
government report submitted to the fourth session of the Tenth
Beijing Municipal People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The capital will take steps to enhance controls on price hikes
by establishing a responsibility system to strengthen leadership
over the work, Li said. The government will also restrict the
number of luxury real estate projects, and beef up controls on
extra-budgetary funds and increase supplies of daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
The lowest price possible will be put on meat and eggs to
ensure ample supply, the price of chemical fertilizers will be
adjusted, and grain prices will be strictly set by the
government. The prices of daily necessities will be fixed within a
certain range when it is showing signs of fluctuating.
</P>
<P>
Further steps will be taken to further improve the price
supervisory and monitoring system, and price controls on
agricultural and side-line products will be emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, measures will also be taken to strengthen price
controls of drugs, education, tourism, and real estate.
</P>
<P>
A series of price regulations will be worked out this year to
reinforce legislation on price controls.
</P>
<P>
Last year, remarkable results were achieved in controlling
price rises and retail price growth was 12.6 percent, a drop of
5.3 percentage points from the year before.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry today called on Balkan nations to begin defense cooperation
and take measures to build mutual confidence.
</P>
<P>
Perry made the call at a meeting of defense ministers from
Italy, Turkey, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Albania as well as
representatives from the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
He said defense cooperation in the Balkans could include:
</P>
<P>
-- Participating in NATO-organized peacekeeping exercises in
the region.
</P>
<P>
-- Opening up each nation's peacekeeping training centers to
troops from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Creating military "rapid response" teams that could work
together in search-and-rescue missions, civilian emergencies and
disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
-- Exchanging with the defense ministries of neighboring
countries detailed information about military budgets, plans and
policies.
</P>
<P>
Perry suggested that Balkan countries implement
confidence-building measures, such as setting up telephone
"hotlines" between the offices of their defense ministers and
withdrawing military units from border regions.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed that Balkan countries draw up defense laws and
national security and military strategies in order to establish
good civil-military relations.
</P>
<P>
Perry arrived in Tirana, the third leg of his trip to the
Balkans and Egypt, on Sunday, after a visit to Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were not
invited to the two-day meeting hosted by Albania. Greece declined
Albania's invitation to attend the meeting despite their improving
relations.

familiar with the technical aspects of the plant will be on
service.

WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Yeltsin Orders Truce In Chechnya
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered a unilateral cease-fire
on Sunday in the shell-shattered southern region of Chechnya and a
phased withdrawal of some Russian forces as part of what he cast
as a milestone peace plan to end the 15-month-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Speaker's Gruff No. 2 Takes Charge In The House
</P>
<P>
Representative Dick Armey, Who arrived on Capitol Hill in 1985,
is still politically crude, rough-edged and brooding. But 12
years after quitting a college classroom to run for Congress, he
has become one of the most powerful politicians in Washington.
Several predecessors could be cited to rival Newt Gingrich for the
title of most powerful Speaker of the House in the Nation's
history. But it is almost universally accepted in Washington
these days that never has a majority leader, the No. 2 job in the
House that Armey holds, commanded so much authority.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Congress Passes New Farm Bill
</P>
<P>
By passing a farm bill last week, the Republican-led Congress
finally agreed to overhaul a major entitlement program. But it
paid a huge price to do so. The so-called Freedom-to-Farm bill,
which President Clinton is expected to sign this week, dismantles
the government's costliest farm-subsidy programs and frees farmers
to produce for burgeoning global markets without any planting
restraints.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
-- April 19 Raises Anxiety Among Federal Worders
</P>
<P>
As the first anniversary of the April 19 Oklahoma City bombing
approaches, officials are rushing to install modern security
measures at federal buildings across the USA. About 283.9 million
dollars will be spent.

pointed out that the reorganization would give the agency a clear
identity and a more authoritative status to take the lead on the
language front and effect a change in the culture and attitude of
the Civil Service.
</P>
<P>
"The work ahead will include producing more guidelines and
reference materials to assist officers to draft documents in
Chinese; to keep closer contacts with policy branches and
departments about the progress on this issue," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said more departments will implement pilot schemes to try
out the use of Chinese on a systematic basis when communicating
with the public.
</P>
<P>
"The agency will also oversee a three-year project to provide
Chinese word processing facilities and training for secretarial,
clerical and executive grades staff within the Civil Service," she

<HEADLINE> China to import 1000 New Agricultural Techniques </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China will put 100 million US
dollars into about 1,000 agricultural projects in the next five
years, mostly for farming, forestry, and water conservation,
according to an official from the technological department of the
Ministry of Agriculture today.
</P>
<P>
The official said that these projects are being given further
consideration, during an interview with a Xinhua reporter.
</P>
<P>
The move indicates that the country is accelerating the pace of
development of agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
China has an ambitious agricultural plan for the year 2000, to
increase grain output by 50 billion kg, and meat and aquatics
output by 10 million tons.
</P>
<P>
At that time, per-capita income of Chinese farmers will reach
1,200 yuan (at 1990 prices) and 65 million poor people will be
provided with enough food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that, to meet the plan's goals, the country
must rely more heavily on technology.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that at present, some 35 percent of
agricultural output increases are resultant from technological
advances. By the year 2000, the rate will be raised to some 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000 items of technology are also expected to include
personnel training and international cooperation and exchange
projects.
</P>
<P>
China will hold an international agricultural technological
exposition here from April 16 to 20. By then, more than 300
companies from 20 countries and regions will bring their new
farming techniques for exhibition.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Improves Toilets for Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- With the number of tourists now
rising to more than 60 million in the Chinese capital, the city
has received many complaints about the scarcity, poor quality, and
unreasonable location of the W.C.s at tourist sites.
</P>
<P>
So, it came up with a three-year plan to deal with the matter,
in 1994, "Beijing Daily" reports. The plan called for putting more
toilets at tourist sites, and 44 W.C.s have been built or
renovated at such sites as the Great Wall, the Ming Tombs.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.34 million yuan (161,000 US dollars) was spent at
the Ming Tombs on building four first-class toilets in one year,
improving the tourist facility greatly.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 12 million, Beijing has more than 6,800
public W.C.s, probably the largest number for the world's large
cities.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Announces First Quarter Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade deficit in the
first quarter of this year amounted to 3.79 billion U.S. dollars
after a sluggish increase in imports, an official of the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry said today.
</P>
<P>
He said the figure, though less than expected, is already
more than half of the projected trade deficit of seven billion
dollars for the whole of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Imports in March rose 3.6 percent from a year earlier to 12.09
billion dollars, bringing the total value of imports for the first
three months of the year to 35.62 billion dollars, up 16.7 percent
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the first quarter totalled 31.83 billion dollars, an
increase of 21.5 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In March alone, exports surged 17.9 percent to 11.79 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the growth rate of imports of capital
goods and raw materials has been held down to within the
annualized 10-percent level.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he added, export letters of credit which
arrived during the first 20 days of March totaled 4.14 billion
dollars, the highest monthly figure since last March.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's trade deficit in 1995 stood at 10.06 billion
dollars, up 58.7 percent from the 6.34 billion dollars registered
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased 30.3 percent from 1994 to 125.06 billion
dollars, the fastest yearly growth since 1987, while imports
grew even faster at 32 percent to 135.12 billion dollars, the
highest since they shot up 35.8 percent in 1979.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Forge New Industrial Cooperation Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will sign an agreement to enhance
industrial cooperation through a resource-sharing mechanism,
Philippine Trade Secretary Rizalino S. Navarro said today.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Industrial Cooperation (AICO) scheme, set to be inked
later this month by ASEAN ministers, will replace the scheme of
the automotive-based ASEAN Industrial Joint Venture and the
Brand-to-Brand Complementation.
</P>
<P>
Navarro said the new scheme provides for an expansion of
product coverage, shorter approval process of a maximum of 134
days and the grant of non-tariff incentives in the country of
operation.
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement, companies incorporated and operating in
at least two ASEAN countries can engage in a joint venture for the
manufacture of a host of products, at least 50 percent of which
should be exported.
</P>
<P>
In addition to non-tariff incentives, AICO-covered products
will enjoy a tariff preference of zero to five percent and
accreditation of local content.
</P>
<P>
Navarro said the scheme of resource sharing and industrial
complementation would lead to improved resource utilization,
enhanced market position and better performance of participating
firms.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah
started his first official duty today, urging officials to bear
in mind the interest of the people and stop using their position
as a means to get rich.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony of swearing in Dr Albert Demby as vice
president at State House, President Kabbah said, "we are trying
to ensure that politics in Sierra Leone should stop being
business as usual."
</P>
<P>
"Those put in position of trust and responsibility should have
the interest of the people," Kabbah said, adding "we want to stop
the thinking that those who are called to public service see it
as a means to enrich themselves."
</P>
<P>
"Those who work with me must be examples to others and should
work to end the decline of Sierra Leone and assist in its
resurgence," Kabbah noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State House sources said Kabbah has sent a list of
his 25 ministers he intends appointing to his cabinet to
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Parliament is to hold its first session on Tuesday where the
list would be approved.
</P>
<P>
According to presidential spokesman Solomon Berewa today, "the
new government's intention is to restructure its ministries to
meet the current challenges and the needs of the nation in
general."
</P>
<P>
Berewa explained in an interview that the motive behind the
restructuring, citing as example the creation of the Department
of Employment and Labor Relations, is the new government's
commitment and emphasis put on employment and the question of

</P>
<P>
"Every minister will be expected to perform positively within

<HEADLINE> Traffic Normal at Capital Airport with Closed Runway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Repair work on the east runway at
Beijing's Capital International Airport, which was closed because
of wear and tear, began today, but flight scheduling is normal,
airport sources say.
</P>
<P>
The repairs will cost 200 million yuan, and the runway, one of
the two, will be closed for three months. It will affect about 15
percent of flights at the airport, one of China's busiest, said
Han Xiangqian, a press official of the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC).
</P>
<P>
More than 400 domestic flights will be canceled each week,
including such busy lines as Beijing-Guangzhou and Shanghai-Xi'an,
CAAC announced last week, and schedules of about another 100
flights will be adjusted.
</P>
<P>
Nine domestic flights will be diverted to neighboring Tianjin
Binhai International Airport, and one to Shijiazhuang's Zhengding
Airport each week, CAAC said.
</P>
<P>
Although the runway has been expanded and repaired three times
since 1954, the sharp increase in traffic has damaged the runway
and was said to be endangering planes during takeoff and landing.
</P>
<P>
The airport handled 121,000 flights and 15 million passengers
last year. The volume is expected to reach 190,000 flights and 35
million passengers in the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Trade Deficit to Drop in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's current account
balance of payment is expected to show a lower deficit of 17
billion Malaysian ringgit (about 6.8 billion US dollars) in 1996,
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said today.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, also the finance minister, said at parliament that this
would be 800 million ringgit (about 320 million US dollars) less
than the 1995 deficit of 17.8 billion ringgit (about 71.2 billion
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Describing the latest statistics as "very encouraging," he
cited a lower trade balance deficit of 40 million ringgit (about
16 million US dollars) last November and a surplus of 643 million
ringgit (about 257.2 million US dollars) in December.
</P>
<P>
Anwar attributed the country's weak balance of payment mainly
to the low capacity and competitiveness in the service sector,
such as transport, insurance, education and professional
contractors.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's export and import of goods in the merchandise
account registered a surplus of 600 million ringgit (about 240
million dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would continue its efforts to reduce the
deficit, adding that a positive effect has resulted from the
government's measures.

<HEADLINE> Appeal For Reviving National Garment Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign garment companies have
expanded their share of China's clothing market over the past
several years, registering a 10-fold increase in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an industry symposium today, Sheng Caiqing,
vice-president of China National Garment Corporation, called on
the domestic garment industry to sharpen its competitive edge to
survive the increasingly rough competition with foreign brands.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 multinationals have shops in China, and basically
dominate the expensive garment segment, and foreign brands have a
growth rate of 15 percent annually in China.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Sheng noted, no famous brand was ever developed by
the domestic garment industry, even though there has been rapid
growth in production in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Hu Zisheng, general manager of the Yixintai Ramie Garment
Corporation of Hunan Province, said that, with structural reforms,
the country's garment industry has a competitive edge in labor and
material resources. But this advantage alone will not result in
successful competition with foreign companies, unless a more
advanced economic model is established.
</P>
<P>
"The basis of a revival of the nation's garment industry is
technology-intensive production policy, and turning the resource
advantage into profits," he said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Li Zongdao of Hunan Agriculture University, a
figurehead in the country's ramie clothing research, paid tribute
to an integrated development model, which has resource production,
manufacturing and scientific research all in one place.
</P>
<P>
The success of Yixintai, which invested in a 10,000-ha ramie
base in Hunan, and became China's biggest ramie garment supplier,
should be taken as one model of development for the industry,
while accepting the challenge from overseas rivals.
</P>
<P>
Many garment experts proposed that the government give more
assistance to domestic enterprises in technology, cloth, sales,
and information.
</P>
<P>
China's garment sector had reported an annual production
capacity of eight billion garments, and a sales volume worth 260
billion yuan on the domestic market last year.

SHANGHAI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest city has annual
sales of 200,000 medium-sized pigs, weighing about 40 kilograms
each, accounting for one-third of the country's total for Hong
Kong, with export volume exceeding 10 million US dollars' worth.
</P>
<P>
As the departure point for three express freight trains
supplying Hong Kong and Macao with fresh and frozen foods and
livestock, Shanghai has attached great importance to this.
</P>
<P>
In the past 34 years, the express freight trains have made
12,300 trips between Shanghai and Hong Kong, carring more than
eight million head of pigs and other livestock, according to
officials from Shanghai Foodstuffs Import and Export Company.
</P>
<P>
The company has developed a series of measures, establishing
pig production bases, introducing scientific techniques, and
strengthening quality checks, in order to improve their quality.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegate on Protection of Minority Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese delegate today told a
U.N. human rights forum that it is imperative to banish prejudice,
arrogance and double standards from international cooperation to
protect the rights of minorities.
</P>
<P>
Yang Houdi, a member of the Chinese delegation to the 52nd
session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, stressed that it
is the moral obligation of governments to promote the equal rights
of minorities in the political, economic, cultural, religious,
educational and other spheres.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that different countries and regions have
different historical and cultural traditions, and distinctive
economic development levels and national composition.
</P>
<P>
Given this fact, he said, while making efforts to protect the
rights of minorities on its territory, each country should
respect internationally recognized norms of human rights while
adopting measures suitable to its own circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative to get rid of prejudice, arrogance, and
double standards and to uphold the principles of equal treatment,
sincere cooperation and mutual respect" in international
cooperation and exchanges aimed at promoting and protecting
minority rights, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably," he noted, "some states, for their own political
interests, always make presumptuous comments on the human rights
situation of minority nationalities of other countries and engage
in activities aimed at interfering in the internal affairs of
other countries, or even worse, at splitting the territorial
integrity of other countries."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Human Rights Commission should take measures to
correct and put an end to this aberration, Yang said.

<HEADLINE> Pagoda Scriptures Mystery Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A solution has finally been found
for a puzzle about why scriptures on similar paper in two ancient
pagodas suffered different fates: one set being preserved as good
as new, while the other already in bad shape a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
The two pagodas, Huqiu and Ruiguang, are in Suzhou in east
China's Jiangsu Province. Hundreds of volumes of scriptures in the
Ruiguang pagoda have had a more fortunate history than have those
in the other pagoda.
</P>
<P>
Experts from People's University, the Palace Museum, and the
Suzhou Museum have spent eight years trying to solve this puzzle.
</P>
<P>
The key to this mysterious phenomenon has been discovered in
the differing conditions: Huqiu was built out of muddy mortar in
the year 961, which allowed rain to seep through the walls, making
the scriptures dampen and become carbonized.
</P>
<P>
Ruiguang, built in 1030, was made with double-layer walls and
whitewash, which made the structure solid and was not porous. The
temperature and moisture inside the pagoda were suitable for the
preservation of scriptures on its third storey.

</P>
<P>
This is higher than the combined figures of fires in the other
three Indian metropolitan cities -- Mumbai (Bombay), Calcutta and
Madras, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The number of fire cases is expected to exceed 15,500 at the
end of the 1995-96 fiscal year, an increase of more than 2,200
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
With an average of 45 fire calls a day, this is the first time
in 15 years that the number of calls crossed the 14,000 mark in
New Delhi, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Chief Fire Officer S. K. Dheri said the capital is rapidly
becoming a "burning city."
</P>
<P>
According to him, there are about three million slums and over
100,000 industrial units in the capital. The numbers are still
growing and construction for many of them is unauthorized.

The growth rate in the first two months of this year rose by
seven percent, 24.3 percent lower than for the same period last

</P>
<P>
In analysing the sharp decline, a bureau official said that the
rate was attributed by a drop in the number of new projects
launched, less momentum in fixed assets investment, and fewer
funds for unfinished projects.
</P>
<P>
However, state investment in basic industries, energy, raw

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Disagrees with Equal Representation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Equal representation in a
proposed federal Cyprus government, as demanded by the Turkish
Cypriot side, is not an acceptable option, President Glafcos
Clerides said here today.
</P>
<P>
The President made the remark following press reports that the
U.S. would favor equal representation of the Greek and Turkish
Cypriots in a federal Cyprus government that would emerge from an
agreed solution between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides told the press that "the two states
comprising the federal state have the same constitutional rights,
whether their population is one or ten million."
</P>
<P>
"We have repeatedly said we accept this type of equality. One
canton of a federation cannot have more powers than the
other. What we do not accept is equal representation in the
federal government," Clerides explained.
</P>
<P>
This, he added, is a position held by previous governments of
the Republic.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the government is making the necessary preparations
ahead of an expected American initiative on Cyprus, the president
said "our positions are well known, the Cyprus problem is known,
so is the nature of a solution."
</P>
<P>
"What we would like to see is everybody addressing themselves
to Turkey to change its position on Cyprus," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north in 1974 when Turkish troops invaded the
island following a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The problem has remained unsolved despite the U.N.'s good
office for the past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.S. will launch a peace initiative in
a bid to seek a solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao Shi
said here today that China respects the choices made by the
Russian people and hopes Russia will enjoy social stability and
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, Chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, made the remarks during a meeting with Yegor
Stroyev, chairman of Russia's Federation Council, or upper house
of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Qiao laid down five principles in China's relations with Russia:
</P>
<P>
-- China respects the choices made by the Russian people and
will not interfere in Russia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
-- China sincerely hopes that Russia will enjoy social
stability, economic growth, and that its people can live and work
in peace and contentment.
</P>
<P>
-- China will develop its relations with Russia with a
strategic view towards the next century.
</P>
<P>
-- On some specific problems in bilateral relations, China will
strive to find appropriate solutions through friendly
consultations.
</P>
<P>
-- China will strengthen its cooperation with Russia in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev, who agreed with Qiao, said Russia is undergoing
profound social reforms and values highly China's experience in
its reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia fully backs China's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said China's basic policy of steadily developing and
deepening its good-neighborly, friendly and mutually beneficial
cooperative relations with Russia will in no way be altered as a
result of changes in international and domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said China is looking forward to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's visit to Beijing later this month, and expressed the
belief that the summit meeting will give new impetus to
Sino-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
He said inter-parliamentary cooperation is a major part of
bilateral relations and the Chinese NPC will maintain regular
contact with various levels of both chambers of the Russian
parliament.
</P>

Qiao, who arrived here Sunday from Ukraine on a six-day
official visit, will continue on to Cuba and Canada, with a
stop-over in Greece.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Focuses on Key Projects to Spur Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, an economic powerhouse
in east China, reported marked economic returns last year through
the spread of sophisticated science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics available show that four major science
programs in Shanghai, which are aimed at spreading sophisticated
science and technology, have yielded over 23 billion yuan worth of
output value. The ratio of input against output is record one to
5.58.
</P>
<P>
Priorities were given to the application of computers and
softwares and modern biological and medical achievements. Fairs
were very often held for promoting the use of computers. And
automatic teller machines were adopted at 80 percent of the
banking outlets.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the computer industry yielded four billion yuan
worth of output value in 1995, doubling that of the previous
year. Modern biological and medical industry yielded 9.6 billion
yuan in output value, an increase of more than 30 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local authorities invested more in the manufacture
of products which would substitute the relevant imported goods. A
medical achievement alone saved local authorities some 10 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis was also placed on application of research findings
for major industrial sectors. Seventy-five of the 83 projects for
the Torch Plan carried out last year yielded an annual output
value of some 10 billion yuan each.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Send Only Skilled Workers Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian House of
Representatives and manpower experts have welcomed the
government's plan to send only skilled workers abroad, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, President Soeharto asked labor recruitment
agencies in Indonesia to send only skilled workers overseas.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarian Eric Soekardja stressed the need for revision
of the country's training system for workers to be sent overseas
to work in "formal sectors."
</P>
<P>
He said it is high time to upgrade workers' skills to solve
problems that have long troubled Indonesian workers abroad, such
as sexual harassment, rape and other immoral incidents.
</P>
<P>
However, up to 80 percent of the overseas Indonesian workers
are now employed as unskilled labor such as maids and chauffeurs
in more than 50 countries in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East and
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Some experts on manpower suggested that an independent labor
promotion agency should be established to market skilled
Indonesian workers abroad to increase the number of overseas
Indonesian workers.
</P>
<P>
Since the current five-year development plan started in 1994,
Indonesia has sent 1.5 million workers abroad, who are expected to
bring in 3 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government aims to send a total of 2.5 million workers
abroad by the year 2000 in the hope of earning at least 12.5
billion US dollars in foreign exchange.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Marks Anniversary of National Liberation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus commemorated today the
41st anniversary of a four-year struggle in the 1950s to rid the
island of British colonial rule, which ended with the
establishment of the Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
A church service was held at Saint John's Cathedral,
officiated by the primate of the church of Cyprus Archbishop
Chrysostomos and attended by President Glafcos Clerides and
government officials.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Justice and Public Order Minister Alecos
Evangelou praised the Eoka (National Organization of Cypriot
Fighters) struggle as "the eternal symbol of our love for freedom
and a light that continues to inspire and lead us."
</P>
<P>
Calling for a unified front, he said "we have to walk down the
road leading to a solution in Cyprus which the President has
marked on the basis of international law."
</P>
<P>
"We shall not bargain our rights. We shall not forget our
ancestral homes. We look to tomorrow with faith in our just cause
and hope it prevails and we shall spare any sacrifice," Evangelou
concluded.
</P>
<P>
After the service, the Archbishop led a prayer at the graves of
13 Eoka fighters killed during the 1955-59 struggle. President
Clerides laid wreaths at their graves.
</P>
<P>
Similar commemoration services were also held in all towns in
the southern government-controlled areas of Cyprus and were
attended by government ministers. The northern part of the island
has been occupied by Turkish troops since 1974 when Turkey
militarily intervened following an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides also attended events at the central
Nicosia stadium which include a parade by Eoka fighters and
army reservists.

AMSTERDAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Feyenoord Rotterdam will appeal
to the European soccer body UEFA against the disciplinary actions
upon the club and its fans, club officials said in Rotterdam on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Feyenoord were fined 50,000 Swiss francs (12,500 U.S. dollars)
because of violent behaviors of its fans before and after the
European Cup Winners' Cup quarter-final against Borussia
Moenchengladbach on March 7.
</P>
<P>
Its fans were accordingly banned from the semi-final against
Rapid Vienna on April 18.
</P>
<P>
But chairman Jorien van den Herik said his club should not be
fully responsible for the incidents since German organisers of the
Moenchengladbach match had sold nearly 5,000 tickets to
unauthorised Dutch fans, which violated the UEFA rules.
</P>
<P>
He said Feyenoord feared that some 4,000 tickets for the Vienna
semifinal may have already been sold to Dutch supporters.

<HEADLINE> Peres Embarks On Mission To Gulf Arab States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Shimon Peres
left Tel Aviv this morning for a two-day trip to two Gulf States,
Oman and Qatar, in an effort to broaden new spheres of relations
with Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Peres is scheduled to land in Muscat this afternoon and hold
talks with Omani Sultan Qaboos Bin Said. On Tuesday, he will
become the first Israeli leader to visit Qatar, Oman's neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Peres is accompanied by Energy Minister Gonen Sevev, Major
General Danny Yatom and leading industrialists.
</P>
<P>
The late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was the first Israeli
leader to visit Oman in December 1994. The two countries have
enjoyed quiet security links since Oman asked for Israel's help
in the aftermath of an attempted insurrection by the Dofari
northern province in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
Oman was one of the few Arab countries that did not break ties
with Egypt when it made peace with Israel in 1979.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Doha, Peres is expected to discuss a
natural gas deal between the two countries. Israel and Qatar have
negotiated on the matter, but yet to conclude such a
deal. Problems include how such gas will be transported as well as
Egypt's insistence that it could provide such natural gas to
Israel at a cheaper price.
</P>
<P>
A landmark announcement may also be made on the opening
of an Israeli economic liaison office in Qatar's capital.

<HEADLINE> South Korea, Bolivia Sign Investment Guarantee Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Bolivia signed an
agreement on the reciprocal promotion and protection of investment
here today, which will pave the way for Korean firms to make
inroads into the South American state.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which stipulates that investors from one country
be given "de facto national treatment" in the other country, was
signed by South Korean Foreign Minister Gong Ro-myung and his
visiting Bolivian counterpart Antonio Aranibar Quiroga.
</P>
<P>
Before signing the agreement, the two ministers held talks and
agreed that they will make efforts to enhance the economic and
political ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Quiroga promised that the Bolivian embassy in Seoul will have
the discretion to issue visas for South Koreans unlike the present
system in which the embassy must get permission from the Bolivian
government before issuing visas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Korea exported 18 million U.S. dollars worth
of goods to Bolivia while importing only eight million
U.S. dollars worth of products from that country.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of last December, South Korean firms had invested
1.8 million U.S. dollars in facilities to produce silk, aluminum
and plywood in Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
Quiroga arrived here Sunday for a five-day official visit to
South Korea.

<P>
LAGOS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The British government at the
weekend announced release of 250,000 pounds aid to Nigeria,
to help the west African country combat the scourge of cerebro-
spinal meningitis.
</P>
<P>
The aid is coming through the British Overseas Development
Agency (ODA), according to a statement by the British High
Commission in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
ODA aid is in response to an appeal by the World Health
Organization, and the Red Cross Society of Nigeria, for
international aid toward combating the scourge, which has
already afflicted citizens mostly in northern Nigerian states,
killing an estimated 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross reported last month that a separate aid package
for the same purpose had been despatched to Kano, north Nigeria,
from Germany.
</P>
<P>
As of last week, 30,272 cases have been reported to the World
Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
The situation is said to have been worsened by parallel
outbreaks of cholera and measles, which have already claimed
548 and 311 lives respectively.

<HEADLINE> Police Challenged to Curb Rising Crime In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The police force has been
called on to work out effective ways of combating rising crime in
order to maintain sustainable social-economic growth in the
country.
</P>
<P>
This call was made by Director of Criminal Investigation (DCI)
Mr. Edwin Mann during a seminar for regional crime officers held
at Police College in Moshi, Northern Tanzania over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, the DCI revealed
that last year crime rose to 463,078 reported cases, an increase
of 2,501 or 0.54 percent, compared to 460,577 cases in 1994.
While in 1993, there were 426,416 reported crimes, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Mann attributed crime increase to poor economy,
unemployment, inflation and rising costs of living which he said
resulted in massive migration of rural youth to urban areas in
search of job.
</P>
<P>
However, the DCI said, in order to curb the crime's increase
trend, it is necessary for the police to intensify
inter-territorial collaboration in fighting crime.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Provide 500 Million Dlrs Annually to Pakistan  in Next 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has committed to Pakistan at least 500 million US dollars annually
in assistance over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here today, ADB programs Director
Noritada Morita said for 1996, the bank has earmarked 589 million
dollars to Pakistan in loans mainly for the Ghazi Barotha
Hydropower project and the Social Action Program (SAP).
</P>
<P>
Some 200 million dollars from the bank's concessional Asian
Development Fund will go to the SAP phase II, which seeks to
improve basic education, primary health and nutrition, rural water
supply and sanitation and population control across the country.
</P>
<P>
It is twice the amount provided under the bank's previous
contribution to SAP, a five-year program started in 1993, he
added.
</P>
<P>
For 1997, 540 million dollars has been planned while in 1998,
555 million dollars will be made available for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1994, the bank's assistance was mainly concentrated on
agriculture, energy and finance and industry sectors.
</P>
<P>
During the next three years, the share of projects in the
social sectors is expected to increase from 12 percent to about 30
percent of total lending.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding, the ADB has lent about 8.6 billion dollars
in loans to Pakistan over the three decades.
</P>
<P>
The bank is one of the largest providers of external assistance
to Pakistan, which is among the bank's major borrowers.
</P>
<P>
The director said the bank is satisfied with the government of
Pakistan in regard of utilization of loans and disbursement.
</P>
<P>
The press conference marked the conclusion of the annual
Country Programming Mission to Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> SADC To Lift Exchange Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The long-term objective and
top priority of central bankers in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) is to work toward the lifting of
exchange controls in all member countries.
</P>
<P>
This was made clear by Mauritius central bank chief manager
Bud Gujadhur at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
A local daily "Business Day" today quoted Mr. Gujadhur as
saying that exchange controls were a severe impediment to
intraregional trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During their second committee meeting held at Somerset West
near Cape Town, representatives from SADC's central banks
discussed the need for a data bank to compile information on the
different exchange controls imposed by the members countries as a
first step on the road to create the free flow of funds in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Among the 12-member SADC group, only Mauritius and Zambia have
completed a liberalization process.
</P>
<P>
Gujadhur said South Africa would be the driving force in the
process. While South African Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals
had told the meeting that he wanted exchange controls relaxed
"sooner rather than later."
</P>
<P>
The South African government had promised earlier this year to
lift the exchange controls, adding it was only "a question of
time."
</P>
<P>
During the weekend meeting, SADC bankers also reviewed the
present economic and financial situation in each member state.
</P>
<P>
However, the committee said the input by representatives of
each central bank revealed the diversity in the structure and
management of financial policies of each member state.
</P>
<P>
In addition to exchange controls, the meeting also discussed
the development of a cross-border payment and settlement system,
a joint approach to combat money laundering and the training of
central bankers.
</P>
<P>
The SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<P>
TOKYO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen today urged Japan to stick to the 1972 joint
statement normalizing bilateral relations between the two
countries, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived here Sunday for a four-day official visit,
met Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto at the premier's
official residence for talks on issues of mutual concern, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Qian told Hashimoto that the joint statement, along with the
1978 peace and amity treaty, serves as the political foundation
for Beijing and Tokyo to improve bilateral ties, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The friendly relationship between our two nations will be able
to enjoy a healthy and smooth development as long as these basic
principles are abode by and unnecessary disturbances removed," the
official quoted Qian as telling Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said Japan's policy of providing cooperation for
China's ongoing reform efforts remains unchanged and will not be
changed in the future.
</P>
<P>
He added that Japan will continue to honor its duties in
accordance with the agreements and treaties concluded between the
two governments, the official said.
</P>
<P>

Premier Li Peng in Bangkok in early March were "very fruitful" and
"conducive" to the further development of Beijing-Tokyo ties,

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Sees Lowest Ebb in New Projects Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Investment Promotion
Center (IPC) of Tanzania will meet on April 4 to discuss why the
country had only received 85 projects, the poorest recorded in
the last four years.
</P>
<P>
The figure of approved new projects last year, represents only
eight percent of the total number of projects received since the
IPC was conceived in 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to IPC reports, the center's approval committee
cleared 14 projects in 1990, 228 in 1991, 118 in 1992, 131 in
1993 and 115 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
So far a total of 691 projects have been approved out of 1,097
applications received since 1990. This represents 63 percent of
the actual applications.
</P>
<P>
A senior IPC official attributed the drastic drop in projects
last year to lack of stability in the investment policy. He told
Xinhua today that the investment policy had been amended four
times so far.
</P>
<P>
The transition to multi-party politics was cited as another
factor behind the low response from potential investors. "No one
would like to take a risk," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The IPC official said, immigration procedures and lack of
transparency in the investment procedures were also hindrance
factors to investors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that the IPC lacked adequate operational
funds to facilitate the flow of communication.
</P>
<P>
The 691 projects approved by the IPC are worth 1.6 billion
U.S. Dollars. Of these 505 were new ones, with 320 local and 259
joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The projects generated 106,982 jobs, mostly for Tanzanians.

Market analysts estimate that by the year 2000 China's demand
for the convenient quick-frozen food will reach over 8.5 million
tons, and if the economy grows faster, the demand will top 10
million tons a year.
</P>
<P>
Though appearing in China only in the late 1980s, the
production of quick-frozen food has grown rapidly and diversified.
</P>
<P>
For example, Beijing now has over 100 enterprises turning out
quick-frozen foodstuffs in over 150 varieties, including
dumplings, steamed stuffed buns, fried spring rolls and fishballs.
</P>
<P>
While developing rapidly, the industry is also showing some
shortfalls, especially when compared with the developed countries,
an article carried in the "China Business Daily" pointed out.
</P>
<P>
There are problems of inferior quality, narrow range of
varieties, and repetition in production.
</P>
<P>
The lack of unified management is deemed to be the main reason
for these problems.
</P>
<P>
The article called for strengthening the industry's management,
speeding up the formulation of industry standards, and improving
production technology.

<HEADLINE> US Reaffirms Ties with Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States has reaffirmed
its ties with Bahrain but is concerned about the safety of its
citizens in the Gulf Arab country.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Khaleej Times based here, U.S. Commerce
Secreatry Ron Brown was quoted by the paper that Washington
considers Bahrain as one of the most important allies in the
region and one of its partners in defending the security and
stability of the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception hosted in his honor at the Bahraini
Embassy in Washington, Brown said the recent events in Manama had
no adverse effects on U.S. trade or investment.
</P>
<P>
Since last April, a series of violent actions including arson
and bombing attacks have taken place in the tiny Gulf island
country.
</P>
<P>
"Investments and trade (with Bahrain) will continue to
flourish and prosper," Brown said. Reaffirming his country's
support and care for the stability and security of Bahrain, he
said the U.S. would further expand cooperation with the island as
it had formerly extended the "hand of cooperation to the United
States."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the U.S. Embassy in Bahrain has recently
issued fresh safety instructions to the 3,500-strong American
community living there after reporting "an increase in civil
disturbances."
</P>
<P>
In a message on the U.S. citizen hotline, the U.S. Embassy
"recommends that Americans in Bahrain exercise the strongest
caution. If possible, avoid travel to all villages, especially
Sitra and Jdhafa, the scenes of several recent incidents."

<HEADLINE> Fourth Trial of Former South Korean Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The fourth trial session on mutiny
and treason charges involving former South Korean Presidents Chun
Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo opened at the Seoul District Court here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
The two ex-presidents, as well as 14 former army officers, have
been indicted respectively on charges of mutiny or treason, or both.
</P>
<P>
The charges stem from their roles in the arrests of several
loyal generals on December 12, 1979 and in the military crackdown
on the civil uprising in Kwangju, capital of South Korea's South
Cholla Province, on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
During today's trial, prosecutors focused on the crackdown
of the Kwangju uprising, in which about 150 people were killed and
2,000 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
They also sought the truth about the expansion of martial
law nationwide on May 17, 1980, the subsequent illegal closedown
of the National Assembly and the illegal arrests of senior
politicians as well as the establishment of a military junta
virtually controlled by Chun, then Chief of the Defense Security
Command.
</P>
<P>
Roh, then capital garrison commander, was questioned first
in the trial.
</P>
<P>
In the previous three trial sessions last month, the 16
defendants alleged that the 1979 arrest of the generals was not a
mutiny, but a legitimate and unavoidable action needed for the
investigation of the assassination of President Park Chung-hee.
</P>
<P>
Chun said that he was the only decision-maker in the arrest and
should be responsible for it alone.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who loomed large as the army strongman after the alleged
1979 military mutiny, seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled
the nation until February 1988. He was followed by Roh, who stepped
down in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two ex-presidents, who were arrested last year, have also
been indicted for graft charges as they received huge bribes from
businessmen while in office.
</P>
<P>
Chun has already stood trial once and Roh three times on the
graft charges.

<HEADLINE> Uganda To Assist Herbalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
decided to assist herbalists engaged in research, reported the
local daily "the New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Health Bart Katureebe was quoted as
saying that his ministry will assist in providing them with
laboratory facilities.
</P>
<P>
Recently, herbalists at Bushenyi town, southwestern Uganda
complained that they were being marginalized by the government,
saying they had not been recognized while modern scientists had
gained a great deal from their herbs.
</P>
<P>
So Katureebe assured them that his ministry would work closely
with them and assist those engaged in research through provision
of laboratory facilities.
</P>
<P>
Katureebe also said the government would enhance efforts to
harmonize research in herbs undertaken by herbalists and modern
medicine practitioners.
</P>
<P>
When visiting gardens of herbs in Bushenyi last week,
Katureebe noted that these gardens would serve as a reserve for
the future generations.

<HEADLINE> Lin Falters at China's Swimming Olympic Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Olympic gold medalist and world
record holder in the women's 200 meters individual medley Lin Li
suffered disappointment in her first appearance at the China
Swimming Champions' tourney, which started here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The seven-day tournament is also considered as China's Olympic
trial for the Atlanta Olympic Games this summer.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who didn't participate in any major international tourney
since the Barcelona Games in 1992, clocked a modest four minutes
57.47 seconds in the women's 400m individual medley heats
competitions, the ninth finisher in the 48-athlete six-group
preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
Unfancied Wu Yanyun, who came from south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, finished first in the event with a time of
4:51.39.
</P>
<P>
After the competitions, Lin and her coach Zhang Xiong refused
to make any comments.
</P>
<P>
But the 200m individual specialist has another chance in her
favorite event slated for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Women's 100m and 50m freestyle world record holder Le Jingyi
made no further trouble in finishing atop in the women's 100m
freestyle heats.
</P>
<P>
Le, the double world champion in both 100m and 200m events,
clocked 55.51 seconds, 1.50 seconds slower than her record of
54.01, set at the Rome World Championship in September, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old Zhao Na, fifth-ranked in the 1994-1995
year-ending world lists, finished third at 56.19.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yiwu, the first Chinese man swimmer with a world title,
finished the men's 100m breaststroke at 1:05.14, squeezing into
tonight's final.
</P>
<P>
Wang chalked up a gold in the 200m breaststroke at the World
Short Course Championships in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in December
2, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jianhong, a veteran who retired from national squad
recently, didn't perform well in his speciality -- men's 100m
breaststroke, and came in ninth, disqualifying for tonight's
final.
</P>
<P>
Some 370 swimmers are taking part in the tourney which ends on
April 7, vying for the qualification of the Atlanta Olympic
swimming competitions.
</P>
<P>
"We will take this competitions as the main reference for the
line-up of the team for the Atlanta Games," said Zhou Ming, one of
the Chinese team coach.
</P>
<P>
According to another official of China's National Culture and
Physical Committee, the swimmers who qualifies for the Atlanta
Olympics will also book himself (or herself) a berth in next
year's National Games in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Diplomat Warns Of Dangerous Impact On Peace If Likud Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Western diplomats here are
concerned about a prospect of uncertainty over peace process if
Likud wins the general elections due to be held on May 29,
reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Should the Likud win the election, it will take measures that
will impinge upon Palestinian control of the territories without
prior consultation, including strengthening settlements and
launching preemptive raids into Palestinian cities to root out
terrorists, Ariel Sharon, a Likud Member of Knesset, reportedly
told a Western diplomat recently.
</P>
<P>
Another diplomat warned that if Sharon's plan is adopted it
would have dire consequences, bringing about the "downfall of the
Palestinian Authority and the collapse of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace track."
</P>
<P>
Sharon's reported remarks are being taken seriously because of
his strong second-place finish in the Likud primaries last week.
</P>
<P>
The second diplomat warned, "if Israel rolls back the
Palestinian track, the world will react accordingly. This will
sour Israel's relations with Jordan, and hurt the Syrian track."
</P>
<P>
Sharon reportedly told the foreign diplomat that a Likud
government would set up two parallel "security belts" in the
territories, running parallel along the Jordan River and along the
West Bank side of the Green Line, which would both be run by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear how the unilateral establishment of such
security zones would impact upon some existing designated rural
areas, known as B under the Oslo accords, where the Palestinians
are supposed to have a modicum of control.
</P>
<P>
Sharon has long been champion of the "cantons plan," which
favors Israeli control over islands of Palestinian autonomous
areas centered in the Palestinian cities.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army will feel free to stage preemptive raids into
Palestinian cities (Area A) to root out terrorists, without prior
consultation with the Palestinian Authority, he added.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Prime Minister Shimon Peres and his government
have studiously avoiding raids into the cities, instead focusing
on Area B and the other 70 percent of the West Bank, Area
C, which remains under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
If Palestinians continue to refuse to extradite suspects, a
Likud government will reserve the right to take them itself, using
force, he said.
</P>
<P>
All Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem will be closed by a
Likud government.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Peres pledged to the late Norwegian foreign
minister Johan Jorgen Holst that institutions not affiliated to
the Palestinian Authority could remain open.

<HEADLINE> 7 Killed in Israeli Army Helicopter Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- An Israel Air Force Yasur 2000
transport helicopter crashed during a training mission near the
Dead Sea Sunday afternoon, killing seven aboard and injuring two
others, Israeli reports said today.
</P>
<P>
It was the first crash in six years involving a Yasur, an
upgraded U.S.-made Sikorsky CH-53, considered a relatively sturdy
craft.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter was taking part in a routine exercise dropping
off soldiers and had just put down a squad and taken off when it
apparently lost power and crashed. It burst into flames and was
totally destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Head commander of the Israel Air Force Herzl Bodinger Sunday
night told reporters that it was too early to tell if the
accident was a result of a technical malfunction or human
error. He has ordered an investigation.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister and Defense Minister Shimon Peres Sunday night
expressed his sorrow at the loss of the soldiers and sent
condolences to their families.
</P>
<P>
It was in fact the first fatal military crash in Israel since
last August when an F-15 collided with storks, killing the two
pilots aboard.
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred about two kilometers west of Mitzpeh
Shalem, near the Dead Sea. Another helicopter in the exercise was
in eye-contact when the crash occurred, Bodinger said, adding
that it was forced to land by a mechanical problem.
</P>
<P>
Bodinger dismissed any link between the malfunction of the
second helicopter and the one that crashed, saying that
helicopters routinely land if even a minor malfunction occurs.
</P>
<P>
Bodinger, who visited the crash site, said there were no
clouds and visibility was clear. He said that wind velocity was
normal and that the Yasur had not been carrying any load other
than the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what happened at this moment," he said. The
Yasur "took off and didn't appear to have attained much altitude
when it dived and hit the ground. It only reached some 50 to 100
feet."

BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Dalian, the biggest seaport in
northeast China, is to open more international ocean transport
lines, especially to Europe and America in the 1996-2000 period,
to sharpen its competitive edge in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Most of Dalian's shipping capacity added in the next five years

Chinese ports and to ports in neighboring countries will also be
opened.
</P>
<P>
Dalian plans to raise the total carrying capacity of its ships
to 850,000 dwt and 17,000 passengers by 2000 through an annual
increase of passenger carrying capacity of 15 percent and cargo
carrying capacity of 10 percent over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Dalian will gradually eliminate most of its wooden passenger
ships, and put more cargo ships with carrying capacities of over
5,000 tons and special-purpose cargo ships into service during the
five years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Cargo transport started today on
the southern section of the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, demonstrating
that the 2,536-km line is fully operational for cargo transport.
</P>
<P>
Operational from today is the section from Xiangtang in Jiangxi
Province to Longchuan in Guangdong Province. The section south of
Longchuan was put into operation in the end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
Currently there will be four pairs of cargo trains running on
the southern section each day, railway officials here said, adding
that from now on, cargo trains from east China will run to
Guangdong via the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, instead of the old
Beijing-Guangzhou Railway.
</P>
<P>
Running almost the north-south length of China, the
Beijing-Kowloon Railway is the longest railway line China has ever
built at one time.
</P>
<P>
Track-laying was completed in November last year. The
authorities hope that the whole line will be put into commercial
operation within this year.

The number of local residents who have been bitten by dogs
dropped by 41.2 percent compared with the figure before the
implementation of the law.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Fuel Prices Up in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's fuel prices have gone
up again with immediate effect by between three and 20 percent,
barely four months after the prices of petrol and diesel were
upped.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Transport and Energy announced in a statement
in Harare on Sunday that the new hike sees aviation fuels and
illumination paraffin receiving the largest increases of between
18 and 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the recent increase in prices to an 11
percent decline of the Zimbabwe dollar against the U.S. dollar
since July last year. This caused an increase in the costs which
have to be paid in foreign currency.

<HEADLINE> India Lifts Ban on Malaria Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- India's Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare has lifted the long-standing ban on anti-malarial
drug Mefloquine due to the spurt in cerebral malarial cases in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, which had maintained the ban despite protests
from experts, decided to change its stance in face of a 20-fold
escalation of cerebral malaria over two decades. Caused by the
vector plasmodium, cerebral malaria has a high fatality rate.
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed as Mefloquine is the only effective check
against cerebral malaria and now the increasing immunization
levels to conventional anti-malarial drugs would extend to
Mefloquine, removing the last effective resistance to such cases,
the Health Ministry sources said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Ready To Fight Locust Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is prepared to control an
invasion of red locusts which have reportedly invaded Mozambique,
and is monitoring the common border very closely in case of an
outbreak, Agriculture Minister Dennis Norman has said.
</P>
<P>
''We are safe as far as the red locusts are concerned and we
are monitoring the Mozambican border very closely. We have both
aerial and ground spraying equipment, so there is no need to
panic,'' he said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Plant Protection and Research Institute said
if the locusts invaded Zimbabwe, their effect would not be
serious as most of the country's crops are now almost ready for
harvesting and the locusts prefer green crops.
</P>
<P>
The red locusts have recently invaded Mozambique through which
they can enter Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the plague is spreading in Mozambique,
Malawi, Angola and parts of Zambia. In Angola, reports say
several farms of maize and sorghum in southern provinces have
been completely destroyed by locusts as farmers could not procure
pesticides in time.

<HEADLINE> China Rectifying Soil Erosion on Yangtze's Upper Reaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China is striving to improve an
annual 10,000 sq km of soil-eroded areas on the upper reaches of
the Yangtze River, the country's largest.
</P>
<P>
To accomplish the goal, the Chinese government will increase
its annual investment from 40 million yuan to 118 million yuan in
this field starting this year.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 39,000 sq km of soil-eroded areas on the upper
reaches of the river had been improved by the end of last year,
according to Shi Liwen, general water and soil conservation
engineer of the Yangtze River Water-Conservancy Committee under
the Ministry of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
The country began an overall improvement of the upper reaches
of the Yangtze by transforming hilly land, building irrigation
projects and planting trees in 1989.
</P>
<P>
As a result, these areas have so far increased their grain
output by two billion kg, and built a number of forest belts.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Gov't Steps in To Stop Talent-Poaching  (by Xiong Ping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Commerce Ministry has
warned some life-insurance companies to stop poaching qualified
staff from other companies as practices of this kind rose in the
country's insurance business.
</P>
<P>
The Insurance Department under the ministry recently issued a
letter to insurers, noting such practices are jeopardizing
customer services and may hurt the image of the industry.
</P>
<P>
The warning came after some 300 agents of American
International Assurance Co. recently quit to join Ayudhaya Jardine
CMG Life Plc.
</P>
<P>
Insurance personnel, agents and executives were obviously
attracted by higher salaries and other perquisites as competition
for qualified staff and agents intensified due to the
liberalization of the industry, the department said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Many of these people left without notifying the related
departments and this had resulted in many people leaving their old
clients unserviced, with the possibility of their policies being
canceled or revoked if they were not renewed when due, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
Companies should invest more in fostering their own personnel
to meet rising demand, instead of resorting to the poaching, it
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The department cautioned that if insurance agents and brokers
are found having hurt an insurance policyholder, a beneficiary or
the public, their licenses could be suspended for up to three
years.
</P>
<P>
The department also said that it may refuse to renew licenses
of those who have faced punitive action.
</P>
<P>
Thai Life Insurance Co., the country's second largest life
insurer, welcomed the department's warning, saying it would
benefit those companies that invest to foster their own personnel.
</P>
<P>
Much of the staff-poaching was done by companies teamed with
foreign insurers who lack knowledge of local customers and
markets, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Yet other industry sources said that the Insurance Department
should not interfere in the market and people are free to work
where they wish.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the department's move is aimed at
protecting some companies rather than customers.
</P>
<P>
The number of insurance agents and brokers increased slightly
over the past year in Thailand. At the end of January this year,
The country had 187,200 registered life-insurance agents and 1,729
registered brokers. But they fail to meet the demand in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
Insurance agents and brokers are allowed to transfer to other
companies if they inform the Insurance Department.

<HEADLINE> India to Have Special Trade Partnership with France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- India is reported to have been
holding negotiations with France to set up special trade
partnership between the two countries with "image-building" as its
main objective.
</P>
<P>
The Indo-French economic alliance will encompass a two-year
program devoted to a "face-lift" for India in Europe, an official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, an Indo-French task force of private and
semi-public organizations will organize exhibitions, special media
reports and visits of delegations.

The proposed Indo-French partnership will complete the series
of such arrangements India has entered into over the last three

partnership initiative and the Indo-German business committee, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
In a related move, the Commerce Ministry will get a trust
registered Tuesday to operate the India brand equity fund with an
ambitious goal of making the "made in India" label popular in
overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also prepared a comprehensive report on
commodity-wise and market-wise analysis of trade opportunities and
barriers as basis for India's plan to engage major trade partners
in a trade opening and facilitating dialogue, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger Appeals to U.S. to Maintain One China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger today appealed the U.S. government to maintain
its one China policy to avoid confrontation with China.
</P>
<P>
In an article published today in the "Welt am Sonntag,"
newspaper, Kissinger said the United States will find no allies
if its hostile attitude towards China becomes a frequent
phenomenon in U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Although tensions exist in relations between the United States
and China, Kissinger said both countries have a common interest in
the development of peace in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan played a role in the build-up of tension. With its
economic strength, Taiwan tried to influence U.S. policy and tried
to get the United States give up its support for the peaceful
reunification of China, said Kissinger. If the problem became so
serious, the Chinese government would use force without regard for
the consequences.
</P>
<P>
The thorniest issue in Sino-U.S. relations is Taiwan. Chinese
leaders have rejected the solution of two Chinas. U.S. presidents
including Bill Clinton have stated that the United States supports
a one China policy and hopes the issue can be resolved peacefully,
said Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government reacted strongly when the
U.S. administration allowed Taiwanese "President" Li Teng-hui to
pay a "private visit" to the United States last year. Several
weeks before his visa was granted, U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher had assured China Mr Li would not be issued with a
visa because it went against the U.S.' one China policy, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Chinese leaders had to give a sign that they were
not prepared to allow the one China policy to be destroyed. The
article said China observers believed China would fight at any
cost to guarantee its territorial sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. ties will improve only after the United States
confirms its common interests with China and creates a dialogue
with China, said Kissinger.

<HEADLINE> Coming General Elections to Cost 145 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The cost of holding elections in
India has increased progressively since 1952 by scores of times
over and the forthcoming general elections to be held from April
27 this year are estimated to cost Exchequer five billion rupees
(about 145 million US dollars), Election Commission sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The costliest elections so far were the one held in 1991 with
the government spending around four billion rupees (125 million US
dollars). The cost this time round is bound to go up further,
considering the continuous inflationary pressure during the last
five years, poll economy watchers said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the normal economic factors such as rising prices of
poll materials, higher wages of employees, a growing cult of
political violence and rise of terrorism over the years have
pushed the cost of a rapidly enlarging security apparatus. A host
of law and order problems has aggravated the already complex
logistics in a vast country, necessitating movement of security
personnel from one region to another and leading to staggering
cost of polls.
</P>
<P>
All this shows only one side of the cost of elections as there
is no definite estimate of money being spent by candidates and
parties, though one estimate put it around 6.7 billion rupees
(about 210 million US dollars), press reports said.

<HEADLINE> Leotard Elected UDF's New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Union for French Democracy
(UDF), one of the country's two most powerful ruling parties,
today elected Francois Leotard as its new leader to succeed
veteran politician Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
</P>
<P>
Leotard, 54, defeated his chief rival, former Finance Minister
Alain Madelin, winning 57.4 percent of the vote to Madelin's 30.2
percent at the UDF party congress in the central city of Lyon.
</P>
<P>
Leotard, a former culture and defense minister, will take over
from former President Giscard d'Estaing, now 70, who founded the
party in February 1978 and became its chairman in June 1988.
</P>
<P>
In a victory speech, Leotard pledged to realize "the
reconciliation and unity" of the UDF to "build a powerful center
and center-right political force".
</P>
<P>
He urged UDF members to discuss in depth unemployment, tax
reform, decentralization of power, reduction in working hours,
family policy, European construction and other issues and put
forward as soon as possible a new program to win the 1998 general
election.
</P>
<P>
The UDF, a centrist umbrella party made up of six groups, has
214 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly and is the largest
party after its right-wing coalition partner Rally for the
Republic, founded by President Jacques Chirac and now chaired by
Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
Leotard was Culture Minister in Jacques Chirac's government
from 1986 to 1988 and Defense Minister in Eduard Balladur's
government from 1993 to 1995. But he was cast into the political
wilderness after backing ex-premier Balladur against Jacques
Chirac as conservative standard-bearer in the 1995 presidential
election.

<P>
DHAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- At least 4 people were killed and
more than 120 others injured in different districts across
Bangladesh Sunday, one day after the chief adviser of the planned
caretaker government took oath.
</P>
<P>
The retired chief justice of supreme court, Habibur Rahman, was
sworn in as the chief adviser to head the caretaker government for
next general elections Saturday night following the dissolution of
the parliament and the resignation of Prime Minister Begum Khaleda
Zia.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today said that two political activists
were killed and about 15 others injured in separate incidents in
Chittagong while a pre-dawn gunbattle between rival groups of
armed thugs in Dhaka left at least two young men dead and several
others injured.
</P>
<P>
At least 120 persons were injured in separate clashes between
the activists of Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
and its rival parties -- the Awami (people's) League (AL) and the
Jatiay (national) Party -- in various districts including Rangpur,
Jhenidah, Jessore, Thakurgaon, Rajshahi, Sirajgnj and Commilla,
the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BNP and the AL held separate procession and

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Farmers' Protest Expected to Continue  (by Yu Zuncheng) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of farmers rallying
outside the Government House from the Northeast has swelled to as
many as 7,000 over the weekend, demanding that the prime minister
step in and look at their grievances personally.
</P>
<P>
Protest leaders expect that the number could reach 10,000 this
week as more people pour in from the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the various protest groups have come
together to form a coordinating umbrella organization -- the Forum
of the Poor -- to fight for their separate demands.
</P>
<P>
The groups have called on the government to tackle a number of
issues, including land right conflicts with state authorities,
compensation claims for villagers affected by dam development
projects, and assistance to those who suffer from industrial and
state development schemes, to workers who have fallen sick from
poor working conditions, and to slum dwellers who have lost homes
in the wake of the development of state land.
</P>
<P>
The protesters blame government inaction and lack of sincerity
from ministers and officials and bureaucratic red tape.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the Forum of the Poor said, "Before any
dialogue takes place, we demand the prime minister, the highest
person in the administration, personally step in and issue orders
so they will be carried out by agencies concerned."
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the Forum "will not accept any other
people who have no decision-making power in the talks just to
persuade us to dissolve."
</P>
<P>
Wanida Tantivithayapitak, an adviser to the Forum, said, "We
are prepared to stay on over the Songkran Festival (Thai New Year,
April 12-15) and fight until every one of our demands is met."
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Northeast is predominantly agricultural and
relatively underdeveloped. The living standard there is lower than
other regions.
</P>
<P>
Wanida said the farmers have come on their own initiative and
that their suffering is genuine.
</P>
<P>
She said that the sooner the government solved the problems the
better it would be for the government; otherwise, the protesters'
problems could adversely affect government stability.

<HEADLINE> Thailand To Take Action Against Monopoly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Commerce Ministry is
proposing a bill on fair trade competition to cover all businesses
in the country, especially banking and finance operations.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the bill is proposed to cover banks and
financial institutions as they have a major impact on the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the ministry said that the bill would reduce
unfair pricing by many leading companies.
</P>
<P>
When the bill became law, leading manufacturers would have to
price their products based on production costs, resulting in a
fall in standard prices, they said.
</P>
<P>
Yet the Finance Ministry wants to separate control of banking
and finance businesses under specific laws -- the Commercial Bank
Act and the Finance, Security and Credit Act -- which it plans to
amend within three years.
</P>
<P>
The issue will be presented to a joint committee for
deliberation and analysts said that the banking and finance
businesses might be removed from the coverage of the proposed bill
as a compromise.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Prime Minister on Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba said Sunday that Nepal's foreign policy is
"unequivocal" on matters concerning Tibet autonomous region of
China.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has been recognizing Tibet as an inseparable part of
China, he said.
</P>
<P>
While meeting a Nepalese delegation of journalists, which was
to visit China, Deuba said Sunday that no change had been made in
Nepal's policy on Tibet nor would be made in the future.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed not to allow any anti-China activities to
take place on the Nepalese soil," he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Nepal and China share a common Himalayan culture
and enjoy a very close and traditional friendship, Deuba said
ties between the two neighbors are ever growing on the basis of
the principles of peaceful coexistence.
</P>
<P>
The 7-member delegation of Nepalese journalists is leaving for
China Monday.
</P>
<P>
During their 10-day stay in China, the Nepalese journalists
will visit Chinese cities of Lhasa, Chendu, Beijing and Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Ruling Party Congress Calls for Public Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's socialist prime
minister has called on the nation to support and trust the
government through the country's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Horn Gyula, prime minister and chairman of the Socialist Party
(HSP), one of the two ruling parties, said Hungary is now facing
its most painful moment before economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to ask society to continue to stand by us and
honor us with its trust," he told the HSP's fifth congress.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said Hungary's present crisis was a legacy left
over from previous decades and that the dramatic social upheavals
faced by the country are a result of the transformation of society.
</P>
<P>
The HSP, a split from the former Munkaspart (Socialist Workers'
Party) in 1989, won the parliamentary elections in 1994 with its
current coalition partner the Alliance of Free Democrats, taking
over from a right-wing coalition.
</P>
<P>
Since taking power 20 months ago, the HSP has created the
conditions for the country to lift itself out the current crisis,
and has saved the country from catastrophe by changing the
policies of the previous government, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government launched a series of measures to rein
in a soaring budget deficit and growing current account deficits,
but the measures have caused a fall in real wages, a slump in the
Socialists' popularity and growing criticism from within and
outside the party.
</P>
<P>
Besides assessing party policies and the government's
performance over the past two years, the HSP congress also
discussed the party's future work.
</P>
<P>
It reaffirmed Horn as party chairman and elected Kosane Kovacs
Magda as first deputy executive chairman, Katona Bela, Janosi
Gyorgy and Szekeres Imre as deputy executive chairmen.
</P>
<P>
The congress also selected a 15-member presidium.

<HEADLINE> Australian Current Account Deficit Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Australia's current account
deficit rose to 1.713 billion Australian dollars (1.336 billion US
dollars) seasonally adjusted in February after falling sharply in
January.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) also revised up the
seasonally adjusted current account deficit in January from 1.64
billion Australian dollars (1.279 billion US dollars) to 1.651
billion Australian dollars (1.288 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figures fell within expectations of local economists and
had little impact on the local financial market.
</P>
<P>
Local forecasters predicted a current account deficit of 1.7
billion Australian dollars (1.33 billion US dollars) for February.
</P>
<P>
The Australian stock market showed little reaction to the ABS
figures. The Australian dollar also remained static after the
figures were released today.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the current account deficit was mainly due to a
widening trade deficit. In February, Australia's exports dropped
eight percent, while imports remained steady.
</P>
<P>
Local economists also blamed a 102 million Australian dollar
(79.56 million US dollar) increase of net income deficit for the
rebound of the current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Today's figures brought the current account deficit back to the
level in last December. A prominent economic forecaster
predicted that the current account deficit would exceed 21 billion
Australian dollars (16.38 billion US dollars) in the fiscal year
of 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Australia has one of the biggest foreign debt in the Western
world due to its chronic current account deficit. But most part of
the foreign debt was borrowed by the private sectors rather than
the government.
</P>
<P>
Australia is striving to expand domestic financial markets and
improve national savings in order to reduce its current account
deficit.

<HEADLINE> Tariff Cuts Take Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Cuts in import tariffs affecting
some 4,994 kinds of commercial goods took effect today, together
with the lifting of quota restrictions on 176 frequently traded
commodities.
</P>
<P>
"The affected items account for 76.3 percent of China's total
tariff-imposed commodities, and over 30 percent of non-tariff
barriers under the quota licensing system in China are gone as
well," said Zhao Chuang of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Co-operation (Moftec).
</P>
<P>
The cuts, averaging 35.9 percent, brought China's nominal
average tariff rate down almost 13 percentage points to 23 percent
after the change. But the degree of cuts varies from one category
of imports to another, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Customs duties on raw materials and high tech-items have been
cut substantially, while tariffs on consumer goods and luxuries
remain largely intact or have been only slightly cut, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The tariff times involved can be grouped into 21 major
categories, seven of which have been cut by more than 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
A list of the tariff items involved and rates of reduction is
being printed by the Law Publishing House, and the first batch of
20,000 copies will be available within a week.
</P>
<P>
Li Pengnan, director-general of the General Administration of
Customs, said the massive tariff cuts taking effect today are a
continuation of China's drive toward trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
China started the campaign in 1992, and by the end of last year
had introduced cuts in over 6,000 tariff times by an average of 17
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
But no previous cuts can match the coverage and magnitude of
this round of tariff reductions, indicating China's strong desire
to lover its tariffs in line with other developing countries as
quickly as is economically practicable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the declared cuts, effective cuts also result from
two other measures, said Shang Yuanwen, a division chief at the
Office of the State Council Tariff Commission.
</P>
<P>
Temporary low tariff rates will apply to imports of raw
materials, technology and equipment that are in short supply and
urgent demand in China. Equipment is covered in the scheme for the
first time, she said.
</P>
<P>
In another novel move, a tariff quota system is being adopted
to partly lower import duties on 12 types of grain and edible
oil, Shang said.
</P>
<P>
Traders will pay low tariffs on imports that fall within a certain
negotiated limit, and punitively high ones when imports exceed
that limit.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
plans to invest 100 million (over 12 million US dollars) in new
bridges, highways, ports and railways in the next five years, to
tighten its connections with its neighbors Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
"These planning projects will link the prosperous Pearl River
Delta of Guangdong to Hong Kong and Macao," said Niu Heyin, deputy
director of the provincial bureau of communication.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "China Daily", the projects are expected to
get under way during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000)
with estimated costs in the billions of US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Feasibility studies are now being done, and Hong Kong investors
and concerned government departments - who stand to benefit from
the projects - are being contracted for possible cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong investors have shown great interest in jointly
constructing those projects that will also help support Hong
Kong's continuous economic growth when China resumes the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest project planned is the Lingdingyang Bridge, linking
the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone to Hong Kong and Macao. Estimated
cost of the 29-km bridge is over seven billion yuan (about 843
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Another large project is a network of expressways centered in
the provincial capital of Guangzhou, which has already established
plane, ferry, train and bus services to Hong Kong.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- United States trade officials have
urged Thailand to unveil concrete steps to open its
telecommunications and auto markets, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Timothy Hauser, US undersecretary for international trade, said
here that Washington wants to know Thailand's position on telecom
liberalization before April 30, the deadline for offers to be made
to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
He expressed hopes that Thailand's offer would contain steps to
end restrictions and monopolies for the market.
</P>
<P>
The US is also concerned over its auto parts makers' access to
the Thai market, Hauser said, stressing that Thailand's 20 percent
tariff on finished products and 30 percent on raw materials make
it difficult for US manufacturers to enter the Thai market.
</P>
<P>
Hauser, who is leading a US trade delegation of small and
medium-sized businesses to Thailand, held talks with his Thai
counterparts last weekend, focusing on three issues --
intellectual property rights, tariff cuts for the auto industry
and telecom liberalization.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Telephone numbers in Yangon city,
capital of Myanmar, will change to six digits replacing the
original five digits from April 16 in an expansion program to
meet public demand for telephones, the official paper "The New
Light of Myanmar" reported today.
</P>
<P>
As the current expansion in Yangon city exceeds the numbering
capacity available with five digits, it has become necessary to
change telephone numbers from 5 to 6 digits, the report quoted the
state-run Myanmar Posts and Telecommunications' announcement as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, a number of foreign companies have signed
contracts with the Myanmar telecommunications authorities to
install nearly 20,000 auto-radio telephone lines in Myanmar
covering areas of Yangon, Mandalay, Lashio and Mawlamyine. The
foreign companies include Israel's Telrai Communications, Japan's
Sumitomo and the United States' Inter Digital Communication.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 cellular phones are also to be installed in Yangon
by Australia's Ericsson Company according to a contract signed
here in January.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that in the 1994-95 fiscal year, there
were 141,250 ordinary telephones in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Myanmar called for public participation in
cooperation with the government to develop communication
facilities, signaling partial opening of the telecommunication
sector to private entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
There are only three telephones per 1,000 inhabitants in
Myanmar and more and more telephones are still needed to cope with
increasing economic activities.

<HEADLINE> Three Designs Chosen for Shanghai New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai authorities have
selected three better designs for its new international airport in
the Pudong New Area, from six entries submitted by international
designers.
</P>
<P>
The designs were submitted by Naco-Foster, a Dutch-British
company, ADP of France and Greiner of the US, all well-known
international airport designers and builders.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 overseas firms applied to join the competition,
but only six were given the chance to submit their designs by the
Shanghai Pudong International Airport Construction Company.
</P>
<P>
The six designs were then subjected to appraisal by a committee
formed of experts in airport design and civil aviation from China,
the United States, Japan, Italy and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The three designs differ in style, but they have the same
starting point of considering Shanghai as soon to be an
international economic, banking and trade center and the "dragon
head" of the Yangtze River Valley in the 21st century, the
committee said.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Pudong International Airport has been listed as
one of the 10 biggest projects of the city in the country's Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The new airport, to be located in the southeastern part of the
Pudong New Area, will be 30 km from the center of Shanghai and 42
km from the Hongqiao International airport.
</P>
<P>
Relocation and land leveling are underway on the 36 square km
land for the first phase of the construction.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that the Pudong International Airport will
have great advantages in geographic location as the future
aviation center of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to the official plan, the new airport is to open to
traffic in 1999. The passenger flow is estimated at 20 million by
the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's current international airport, the Hongqiao Airport,
now has an annual passenger flow of 13 million, which is already
close to saturation point.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai authorities will select the best design from the
three candidates and allow the designer to co-operate with the
East China Architectural Design and Research institute in the
design of the passenger terminal complex of the airport.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Muslims, Croats Sign Accord on Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Muslims and Croats have
signed an new agreement aimed at shoring up their alliance, an
international mediator announced today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed late Saturday by leaders of the two
ethnic groups, whose Washington-brokered federation has shown many
signs of crack in the past few months, according to Michale
Steiner, deputy to High Representative Carl Bildt who oversees
efforts to implement the civilian aspects of the Bosnian peace
agreement,
</P>
<P>
In the latest accord, both sides had agreed to abolish internal
duties charged at ethnic boundaries and Bosnian Croats promised to
pay taxes at the border with Croatia into the federation accounts,
Steiner told reporters in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Muslim and Croat leaders also agreed on a joint flag and coat
of arms for the federation and a one-month timetable for carrying
out 20 different tasks designed for the federation to function
properly.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Muslims and Croats fought a 11-month war before
agreeing to the federation in 1994. Although both sides have
signed many agreements on the federation, few of them have been
fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Steiner said the accord is "completely new" because those
municipalities which refuse to carry it out will be sanctioned and
officials who oppose it will "risk losing their jobs."

<HEADLINE> S. African Govt Urged To Reduce Structural Deficiencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of a
medium-term financial program in South Africa must address the
structural deficiencies inherent in the economy, Governor of the
Reserve Bank Chris Stals said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Expenditure Budget Reform Conference in
Pretoria, Stals said priority must be given to job creation,
economic growth and government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The governor said while the domestic financial environment had
been relatively stable over the past two years, the economy had
shown further evidence of structural deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the country's low level of savings was not
a temporary phenomenon and would impose major constraints on
future investment and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the trade imbalance, Stals urged the government
to solve the problem of unfavorable trade imbalance.
</P>
<P>
South africa's current account deficit grew from 2.2 billion
Rand (about 600 million U.S. Dollars) in 1994 to 12.7 billion
Rand (about 3.34 billion U.S. Dollars) last year, as the value of
imported goods jumped 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise imports amounted to 26 billion U.S. Dollars in
1995, compared to merchandise exports of 21.3 billion U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the unfavorable trade imbalance was more than
covered by a net inflow of 5.7 billion U.S. Dollars in foreign
capital.
</P>
<P>
However, Stals stressed that no progress had been made in
creating employment.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia-Herzegovina Joins World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James D.
Wolfensohn today announced that Bosnia and Herzegovina has joined
the World Bank, according to the Bank's press release received
here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Sarajevo, capital of the war-stricken country,
after meetings with officials from the government of Bosnia and
Herzegovina at which the final membership papers were signed, the
World Bank chief promised swift action from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia's membership in the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) follows its fulfillment of
conditions established by the bank in 1993 for five former
Yugoslav republics for succession to the membership formerly
held by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors in
Washington endorsed a plan for resolving Bosnia's arrears to the
bank, which was one of the requirements for membership. In the
coming five years, the bank expects to provide a net transfer of
some 450 million U.S. dollars in support of Bosnia's
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
In addition to joining the IBRD, which became effective as of
February 25, 1993, the main arm of the World Bank that provides
loans on market terms, Bosnia has also become a member of the
International Development Association (IDA) and the International
Finance Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The IDA is the bank's concessionary lending wing and the IFC is
another lending arm of the World Bank Group for the private
sectors in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Membership paves the way for direct support from the World
Bank. The bank plans to provide an exceptional level of IDA credit
over the 1996-99 fiscal years in addition to the resources from a
150 million dollar Trust Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina
established and approved by the World Bank on February 23 this
year.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated by the bank that Bosnia's reconstruction needs
some 5.1 billion dollars over the next three to four years, with
1.8 billion dollars in the first year alone for the most urgent
works.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The speaker of the upper house of
Russia's parliament said here today that to develop good relations
with China is Russia's long-term unswerving policy.
</P>
<P>
At a banquet in honor of Chinese National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi, Yegor Stroyev,
chairman of the Russian Federation Council, said the People's
Republic of China has been and will remain a major priority in
Russia's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"We have had different chapters in our relations, but history
has taught us that both Russia and China need each other. It is
better for us to be united than divided," Stroyev said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia and China helped each other during the harsh
times when confronting fascism and militarism.
</P>
<P>
"The firm friendship between us is an important factor in
security, stability, peace and development in Asia and the world
at large," Stroyev said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, who arrived here Sunday on a six-day official visit,
thanked the hosts for their hospitality, said China fully respects
the choices made by the Russian people and will strive to develop
friendly, good-neighborly, mutually beneficial and cooperative
ties with Russia in line with the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence, whatever the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Russia is the second leg of Qiao's current tour, which will
also take him to Cuba and Canada. He earlier visited Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Besides Moscow, Qiao and his entourage will visit St.
Petersburg before leaving for Greece for a stop-over.
