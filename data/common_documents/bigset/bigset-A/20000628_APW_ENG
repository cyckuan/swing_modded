<HEADLINE> Promoter says Don King came first with IBF  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Boxing promoter Cedric Kushner says that
although he had influence with IBF founder Robert W. Lee because of
regular payoffs, another promoter, Don King, had even more.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always knew I was second fiddle, or fourth. No matter what
happened, Fuzzy Wuzzy, as he was called, came first,'' Kushner
testified Tuesday at Lee's racketeering trial.
</P>
<P>
   At mentioning a nickname for King, prosecutor Jose P. Sierra
asked the heavyset and mustachioed Kushner if he also had
nicknames. ''Fat man'' and ''walrus,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors have heard some of those names in covert FBI tapes of
conversations between Lee and his longtime ratings chairman, C.
Douglas Beavers, who cooperated with investigators and testified
that he brought money from Kushner and other promoters to Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors maintain King, the most influential promoter in
boxing, was a prime beneficiary of Lee's manipulations of rankings
but have not charged him, describing him as an unindicted
co-conspirator.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers, a longtime Virginia boxing commissioner, testified in
April that King made regular payoffs so his fighters got special
consideration. King, based in Deerfield Beach, Fla., has denied
that.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner did describe a 1991 incident when King and Lee were not
getting along.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF, at its annual convention, was considering whether to
give its approval, a ''sanction'' in boxing terms, to championship
fights in South Africa as its apartheid system began to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner, a native South African and naturalized U.S. citizen,
said he told Lee he favored the change.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was somewhat ambiguous,'' Kushner recalled. ''On the one
hand he was for it, and on the other he said he was under a lot of
pressure, that there were people demonstrating (against it).''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the deliberations was not immediately disclosed,
but Kushner said he refused a Beavers suggestion that promoters pay
$100,000 for each title fight sanctioned in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner said he believed that King arranged for the Rev. Al
Sharpton to bring demonstrators to the convention, in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   King spokesman Greg Fritz said King opposed apartheid, but could
not immediately say whether he had a role in any Sharpton protest.
A Sharpton spokeswoman had no immediate response.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner had testified earlier that in 1987 he persuaded the IBF
to break with other boxing groups and rank South African fighters.
He testified he paid $10,000 for that change.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner said that most of his payments to Lee were ''preventive
medicine:'' efforts to ensure good treatment for his boxers, not
for any specific action.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Bob was happy, someone else's fighter might not jump over
my fighter, or if I needed more time for a mandatory (fight), that
might be granted,'' said Kushner, 51, who gained fame in the 1970s
as a promoter of rock 'n' roll concerts before turning to boxing in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   Three to four times a year, from 1987-1994, Beavers would drive
from his home in Portsmouth, Va., to Kushner's home in East
Hampton, N.Y., and get cash ranging from $2,500 to $10,000, Kushner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner is the fourth big-time promoter to testify against Lee.
All have said payoffs were required to do business with the East
Orange, N.J.-based IBF. As one of three major sanctioning bodies
for boxing in the world, its rankings and decisions play a large
role in the purses earned by boxers, of which managers and
promoters get a cut.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner is expected back on the stand Wednesday, where he is to
discuss a $100,000 bribe other witnesses have said he funneled to
the IBF for a rematch between heavyweight champion George Foreman
and Axel Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and other IBF officials are accused of taking $338,000 in a
span of more than a decade in exchange for favors and rigged
rankings, but the bulk of that money stems from the machinations
regarding Foreman and Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 66, of Fanwood, N.J., and his son, Robert Jr., 38, of
Scotch Plains, N.J., are the only defendants on trial. They face
multiyear prison terms if convicted of conspiracy, racketeering,
fraud and tax charges.
</P>
<P>
   Former IBF championship committee chairman Bill Brennan, 86, of
Warsaw, Va., past president of the U.S. Boxing Association, a group
that became the IBF, was severed from the trial because of ill
health.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF's South American representative, Francisco ''Pacho''
Fernandez of Colombia, remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   The Lee trial is in its 12th week and is expected to last into
August. In the meantime, a court-appointed monitor is overseeing
the IBF, and Lee is barred from participating in IBF affairs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: 'feminization' means 'humanization' of politics  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton on
Tuesday made one of her strongest pitches to date for putting her
in the Senate because she supports what have become known as
traditional ''women's issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also lashed out at her Republican rival Rick Lazio's
plan to repeal a portion of the federal gas tax as ''a bad deal for
New York and a potential bonanza for the oil companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to about 180 members of a Buffalo-area women's
political club, the first lady said the fate of legalized abortion
could hang in the balance with this year's election. She noted that
the next president could wind up appointing at least two and
possibly four new members of the U.S. Supreme Court, who would be
subject to confirmation by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said she would not vote to confirm any nominee for
the Supreme Court who did not support the Roe v. Wade decision
legalizing abortion in America. Lazio, a Long Island congressman,
has declined to make such a pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't understand that Roe v. Wade hangs in the balance,
then we could wake up the day after this election in 2000 and
basically see that right slip away,'' Clinton told a luncheon of
the Taking Action in Politics group.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had an appearance scheduled later in the day at a
Buffalo-area shopping mall and was to receive an award Tuesday
night at a Syracuse synagogue
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Tuesday, Lazio campaigned at service stations in the
Hudson Valley, complaining about the high cost of gasoline and the
Clinton administration's inability to bring petroleum prices down.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Senate, Clinton told the women in Buffalo,
she would work for issues ''that will directly affect the quality
of life for our daughters and girls throughout New York and
America.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton told the audience, which included a few men, that
what had become known as women's issues ''is often a misnomer.''
She said issues that concern women, such as Social Security,
education and abortion rights, are also issues that men are
concerned about.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that when her husband was first elected president,
one commentator suggested the new administration's agenda
represented ''the feminization of politics.'' She said, ''I know he
meant it as an insult ... (but) I think it's leading to the
humanization of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said she has also heard people complain that she
''has an agenda'' in running for the Senate. She said those critics
are correct.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have an agenda about education ... and when it comes to
health care, I have an agenda,'' Clinton said. ''And when it comes
to the economy, I do have an agenda, I want to see it keep growing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have an agenda when it comes to women's issues,'' Clinton
added, saying that it was important to ''support candidates who
will not blink, who will not flinch.''
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen anti-abortion demonstrators were on hand Tuesday
outside the Butler House, a mansion once owned by a publisher of
the Buffalo News, during Clinton's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she has a chance and I'm very concerned about that,''
said protester Mike Mombrea, a retired television news cameraman.
''I think Lazio is the better of the two candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, during a visit to a shopping mall in the Buffalo suburbs,
the first lady attacked Lazio's plan to repeal 4.3 cents of the
federal gasoline tax.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said ''the gas tax is one of the few exceptions where we
actually get more money back than we send to Washington.'' While
New York sends $300 million a year to Washington in gas taxes,
Clinton said it gets back $477 million in highway funding annually.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said Lazio's plan would have a ''damaging
impact'' on the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to me, as usual, you've got my opponent siding with
the Republican leadership instead of the needs and interests of the
people of New York,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady called for the Federal Trade Commission to expand
its inquiry into rising gasoline prices to take in the entire
nation. The FTC is investigating rising prices in the Midwest.

<HEADLINE> Giants 12, Rockies 7  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Shawn Estes pitched seven strong innings, and Rich
Aurilia had three hits and four RBIs as the San Francisco Giants
beat the Colorado Rockies 12-7 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Estalella and Jeff Kent homered for the Giants, whose
first nine runs -- and 11 of their 12 -- came with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Estes (7-3) went 7 1-3 innings, allowing just six hits and
leaving with a 12-3 lead. Reliever Felix Rodriguez inherited two
runners and allowed both to score on RBI singles by Mike Lansing
and Jeffrey Hammonds. The Rockies pushed across two more runs
before Rodriguez fanned Brian Hunter for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   Estes, who entered with the best run support in the majors (7.0
runs per game), benefitted from the Giants' 15-hit attack that
included eight doubles. But Estes also contributed an RBI double
and a sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies manager Buddy Bell was ejected by home-plate umpire
Jerry Layne in the eighth inning after arguing that Estes threw at
Tom Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants chased Colorado starter Kevin Jarvis (2-3) after five
innings, taking a 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kent led off the second with a double and, with two outs,
Aurilia hit an RBI single and Estalella followed with a two-run
homer, his ninth.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, J.T. Snow doubled and scored on Aurilia's two-out
double down the left-field line. After the Rockies intentionally
walked Estalella, Estes lined an RBI double to left-center.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, again with two outs, Kent hit a 427-foot solo
homer, his 20th and his NL-leading 73rd RBI. Snow then singled,
went to second on a wild pitch and attempted to score on Ellis
Burks' single but was gunned down at the plate by left fielder
Brian Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado scored twice in the third. Scott Servais and Neifi
Perez hit back-to-back doubles. Perez went to third on Jarvis'
sacrifice and scored on Tom Goodwin's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies added an unearned run in the fourth. Todd Helton
walked, Jeff Cirillo hit an infield single and both runners
advanced when third baseman Bill Mueller threw wild to second.
Hunter then lined a run-scoring single to right. Estes avoided
further damage, snaring Servais' hard grounder and starting a
double play.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard's two-out, run-scoring single off Scott Karl made
it 7-3 in the sixth. After walks to Kent and Burks in the seventh,
Aurilia hit a two-run double to left.
</P>
<P>
   Snow and Calvin Murray had back-to-back RBI doubles in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The swelling subsided Tuesday in Kirk Rueter's right leg,
one day after being struck above the ankle by a line drive off the
bat of Neifi Perez. Rueter is expected to make his next scheduled
start on Saturday against Los Angeles. ... Rockies slugger Larry
Walker sat out the game to rest his ailing throwing elbow. Walker
missed 23 games earlier in the year because of the injury. ...
Victims of the recent Colorado wildfires were guests of the
Rockies. ... The Rockies signed 20th-round draft choice Ross
Pilkington, who was headed to Nebraska on a football scholarship.
Pilkington, a shortstop who graduated from Loveland (Colo.) High
School, will report this week to the Arizona Rookie League.

<HEADLINE> House To Vote on Disclosure Bill  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a victory for campaign finance reform, the
House easily approved legislation requiring newly popular but often
secretive organizations to say who is paying for TV commercials and
other political activity.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, much like one passed in the Senate, included
only groups that organize under section 527 of the tax code after
GOP efforts to broaden the bill failed.
</P>
<P>
   The 385-39 vote shortly after midnight Tuesday was well above
the two-thirds needed under the special procedure employed by the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are moving forward with what is an important but obviously
a small step to open up the secret organizations to sunshine,''
said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, who has led the effort to force
these groups to disclose their donations and spending. ''This
represents one small triumph for democracy over secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   The final bill was much like one that Democrats originally
proposed. Republican leaders blocked their efforts -- some arguing
that no bill was needed at all; others saying the legislation
should be broadened to include other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, efforts to broaden the bill to include other
nonprofit organizations that get involved in campaigns met with
resistance from Democrats who argued that the GOP bill was unfair
and probably unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ''You shoot as high as you possibly can and end up with
something the majority feels is the best practical solution,'' said
Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., who led the Republican effort.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, was less enthusiastic: ''The House had
a real chance at reform. We blew it.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure requirement will not take effect until President
Clinton signs the bill, meaning that even if the legislation makes
it to his desk before the November election, groups will not have
to disclose money they raise between now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the Senate will now pass this bill and send it to
President Clinton for immediate signature so we will know this
election cycle who and what these organizations are,'' said Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., who pushed similar legislation through the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 is reserved for political groups, giving them
certain tax advantages. It was created for political parties and
political action committees, which report their spending to the
Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But a new brand of 527 is reporting to no one. As far as the FEC
is concerned, these groups claim to be involved in issues, not
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Other nonprofits also avoid disclosure with the FEC by claiming
to be involved in issues, although they, too, spend large sums on
TV ads that obviously are attempting to influence elections. Still,
unlike 527s, these other groups do face some limit on how much
political activity they can conduct without losing their nonprofit
tax status.
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 allows groups to be entirely focused on politics.
</P>
<P>
   One group, called Republicans for Clean Air, ran $2.5 million in
ads praising Texas Gov. George W. Bush and attacking McCain in the
days before a crucial GOP primary election. Another 527, with ties
to House Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, is campaigning for a variety of
Republicans running for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay attacked the House bill as an unconstitutional
infringement on Americans' right to participate in the political
process.
</P>
<P>
   ''This lack of privacy and free speech is chilling,'' he said in
a statement Tuesday. ''This so-called 'reform' bill is in reality
nothing more than a last-ditch effort by the Democrats to protect
their vulnerable incumbent members from valid attacks on their
positions and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is intended to shed light on who is paying for
these advertisements, requiring groups to disclose their names to
the Internal Revenue Service, which would make them public.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing back Democratic attempts to pass the bill early this
month, GOP leaders in the House said the legislation should also
include spending by other nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans crafted a bill that included unions, trade
associations and a host of traditional nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats complained that corporations were left out, and
sought to include them as well. Republicans balked.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also complained that such a broad bill was probably
unconstitutional and doomed for repeal. The GOP version included
year-round nonprofit activity, whereas Democrats wanted to limit it
to activity within a month or two of an election.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise arranged Tuesday allowed Democrats to drop their
objections and return to the original legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The final legislation covers any group that raises at least
$25,000 per year, requiring those that do not already report to the
FEC to report to the IRS.

<HEADLINE> King sentenced to 57 months for defrauding Marine Toys for Tots  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Jerry Lee King, who defrauded the Marine
Corps Toys for Tots Foundation of $1.8 million, was sentenced to
the maximum 57 months in prison and ordered to repay the nonprofit
charity for its losses.
</P>
<P>
   The suburban Buffalo native, a one-time president of the
national Toys for Tots program and the founder of the separate
Amherst Toys for Tots foundation, also faces three years parole
after he was sentenced Tuesday in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Originally indicted on 22 counts, including money laundering and
insurance fraud, King pleaded guilty last March to one count of
wire fraud and one count of making false statements on a tax
return.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it ''a remarkable case for a number of reasons,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Gretchen Wylegala was pleased that U.S.
Judge Richard J. Arcara chose the maximum sentence of just under
five years. Under sentencing guidelines, Arcara was limited to
choose a term between 46 and 57 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lot of money for a fraud and, of course, a fraud
against a charity. And I think that that makes this a special type
of a case,'' Wylegala said. ''I think the foundation was the group
that lost the most because they lost, for at least a period of
time, a good part of their reputation and good name.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's since been restored by them, and I think that this now
brings kind of a sad period in that foundation's existence to a
nice closure.''
</P>
<P>
   After delivering his sentence, Judge Arcara said: ''It is clear
from the facts of this case that there was an elaborate scheme to
divert substantial amounts of money.''
</P>
<P>
   King, 57, was released on bond, and has 72 hours before
beginning his sentence, which will be served in McKean, Pa. Had he
been convicted in a trial, King would have faced a maximum sentence
of more than 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   An intensive investigation, which included the FBI and IRS,
found that King used his position as chairman and founder of the
foundation to divert money through at least five bank accounts he
held secretly in Hong Kong. King managed to transfer the money into
those accounts under the impression that it was to buy toys from
Hong Kong-based manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, King used the money for himself, diverting some of it
to fund his own businesses, while also buying a car and using a
portion to pay for one of his two sons' college education.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud took place from 1991 to 1993. King was forced to
resign as foundation president and chairman in 1992 when federal
authorities began their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   King established his reputation in the toy industry in the
1970s, working his way up at Fisher-Price and eventually founding
his own company, Kingsbury Mini-Motors which, prior to going
bankrupt, had become the nation's largest manufacturer of
pedal-powered toys.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jerry King victimized a lot of people,'' said Bill Grein,
retired major and current foundation vice president. ''He
victimized the Toys for Tots Foundation staff, the United States
Marine Corps and a lot of children that could have benefitted from
the money that he took. So we're pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Grein was one of the people who worked alongside King, and
helped uncover the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jerry King was looked upon as the savior, the guy who was
going to take the Toys for Tots Foundation to the next dimension. I
was really proud to be part of that,'' he said. ''Then the longer I
worked with the man, the more I realized that this was a person I
did not want to be associated with.''
</P>
<P>
   Grein said it was especially devastating considering that King
was a former marine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll never forgive Jerry King for that. You just don't let the
Marine Corps down like that, not after 20 years in the corps,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It took almost two years for the foundation to recover,
including moving its headquarters from Buffalo to Virginia. Last
Christmas, the foundation gave out toys to a record 5.9 million
children, Grein said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People seem to have forgiven us for what Jerry King did,'' he
said. ''So one bad man has left the foundation, but the foundation
is in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 2 1-2 hour sentencing hearing, Judge Arcara raised
numerous questions about King's motives and conduct.
</P>
<P>
   When King's defense attorney Patrick Brown noted there was
another side to his client, and he was not ''an evil person,''
Judge Arcara responded: ''You're saying he's not an evil person? I
don't know how you define evil, but $1.8 million ... it almost
sounds like a preconceived plan.''
</P>
<P>
   King refused to comment outside of court. Inside the courtroom,
when asked by the judge whether he had anything to say, King told
the judge his defense attorney ''said everything I can possibly
say. I don't have anything to add to that.''

<HEADLINE> State commission imposes $133,600 in fines on lobbyists  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The New York Yankees, struggling on the
field of late, suffered a setback in another arena Tuesday when the
club was fined by the state Lobbying Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were one of 36 groups or companies who lobby New
York state government officials and state legislators to be fined
by the commission for failing to file their 1999 financial
statements by the Jan. 15, 2000, deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen of the lobby clients, including the Yankees, received
the largest fine handed down by the commission Tuesday, $5,000. The
commission, which discusses its penalties in executive session, did
not disclose why the Yankees were among those getting the largest
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   When lobby clients fail to file the required financial
disclosure statements on time ''it is pretty much cut and dried''
that a fine will be levied, commission Executive Director David
Grandeau said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Grandeau said the club did file the required disclosure forms
prior to June 21, when the commission held a hearing for lobbyists
to explain why they missed the filing deadline.
</P>
<P>
   A grace period for tardy filers disappeared in 2000 thanks to a
new lobbying law created by Gov. George Pataki and the state
Legislature in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first year that lobbyists did not get written
warning and a 15-day grace period to get their financial filings in
to the lobbying commission.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Rubenstein of Rubenstein Associates, the New York City
public relations firm which is the Yankees' registered lobbyist in
Albany, said the fine occurred due to an oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a complicated law, passed in December of 1999, that
has different interpretations,'' he said Tuesday. ''The Yankees did
no lobbying (in 1999) and they failed to file a piece of paper.
They had no intent to violate the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees retain a lobbyist to be heard in Albany on various
issues that relate to the club, including the regulation of cable
television and the periodic talk of a new ballpark to replace
Yankee Stadium. Some state money would likely be sought for such a
project.
</P>
<P>
   Grandeau said that from the commission's standpoint, the new law
worked to hasten the filing of financial disclosure statements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Late filers were running at about 20 percent,'' Grandeau said.
''Now we are well below two-three percent. I think people are also
being much more accurate in their reporting because there are
significant fines that can be imposed for inaccurate filing.''
</P>

   The commission can fine lobbyists or lobby clients up to $25,000

<HEADLINE> D.C. Mulls Changing School Board  </HEADLINE>
By CANDACE SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- District of Columbia Mayor Anthony Williams
headed toward a narrow victory in a referendum Tuesday on his
proposal to appoint some members of the city's school board.
</P>
<P>
   Results released by the D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics
showed 19,643 votes in favor of the proposal and 18,795 against.
That was 51.1 percent in favor and 48.9 percent against.
</P>
<P>
   However, 2,000 absentee and special ballots remained to be
counted, according to elections spokesman Bill O'Field, who said
those votes would be counted Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At present the school board consists of 11 members, all of them
elected. Under the proposal on the referendum, which Williams has
made a major issue, the mayor would appoint four members of a
nine-member board, while the remaining five would be elected.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has said he could not be held responsible for the
quality of education if he had no input on the school board, which
has come under fire for infighting, low test scores and court
mandates requiring improvements to facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the proposal said it deprived district citizens of
one more measure of self-government.
</P>
<P>
   A federally appointed panel took over the troubled system and
stripped the current school board of most of its power more than
three years ago. In May, school superintendent Arlene Ackerman
quit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the right thing to do right now,'' Williams said of
the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   But city leaders weren't all on Williams' side.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no data to show where a non-elected board improves
the education of our children,'' Councilwoman Carol Schwartz said.

<HEADLINE> Red Army Hijacking Suspect in Japan  </HEADLINE>
By KOZO MIZOGUCHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- An ex-member of a radical Japanese leftist group
allegedly involved in the 1970 hijacking of an airliner to North
Korea arrived here Wednesday after being extradited from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshimi Tanaka, 51, who once belonged to the Red Army terrorist
group, arrived at Tokyo's main international airport on a flight
from Bangkok, police said. Police planned to question him later
about the hijacking of the Japanese jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   The nine hijackers sought exile in North Korea, where four
former Red Army members reportedly remain. Three others have died
from illnesses, while one member secretly returned to Japan in 1988
and was convicted on hijacking charges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Tanaka was arrested in Cambodia with more than $120,000
worth of fake $100 bills. He was trying to flee to Vietnam in a
North Korean Embassy car accompanied by North Korean diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Tanaka was found innocent in Thailand on charges of possessing
fake currency as part of a counterfeit ring, but was kept in jail
until the extradition request was honored. He was also wanted in
Japan on charges of inciting a riot and an attack on a police
station.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Army was responsible for bombings and attacks on
embassies and airports in Japan and abroad. Its most notorious
attack came in 1972 when 24 people were killed at Israel's Lod
airport.

<HEADLINE> House Backs Heating Oil Reserve  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Propelled by rising fuel prices, the House
renewed its backing for creation of a special heating oil reserve
for the Northeast and approved a bigger budget for research into
renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   House lawmakers, by a 393-33 vote Tuesday night, approved an
amendment to a $21.7 billion spending bill for energy and water
programs that would set up a 2 million barrel reserve that the
energy secretary could tap into when price spikes cause financial
hardships in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast was hit hard last winter by tight supplies and
sharp jumps in heating oil prices. ''We should not force families
to choose between heating their homes and buying food in the winter
months,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, sponsored by Rep. Don Sherwood, R-Pa., also
reauthorizes the president's power to withdraw oil from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a 600 million barrel stockpile in
Texas and Louisiana set up during the oil crisis of 1975 to help
meet emergencies. It has been used only once, by President Bush
during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives the energy secretary the right to purchase oil at
$15 a barrel from small-scale ''stripper'' wells when world oil
prices drop below that level. Oil in the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve must now be purchased from foreign sources.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the same measure in April, but the Senate has
not acted on it and the focus on energy policy brought about by
high gasoline prices drove backers to attach it to the must-pass
fiscal 2001 spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is no secret to anybody that this country is facing an
energy crisis from one end of the nation to another,'' said Rep.
Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Debate on the energy spending bill, which passed by 407-19, was
dominated by partisan exchanges on who was to blame for high gas
prices and what could be done to make the country more energy
self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused Republicans of cutting funds for alternative
energy and failing to reauthorize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
law after it expired on March 31, while Republicans said the
administration was to blame for not reducing U.S. dependence on
foreign oil. ''The bottom line,'' said Sherwood, ''is that we lack
a coherent national energy policy to insulate us from the
volatility of these markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The House approved by voice an amendment by Reps. Matt Salmon,
R-Ariz., and Mark Udall, D-Colo., to increase funding for renewable
energy sources -- solar, biomass, wind and geothermal power -- by $40
million to about $390 million. The House bill as it came out of
committee provided $106 million less than President Clinton wanted
for renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
   Another amendment, proposed by Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga.,
requires the energy secretary to submit a report within 30 days of
the bill becoming law on national energy policy and plans to
address the escalating prices of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, which has yet to take up the energy and water
spending bill, Energy Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska,
and Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., were pushing an energy
package that, like the House-passed measure, would reauthorize the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, create a home heating oil reserve and
encourage stripper well production.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4733.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Influence Congress  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More and more, members of Congress are being
pulled into the orbits of presidential hopefuls Al Gore and George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In matters large and small, the presidential campaigns of the
Democratic vice president and the Republican Texas governor are
influencing, sometimes even shaping, legislative conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and congressional Democrats have aligned themselves closely
on major issues to push a mutual agenda -- issues like prescription
drug coverage for older Americans and a so-called patients' bill of
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bush generally has kept his distance from Republicans in
Congress, although on several occasions he has gently chided his
party's Capitol Hill division.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Republicans who control Congress appear to be
attempting to accommodate Bush even if he doesn't ask.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted this month to give the next president the
ability to make unilateral cuts in the nation's nuclear arsenal,
while in effect keeping current restrictions in place on President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Senate bill would help whoever wins in November,
Bush has made a specific campaign proposal for deep cuts in the
U.S. nuclear arsenal, now about 7,200 warheads, whether Russia goes
along or not.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal would be illegal under current law.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the bill said the Bush campaign did not ask for the
change, and campaign officials refused to comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   Because he served in both the House and the Senate, Gore has
many friends and acquaintances on Capitol Hill and frequently goes
visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, with the constitutional role of Senate president,
Gore has the authority to vote to break Senate ties.
</P>
<P>
   This authority was exercised with a flourish last week as Senate
Democrats ''summoned'' Gore off the campaign trail to rush back to
the Capitol in case his vote was needed on a White House-backed
bill on hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The vote wasn't even close. The bill passed 57-42. Instead of
casting a tie-breaking vote, Gore found himself presiding over a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans later suggested the outcome was never in doubt, and
Gore was brought in mostly for political grandstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Bush doesn't have as many close relationships with members of
Congress as Gore does. His top congressional allies are Sen. Paul
Coverdell, R-Ga., and Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a good deal of contact, but it's not like we're flying
in formation,'' Coverdell said of his relationship with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush's positions on many issues naturally coincide with
those of Senate Republicans, even though ''we got at cross purposes
on Kosovo. Sometimes that's hard to avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said the Bush campaign checks with him ''from time to
time'' but that mostly it's just to find out what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush has not tried to weigh in on a lot of issues,''
said former Bush rival Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. ''But when he has,
as with Kosovo and on the earned income tax credit, he's been
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bush made his disagreement with House Republicans
clear when he labeled as ''a bad idea'' their plan to save money in
the budget by delaying income-support payments to poor workers.
They immediately withdrew it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last month, Bush subtly lodged objections to legislation
by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va.,
that would set a July 1, 2001, deadline for withdrawing troops from
Kosovo. The proposal was withdrawn after a Bush spokesman suggested
the governor felt it amounted to ''legislative overreach.''
</P>
<P>
   His latest dispute with the lawmakers came Tuesday when he
differed with an effort by House Republicans to allow American food
into Cuba for the first time in 40 years. ''I have opposed lifting
the sanctions and I still continue to do so,'' Bush said during a
campaign appearance in Wayne, Mich. ''I am very skeptical as to
whether or not Fidel Castro will let food get to his people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's relationship with congressional Democrats hasn't been all
smooth sailing. He disagrees with most of them on the
administration-backed bill to establish permanent normal trade
relations with China. The bill is strongly opposed by organized
labor, a top Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The China trade bill, however, is the exception rather than the
rule.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't any ''usual trend'' for the spells that presidential
candidates can cast over Congress, said Thomas Mann of the
Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. ''It's complicated,
depending on whether the candidates are trying to distance
themselves from their party in Congress or put their fates
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been on and off with Bush and the Republicans in
Congress,'' Mann said. ''For one thing, he believes he's more
popular than they are.''

<HEADLINE> Fugitive pleads case Wednesday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A fugitive who fled prison after being
convicted of selling $20 worth of drugs three decades ago is
expected to surrender Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Harvie Richardson, now 50, will make a last-ditch plea for
leniency by offering letters of support from 100 friends in
Vancouver, British Columbia. Richardson hopes that Monroe County
Court Judge John J. Connell will set aside a 1971 sentence of up to
four years in prison. He sold LSD to an undercover police officer
at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Connell has refused twice to dismiss or reduce Richardson's
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson will argue that he deserves mercy because he became
an exemplary citizen, his lawyer told the Rochester Democrat and
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ''The man who is coming to court is a very different man from
the young, impetuous and reckless student of 30 years ago,'' said
Michael Bolton, who is Richardson's lawyer in Vancouver, where
Richardson has lived since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also will argue that his incarceration could have a
dire effect on his wife, Amalia, who suffers from breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Connell rejects the arguments, the letters of support
could be reviewed by a parole board to help determine when he would
be released.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting Richardson's similar arguments previously and
ordering his surrender to finish his sentence, Connell said
Richardson needs to take responsibility for his actions and
shouldn't be rewarded for escaping.
</P>
<P>
   Although District Attorney Howard R. Relin opposed setting aside
the sentence, he said he expects Richardson to be paroled within
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson couldn't be reached for comment. Bolton said he and
his wife are traveling to Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Because Richardson is a prison escapee, he could be taken into
custody when he enters the United States. Bolton, however, said he
hopes U.S. immigration authorities and police allow him to
surrender on his own.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City native and Vietnam War protester served six
weeks in Attica Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison.
He then was transferred to Camp Georgetown, a minimum-security work
camp in Madison County.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was at the work camp for six weeks when the riot and
retaking of Attica killed 43 inmates and correctional officers. He
said he walked away from the camp and fled to Canada when a guard
told him that he would return to Attica.
</P>
<P>
   The past of the research technologist who lives in a $700,000
home was revealed in 1998 when New York authorities tracked him to
Vancouver. Because Richardson had not changed his citizenship,
Canadian immigration authorities ordered him to leave.

Newcomer Smith Upsets Cook in Utah
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Political rookie Derek Smith upset embattled Rep.
Merrill Cook in Utah's Republican primary Tuesday, handily beating the two-term
incumbent. With nearly half of the precincts reporting, Smith led Cook 58
percent to 42 percent. Cook's seat was considered one of the most vulnerable,
and GOP leaders in Congress had jumped to his defense. But fellow Republicans in
Utah were less supportive, sending Cook into the primary against the millionaire
computer company founder Smith. Cook becomes only the second incumbent to lose
in a primary this year, and the first Republican. The incumbent had been stung
by news reports over the last two years regarding his combustible temper,
erratic behavior and staff mismanagement.

<HEADLINE> Iran Impounds Iraqi Oil Tankers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Iranian authorities have impounded two Iraqi
tankers suspected of smuggling Iraqi oil, according to Iranian
state radio.
</P>
<P>
   The tankers had anchored off the Iranian island of Kish in the
southern Gulf several days ago, the Voice of the Islamic Republic
of Iran said Tuesday night in a bulletin monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the tankers lacked proper documentation and
entered Iran's waters without permission carrying ''smuggled Iraqi
oil.'' It added that a previously impounded tanker was still
anchored off Kish.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible to obtain an immediate response from the
Iraqi authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations imposed sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait
in 1990. Officials of the U.S. 5th Fleet, which enforces U.N.
sanctions against Iraq in the Persian Gulf, have said that Iraqi
ships evade the embargo by sailing down the Persian Gulf in Iranian
waters.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Budget Vetoed Due To Tax  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SHARP
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A possible government shutdown hangs in
the balance as Gov. Don Sundquist and the Legislature clash over a
budget bill that doesn't contain the state income tax he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The $18.3 billion budget Sundquist vetoed Tuesday faced a
crucial Senate override vote Wednesday. Without a budget, state
government could be forced to shut down when the new fiscal year
begins Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor has pushed for tax reform since last
year and called two special sessions, saying a 3.75 percent tax on
wages is needed to increase money for education and health care and
keep Tennessee from becoming ''a second-rate state.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked the members of this General Assembly to consider what
kind of state we want Tennessee to be in 10, 20, 50 years,''
Sundquist said. ''Judging from the budget before me today, the
majority in this General Assembly answered that question by saying
it wants a state that continues to lag behind the rest of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after Sundquist's veto, the House overrode it by a
vote of 78-19. An override in the Senate, where the budget passed
23-6 last week, requires a majority of 17 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard our constituents say make responsible cuts, and we
did. We heard people tell us to live within the available dollars
and to the extent we could, we did,'' said Democratic House
Majority Leader Jere Hargrove, one of the budget's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has said that an income tax is the most equitable
approach but that he is willing to consider other means of tax
reform. Tennessee is one of nine states without a broad-based
income tax.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Legislature approved a spending plan without taking
up tax reform. Instead, it used one-time money for recurring
expenses and raised state revenue estimates based on the booming
economy.
</P>
<P>
   All 99 House members and 16 of 33 senators are up for
re-election. Many voters oppose an income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Failing an override, a temporary budget could be passed to keep
some state services funded past Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In return for an income tax, Sundquist had proposed exempting
food from the state's 6 percent sales tax, dropping the tax on
interest and dividends, and reducing the overall sales tax to 3.75
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has argued that Tennessee is too dependent on sales
taxes, which account for 57 cents of every state tax dollar.

<HEADLINE> Elian Departure Not Quite Certain  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez may be heading back to Cuba as
early as Wednesday night for the first time in seven months.
Assuming the Supreme Court gives the green light, his return home
will attract a lot more attention than his departure.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an adverse court ruling, Elian would be free to leave
U.S. soil for Cuba by 4 p.m. EDT, and tentative plans were being
made for a nighttime arrival in Havana aboard a chartered flight
from Washington Dulles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Elian would be accompanied back home to Cuba by his family and
an entourage of Cuban compatriots, including classmates who joined
him here in April.
</P>
<P>
   But the departure plans would have to be put on hold if the
Supreme Court agrees to hear an appeal by Elian's Miami relatives
seeking a political asylum hearing for the 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials said the departure plans were being coordinated
by Gregory Craig, the lawyer for Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, just another Cuban boy last November, has since become an
international celebrity. He barely survived a perilous boat journey
from Cuba that claimed the life of his mother, and since his rescue
from the Atlantic Ocean on Thanksgiving Day he has been at the
center of a bitter custody battle between his father in Cuba and
his Cuban-American relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For President Fidel Castro, getting Elian out of the clutches of
his powerful adversary has been a No. 1 priority.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has become a rallying point for anti-Castro sentiments in
the United States, particularly in Miami's Cuban exile
neighborhoods. He stayed with his Miami relatives until federal
agents seized him on April 22 and turned him over to his father in
Washington pending the court appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Elian may be in the dark as to what may await him today.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. Joan Brown Campbell, former general secretary of
the National Council of Churches and a staunch supporter of Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, said Tuesday she believed the father has been
careful not to promise his son when he might be returning home.
</P>
<P>
   ''My overwhelming impression is that no one is talking to him
about going home'' yet, she said. ''I don't think his father is
going to talk about this until they're sure they're going.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, attorneys for the relatives asked Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy to block Elian's departure so the full Supreme Court could
address the issue. Kennedy is responsible for dealing with cases
from the 11th Circuit Court in Atlanta, which ruled last week that
Elian should be allowed to leave on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Miami relatives have argued that a few weeks'
delay in the long legal fight over the boy is a small cost in a
case with stakes of such magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   All along, the Miami relatives have said the immigration service
erred in not granting Elian the right to apply for political
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have consistently maintained that the
desire of Elian's father to repatriate the boy to Cuba must be
respected, a position backed by a succession of court rulings.

<HEADLINE> Fishermen find body in Mohawk River  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GLENVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - Detectives said they must rely on dental
records to identify the body of a man believed to be from
Flagstaff, Ariz., that was found in the Mohawk River.
</P>
<P>
   Two fishermen discovered the body after it had been in the river
for five days.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the level of decomposition ... we can't rely on his
photo ID or a relative to identify him,'' said police Lt. Lewis
Moskowitz.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sign of violence and town police said their
preliminary cause is drowning. Police are contacting a person in
Colorado who may be a relative of the man to get dental records.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen noticed a heel sticking up out of the water then
saw the body. Police said the man carried identification papers
that showed he was from Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   His name was being withheld until police could tell his family.
</P>
<P>
   Glenville is 22 miles northwest of Albany.

<HEADLINE> The cow comes home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Maybe the grass was greener on the other side of
the park.
</P>
<P>
   A fiberglass cow was found late Tuesday in another part of the
Queens park where it went missing a day earlier, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The cow, one of 500 placed around the city as part of CowParade
New York 2000, was reported stolen at about 11 a.m. Monday from its
spot in Forest Park, in the Richmond Hill section.
</P>
<P>
   A man cycling in the park Tuesday spotted the bovine sculpture
near a horse trail and notified a local television station. The
station contacted police, who met the cyclist in the park. The cow
was recovered just before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-pound cow, which was decorated by a seventh-grade student
at a Queens public school, was taken to the 102nd Precinct, short
one horn. It was unclear how long the cow would spend in police
custody.
</P>
<P>
   The cow, called Moo-Stripa, is 7 feet long, 4 feet tall and 3
feet wide and is painted with orange, red, white, blue and green
stripes.
</P>
<P>
   The organization sponsoring the exhibit, CowParade Holdings
Inc., has offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to the
arrest and conviction of anyone responsible for stealing or
damaging any of the cows.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cows are here for everyone to enjoy,'' company president
Jerome Elbaum said. ''Pet them, kiss them, take your picture with
them. But why would anyone want to damage these beautiful cows,
which were decorated with such love and creativity by talented
artists, including New York City schoolchildren?''

<HEADLINE> Missouri Executes Convicted Killer  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID SCOTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- A man was executed by injection early
Wednesday for suffocating a woman and her son during a 1988 robbery
because he feared the pair would identify him.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Hunter, 53, was apparently the first inmate in Missouri
history put to death without a jury trial. When his case came to
trial in 1989, Hunter was clinically depressed and suicidal. He
pleaded guilty and asked the judge for the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   His later attempts to seek a new trial were denied. Hours before
his death, he said he didn't expect a last-minute reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no justice,'' Hunter said. ''It's time for this
nightmare to be over, as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was convicted of killing Mildred Hodges, 75, and her son,
Richard, 49, at their home in Jefferson City. Tomas Ervin was also
convicted in the crime and sentenced to die.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter denied that Ervin was involved in the murders, saying an
unnamed accomplice killed Richard Hodges after the victim's mother
died during a scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was earlier convicted of killing a blind bar owner in
1968, but was released on parole in 1980. Prosecutor Richard
Callahan said Hunter was an intelligent man whose cocaine habit
cost him work.
</P>
<P>
   In need of money, Hunter and Ervin planned to rob the Hodges
home, Callahan said. In his confession, Hunter said the Hodges were
killed because the assailants feared they had been recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Both victims were found with plastic bags over their heads. A
medical examiner said they died of suffocation.

<HEADLINE> Newcomer Smith Upsets Cook in Utah  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT GEHRKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Political rookie Derek Smith upset
embattled Rep. Merrill Cook in Utah's Republican primary Tuesday,
handily beating the two-term incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Smith received 29,592 votes, 59 percent, to Cook's 20,847 votes,
41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''For an absolute political unknown to come out of nowhere and
come from behind in just 12 weeks and win the Republican nomination
says this is still the greatest country in the world,'' Smith said
in his victory speech Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, whose seat was considered one of the most vulnerable, had
been stung by news reports over the last two years about his
combustible temper and accusations of erratic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional GOP leaders -- hoping to maintain their 11-seat
advantage in the House -- had jumped to Cook's defense, but fellow
Republicans in Utah were less supportive, sending him into the
primary against the millionaire computer company founder Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't win when (state) party big shots won't stand up for
you,'' Cook said Tuesday night, adding that he plans to return to
politics. ''This guy's not finished yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook becomes only the second incumbent to lose in a primary this
year, and the first Republican. The other incumbent was nine-term
Democratic Rep. Matthew Martinez of California.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt easily defeated
conservative challenger Glen Davis in the GOP gubernatorial runoff.
Early returns show Leavitt had a wide lead over Davis. With 94
percent of precincts reporting statewide, Leavitt led 62 percent,
107,652 votes, to 38 percent, 66,590 votes.
</P>
<P>
   And in primary runoffs in South Carolina, GOP voters chose a
candidate for a congressional district on the coast, and re-elected
a state representative being challenged by her estranged husband.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, some Republicans had said Cook was too weak a candidate
to fend off Democrat Jim Matheson, son of the late Gov. Scott
Matheson, a Utah political hero and the last Democrat to hold the
office.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 35, stepped into the race minutes before the filing
deadline. He had no political experience, but spent $509,000 of his
own money on the race.
</P>
<P>
   Early polls showed Smith far ahead of Cook. But weeks of
negative ads tightened the race to a statistical dead heat,
according to one recent poll. Another showed Cook still trailing
badly.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cook, 54, and Smith, 35, are conservatives who oppose gun
control and abortion rights. The race has focused instead on Cook's
temper and accusations of erratic behavior from former staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, after a half-dozen unsuccessful campaigns for everything
from school board to governor, won the House seat in 1996. In years
past, he angered many by running a citizens' initiative against a
GOP tax increase and briefly leaving the party to challenge a
Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Cook was briefly banned from state GOP
headquarters after a foul-mouthed tirade days before the November
election. Soon after he won his second term, Cook fired chief of
staff Janet Jenson, who accused him of delusional behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''Merrill has taken up permanent residence in whacko land,''
Jenson wrote in an office e-mail. ''If he asks you to fax his
underwear to the speaker's office, please just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the accusations were unfounded, though he acknowledged
having a temper.
</P>
<P>
   In Leavitt's primary, the two-term governor was forced to defend
his record against conservative businessman Davis, who raised
questions about the governor's role in the Olympic scandal and his
support for limited gun control. Leavitt outspent his opponent more
than 7-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, domestic discord led to a bitter race between
two-term Republican state Rep. Shirley Hinson and her estranged
husband, retired school principal Jimmy Hinson.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Hinson captured 52 percent of the vote Tuesday to win
her third term. She is assured of the seat because there is no
Democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The race was steeped in the details of the Hinsons' troubled
marriage, including allegations of death threats and infidelity.
Shirley Hinson said her husband was simply seeking revenge; he said
he could do a better job.
</P>
<P>
   And in the race for an open seat in Congress, state Rep. Henry
Brown defeated former state Transportation Chairman H.B. ''Buck''
Limehouse to win the GOP nomination to replace retiring three-term
GOP Rep. Mark Sanford, who kept a term-limit pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial results Tuesday showed Brown with 55 percent of the
vote to Limehouse's 45 percent. He will face Democrat Andy Brack, a
former spokesman for Democratic Sen. Ernest Hollings, in the fall.

<HEADLINE> Report: Airline Service Improving  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tired of airline delays? Lost luggage?
Overbooked flights? You're not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the American airline industry are skyrocketing
this year even as air carriers try to live up to their promise to
improve customer service, federal investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines last year staved off legislative action by promising to
treat customers better and to be more forthright with passengers
all the way through their travel experience. When Transportation
Department inspectors checked earlier this year to find out whether
the airlines were living up to that pledge, they found varying
degrees of success.
</P>
<P>
   ''Airlines are making a clear and genuine effort at
strengthening the attention paid to customer service, but
bottom-line results to date are mixed,'' the department's inspector
general said in a preliminary report to Congress. ''The airlines
have a way to go to restore consumer confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, complaints were up 74 percent in the first four months
of 2000 when compared with the same period in 1999 -- 6,916 to
3,985. Delay complaints, the department's top complaint about
airlines -- were up 80 percent -- 2,842 in the first four months of
2000, compared with 1,546 in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   While the increase can be attributed to the Transportation
Department's introduction of complaint filing over the Internet,
that doesn't mean that there's not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The air carriers receive 100 to 400 complaints for every
complaint filed with the DOT,'' inspectors said.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are getting better at warning customers about delays
and cancellations, inspectors found. However, they still aren't
telling customers the truth about the delays, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several airlines pointed to the air traffic control system as
the reason for delays, even in cases of extremely bad weather, crew
unavailability or maintenance problems,'' inspectors said. In fact,
some airlines knew about delays as much as four hours beforehand
but didn't tell passengers until they had boarded the plane and
couldn't get back inside the airport, inspectors found.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are only six months into their pledge, and none of them
were identified in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce Committee, which requested the report, will
consider it at a hearing Wednesday, where airline industry
executives were scheduled to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., said he hasn't given up
on the idea of passenger fairness legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors' report ''shows mixed success and raises many
questions and concerns,'' McCain said. ''Unfortunately, the report
indicates that the airlines still have a long way to go to make
significant inroads on the customer service front.''
</P>
<P>
   In their pledge, the airlines promised to volunteer the lowest
airfares or cheaper travel options when people call for
reservations, to give passengers at least 24 hours to cancel ticket
purchases and to find lost luggage within 24 hours. They also said
they would update passengers at 15- to 20-minute intervals when
there were delays.
</P>
<P>
   Customers usually get the best price they're eligible for, but
sometimes higher prices are charged when the ticket agent doesn't
follow correct procedures, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   And while actually following their rule, airlines aren't telling
people when the 24-hour clock starts on their efforts to find lost
luggage and aren't telling people that they can get refunds if they
cancel within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''The customer should not have to ask if this option is
available,'' investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department will check airline service again
before January.
</P>
<P>
   ''By December, the airlines will have had a full year in which
to fully implement their plans,'' Transportation Department
Inspector General Kenneth Mead said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Voters Stirred By Oil Issues  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The threat stirs crowds at campaign rallies
and grabs headlines in newspapers: Elect top opposition candidate
Vicente Fox as president and he will sell out Mexico, including its
state-run oil company.
</P>
<P>
   There's little chance Pemex, the world's sixth-largest oil
company, will cease to be a state monopoly anytime soon. But the
campaign threats are part of a larger debate about the dreaded
p-word: privatization. And Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who
has said he sees no reason why Pemex couldn't be privatized, is an
easy target.
</P>
<P>
   For most Mexicans, privatization has meant enrichment for the
politically connected -- or foreign exploitation of the country's
resources. But as government funds for state-run sectors become
more scarce, officials have looked for ways to find outside
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question in the air is: How do we think about having the
private sector assume some of the risk for projects and receive
some of the rewards?'' said George Baker, editor of Mexico Energy
Intelligence, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   But in Mexico, talking about private investment is only a little
easier than talking about privatization. Eduardo Olivo Aguilar, a
25-year-old former bank employee who is studying finance, said any
money would likely come from American investors who would
eventually exploit Mexican workers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government has succeeded in selling some
state-owned industries -- including telecommunications and banking --
attempts to privatize state-owned utilities have failed, and
ruling-party presidential candidate Francisco Labastida and leftist
candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas have repeatedly accused Fox of
wanting to privatize Pemex, largely considered sacred in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has repeatedly denied planning to privatize the oil monopoly
if he is elected president, acknowledging that the move would be
political suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, however, he said the money used for Pemex would be
better spent on education and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the past, (Pemex) had a strong responsibility in creating
jobs, but today that responsibility is much less,'' he said. ''In
the past, the transformation and formation of Pemex represented a
high percentage of Mexico's raw material. Today, that's not the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Pemex has been one of Labastida's many attempts
to portray Fox -- who is trying to end the ruling party's 71 years
in power -- as a traitor. Polls show the two locked in a statistical
dead heat before Sunday's election.
</P>
<P>
   Armand Peschard-Sverdrup, director of the Mexico Project at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the threats
paint Fox ''as someone who would try to sell Mexico to
foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is the perception that oil is the last frontier of the
Mexican identity,'' he said. ''The fact that they would lose that
to a foreigner, there's a kind of psychological'' impact.
</P>
<P>
   In 1884, Mexico's government surrendered the state's ownership
of the subsoil, opening the oil industry to foreign investment --
largely by British and American companies. But in 1938, foreign oil
companies refused to raise wages, and Cardenas' father, Lazaro,
expropriated the companies in one of his most memorable moves as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Mexican government has kept a tight hold on the
oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-government union is also a powerful influence, with its
members historically backing the ruling-party candidate in
elections. Yet that is changing. Prosecutors are investigating a
complaint by workers at Pemex that executives used company
information and resources to support the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has 28.4 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the
second-largest in the Western Hemisphere after Venezuela. Oil
accounts for a third of the government's revenues and 7 percent of
the country's total export earnings. More than half the country's
net oil exports go to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The government, however, has been forced to cut subsidies and
funding for Pemex. To raise money, officials have considered
opening the company to more private investment -- an idea Labastida,
Cardenas and Fox all support.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the private sector also could introduce improved
technology and more research, something labor-intensive Pemex has
lacked.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes Prescription Drug Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are pushing their Medicare
prescription drug bill toward passage in an atmosphere of intense
partisanship, with Democrats mounting an all-night campaign of
opposition and threatening a walkout to interrupt debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Older Americans deserve financial security and health
security. Our plan would ensure both of them,'' House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Tuesday as the GOP high command
counted votes in advance of Wednesday's showdown. ''When it comes
to prescription drug coverage, the time for politics is over and
the time for progress is now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats said politics and Republicans' fear of a backlash
from senior citizens was driving them to propose a sham bill that
would principally benefit the pharmaceutical industry. ''Not only
is it empty promises, it is empty pill jars,'' Rep. Patrick
Kennedy, D-R.I., jabbed at one point, holding an empty vial aloft
to dramatize his point.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton joined the GOP-bashing, telling an audience
Tuesday night that Republicans were afraid to let a costlier and
more generous Democratic plan come to a vote. ''Why?'' he asked
rhetorically. ''Because it might pass in an election year. Because
they're just five seats in the majority and they figure there might
be six or seven of them that might figure out that the voters back
home may ... actually look at the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled vote capped a brief but intense struggle over the
issue likely to resonate into the fall campaign, in which Democrats
are mounting a major effort to overturn the narrow GOP majority in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill envisions a blend of private insurance
companies and federal subsidies to spread prescription drug
coverage nationwide to any Medicare-eligible senior citizen who
wants it. The bill, estimated to cost about $40 billion over five
years, includes subsidies for low-income seniors as well as those
with high drug expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic proposal, with a price tag nearly double the GOP
plan, calls for a program in which the government establishes a
uniform drug benefit to be made available nationwide. It, too,
contains subsidies for the low income, and more generous benefits
for seniors with high drug costs than Republicans provide.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the debate over policy differences, though, lie
competing political calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, cautioned by their pollster that passing
legislation is a ''political imperative,'' pushed the bill through
committee last week on a party-line vote and expressed confidence
they could do the same on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, determined to attract senior citizen support as part
of their campaign to win the House this fall, labored to hold
defections to a minimum, part of a strategy to deny GOP claims that
their measure was a bipartisan solution to a problem vital to 39
million senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   They demanded that Republicans permit them a vote on their
costlier alternative, but that seemed unlikely Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they warned that denial likely would trigger a program of
disruptive tactics on the House floor, including demands for a
series of procedural roll calls that could kill hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''One time during impeachment ... we had a walkout,'' Democratic
leader Dick Gephardt said Tuesday. ''We entertained that idea too''
for the Medicare drug battle.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Democrats turned a basement room in the Capitol
into a mock pharmacy, and arranged for a succession of lawmakers to
be available around the clock for talk radio programs and other
appearances designed to underscore their opposition to the GOP
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered with some political theater of their own.
</P>
<P>
   They touted their proposal at a ceremony on the steps outside
the Capitol on Tuesday, with entertainment provided by a
retirement-age barbershop quartet.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and other supporters of the bill walked to the
microphones serenaded to the tune of ''Happy Days Are Here Again,''
a virtual anthem for Democrats for more than a generation.

<HEADLINE> Navy Divers Convicted of Poaching  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Two decorated Canadian navy divers
were convicted of poaching dozens of lobsters from the ocean floor
that later were served at a private party.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer Anne Menard and Leading Seaman Joe Tremblay of the
Atlantic Fleet Diving Unit admitted Tuesday they helped colleagues
nab about 100 pounds of lobsters in September 1999 and transport
them to a military base to be cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Nancy Koppang, a military prosecutor, said the illegal
lobster hunt occurred at a time when the government was involved in
a high-profile dispute with native fishermen over lobster fishing
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''The navy's name was tarnished as a result of this,'' Koppang
said.
</P>
<P>
   Menard was found guilty of fishing for lobster during a closed
season and using a military vessel, and was fined $1,300. Tremblay
was convicted of fishing out of season and possessing undersized
and female lobsters. He was fined $2,600.
</P>
<P>
   Nine divers from the 98-member unit were charged. One case was
dropped for lack of evidence; another diver was convicted and fined
$2,000; and five await military court trials.

<HEADLINE> Feds May Keep Interest Rates Steady  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the economy showing signs of cooling, the
Federal Reserve may decide to hold the line on interest rates
Wednesday rather than continuing to raise them.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times since
last June to slow down economic growth and there are indications
that its policy is working: the nation's unemployment rate rose to
4.1 percent in May up from a 30-year low of 3.9 percent in April;
retail sales were lackluster the past two months; and the housing
market has slowed a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been some whiffs of an economic slowdown, which
have been refreshing,'' said Sung Won Sohn, Wells Fargo's chief
economist, echoing the main reason why many economists believe the
Fed will stay on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Economists also suggested that some of the Fed's previous rate
increases have yet to work their way through the economy, a process
that can take anywhere from six months to a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Open Market Committee, composed of Fed board members
and regional bank presidents, is scheduled Wednesday to conclude
two days of closed-door discussions with Fed governors about
interest rates. An afternoon announcement is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Fed is going to stand pat but very possibly issue
a statement which suggests it is quite prepared to tighten at the
next meeting'' on Aug. 22, said Paul Kasriel, chief economist for
Northern Trust Co.
</P>
<P>
   If Fed policy-makers do nothing this time around, economists
believe the central bank probably will boost interest rates in
August by a quarter point to hold down economic growth and limit
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is strong evidence that the interest rate increases the
Fed has done to date are taking hold. They are effective. But more
needs to be done,'' said Ken Mayland, an economist with ClearView
Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists believe that the economy, which was roaring
ahead at a 5.4 percent growth rate in the first three months of
this year, may have slowed to 4 percent rate or less in the current
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed doesn't want a repeat of the last two years, when
growth slowed in the spring only to reaccelerate sharply for the
rest of the year, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues are seeking to
achieve a soft landing in which growth slows enough to keep
inflation under control but not so much that it threatens the
country's record 9&AMP;frac12;-year economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   At its last session on May 16, the Fed boosted rates by a half
point, double the normal quarter-point moves. That pushed its
target for the federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each
other, to 6.5 percent, the highest level in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates six times since last June, when the
funds rate stood at 4.75 percent. Those increases have pushed
banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark for millions of consumer
and business loans, to a nine-year high of 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the debate over whether growth has really slowed,
Fed policy-makers are also discussing how much of a slowdown will
be needed to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Laurence Meyer raised the possibility in a recent speech
that the Fed may need to bring about ''a period of below-trend
growth'' to keep inflation in check, comments that were viewed as
indicating that Meyer may be urging further rate increases to push
growth down and unemployment up.
</P>
<P>
   But 16 House Democrats wrote Greenspan and his colleagues
earlier this month warning that further rate hikes would lead to
''increases in unemployment and real economic damage to our least
prosperous citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   While conventional wisdom holds that the Fed does not like to be
changing interest rates as a presidential election heats up,
analysts believe the central bank will run that risk to make sure
inflation is being controlled.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Financial Markets Center, a research institute
based in Philomont, Va., showed that the 1.75 percentage point
increase in rates already engineered by the Fed exceeds the rate
increases of all previous pre-election periods over the last four
decades with the exception of 1967-68, when inflation was rising
rapidly at the height of the Vietnam War.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 7, Rangers 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Ben Grieve drove in three runs and the
Oakland Athletics overcame the loss of injured starter Tim Hudson
to beat the Texas Rangers 7-6 Tuesday night, their 11th win in 12
games.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez and Rafael Palmeiro each drove in a pair of runs
for the Rangers, who have lost nine of their last 10 road games and
13 of 16 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which has the second-worst road record (12-22) in the AL,
dropped 10&AMP;frac12; games out first place for the first time since ending
the 1997 season 13 games back.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson (9-2), who is 8-0 in 12 starts since an April 20 loss at
Cleveland, came out of the game after five innings with a split
fingernail on the middle finger of his right hand. He allowed three
runs and three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson became the seventh pitcher in major league history, which
includes former Athletic Vida Blue, to start their career with 20
wins in his first 24 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Isringhausen got the final three outs to convert his 13th
straight save chance, his 19th in 22 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Perisho (2-1), making his third start for the Rangers, gave
up seven runs, six hits and four walks in five inning/
</P>
<P>
   The A's scored three runs in the first with the help of an error
by third baseman Mike Lamb. With one out and runners at the
corners, Olmedo Saenz's grounder went through Lamb's legs, scoring
Terrence Long. Ben Grieve followed with a run-scoring single and
Jeremy Giambi hit a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb hit a sacrifice fly in the second, but Grieve's 15th home
run of the season gave the A's a 5-1 lead in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro hit his 20th home run of the season leading off the
fourth and after Rodriguez tripled, David Segui followed with a
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Long and Jason Giambi each drove in runs in the fourth, making
it 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Service replaced Hudson in the sixth and didn't retire a
batter. After Rusty Greer and Palmeiro singled, Rodriguez doubled
home both runners and ended Service's night. Palmeiro added an RBI
single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rodriguez's double in the sixth was the 283rd of his
career, a Rangers' record. ... Long extended his hitting streak to
a career-high 15 games with his single in the fourth. ... Rangers'
2B Luis Alicea missed Tuesday's game with tightness in his lower
back. ... Mike Magnante was activated from the 15-day disabled list
before the game. ... A's LHP Rich Sauveur was sent down to Triple-A
Sacramento of the PCL. ... Texas RHP Esteban Loazia will pitch
Thursday in place of original starter LHP Kenny Rogers, who would
have been pitching on three days rest. ... Tuesday's game was the
first of six meetings over nine days between the A's and Rangers.
... A's RHP Omar Olivares threw in the bullpen for the first time
since going on the 15-day disabled list on June 17. ... Greer
extended his club record with his ninth consecutive multihit game.
... Saenz left in the seventh with tightness in his left hamstring.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 5, Angels 3  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Aaron Sele won for the seventh time in eight
decisions, and David Bell and Mike Cameron homered Tuesday night as
the Seattle Mariners won their seventh straight, 5-3 over the
Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Tim Belcher (2-1) and manager Mike Scioscia were
ejected in the second inning by plate umpire Mike DiMuro for
arguing after Belcher balked in Joe Oliver, giving Seattle a 3-0
lead
</P>
<P>
   In a blow for the Mariners, the team said catcher Tom Lampkin
has a torn ligament in his right elbow and will have surgery on
Friday. No. 1 catcher Dan Wilson already is on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   Sele (9-3) allowed three runs and five hits in 6 1-3 innings,
striking out six. He is 7-1 with a 4.09 ERA in nine starts since
May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Rhodes and Kazuhiro Sasaki finished, with Sasaki pitching
the ninth or his 15th save in 17 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's seven-game winning streak is the team's longest since
it won 10 straight from Sept. 12-21, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, in just his third start following offseason surgery on
his right elbow, gave up three runs, three hits, three walks and a
balk in 1 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn hit his 21st homer for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud hit an RBI single in the first, and Bell started the
second with his fifth homer. With runners at the corners later in
the inning, Belcher faked a throw to third, but his foot came
toward the plate.
</P>
<P>
   After Joe Oliver scored from third on the balk, Belcher got into
an animated argument with DiMuro and was tossed. Scioscia came out,
got between Belcher and DiMuro, then was ejected, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon's RBI single pulled Anaheim to 3-1 in the third, but
Mark McLemore hit a run-scoring double-play grounder in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron connected off Mike Fyhrie in the fifth with his 10th
homer and Vaughn homered in the sixth off Sele, his first since
June 17.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad hit a run-scoring grounder in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mariners are 18-6 in June. ... Seattle's Edgar
Martinez, who leads the majors with 77 RBIs, has a four-game
hitless streak for the second time this season. ... Scioscia was
thrown out of his second game this season. ... Erstad's hitting
streak was stopped at 11 games.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 5, Padres 4  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eric Karros singled home the winning run with
two outs in the 10th inning, one pitch after getting sent to the
dirt by a brushback pitch, as the Los Angeles Dodgers snapped a
five-game losing streak with a 5-4 victory over the San Diego
Padres on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Karros also homered for the Dodgers, who tied the game in the
seventh on a two-run homer by pinch-hitter Dave Hansen and again in
the ninth on a leadoff homer by Todd Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek started the winning rally with a one-out
double down the left-field line against Matt Whiteside (2-1). Shawn
Green was intentionally walked one out later and Karros lined a 2-2
pitch to left for his 63rd RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters (3-0), the fourth Los Angeles pitcher, worked one
perfect inning for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   After blowing their early three-run margin and regaining the
lead in the eighth, the Padres coughed up a 4-3 advantage when
Hundley hit his 14th homer. It came on an 0-2 pitch from Trevor
Hoffman, who entered the game with two outs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers reliever Matt Herges, who entered in the eighth, issued
a leadoff walk to Ryan Klesko. Phil Nevin sent Klesko to third with
a single to center, but was out at second trying to take the extra
base on the throw to third.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone, who drove in five runs Monday night during an
eight-run second inning that sealed Orel Hershiser's fate as a
Dodger, singled to left for a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Will Cunnane, making his second major league start since 1997,
carried a three-hit shutout into the seventh before giving up
Karros' 22nd homer and Hundley's double.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Reyes came in and retired his first two batters before
Hansen, batting for reliever Antonio Osuna, drove a 3-2 pitch to
right field, tying it 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   The pinch-homer was the 10th of Hansen's career and his ninth
with the Dodgers, tying the franchise record set by John Frederick.
It was Hansen's fourth pinch-homer this season.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko homered in the first inning and Kevin Nicholson singled
home two runs in the fourth for the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Cunnane was charged with two runs and five hits over six-plus
innings, striking out two and walking two. He was recalled from
Triple-A Las Vegas on Monday for his third stint with the Padres
this season. Cunnane displayed some offense too, hitting a two-out
double down the right-field line in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Eric Gagne was promoted earlier in the day from
Triple-A Albuquerque when the Dodgers put Hershiser on waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was shelled for eight runs in the second inning of a
9-5 loss to the Padres on Monday night in what turned out to be the
1988 Cy Young winner's last game with Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson played the game under protest,
claiming that Padres manager Bruce Bochy made a second visit to the
mound after replacing reliever Kevin Walker with closer Hoffman in
the eighth before Hoffman faced one batter. But Karros' hit made it
a moot point.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hoffman's blown save was his third in 22 chances and second
in three outings... Cunnane's last major league start was May 20 at
Atlanta, where he gave up seven runs over 3.1 innings in a 10-6
loss. Prior to that, he started Sept. 13, 1997, at St. Louis. ...
Ten of Hansen's 27 career homers have come as a pinch-hitter. ...
Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant showed he has a decent arm. He
threw out the first pitch, getting the ball to Hansen on the fly.
... The Padres optioned right-hander Brandon Kolb to Triple-A Las
Vegas and activated right-hander Steve Montgomery from the 15-day
DL.

<HEADLINE> Gore Fund Probe Turns Ugly  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAYNE, Mich. (AP) -- The investigation of Vice President Al
Gore's past fund-raising practices has erupted into a political war
of words, with his campaign spokesman accusing GOP inquisitors of
''McCarthyite tactics'' linked to George W. Bush and Bush and
others fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're turning the United States Congress into a
scandal-industrial complex and George W. Bush is the CEO of that,''
Gore spokesman Chris Lehane told reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush fired back, saying Lehane's ''mindless name calling'' turns
voters off.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're sick of this kind of finger-pointing and calling names
and trying to divert attention,'' Bush said at a news conference
here.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they want four more years of Clinton-Gore and mindless name
calling like this person just did then I'm not the right person,''
he added. ''If they want something different, a new attitude, they
ought to give me a chance to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who is investigating whether Attorney
General Janet Reno should have appointed an independent counsel to
probe Gore, bristled during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing
Tuesday at the suggestion that he and Bush are in ''cahoots.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not and would not discuss this matter with the Bush
campaign,'' Specter told the hearing, at which Reno defended her
decisions against subjecting Gore to an outside investigator.
</P>
<P>
   ''And as to the reference to McCarthy-like tactics, that is a
matter which I will take up personally with the vice president to
see if it was authorized. And if so, I will take it up with him in
some substantial detail,'' Specter added.
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to Sen. Joe McCarthy, who led a bitter
campaign in the 1950s to expose public figures suspected of having
communist sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane issued similar comments in written statements after the
hearing, and also was unapologetic later in the day after being
told of Bush's pique.
</P>
<P>
   Specter also fired off a terse letter to Gore seeking an
explanation and ''prompt apology,'' but Mark Fabiani, the Gore
campaign's communications director, stood by Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   ''He shouldn't expect an apology and we still expect an answer
to how Senator Specter received and then leaked confidential
Justice Department information,'' Fabiani said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion came five days after Specter revealed that the
head of the Justice Department's campaign finance task force,
Robert Conrad, was recommending that a special counsel be appointed
to investigate Gore for possible false statements in connection
with his past fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned April 18 by Conrad, Gore said he did not know he was
attending a fund-raising event when he visited a Buddhist temple
during the 1996 campaign, although his aides knew.
</P>
<P>
   Reno defended her past decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not been shy about appointing independent counsels when
the facts and the law required it,'' she told the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has rejected several recommendations for such an
investigation of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that several people have advised me at various times
to seek the appointment of an independent counsel ... should come
as no surprise to anyone,'' she testified. ''In each and every
instance ... there were always people of the opposite view.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno refused to discuss Conrad's pending recommendation. She has
twice refused to seek an independent counsel for Gore, first for
fund-raising phone calls he made from the White House and then for
possible false statements relating to the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Lehane accused Specter of ''engaging in
McCarthyite tactics'' and said the senator and other Republicans
opposed to Gore becoming president ''have turned the Congress into
a scandal industrial complex designed to manufacture and create
partisan scandals and inflict political damage on the vice
president a mere four months before voters go to the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is absurd what this man said,'' Bush said in response.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Lawmakers Map out Challenge  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Leaders of the main opposition party
planned Wednesday to map out how to challenge President Robert
Mugabe's slender victory in parliamentary elections marked by a
bitter campaign of violence and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition candidates, promising reform of the country's
disastrous economic performance, made sweeping gains in poll
results announced Tuesday, increasing their seats from three to 58
in the 150-seat Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But they fell short of the majority needed to force the
autocratic president and his party to adopt economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change,
said his party will gather its leaders Wednesday in Harare ''to
plan the way forward.''
</P>
<P>
   After posing the biggest challenge to the ruling party's two
decades of virtually unrivaled rule, the MDC's newly elected
lawmakers will lead a campaign for change and accountability in a
government still to be headed by Mugabe, Tsvangirai said.
</P>
<P>
   One opposition seat went to a small opposition group in its tiny
stronghold of Chiredzi in southeastern Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the mandate for democratic change,'' said Tsvangirai,
who lost his race for a parliamentary seat in his home district of
Buhera in rural southern Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai said he will lead the opposition from outside
Parliament and will prepare to challenge Mugabe in presidential
elections in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe, vowing Tuesday to honor what he described as the binding
results of the elections held Saturday and Sunday, said the new
Parliament to be sworn in next month ''is certainly destined to be
very lively.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to working with the new Parliament as together
we grapple with the pressing challenges of improving the
livelihoods of our people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Voting came after months of political violence and intimidation
that left more than 30 people dead. European Union monitors said
the violence, which they called state-sponsored terror, meant the
elections were flawed and the campaign was not free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   Voters still turned out in large numbers -- more than double the
turnout of the last parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   The results were a massive blow to Mugabe's party, which was
impervious to criticism for most of its rule.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition for the first time won enough seats to prevent
the ruling party achieving a two-thirds majority necessary to
change the constitution and entrench Mugabe's powers.
</P>
<P>
   Its lawmakers are also able to force the ruling party to fully
disclose policies that until now were not questioned or publicly
aired.
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai said among these were the costly deployment of 11,000
Zimbabwe troops to back President Laurent Kabilia in the distant
Congo civil war. For nearly two years, costs and casualties have
been shrouded in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be pushing for an urgent withdrawal'' from the Congo,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe had one of Africa's strongest economies at independence
in 1980. Today, it is wracked with high unemployment and soaring
inflation, crippling fuel and hard currency shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial farming, the most important sector of the economy,
has been badly hurt by the illegal takeover of hundreds of
white-owned farms by armed black squatters.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Soar in Midwest  </HEADLINE>
By JACQUI PODZIUS COOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Joyce LeFlore turned on the engine of her shiny
black Infiniti and watched the gasoline gauge to see how much $15
bought her.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't much.
</P>
<P>
   ''Less than half a tank,'' she sighed before driving away. She
had paid $2.35 a gallon for the premium grade required in her
luxury car. Regular was $2.10, mid-grade $2.20.
</P>
<P>
   LeFlore's frustration is being felt by drivers across the
Midwest, who are paying some of the highest gas prices in the
nation. Many say they aren't canceling their Fourth of July weekend
plans but they are making changes, such as driving from Chicago to
Indiana for slightly cheaper gas or organizing car pools.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the American Automobile Association projects 37.5
million people will travel 100 miles or more from home between
Friday and Tuesday. Of those, 32 million are expected to travel by
car, a 4 percent increase over last year, AAA spokeswoman Janie
Graziani said.
</P>
<P>
   The association expects nearly 5 million of all holiday weekend
travelers to be from Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin,
even though gas prices are as much as 90 cents more per gallon in
some places than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Pagel of Wausau, Wis., refuses to cancel his weekend trips
to his parents' cottage on Lake Nokomis, about 40 miles north.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing would make me change those plans, even if they put it
at $4 a gallon,'' Pagel said as he pumped $25 worth of unleaded
regular at $1.83 per gallon into his minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani was not surprised that most people feel the way Pagel
does. She said gas is still a small fraction of travel expenses
compared with meals, hotel rooms and tourist attractions. It still
costs less for a family to drive than buy airplane tickets, which
include a fuel surcharge of up to $30 per round-trip ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA survey of 1,300 adults was taken in April, before gas
prices hit the $2-per-gallon mark in some areas, but Graziani said
it included questions about travel plans if prices continued to
rise. Only 1 percent said they would cancel their trips.
</P>
<P>
   Elijah Cunigan has changed his mind about driving 90 miles from
Detroit to Lansing, Mich., this weekend to see his sister -- or
going anywhere else this summer -- because he can't afford to fill
up his Mercury Villager minivan.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're all canceled,'' he said. ''If the prices were like
they were last summer, I could do more.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the average price for a gallon of regular-grade gas
in Michigan was $1.15 a gallon. This year it's $1.97, according to
AAA.
</P>
<P>
   Some relief is in sight as the holiday draws near. Indiana Gov.
Frank O'Bannon has suspended the state sales tax on gasoline for 60
days. The Illinois Legislature will meet in special session
beginning Wednesday to discuss repealing or suspending the state's
5 percent sales tax on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Tuesday that
''unacceptably high'' gas prices are falling 7 to 12 cents per
gallon in the Midwest. He also said Energy Department figures
showed gas prices nationwide dropped 3 cents a gallon over the last
week.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco, the largest supplier of gas in the Chicago area,
announced last week it was lowering prices, which officials
attributed to an increase in oil supply.
</P>
<P>
   Cicero Miller was pleased to get even a small break as he fueled
up his Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicle at an Amoco station on
Chicago's southwest side, where the lowest grade gas was $2 per
gallon. He said it now costs him about $40 to fill up his tank,
compared with about $25 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm retired and on a fixed income, so it's taking a bite,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He's been saving a little by driving 10 miles or so to the
Indiana state line and fueling up there, where gas is averaging
about 20 cents cheaper for regular grade.
</P>
<P>
   LeFlore, Miller and other motorists said they have heard many
explanations for the rise in prices. Industry officials have cited
rising crude oil prices, low gasoline stocks, pipeline problems and
cleaner-burning, more-expensive reformulated gas required in
Chicago, Milwaukee and other cities with severe summer smog
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Like Miller, Patricia Carroll has been going to Indiana to fill
up her Saab. She plans outings there like berry picking or trips to
the beach with her 7-year-old daughter to make up for the
inconvenience of driving to another state for gas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have family and friends around the country and nobody is
paying this much,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts expect gas prices to drop once the summer travel season
ends. Even though he is spending $10 to $20 more per week for gas,
Dan Dreyer of Indianapolis hopes drivers will have learned that
they are not entitled to cheap gas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regardless of what anyone says, it's not an infinite
resource,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> HIV-infected man accused of sex with child first charged under HIV law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - An HIV-infected man accused of sexually
assaulting a child has become the first person in New Jersey
charged under a law that made it a crime to have intercourse while
knowingly infected with the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on Tuesday announced the arrest of Ora Dwayne
Battles, 40, of Newton, saying the Sussex County Community College
student sexually assaulted the child several times between April 1
and June 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Sussex County Prosecutors Office declined to release details
of the alleged incidents, but said the child was younger than 13
and not related to Battles.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the victim's mother became aware of the abuse
and notified police after seeking medical advice.
</P>
<P>
   Known by most people at the college as David, Battles was a tour
guide, a member of the student senate and an officer in a club -
called AIDS Brigade - that disseminates information about the
disease and holds fund-raisers, according to Heidi Gregg,
coordinator of athletics and student activities.
</P>
<P>
   Battles is charged with first-degree aggravated sexual assault,
endangering the welfare of a child, sexual assault, and committing
acts of sexual penetration while knowingly infected with HIV or
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   He was being held at Sussex County jail Tuesday in lieu of
$250,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against him mark the first use of the AIDS law,
which went into effect in August 1997. A spokesman for the state
Division of Criminal Justice said the agency's database shows no
other arrests or convictions under the law.
</P>
<P>
   Morris County First Assistant Prosecutor Karin Kelly-Weisert,
who said her office was involved in an investigation that could
have resulted in a charge under the statute, said it can be
difficult to meet the law's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In the Morris County case, a woman learned a man with whom she
had engaged in sex was HIV-positive and sought to have him
prosecuted. But Kelly-Weisert said it was difficult to establish
when the man had learned he was infected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kelly-Weisert was surprised that there had been no
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''One would think the issue would be raised more often,'' she
told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Wednesday's editions. ''It's
possible that victims either don't know about the statute or just
don't want to go public with it.''

<HEADLINE> Carless Unaffected by Gas Prices  </HEADLINE>
By DON BABWIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Jerry Marcoccia is part of a relatively small --
and, these days, merry -- band of people in Chicago who are watching
the gas crisis from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Marcoccia, a 43-year-old U.S. Department of Agriculture program
analyst, knew the gas situation was serious after telling his
father recently that he was happy he doesn't own a car.
</P>
<P>
   ''For one of the first times he didn't say, 'You're crazy,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In their offices, homes and on the bus or train, those without
automobiles are following the woes of Midwest drivers paying nearly
as much for a gallon of gas as they pay for a gallon of milk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always thought of a car as a way to lose money,'' said Joe
Sylvester, 32, who sold his car in 1994 because he found he didn't
need it living and working in Chicago. With gas in Chicago selling
for more than $2 a gallon these days, he said, ''Now it's even more
so.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are other rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you've been the butt of jokes by your car-driving friends
who mock you and say it's your fault they couldn't find a parking
spot because they had to pick you up, it is kind of nice when they
start whining,'' said Suzanne Bish, 30, a Chicago attorney. ''You
can say, 'See, if you didn't have a car like me ... .'''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester sympathized with the plight of people who rely on
their cars, like the taxi drivers he tips a little more generously
these days. But he's not as sympathetic for others.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sometimes see people on TV standing by their SUVs
complaining about how much it costs to go to work,'' he said.
''That's kind of humorous.''
</P>
<P>
   What strikes Allison Harmon, who hasn't had a car in the 2&AMP;frac12;
years she's lived and worked in Chicago, is that with all the
complaining about gas prices, buses and trains don't seem any more
crowded than they did before gas prices began climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's been kind of discouraging,'' she said. ''You would
think people would be driving less and using public transportation.
But I don't see that.''

<HEADLINE> Premium Gas Users Paying More  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID SHARP
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Marianne Tarraza gave little thought to
fuel costs when she bought her Lincoln Navigator last summer. Gas
was cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's getting walloped by soaring gasoline prices and she's
also paying more than most: Her sport utility vehicle is one of a
growing number of models that work best with premium grade gas.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I made the purchase, I wasn't thinking of premium gas at
all. I was mostly concerned about lugging my children around, and
gas wasn't a consideration,'' Tarraza said.
</P>
<P>
   For a 30-gallon tank of gas, she spends about $50, about $5 more
than a tank of regular.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, more motorists are finding themselves in the same
situation as the number of new cars for which premium gas is
preferred creeps upward, said Bob Reynolds, president of Downstream
Alternatives, an Indiana fuel consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   A computer analysis of EPA fuel economy data by The Associated
Press shows the number of car models recommending premium gas
jumped to 26 percent this year after hovering around 20 percent
since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of just luxury and performance-oriented cars like BMWs
and Mercedes, mid-priced cars like the Volkswagen Passat, Nissan
Maxima and some versions of the Mazda 626 and Mitsubishi Galant are
coming equipped with engines that perform best using premium or
mid-grade gas.
</P>
<P>
   The cost difference is substantial -- premium gas can cost nearly
20 cents per gallon more than regular -- at a time when fuel prices
are rising steeply.
</P>
<P>
   The national average price last week was $1.65 per gallon for
regular unleaded gas and $1.81 for premium, both about 50 cents
higher than a year ago, according to the American Automobile
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are even higher in the Midwest, with premium gas going
for about $2.36 a gallon last week in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Cars that use premium fuel generally can get by without it,
thanks to computerized ''knock sensors'' that allow engines to
accommodate gas with lower-than-recommended octane levels, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   But the higher octane gas translates to greater horsepower, one
of the selling points for such cars, said David Champion, director
of automobile testing for Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher
of Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying to get more performance out of the same
engine,'' Champion said from his office in Colchester, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Nissan tweaked the engine in its Maxima, boosting
the horsepower from 200 to 222 in its 2000 model. Nissan recommends
mid-grade fuel with a rating of 89 octane or better, while regular
87 octane was fine for the old Maxima.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their Japanese and European counterparts, many American
manufacturers seem to be resisting the trend toward higher octane
gas.
</P>
<P>
   For example, General Motors will begin recommending regular
instead of premium for models using its Northstar engine next year,
said Bob Furey, a fuel specialist for GM in Warren, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Magliozzi, who hosts National Public Radio's ''Car Talk''
program with his brother, said those in the market for a new car or
truck should consider the extra cost of premium gas because the
difference can add up to thousands of dollars over the car's life.
</P>
<P>
   ''That may not bother you if you're driving a Mercedes S600, but
if you bought a Passat, it may be a very rude surprise,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Justices Disclose Holdings, Gifts  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief Justice Willliam H. Rehnquist's robe
with four stripes on each sleeve became familiar to many Americans
during last year's Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton.
It belongs to the Smithsonian Institution now.
</P>
<P>
   In his financial disclosure report for 1999, Rehnquist indicated
that the robe had been appraised by Sotheby's at $30,000. The chief
justice did not respond when asked whether he had taken a tax
deduction for the donation.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas received an $800 commemorative jacket
and traveled free by private plane when he served as grand marshal
of the 1999 Daytona 500 auto race, according to his report.
</P>
<P>
   And Justice Sandra Day O'Connor received a crystal piece and
china rose -- estimated value $500 -- when honored by the National
First Ladies' Library.
</P>
<P>
   Federal judges, members of Congress and other high-ranking
government officials are required to file annual reports. The
federal law requires only broad ranges of worth for assets and
exempts personal property.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the highest court's members were millionaires as
the year began, led by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who estimated
her family's wealth at between $7.4 million and $33.1 million.
Ginsburg and her lawyer husband, Martin, included six investments
between $1 and $5 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Four other justices -- O'Connor, Stephen G. Breyer, John Paul
Stevens and David H. Souter -- held investments worth over $1
million, and Rehnquist may have joined the court's millionaires
club as well. Justice Antonin Scalia sold stock during the year and
dropped far below the million-dollar level.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's report reflected the most varied investment
portfolio, state bonds and Treasury notes to holdings in
pharmaceutical and communications companies. Her ownership of AT&AMP;T
and MCI Worldcom stock, among others, has forced O'Connor to
disqualify herself from cases in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist valued his assets at between $525,000 and $1.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia's reported assets fell to $145,000 to $535,000, down from
$645,000 to $1.5 million the previous year. He sold off significant
amounts of stock in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing up the rear were Justices Anthony M. Kennedy ($65,000
to $195,000) and Clarence Thomas ($150,000 to $410,000).
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's annual salary is $181,400; the eight other Supreme
Court members receive $173,600.

<HEADLINE> 135 Vieques Protesters Are Detained  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Navy ships and warplanes bombarded
Vieques Island's disputed training ground with dummy shells and
bombs after more than 100 Puerto Rican activists were detained for
sneaking under the base fence in a vain effort to stop military
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was expected to come up at a White House meeting
Wednesday between President Clinton and the leaders of Puerto
Rico's major political parties that originally was called to
discuss the U.S. territory's ultimate status.
</P>
<P>
   The military exercises have riveted this Spanish-speaking
society of 4 million people. It remained unclear how long the
training would continue. Recent Navy announcements suggested they
could go on until Sunday. But unlike the past two days, no
announcement designating danger zones was posted in Vieques on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Exercises had stopped in April 1999 after two 500-pound bombs
were dropped off target, killing a civilian security guard and
sparking protests laced with anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday brought the first reported violent confrontation in 14
months of agitation. The Navy claimed fisherman lobbed 12-inch
metal bars that injured two sailors at sea and that a video
recording of the incident was turned over to the FBI. One of the
fishermen, Yabureibo Zenon, flatly denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, guards arrested 135 Independence Party demonstrators
who invaded the bombing range, some cutting the chain-link fence,
others simply lifting it up to crawl under.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go home, Yankees! This is our land!'' Elba Diaz, a 43-year-old
Vieques housewife, shouted at helicopters overhead that were
scanning the area with search beacons.
</P>
<P>
   Shelling from the ships was delayed for 45 minutes, starting at
8:45 a.m., the Navy said. Then fighter jets screamed overhead and
thuds and booms could be heard, presumably from an aerial
bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters claimed some of their band might still be at large
after the shelling started -- charges supported by the Navy's
confirmation later that the Independence Party vice president
Fernando Martin and five others were not arrested until about 4
p.m. Still, the group could have been far away from the actual
target area, which occupies only the eastern tip of the almost
10-mile wide Navy area.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques, where 9,400 people live, is the site of the Navy's
prime Atlantic Fleet training ground. Activists committed to
ousting the Navy say the bombing destroys fishing grounds and
endangers residents. The Navy maintains the bombing is safe and
provides crucial training.
</P>
<P>
   The first fatality on the range in six decades of bombing united
Puerto Ricans as never before to demand that the Navy leave the
island. Dozens of protesters invaded the range and occupied it for
about a year before being peacefully evicted last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy insists the opposition is coming from a small minority
of Puerto Ricans. It says Vieques is the only place its Atlantic
Fleet can hold simultaneous land, air and sea exercises with live
fire before deploying abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, President Clinton negotiated an agreement with
the Puerto Rican government allowing the Navy to resume training
using non-explosive ordnance. Clinton also promised a referendum,
perhaps next year, in which Vieques residents would choose whether
to evict the Navy or allow it to stay and resume live bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello said Tuesday the protesters'
incursions on the range could endanger the referendum. ''They are
putting at risk what is clearly the only instrument available at
this time for a final resolution of the situation of Vieques to the
benefit of the people of Vieques,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute also has raised concerns about a deeper rift between
the Caribbean territory and the United States -- colonizer to some,
benefactor to others.
</P>
<P>
   The protests ''are endangering the relations between Puerto Rico
and the United States, and therefore the welfare of all Puerto
Ricans,'' The San Juan Star said in an editorial.

<HEADLINE> Baseball's hopes Rocker subway plan is derailed  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - It appears John Rocker's plan to take the No. 7
train has been derailed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Atlanta reliever told USA Today Baseball Weekly
that he planned to ride the subway through Queens during the
Braves-Mets series that starts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't be in a cab,'' he vowed. ''I won't be on the bus. I'll
be on that train.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations
in the commissioner's office, said Tuesday he thinks Rocker has
been persuaded not to take the subway.
</P>
<P>
   ''The number of people who have advised him not to take the No,
7 train is exceeded only by the number of people who take the No. 7
train,'' Alderson said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Atlanta reliever does carry out his threat to ride the
subway to games between the Mets and the Braves, there could be
more cops on the train than purple-haired punks, unwed mothers and
AIDS patients combined.
</P>
<P>
   Security at Shea Stadium will be tight. And Mets fans itching to
taunt Rocker - who angered New Yorkers with his politically
incorrect views on punks and foreigners riding New York subways -
may find their anger dulled by a two-beer limit.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Tuesday that Rocker can take the subway, which
passes through many immigrant communities. But he might have
trouble starting a meaningful dialogue with other riders.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Rocker gets on the train, he'll be entirely surrounded by
police officers,'' police spokeswoman Marilyn Mode said.
</P>
<P>
   Once Rocker gets to the stadium, he'll be protected by a sea of
blue. Mode said that in addition to the 60 officers usually
assigned to games, there will be an extra 500 uniformed cops plus
an unspecified number of plainclothes officers.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all. Police sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity told The Associated Press that officers will be on every
subway platform along the No. 7 line between Grand Central Terminal
in Manhattan and Shea in Queens, and any train Rocker boards will
become an express so that it picks up fewer passengers.
</P>
<P>
   A police source also said that an Atlanta police lieutenant
would travel with the team, wearing a Braves uniform at the games
to blend in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mets senior vice president David Howard said that
fans would be allowed to buy only two beers at a time during the
four-game series. The normal limit is four. Howard said beer sales
will stop after the sixth inning instead of the usual seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident New Yorkers will rise above the situation and
not stoop down to his level,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball commissioner Bud Selig, in town to unveil the new World
Series championship trophy, said he had discussed security
arrangements with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, police officials and
Rocker, and was satisfied that all precautions have been taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time to be prudent and smart,'' Selig said. ''The Mets
fans will be just fine and I don't think John will do anything to
incite anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker became a target of fan ire here when he told Sports
Illustrated during the off-season that he would rather retire than
play for a New York team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine taking the 7 train ... looking like you're (in) Beirut
next to some kid with purple hair, next to some queer with AIDS,
right next to some dude who got out of jail for the fourth time,
right next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids,'' he said.
''It's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''The biggest thing I don't like about New York are
the foreigners. You can walk an entire block in Times Square and
not hear anybody speaking English. ... How the hell did they get in
this country?''
</P>
<P>
   The series this week will be the hurler's first trip to Shea
since the story appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Braves and Mets players had varying opinions on the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I'm thinking about is going up there and doing my job on
the mound,'' said Braves starter Kevin Millwood, who is scheduled
to pitch Friday. ''I think major league baseball and security at
Shea Stadium is smart enough to prevent having anything bad from
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets catcher Mike Piazza said: ''I'm sure the crowd will be loud
and rowdy. That's what New York baseball is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   And if ugliness does break out on the subway, the Mets will come
to the rescue - in a comic book. The team has commissioned a
24-page comic book featuring a villain who wants to blow up a No. 7
train. The bad guy and his robotic henchmen are defeated by the
Mets' multiracial lineup, with reliever John Franco pounding the
villain, named Larcenous Vein, into outer space with his baseball
bat. The comic book will be handed out to fans 14 and under at
Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The team said no similarity between Vein and Rocker was
intended.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a coincidence,'' said Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz. ''The
idea was conceived a long time ago.''

Blum contributed to this story.

<HEADLINE> Commission Torn on War Crime Papers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some members of a federal commission that is
unearthing Nazi and Japanese war crimes documents favor a ''bulk
declassification'' that would more quickly make public millions of
U.S. government-held papers.
</P>
<P>
   But the CIA, FBI and Pentagon are resisting, citing possible
compromises from information now a half century old.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group reported
to Congress Tuesday that it may be able to identify and declassify
all World War II documents related to Germany by an October 2001
deadline. But it reported no real progress in exposing documents on
Imperial Japan, saying that could take at least a year longer.
</P>
<P>
   More than halfway through the commission's three-year task, at
least 70 percent of the millions of World War II documents related
to war crimes remain secret, commission members said.
</P>
<P>
   But intelligence and military representatives on the commission
insist, however, that their page-by-page, and sometimes
line-by-line declassification is moving along rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Panel chairman Michael J. Kurtz, who is also an assistant
national archivist, said not every document needs the painstaking
analysis insisted upon by intelligence agencies. He said bulk
declassification would speed up a process which has so far
declassified 1.5 million papers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Baer, another commission member, said historians prefer
mass declassification because it would preserve original documents
and their relationships to each other. Some documents have been
released piecemeal after censorship by intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Levit, CIA special counsel who sits on the commission,
said the CIA opposes bulk declassification because it needs to
protect its sources and methods.
</P>
<P>
   John Collingwood, an FBI member on the panel, said the FBI has
been declassifying documents at ''an incredibly fast pace'' but
also could not agree to a blanket release.
</P>
<P>
   Army representative Col. Lewis Thompson said the Pentagon also
opposes any sweeping declassification, but has made progress by
converting old microfilms to computer-searchable files. He said
Army teams are processing up to 70,000 pages a week.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of Japanese documents is complicated by the need for
Japanese cooperation, commission members said at a hearing,
although they indicated no steps have been taken to get it.
Millions of documents captured during the war were returned to
Japan in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not even begun to get our arms around the Japanese
issue,'' said commission member Richard Ben-Veniste.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires all U.S.-held papers related to possible war
crimes and looted property to be declassified by October 2001. The
law covers Germany, Imperial Japan and their allies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect between 5 million and 8 million pages to be
declassified. The commission started with 600 million pages in
1999.

<HEADLINE> Kurds Get Villages in Turkey  </HEADLINE>
By SELCAN HACAOGLU
<TEXT>
<P>
   YENI ARSLANBASAR, Turkey (AP) -- Soldiers won't let Buhar Goktas
stay outside the village at night. They carefully record the times
that she leaves and comes back.
</P>
<P>
   The village she and other Kurds have been forced into since the
military razed their homes is like a prison, Goktas said as she
stepped back to avoid steam rising from a cauldron of boiling
cheese curd. Soldiers in armored cars watch every move.
</P>
<P>
   A year after a Turkish court sentenced Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan to death for treason, the government is dealing
with one of the most difficult problems caused by the 15-year
rebellion that he led: what to do with the hundreds of thousands of
Kurds whose homes were destroyed by the military in a brutal
campaign to depopulate areas considered havens for rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The government's solution -- heavily garrisoned ''central
villages'' away from the mountains where Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers
Party, or PKK, once operated -- has outraged Kurds and human rights
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ocalan has ordered a cease-fire and there is little
fighting in the largely Kurdish areas of the southeast, the
military fears that if left alone, Kurdish villagers could organize
against the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''In central villages, providing security would be easier
compared to the hamlets,'' Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said during
a recent visit to the southeast. ''Those who are affiliated with
the PKK want to be scattered in hamlets and villages. We won't fall
for this trap.''
</P>
<P>
   The government began building ''central villages'' a decade ago
but has quickened the pace of late. Interior Minister Sadettin
Tantan said the government allocated $4.5 million for the project,
reports said Wednesday. The government won't say how many it plans
to construct.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have criticized the project and are calling
on the government to allow refugees to return to their own villages
and pay them compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Goktas' new village, Yeni Arslanbasar, has about 2,000 people
from eight destroyed villages. The remains of her home village,
Samanli, are in the gray mountains about five miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Yeni Arslanbasar is not surrounded by a fence, but soldiers
stand guard in a concrete bunker outside the village and record the
names of people leaving or entering. Non-residents must have
military permission to enter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This place is like an open-air prison,'' said Goktas, 17.
</P>
<P>
   ''We even need to obtain permission from the military to pick
cardoon,'' a local herb.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are late, they slap us,'' she said, slowly stirring the
bubbling cheese mixed with cardoon. ''No one is suffering like
us.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Amnesty International, about 3 million people were
scattered when 3,000 villages and hamlets were destroyed during the
fighting. Most were razed by the military, although the rebels did
burn villages that did not support their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kurds fled to western Turkey or to shantytowns that formed
outside major cities in the southeast. Others, like the residents
of Yeni Arslanbasar, were sent to central villages.
</P>
<P>
   A government-built primary school and a military-run health
clinic near Yeni Arslanbasar are the government's efforts to prove
that it is not causing unrest but providing facilities that are
scarce in the impoverished region.
</P>
<P>
   The government plans to build a school and a health clinic for
each ''central village.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo OK Colombia Emergency Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Breaking a months-long deadlock, top lawmakers
hope to sign off Wednesday on details of an emergency package
financing Colombia's war against drug producers, U.S. troops in
Kosovo and rebuilding from fires, storms and other disasters at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Following a closed-door meeting Tuesday evening among leaders of
the House and Senate Appropriations committees, Rep. Bill Young,
R-Fla., said bargainers had agreed on the outlines of a compromise
package. He said he believed party leaders would ''finalize
everything'' on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Young, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, would not
reveal a precise final figure. But he said it would be between $9
billion and the $12 billion ceiling that House and Senate leaders
set for the bill last week -- about double the $5.2 billion
President Clinton proposed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Top Republicans hope to push a final bill through Congress and
ship it to Clinton by Friday, when lawmakers plan to begin their
weeklong Fourth of July recess. Republicans want to finish the bill
by then to avoid blame for any problems the Pentagon might face as
it juggles money to pay for U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would be an embarrassment for all of us in Congress if we
would allow that to happen,'' Young said at a brief public session
of the bargainers earlier in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Young said the measure would include $1.3 billion to help
Colombia's embattled government fight drug traffickers who control
broad swaths of the country, along with their leftist guerrilla and
right-wing paramilitary allies. Included is money for purchasing
helicopters and other supplies and training Colombian troops.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a victory for Clinton and House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., who have pushed for the aid as a way to combat
drug use in the United States. Colombia supplies most of the
cocaine used in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Still unresolved is whether to include compromise language
struck Tuesday that would lift the four-decade-old U.S. food
embargo against Cuba. There is strong opposition to that deal among
some senators, and Young indicated it might be left for inclusion
in some later bill.
</P>
<P>
   Aides and lawmakers had said earlier that to keep the bill
acceptable to Clinton, they would avoid including controversial
provisions changing laws.
</P>
<P>
   They said they would therefore omit a provision pushed by
Schering-Plough Corp. to win an extension of its patent for
Claritin, the popular and profitable allergy drug. Also left off
the bill was language by Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., aimed at
extending a lucrative patent his alma mater, Columbia University,
has on a process its scientists invented for making some widely
sold biotechnology drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those measures could end up on other bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want a veto of the bill,'' said Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, when
bargainers held a brief public session.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., had criticized
earlier, larger versions of the package for being too costly and
containing unnecessary items, and Senate work on the measure
virtually halted for two months.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved $13 billion in March, mostly by adding extra
money for the Pentagon, while the Senate approved roughly $9
billion last month.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, participants said that as part of the final package,
the House and Senate would each get a $100 million kitty for
various lawmakers' home-district projects.
</P>
<P>
   Young would reveal few details of the bill. But earlier,
participants said that besides money for Colombia, the compromise
would include $2.05 billion to repay the Pentagon for the costs of
5,700 American troops serving with the NATO peacekeeping team in
Kosovo; at least $660 million for rebuilding from the
government-set fires that ravaged Los Alamos, N.M.; and $250
million to help North Carolina and other states recover from last
September's Hurricane Floyd and other agricultural problems.

<HEADLINE> Report: Airline Service Improving  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tired of airline delays? Lost luggage?
Overbooked flights? You're not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the American airline industry are skyrocketing
this year even as air carriers try to live up to their promise to
improve customer service, federal investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines last year staved off legislative action by promising to
treat customers better and to be more forthright with passengers
all the way through their travel experience. When Transportation
Department inspectors checked earlier this year to find out whether
the airlines were living up to that pledge, they found varying
degrees of success.
</P>
<P>
   ''Airlines are making a clear and genuine effort at
strengthening the attention paid to customer service, but
bottom-line results to date are mixed,'' the department's inspector
general said in a preliminary report to Congress. ''The airlines
have a way to go to restore consumer confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, complaints were up 74 percent in the first four months
of 2000 when compared with the same period in 1999 -- 6,916 to
3,985. Delay complaints, the department's top complaint about
airlines -- were up 84 percent -- 2,842 in the first four months of
2000, compared with 1,546 in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   While the increase can be attributed to the Transportation
Department's introduction of complaint filing over the Internet,
that doesn't mean that there's not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The air carriers receive 100 to 400 complaints for every
complaint filed with the DOT,'' inspectors said.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are getting better at warning customers about delays
and cancellations, inspectors found. However, they still aren't
telling customers the truth about the delays, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several airlines pointed to the air traffic control system as
the reason for delays, even in cases of extremely bad weather, crew
unavailability or maintenance problems,'' inspectors said. In fact,
some airlines knew about delays as much as four hours beforehand
but didn't tell passengers until they had boarded the plane and
couldn't get back inside the airport, inspectors found.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are only six months into their pledge, and none of them
were identified in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce Committee, which requested the report, will
consider it at a hearing Wednesday, where airline industry
executives were scheduled to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., said he hasn't given up
on the idea of passenger fairness legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors' report ''shows mixed success and raises many
questions and concerns,'' McCain said. ''Unfortunately, the report
indicates that the airlines still have a long way to go to make
significant inroads on the customer service front.''
</P>
<P>
   In their pledge, the airlines promised to volunteer the lowest
airfares or cheaper travel options when people call for
reservations, to give passengers at least 24 hours to cancel ticket
purchases and to find lost luggage within 24 hours. They also said
they would update passengers at 15- to 20-minute intervals when
there were delays.
</P>
<P>
   Customers usually get the best price they're eligible for, but
sometimes higher prices are charged when the ticket agent doesn't
follow correct procedures, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   And while actually following their rule, airlines aren't telling
people when the 24-hour clock starts on their efforts to find lost
luggage and aren't telling people that they can get refunds if they
cancel within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''The customer should not have to ask if this option is
available,'' investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department will check airline service again
before January.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Honors Korean War Casualties  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSAN AIR BASE, South Korea (AP) -- The U.S. Air Force challenged
Korean War history Wednesday, claiming that the first American
casualties in the conflict were airmen, not ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Three Air Force planes suffered heavy damage in attacks by North
Korea and crashed in bad weather on their way to their base in
Japan, said Deryl D. Danner, chief U.S. Air Force historian in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The six occupants of the planes -- two B-26 invaders and one F-82
twin Mustang -- were killed on June 28, 1950, three days after the
war began, and became the first American victims, Danner said.
</P>
<P>
   The ground troops of Task Force Smith from Japan had been
considered the first U.S. casualties, while engaging advancing
North Korean troops south of Seoul on July 5, 1950.
</P>
<P>
   ''The timing of the efforts (to set records straight) is related
to the 50th anniversary of the Korean War,'' Danner said, adding
that the findings have been sent to Washington for review.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service Wednesday in Osan, the headquarters of the
U.S. Air Force Command in South Korea, honored the six slain
airmen.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the 50th anniversary of their sacrifice, we collectively
thank them for their steadfast courage. Today, the legacy of these
airmen lives on,'' said Lt. Gen. Charles R. Heflebower, commander
of the U.S. Air Force in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''The significance of the ceremony is that the first Americans
who have lost their lives in defense of freedom have been given
credit at last,'' Danner said.
</P>
<P>
   The war began June 25, 1950 when communist North Korea invaded
the South. The northern forces advanced quickly, pushing back
unprepared southern forces.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council voted to send in forces, and on June
28 a dozen Air Force planes flew from Japan to destroy railroads
north of Seoul to stop the North's advance.
</P>
<P>
   The six killed that day were Lt. Raymond J. Cyborski of
Illinois; Lt. Remez L. Harding of Texas; Lt. Vernon A. Lindvig of
North Dakota; Lt. Derrell B. Sayre of Ohio; Staff Sgt. Jose C.
Campos Jr. of Arizona and Staff Sgt. William J. Goodwin of
Washington, Danner said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had not done research before to display Air Force history
like this,'' Danner said. ''There were a lot of problems and
inconsistencies, so we had to do research on the National Archives
and contact veterans' associations and Air Force units.''
</P>
<P>
   The war ended July 27, 1953 with an armistice. More than 36,000
Americans were killed in the conflict, and the United States still
keeps 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the start of the
war were muted after the first-ever summit of the nations' leaders
earlier this month, at which both agreed to promote peace and
pursue eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
   After living half a century in isolation, North Korea is slowly
trying to open ties with other countries to expedite foreign aid
and investment for its devastated economy.
</P>
<P>
   David Morton, who coordinates U.N. assistance to Pyongyang, said
in Beijing on Wednesday that with the worst of a five-year famine
over, North Korea foresees feeding itself in two years' time given
good weather and $250 million in aid.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has agreed to donate 200,000 tons of fertilizer this
year, a $40 million contribution, Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   If the rest of the aid comes in, North Korea will be able to
feed its 22.5 million people in 2002, ending years of dependence on
international food deliveries, Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's economy teetered after its trade partners
disappeared along with the Soviet bloc. Floods and drought
beginning in 1995 ruined the economy and produced a famine that
killed at least 220,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, improved weather, $138 million in aid and limited
agricultural reforms have helped North Korea over the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country is moving along the road from relief to
recovery,'' Morton said, but called the recovery fragile, dependent
on good weather.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's state news agency warned Wednesday that crops are
''severely affected by shortages of water caused by heat and
drought.'' Pastures have dried up, leaving domestic animals short
of fodder, the Korean Central News Agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Playwright, Actress Seldes Honored  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Playwright Donald Margulies and actress Marian
Seldes are the recipients of the 2000 Evans-Kingsley Awards, given
each year by the Dramatists Guild, an organization of some of the
country's best-known playwrights.
</P>
<P>
   Margulies was awarded the prize for his body of work, which
includes such plays as ''Sight Unseen,'' ''The Loman Family
Picnic'' and ''What's Wrong with This Picture?'' He won the
Pulitzer Prize for drama this year for ''Dinner with Friends,'' a
play about marriage and infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The theater is my life, and this is one of the most beautiful
moments I have ever had,'' an emotional Seldes said Tuesday in
accepting her prize.
</P>
<P>
   Seldes, one of the theater's most beloved actresses, won a Tony
Award in 1967 for her performance in Edward Albee's ''A Delicate
Balance.'' In the fall, she will open off-Broadway in Albee's new
drama, ''The Play About the Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   During the golden age of Broadway drama, Sidney Kingsley was one
of the theater's most successful playwrights. His first big hit was
''Men in White,'' which opened in 1933, and concerned the clash
between the conflicts and ideals of a young doctor. His other hits
included ''Dead End'' (1935), a realistic tale about rising class
differences in New York, and ''The Patriots'' (1943), a drama about
democracy and the battle between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander
Hamilton, and ''Detective Story'' (1949), which focuses on the
death of a policeman.
</P>
<P>
   Madge Evans, Kingsley's wife, was an actress who appeared in
many of her husband's plays as well as such movies as ''Dinner at
Eight'' and ''David Copperfield.''
</P>
<P>
   The Evans-Kingsley Awards include stipends of $20,000 for each
winner.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Campaign Disclosure Bill  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House and the Senate have spoken: Newly
popular but secretive groups should be forced to say who is paying
for TV commercials and other political activity.
</P>
<P>
   The House early Wednesday voted 385-39 to require disclosure of
groups that organize under section 527 of the tax code, which
allows nonprofit groups to run campaign-style commercials as long
as they don't directly advocate the election or defeat of any
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a similar measure earlier this month, and the
two chambers now must work out the differences before sending a
final bill to the White House for the president's signature.
</P>
<P>
   The White House cheered the House action. ''The House delivered
a rebuke to their leadership and said the public interest is more
important than the special interests,'' said White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart. ''We certainly hope that this is a precursor to more
broader and more comprehensive campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Arizona Republican John McCain and his allies
will push GOP leaders to adopt the House bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the Senate will now pass this bill and send it to
President Clinton for immediate signature so we will know this
election cycle who and what these organizations are,'' McCain said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the disclosure measure note that every day of
delay allows groups to collect more secret cash. Even if a bill
eventually does become law, groups will not have to disclose the
names of anyone who donates money before the bill is signed.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has a ''very narrow window'' to pass the legislation in
time for disclosure to mean anything for the 2000 elections, said
Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that opponents purposely have delayed the bill to
keep the cash rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   ''For months, while we have waited ... there have been those who
obstructed reform, who have been working as hard as they can to
raise as much secret money as they can,'' Doggett said.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill that passed is much like one Democrats originally
proposed. Republican leaders blocked those efforts, saying the
legislation should be broadened to include unions and other
nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats complained that if unions were included,
corporations should be too. Republicans balked at that.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also complained that such a broad bill was probably
unconstitutional. The GOP version included year-round nonprofit
activity, whereas Democrats wanted to limit it to activity within a
month or two of an election.
</P>
<P>
   ''You shoot as high as you possibly can and end up with
something the majority feels is the best practical solution,'' said
Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., who led the Republican effort.
</P>
<P>
   The final legislation covers any 527 group that raises at least
$25,000 a year. It requires those that do not already report to the
Federal Election Commission to report to the Internal Revenue
Service, which will make the reports public.
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 is reserved for political groups, giving them
certain tax advantages. It was created for political parties and
political action committees, which report their spending to the
FEC.
</P>
<P>
   But a new brand of 527 is reporting to no one. As far as the FEC
is concerned, these groups claim to be involved in issues, not
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Other nonprofits also avoid disclosure with the FEC by claiming
to be involved in issues, although they too spend large sums on TV
ads that attempt to influence elections. Still, unlike 527s, these
other groups do face some limit on how much political activity they
can conduct without losing their nonprofit tax status.
</P>
<P>
   Using a 527, a pair of Texas brothers ran $2.5 million in ads
praising Texas Gov. George W. Bush and attacking McCain in the days
before a crucial GOP primary election. Another 527, with ties to
House Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, is assisting a variety of
Republicans running for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who did not participate in the House debate, issued a
statement attacking the bill as an unconstitutional infringement on
Americans' right to participate in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ''This lack of privacy and free speech is chilling,'' he said.
''This so-called reform bill is in reality nothing more than a
last-ditch effort by the Democrats to protect their vulnerable
incumbent members from valid attacks on their positions and
beliefs.''
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher in early trading
Wednesday as Wall Street awaited a decision from the Federal
Reserve on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the start of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 45.60 at 10,550.06.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 5.02 at 1,455.57, and the
Nasdaq composite index was up 37.85 at 3,896.81.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed was expected to announce Wednesday afternoon whether it
will raise interest rates for the seventh time since last June.
</P>
<P>
   In recent sessions, signs of a slowdown have convinced many
analysts that the Fed will leave rates unchanged. The Fed began its
long course of rate increases in a bid to cool off inflationary
pressures in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But mixed signals abound. Wednesday morning, the Commerce
Department said orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket
manufactured goods shot up 6 percent in May, led by a burst in
demand for electronics equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Economists cautioned that the durable-goods data tend to be
volatile, but worried that the report signified that the
manufacturing sector has not cooled off as much as many analysts
had believed.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fed's decision looming, investors continued moving
money from sector to sector. Technology and telecommunications
stocks fared best, with Hewlett-Packard rising $4.563 to $121.188
and WorldCom up $3.563 at $43.25.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 127.15 million
shares, ahead of Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.47 to 510.55.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.5 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.4 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.5 percent.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taxpayer money can be used to buy computers
and other instructional materials for religious schools, the
Supreme Court ruled Wednesday as it lowered the figurative wall of
separation between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 ruling should speed federal efforts to connect every
American classroom to the Internet. The decision also is sure to be
cited as a big victory for proponents of using public money for
tuition aid to families who send their children to religious
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Politically charged legal fights over tuition vouchers are being
waged in numerous lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   In splintered voting, the justices amassed the votes of a
majority of the court to overturn two 1970s Supreme Court decisions
banning provisions of many materials to parochial schools. More
recent rulings already had blunted the effect of those decisions.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Head Appoints Police Chief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's supreme leader appointed a new police
chief, Iran's official news agency reported Wednesday, replacing a
hard-liner who was widely considered responsible for last year's
student riots.
</P>
<P>
   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appointed by decree late Tuesday Brig.
Gen. Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf as the commander of the Law Enforcement
Forces, as the police are called. He replaces Brig. Gen. Hedayat
Lotfian, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency gave no reasons for the replacement, but pro-reform
groups allied with President Mohammad Khatami had long called for
Lotfian's dismissal after police and vigilantes with clubs stormed
a Tehran student hostel last July, provoking the worst riots since
the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Although no charges have been brought against Lotfian, his
deputy Brig. Gen. Farhad Nazari and 19 others are awaiting a
verdict after a lengthy trial for their roles in storming the
Tehran University dormitory on July 9, 1999. At least one student
was killed and scores were injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Lotfian's sacking comes just two weeks before the first
anniversary of the riots.
</P>
<P>
   Nazari has been charged with ordering the illegal entry of the
hostel, disobeying orders and tarnishing the image of the police.
The other accused -- 11 officers and eight low ranking policemen --
are charged with being accomplices to the crime and destroying
public property. If found guilty, they face prison sentences.

<HEADLINE> Cuban-Bound Jet Awaits Elian  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the Supreme Court weighed whether to block
Elian Gonzalez from returning to Cuba, a chartered jet stood by
waiting to take the 6-year-old, his family and his friends back to
their native soil.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, approved the
arrangements, waiting for permission from the high court to leave
U.S. soil after 4 p.m. EDT Wednesday. Tentative plans called for a
nighttime arrival in Havana after a flight from Washington Dulles
International Airport in suburban Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, who has not seen his homeland in seven months, had an
entourage of Cuban compatriots, including classmates who joined him
here in April.
</P>
<P>
   The plans were uncertain because the Supreme Court could agree
to hear an appeal by Elian's Miami relatives seeking a political
asylum hearing for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials said the departure plans were being coordinated
by Gregory Craig, the lawyer for Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, just another Cuban boy last November, has since become an
international celebrity, and his prospective departure from the
United States is generating a lot more attention than his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   He barely survived a perilous boat journey from Cuba that
claimed the life of his mother, and since his rescue from the
Atlantic Ocean on Thanksgiving Day he has been at the center of a
bitter custody battle between his father in Cuba and his
Cuban-American relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For President Fidel Castro, getting Elian out of the clutches of
his powerful adversary has been a No. 1 priority.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has become a rallying point for anti-Castro sentiments in
the United States, particularly in Miami's Cuban exile
neighborhoods. He stayed with his Miami relatives until federal
agents seized him on April 22 and turned him over to his father in
Washington pending the court appeals.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 protesters prayed for Elian Wednesday morning in front
of the now-abandoned house where he lived with his Miami relatives
for five months. The have kept a vigil in front of the home for
many weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the protesters later joined a similar-sized gathering in
front of the federal courthouse in downtown Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Elian appeared to be in the dark about the fate that awaited him
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. Joan Brown Campbell, former general secretary of
the National Council of Churches and a staunch supporter of Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, said Tuesday she believed the father has been
careful not to promise his son when he might be returning home.
</P>
<P>
   ''My overwhelming impression is that no one is talking to him
about going home'' yet, she said. ''I don't think his father is
going to talk about this until they're sure they're going.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, attorneys for the relatives asked Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy to block Elian's departure so the full Supreme Court could
address the issue. Kennedy is responsible for dealing with cases
from the 11th Circuit Court in Atlanta, which ruled last week that
Elian should be allowed to leave on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Miami relatives have argued that a few weeks'
delay in the long legal fight over the boy is a small cost in a
case with stakes of such magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   All along, the Miami relatives have said the immigration service
erred in not granting Elian the right to apply for political
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have consistently maintained that the
desire of Elian's father to repatriate the boy to Cuba must be
respected, a position backed by a succession of court rulings.

   In recent sessions, signs of a slowdown have convinced many
analysts that the Fed will leave rates unchanged. The Fed began its
long course of rate increases in a bid to cool off inflationary
pressures in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's going to be some recognition that the economy has
decelerated,'' said Michael Strauss, managing director of
Commonfund Asset Management. Strauss was anticipating that the Fed
would leave rates unchanged at this meeting, but would leave the
door open to a possible rate increase in August.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still a very, very cautious Fed,'' he said. ''They have
some room to hold off on a tightening now, but the economic numbers
in July and August could paint a picture of a stronger economy than
they really want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, certain economic gauges have been pointing to continued
growth. Wednesday morning, the Commerce Department said orders to
U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods shot up 6 percent
in May, led by a burst in demand for electronics equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Economists cautioned that the durable-goods data tend to be
volatile, but worried that the report signified that the
manufacturing sector has not cooled off as much as many analysts
had believed.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fed's decision looming, investors continued moving
money from sector to sector. Technology and telecommunications
stocks fared best, with Hewlett-Packard rising $6.188 to $122.813
and WorldCom up $4.813 at $44.375.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 321.35 million
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said end-of-the-quarter buying and selling was
preventing the market from hitting the lull that typically precedes
Fed announcements.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.11 to 512.19.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Roman City Going Underwater  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Archaeologists who have rescued precious
mosaics and other artifacts from two Roman villas were hoping to
excavate more, but floodwaters from a dam in southeastern Turkey
have washed over the site, reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish archaeologists, aided by colleagues from Britain,
France, Australia and New Zealand, excavated the artifacts from the
lower part of the ancient city of Zeugma, founded in the third
century B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The villas on the lower level proved to be a treasure trove: At
least 14 mosaics have been uncovered there, along with 3,700 silver
and bronze coins and 60,000 ceramic seals.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists believe the lower city, once a Roman military
post, holds many more treasures. They were hoping for a delay in
the filling of the Birecik Dam so they could excavate more.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they got a 10-day reprieve to remove the artifacts and
take them to a nearby museum.
</P>
<P>
   Birecik is part of a multibillion-dollar project to irrigate
land, alleviate Turkey's electricity shortage and create jobs in
the nation's impoverished southeast. The project has displaced more
than 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The archaeologists are now excavating the upper terraces of
Zeugma, the Anatolia news agency reported. Those terraces are
expected to be inundated by rising waters from the dam in October.

<HEADLINE> Light Sentences in Miners' Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Two mining executives were convicted of
negligence Wednesday in an accident two years ago in which 10
miners were killed, and both received suspended sentences. Three
other officials were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Hermann Schmidt, the manager of the mine at Lassing, some 120
miles southwest of Vienna, and Wolfgang Wedrac, the regional mining
authority's chief, were convicted by a district court in the town
of Leoben of endangering human lives through negligence in the July
1998 disaster at the Lassing talc mine.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt received a suspended prison sentence of 20 months and a
fine of $8,300. Wedrac received a suspended sentence of 10 months
and a fine of $7,450.
</P>
<P>
   The trial dragged on for months, with the defendant's lawyers
disputing the prosecution's contention, buttressed by two expert
witnesses, that Schmidt and the others could have foreseen the
accident because mining operations were too close to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The defense offered other evidence it claimed cleared their
clients of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 men who perished were themselves part of a rescue team
which was sent into the mine in Lassing on July 17, 1998, when a
landslide buried their colleague, Georg Hainzl, after days of heavy
rain.
</P>
<P>
   But a second, stronger mudslide trapped them in the collapsed
mine, too, and officials declared there was no chance anyone
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days later, however, Hainzl was found alive and in
relatively good condition despite his ordeal. Rescue efforts
intensified, but were plagued by breakdowns and equipment failures.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the other 10 were never retrieved.

<HEADLINE> Official Defends Taiwanese President  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The Taiwanese president's willingness to
accept an agreement that once helped start historic meetings with
China was not a compromise gesture with the island's communist
rival, Taiwan's top official on China affairs said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council,
spoke one day after President Chen Shui-bian made front-page news
by saying he could accept a 1992 deal with China which Taiwanese
refer to as ''one China, each side can have its own
interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal once allowed both sides to disagree about how to
describe Taiwan's political status. Taiwan has enjoyed de facto
independence from China since the two sides split amid civil war 51
years ago, and China considers Taiwan a renegade province that will
one day be reunited with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and the local media viewed Chen's announcement to be a
significant policy shift and a goodwill gesture toward Beijing. In
recent months, some Taiwanese officials have said the 1992
agreement is outdated, and Chen had never before specifically said
he could accept the 1992 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But during her brief news conference, Tsai told reporters, ''His
(Chen's) position has always been consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Chen had never before accepted the agreement, he did say
in his inauguration speech that he would like to build on the
foundation left by the previous Nationalist Party government, which
made the 1992 deal with Beijing. Chen also urged the two sides to
''agree to disagree'' on long-standing disputes that might take
years to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing scrapped the 1992 consensus last year after former
Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui began insisting that both sides
have equal ''state-to-state'' relations. China viewed this position
to be a radical move toward independence and canceled an envoy's
trip to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chen has said he agrees with Lee's view, the president
has downplayed the position, which is rarely mentioned now by
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Since Chen's March election victory, Beijing has been demanding
that he agree with its ''one-China principle,'' which holds that
Taiwan is an inseparable part of China -- not a sovereign,
independent state.
</P>
<P>
   Chen and most Taiwanese oppose the ''one-China principle,''
fearing that it means that the ruler of the country would be the
repressive communist government in Beijing. On Wednesday night,
Tsai repeated Chen's stance: ''There is no way we can accept this
position.''
</P>
<P>
   China did not immediately respond to Chen's latest comments.
</P>
<P>
   C.M. Liang, a political science professor at Fu-jen Catholic
University in Taipei, said Chen is accepting the 1992 agreement now
because he is on the front line of the China debate and is becoming
more sensitive to Beijing's pressure. Liang also said Chen realizes
that he needs a deal with China to calm Taiwan's jittery stock
market and maintain economic stability.
</P>
<P>
   ''His China policy will have to be much more flexible,'' Liang
said. ''There should be a breakthrough during his term.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese: Volcano As Neighbor OK  </HEADLINE>
By YURI KAGEYAMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMITSUKI, Japan (AP) -- Mount Oyama may be a fearsome neighbor,
with its periodic threats of eruption, but residents here say
they're willing to forgive the volcano, given the pleasures of
living on an island surrounded by clean waters filled with tasty
fish.
</P>
<P>
   After days of quakes that rattled Miyakejima island, the danger
of the 2,686-foot mountain's erupting appeared to be fading
Wednesday, raising hopes among hundreds of evacuated residents that
the latest scare was ending.
</P>
<P>
   Tsuruko Kawahara, a 75-year-old cookie factory worker, has lived
through two eruptions by Mount Oyama. Still, she said she wouldn't
dream of living anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ''For those who live on the island, the island is good,'' she
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I leave the house all day with the doors unlocked and the
windows open. I would be much more afraid to live with crime in the
big cities,'' she said. ''A volcano only erupts every once in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Many island dwellers echoed Kawahara's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sea is great,'' said 49-year-old fisherman Motoharu
Komuro. ''I was born and raised here. It'd take a lot of energy to
break out of that lifestyle. I love nature here.''
</P>
<P>
   Seismologists in Tokyo told reporters Wednesday the earthquakes
that are still shaking the island are drifting out to sea, and
there is little chance of the mountain spewing lava on Miyakejima.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation warning was issued Monday after intensifying
earthquakes signaled a possible eruption at Mount Oyama, a
curvaceous tree-covered mountain that seems to spread out to all
corners of Miyakejima, 120 miles from Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The warning involved more than 2,000 residents -- many of whom
moved to centers elsewhere on the island -- and it is now up to
officials on the island and in Tokyo to decide when to lift it.
About 4,000 people live on Miyakejima.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainties about the volcano's activities this time have
been puzzling. Although Mount Oyama has erupted several times in
the last 60 years, including in 1983, the blasts usually came
quickly and were over in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   In previous eruptions, residents saw a pillar of fire shoot up
with a bang and sparks scatter like fireworks explosions.
</P>
<P>
   When it erupted in 1962, Kawahara had to flee on foot to a
junior high school. ''It was frightening,'' she recalled. ''But
I've never felt that I don't want to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was killed or injured in that quake, or the one in 1983,
because the residents were evacuated in time. A 1940 eruption
killed 11 people.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Jonathan Kozol  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nine books and 35 years after he took up the
fight that's shaped his adult life, Jonathan Kozol was growing
weary of the outrage that had been his stock in trade.
</P>
<P>
   The crusading writer was aching for a respite from the
exhausting work of bringing the lives of the poor -- especially
children -- to the attention of a nation that often acts as if it
would rather ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   He turned to a seemingly unlikely refuge -- a gritty,
oft-maligned neighborhood that had touched his heart once before.
And the South Bronx, whose name is shorthand for the woes of urban
America, helped restore his tired spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt at home here,'' says Kozol, 63, whose often searing
books have chronicled the real-life impact of the gap between rich
and poor. ''I don't have children of my own, so this was the place
where I thought I had a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozol's hundreds of trips to the South Bronx neighborhood known
as Mott Haven -- for social visits, classroom stops, religious
services and long afternoons at a church after-school program --
began in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the nation's poorest areas, and Kozol had spent
time there before, researching his 1995 book ''Amazing Grace,'' a
wrenching account of the impact of poverty, violence, disease and
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, he was looking for more than just the makings
of a book -- although he eventually got that, too. Worn down by the
pressures of writing and advocacy and saddened by the illness of
his elderly parents, the Harvard-educated writer sought solace amid
a network of poor black and Hispanic children, most of them still
in elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kept coming back here when I was feeling low,'' he says.
''The children would always cheer me up and comfort me if they
could see I was upset.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every book I've written up until now has had an agenda,''
Kozol continues, recalling works on homelessness, educational
inequality and illiteracy. ''When a writer has a specific agenda,
the whimsical and unpredictable things that children say become
distractions. ... This time, I wanted to enjoy the interruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozol smiles when he speaks of the small, sweet ideas that
occupy the minds of young children, largely the same in the South
Bronx as they are in wealthier places -- things like crayons,
birthdays, pets, baby brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The innocence he saw in the schoolchildren of this troubled
neighborhood is central to ''Ordinary Resurrections,'' the book
that was born from his visits.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of Kozol's earlier works, ''Ordinary Resurrections''
is highly personal, filled with vivid descriptions of children's
lives and personalities and of the friendships he formed with them.
</P>
<P>
   While books like ''Death at an Early Age,'' ''Savage
Inequalities'' and ''Amazing Grace'' exposed some of the ugliest
parts of American life, ''Ordinary Resurrections'' finds beauty
even in a neighborhood filled with sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Kozol describes small encounters over the hundreds of hours he
spent at St. Ann's Church, an inviting stone building where
neighborhood children play, do homework and munch snacks after
school. He also made frequent visits to nearby P.S. 30, a public
school that thrives -- despite many obstacles -- thanks to the work
of a devoted principal.
</P>
<P>
   The children Kozol meets ask to see pictures of his dog, make
bracelets from jelly beans and describe their ideas about God and
heaven. While some may worry about fathers in prison or go home to
mothers who don't have money for food, they are still children --
playful, curious and loving.
</P>
<P>
   ''St. Ann's is not a place of sorrow, but ... of irresistible
vitality and energy and sometimes complicated hope, and now and
then uncomplicated joy,'' Kozol writes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ordinary Resurrections'' clearly reflects his fascination with
children, and the joy he takes in observing the quirks that make
each one unique. But Kozol's new focus on life's softer elements
doesn't mean his passion for political and social change has
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   By introducing readers to youngsters like inquisitive, exuberant
Elio and self-assured Pineapple, he hopes to inspire outrage about
the poverty in which they live and the inferior, underfunded
schools they attend.
</P>
<P>
   Kozol recalls one reader who suggested that ''in a way, it's my
most political book, because I don't speak politically, but the
narrative leads a reader to inevitable political conclusions. I
hope that's true.''
</P>
<P>
   A slight man in a rumpled suit and scuffed shoes, Kozol bursts
with excited energy as he chats with teachers and administrators on
a recent visit to P.S. 30, and he seems happiest with children
tugging at his sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   But ask him about the social and economic forces that may limit
his young Bronx friends, and he responds with an outrage that's
gone out of fashion since he was a young Boston teacher in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Kozol points to schools that are 99.8 percent black and Hispanic
and spend about $5,000 per year for each student. He calls these
''academies of apartheid,'' comparing them to schools in wealthy
towns that spend as much as $18,000 per child.
</P>
<P>
   ''School inequality ought to be the easiest issue for a rich
democracy to resolve,'' Kozol says, leaning in over a table at a
coffee shop around the corner from St. Ann's. ''This country is
rich enough to give every child in the South Bronx the kind of
education it's giving to children in the richest suburbs and not
take a dollar away from the suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although neighborhoods like the South Bronx are benefiting from
a recent drop in crime, the economic boom has hardly been felt in
the area served by St. Ann's, where Kozol says unemployment is
still more than 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After more than three decades of writing angry books, delivering
impassioned lectures and testifying before Congress on poverty and
school inequality, he sometimes wonders what his life's work has
really accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's heartbreaking after 35 years to see public schools that
are more separate and less equal than they were when I started
out,'' he says. ''There is a sense of futility about doing this and
seeing so little change.''

<HEADLINE> Gallery To Show Art by Blind  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE SCHREINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- To cut through the haze of near
blindness, Dorothy M. Mullins presses close to the canvas to apply
brushstrokes to her vision of a dazzling Southern California
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The work is slow going. Her face and clothes are smudged with a
rainbow of colors as she leans in to capture details. A white cane
rests at her side. It helps her to get around as she pursues her
craft.
</P>
<P>
   The union of a white cane -- a welcome tool for the blind -- and
art supplies usually stirs curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say you can paint? I say 'sure,''' says Mullins, who has
been legally blind since birth.
</P>
<P>
   New Vision Enterprises Foundation wants to dispel such
preconceptions by promoting the works of blind or visually impaired
artists, and opens a gallery Thursday to showcase their creations.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the blind say New Vision Art Gallery, in downtown
Louisville overlooking the Ohio River, will illuminate the talents
of many people who create paintings or sculptures with limited or
no sight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people will be surprised,'' says Rosalie Copeland, art
program specialist at The Braille Institute of Los Angeles.
''People tend to look for stereotypes. The variety and quality of
art will amaze them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gibbons, president and chief executive officer of National
Industries for the Blind in Alexandria, Va., says the gallery will
reveal the talents and diversity of the blind.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just speaks a powerful message to blind people to go where
their hearts and abilities take them,'' he says. ''It gives them an
opportunity to create and to move and contribute in ways that make
sense to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a place to permanently display such artwork was the
motivation in opening the gallery, according to Bob Jarboe, chief
executive officer of New Vision Enterprises. An art buff, Jarboe
says the gallery's main purpose is to create career opportunities
for blind or visually impaired artists.
</P>
<P>
   The artwork will be available for sale. The gallery also hopes
to promote works for display in larger galleries across the
country, and generate a following for the artists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our philosophy is that nothing should remain in the gallery
longer than it has to be,'' Jarboe says.
</P>
<P>
   New Vision Enterprises, a private, nonprofit job-development
foundation for the blind, will fund the gallery through
contributions and a small commission from art sales. Visitors will
be admitted free to the gallery, which is across from a local
landmark -- the Louisville Slugger Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Jarboe expects the gallery to draw curious visitors, and
predicts the art will open their eyes to the abilities of the
blind.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just for the blind and visually impaired, it's for
everybody,'' says curator Albertus Gorman. ''We want people to walk
in and engage the work and learn from it or even want to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorman admits he ''did a double take'' when approached about the
job. Once the concept sank in, he was drawn by the gallery's
uniqueness.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're into opening the world for these folks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As the 60-plus pieces of artwork arrived from Florida to
California for the opening show, Gorman says he has been pleased
with the quality.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the works are exactly as I imagined, both sincere and
accomplished,'' Gorman says, taking a short break from preparing
for the gallery's opening. ''It looks like art to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Such acceptance is welcomed by Mullins, a West Hollywood,
Calif., resident who contributed two paintings to the inaugural
exhibition which runs from June 29 to Aug. 27. She is among 28
artists from seven states whose art will be featured.
</P>
<P>
   Though her works have been shown in galleries, Mullins sometimes
endures long dry spells between sales. Like other artists, she says
she draws inspiration from natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Landscapes are very intriguing, especially the sunrise, the
clouds, the ocean and the mountains,'' Mullins says. ''I think it's
so beautiful what Mother Nature does and I try to go from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorman says her two paintings for the opening show -- a landscape
and a seascape -- are ''very expressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullins uses her limited sight to capture a scene from a
magazine or on a television documentary. Sometimes she ventures to
locations in the Los Angeles area, but seeing details is difficult.
She is able to capture the outlines of a scene and envisions the
rest, putting her interpretive flair into the painting.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland, who teaches art to the blind, says the lack of sight
can free her students to become uninhibited in their painting.
''Much of the work is not pretentious,'' she said. ''It reflects a
very genuine quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorman, former curator for the Louisville Visual Art
Association, finds much of the work charming and personal. ''Some
of the works have a sense of humanity,'' he says. ''It tends to be
more intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   His goal is for the gallery to stage six exhibitions each year.
Some shows may present works of just one or two artists, giving
them the ''kind of validation artists require to build careers,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Jarboe's hope is to create a multidimensional cultural center
that also features the talents of sight-impaired writers and
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   And Gibbons plans to be among the visitors. He says the gallery
could inspire others to assist the blind in pursuing their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's another avenue to focus on people's capabilities and what
they do bring as opposed to what they can't do, which is simply
see,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Victorian Cook Is Flavor of Month  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- It was 1856, and 20-year-old Isabella Mayson was
planning her wedding to publisher Sam Beeton. But she could find
little information for new brides about running a home.
</P>
<P>
   Mayson was not your average Victorian middle-class woman,
though. A journalist, she decided to produce her own wifely
handbook.
</P>
<P>
   First published in installments between 1859 and 1861, ''Mrs.
Beeton's Household Management'' became the housekeeping bible of
the burgeoning Victorian middle class, offering advice on how to
instruct a scullery maid, deal with childish fits and handle
poisons.
</P>
<P>
   It also offered recipes for such delicacies as turtle soup
(''cut the head off the turtle the preceding day''), ox cheeks and
carrot jam.
</P>
<P>
   Revised many times, the latest brick-sized edition now has been
published under the Oxford University Press' World Classics imprint
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''What makes 'Household Management' a classic is not the
recipes, but the breadth of a complex text which, read closely, has
a perennial relevance,'' Guardian columnist Bel Mooney wrote.
</P>
<P>
   This is no ordinary cookbook. Tucked between the recipes are
snippets of philosophy, poems by William Cowper and the wisdom of
Samuel Johnson, details of natural history, moral advice and
hygiene tips.
</P>
<P>
   Readers learn that the ancient Egyptians adored cabbage, and
that the Roman general Lucullus had a canal cut through a mountain
to bring fish direct to his villa near Naples.
</P>
<P>
   The Beetons married at the start of a new industrial age, when
cities were sprouting suburbs -- caught, as the editor of the new
edition, Nicola Humble, puts it, ''between the old world and the
new, poised between modernity and nostalgia.''
</P>
<P>
   While others campaigned for women's suffrage, Beeton staked out
a woman's position in the home. A wife, she insisted, ''is the
first and last, the Alpha and Omega in the government of her
establishment; and ... it is by her conduct that its whole internal
policy is regulated.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a book of contradictions -- a rigid household charter
written by a woman who ran wild as a child under the grandstand at
Epsom race course, and a harbinger of the horrors of intensive
farming that also nostalgically evokes the days when you could milk
a cow straight into your baking bowl.
</P>
<P>
   On the page opposite a recipe for luxurious turtle soup is Mrs.
Beeton's ''Useful Soup for Benevolent Purposes,'' which she smugly
reports having made in large quantities in 1858 for the poorer
families of west London.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of her philosophy was the need to lure her adored
husband -- the publisher of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' -- back home to
suburban west London for dinner, when many men of his class dined
in town.
</P>
<P>
   Some of her offerings, including ''Boiled Calf's Feet and
Parsley and Butter'' and ''Giblet Pie,'' sound unappetizing and are
difficult to procure, but Mooney tried ''Sole in Cream Sauce'' and
found it to be delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the recipes came from readers of the English Woman's
Domestic Magazine, published by Sam Beeton, and from Eliza Acton, a
contemporary food writer who was the first to list ingredients,
quantities and times separate from the cooking method.
</P>
<P>
   Although Beeton tested the recipes in her own kitchen to
establish quantities, she could not specify temperatures for the
variable stoves of the day. But she did offer for the first time
recipes with a known, repeatable outcome.
</P>
<P>
   And she became a lifestyle: The 1861 edition sold more than
60,000 copies and, by 1968, sales had topped 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   She tolerated the new trend for bought food, advising those who
could not make her macaroons to ''purchase such articles at a good
confectioner's.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Beeton's book was embellished to include
luxurious recipes that famously included instructions like ''take
18 eggs'' or ''first catch your hare '' -- what biographer Kathryn
Hughes once called ''domestic porn.''
</P>
<P>
   Humble has pared it back to its sparer origins, in which the
reader can still detect the Victorian emphasis on thrift and
cleanliness (''doorsteps must be cleaned and whitened daily'').
</P>
<P>
   Minute instructions are given on household routine (after a cold
bath at 7 a.m. a wife must supervise her husband's breakfast), and
on protocol (''on entering the kitchen, invariably say, 'Good
morning, cook,' a courtesy much appreciated below stairs).
</P>
<P>
   Mooney believes ''Household Management'' has lasted ''because it
epitomizes an order ... for which there is still a deep craving.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is difficult to read Mrs. B on the importance of family
meals without mourning their passing in this era of TV 'grazing'
when the poor eat badly and the rest watch cookery programs,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Humble, the editor, adds that Beeton also ''captured the mood of
her time,'' and although young, she reassured readers by giving the
appearance of ''a matronly expert.''
</P>
<P>
   Beeton's own happiness was short-lived. In February 1865, soon
after having her fourth child, she died from a fever. She was only
29.

<HEADLINE> Livelyhood Studies the Night Shift  </HEADLINE>
By DOUGLAS J. ROWE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's a four-letter word that's on our minds
maybe more than we care to admit: WORK.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as much as it preoccupies so many of us, television largely
ignores that part of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   That's where ''Livelyhood'' comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Night Shift,'' the latest installment of the quarterly PBS
series (Friday at 9 p.m. Eastern on many stations), focuses on the
one in five Americans who are on the job while most of us sleep.
</P>
<P>
   It looks at real people who work what's sometimes called the
graveyard shift, and offers a life-affirming hour about the dignity
of work that brings to mind echoes of Bela Lugosi's Dracula saying:
''Children of the night -- what muuuusic they make.''
</P>
<P>
   The program looks at the strains and benefits of the shift,
focusing on, among others, an emergency-room nurse in San
Francisco, a single mother of four at a Lucent Technologies plant
in Allentown, Pa., a cross-country trucker, and a Minnesota woman
who helps her husband manage a dairy farm after her nightly 10
hours at an e-commerce and catalog warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   With factoids that scroll across the screen, we learn about the
downside, including the fact that 73 percent of night-shift workers
have sleeping problems -- and a total of 78 sleep disorders exist.
We see how even for people willingly working overnight, like the ER
nurse, the hands of time move excruciatingly slowly as dawn
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the last hour of my shift,'' she says, casting an eye
toward the wall clock. ''Tick-tock, tick-tock.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the upside is voiced by a security guard at a Times
Square office building: ''In the daytime, everybody moving is your
boss. You understand? And you really gotta be on your toes. After 5
o'clock, you might as well say, 'I'm in charge of the whole
building.'''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based political humorist Will Durst serves as
series host and sounds particularly qualified for the post: He says
he's had 108 jobs in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Livelyhood,'' which debuted in 1997, aims ''to give normal
people a voice,'' says the 47-year-old Durst, a self-described
third-generation blue-collar guy who grew up in West Allis, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mostly instead of going to experts to find out what's
happening with work, it's going to the people who are experiencing
the problems and the people who are coming up with the solutions,''
says Durst, who has several jobs now besides working half of his
time on ''Livelyhood'' -- standup comedian, columnist on the Web and
commentator on National Public Radio. ''It's a solution-oriented
show, I would like to think.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is. When someone on the program says the ''toughest part
of working nights is getting a good night's sleep, starting at 9
a.m.,'' Durst segues into a segment of helpful hints punctuated
with visual gags.
</P>
<P>
   While his voiceover notes that among the don'ts is drinking
alcohol before hitting the rack, Durst is swigging from a tequila
bottle. And while suggesting that among the do's is reading a
''soothing book,'' Durst is abed reading ''The Silence of the
Lambs'' and looking terrified.
</P>
<P>
   If ''Night Shift'' has a problem, it's that it tries to pack too
much in. The real people we see ARE interesting, as Durst suggests,
but we don't get an in-depth sense of their travails and
adaptability.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the program fills a void. With some notable exceptions,
the same few professions repeatedly are depicted on television, and
even if a drama or sitcom is set at a workplace, most of the action
has little or nothing to do with the job.
</P>
<P>
   The series has been accused of taking a Panglossian look at
working, but Durst responds: ''It's not our job to be pollyanna on
PBS. That's not who we're trying to be. But we are looking for
solutions, and we're looking for people who can share something in
the positive area that can help everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Durst, who gained some notoriety earlier this year as a
''lifeline'' on the game show ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' by
giving a contestant the wrong answer, has a ready answer to the
question: Why would anyone want to come home from work and watch a
show about work?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something that we do for half of our waking life.
Somebody might be interested in it.''

<P>
   In the birthday spotlight:
</P>
<P>
   Director John Woo had a mission: to comfort Tom Cruise's mother
when he sent his leading man up a cliff for a dizzying climbing
scene. They watched the ''Mission: Impossible 2'' star climb an
overhanging cliff some 2,000 feet above ground without a safety
net. Cruise did that stunt seven times, and his mother and Woo
''worried 70 times,'' the director said. ''I kept sweating. I
closed my eyes and prayed to God.'' Cruise, who was born on July 3,
1962, said he would like to work with Woo again because ''he takes
action and elevates it beyond the way that we knew before.''

   TV talk-show host Montel Williams skipped the platitudes and
challenged graduates to turn around ''a nation that doesn't really
care'' in a recent commencement address at Lehigh University in
Bethlehem, Pa. Citing adversity in his own life as a tough lesson
in compassion, Williams urged the grads to define success by
helping others as they had been helped in their own lives.
Williams, host of the nationally syndicated ''Montel Williams
Show,'' placed little hope in politicians to help close what he
called a growing gap between rich and poor. He was born on July 3,
1956.

<HEADLINE> Farmers May Grow Pot in Netherlands  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- In a country where selling small
packets of hash and marijuana is already openly tolerated, farmers
in this Dutch nation may soon be able to grow the soft drug without
fear of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch parliament adopted a resolution Tuesday to tolerate
the cultivation of cannabis and to regulate the crop, government
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators from two of the three parties in the government
coalition drafted the motion, which passed the 150-seat chamber by
a 73-72 vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote was so narrow that Justice Ministry spokesman
Victor Holtus said it was unlikely the cabinet would approve the
resolution. It was to be discussed Friday, and if endorsed, would
then be drafted for legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sharply contradicts international agreements and we don't
live on an island. It is assumed that the minister won't support
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The motion avoids using the term ''legalization,'' apparently to
curtail reaction by other countries.
</P>
<P>
   As any tourist to Amsterdam soon learns, some 3,000 ''coffee
shops'' openly sell hash and marijuana for smoking, or hash cakes
and cookies for eating.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities still crack down on the cultivation and supply
of it. Tons of cannabis grown in Dutch fields are impounded each
year, even though some city residents grow it in their window
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the main objectives is to fight crime,'' said Labor
Party parliamentarian Thanasis Apostolou, who helped draft the
motion. ''By regulating the supply we would know who is selling
what and where it is going.''
</P>
<P>
   But Holtus said the proposal would do nothing to curtail
international crime syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors, he said, ''want to officially regulate a group of
selected hemp growers so they can keep tabs on the supply. Simply
said: it's the legalization of hemp cultivation. To call this
anything else is just playing word games.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the opposition said that the proposal could damage
the country's political position in Europe if adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The French government has been extremely critical of liberal
Dutch drug policies. Relations between the two countries soured
over soft drugs in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are worried that this resolution will isolate the
Netherlands in the European community and prevent any further
discussions on drugs,'' said legislator Wim van de Camp of the
opposition Christian Democratic Alliance. ''Some countries already
had a problem with the tolerant policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution aims to curb exports -- an illegal business now
worth up to $8.5 billion annually, Apostolou told The Associated
Press.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With John C. Reilly  </HEADLINE>
By ELIZABETH A. KENNEDY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Playing a fisherman in ''The Perfect Storm'' was
no easy task for John C. Reilly. His days were spent working on a
boat off the coast of Gloucester, Mass., or in a tank filled with
1.8 million gallons of water on a Los Angeles soundstage.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which stars George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Diane
Lane, is based on Sebastian Junger's 1997 best seller. It is the
true story of a crew of commercial fishermen who battled three
colliding storms in the Atlantic Ocean in 1991. Reilly plays Dale
Murphy, or ''Murph,'' whose wife leaves him because he spends too
much time on the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted Murph to be the biggest guy on the boat. I gained
about 30 pounds, and I grew this big old burly beard and my hair
was all crazy,'' said Reilly, who loves stories about the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ''My dad was a big fisherman. He passed away, but a lot of time
I spent growing up was on the water, so a lot of my best memories
are from that. There's something about the water -- that solitary
kind of peaceful feeling. You're on Earth but not quite.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old actor said he tries never to take easy roles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to take things that challenge me either physically or
mentally, or I have to learn a new skill. In 'Magnolia,' I had to
learn all this police training. In 'For Love of the Game,' I had to
perform like a major-league baseball player.''
</P>
<P>
   1. The characters in ''The Perfect Storm'' spend a lot of time
together on the boat and arguments break out. How did the actors
get along?
</P>
<P>
   Reilly: One of the unique things about making this movie is that
whether we were out at sea or in the middle of the water tank, a
lot of times you just couldn't leave. Especially when we were out
at sea. You were there all day long, 12 hours a day. So there was
none of this, 'I'm going back to my trailer, my trailer's bigger
than your trailer,' that kind of Hollywood nonsense. God forbid you
got seasick because there was no option to go back. So that really
did force us to be a group.
</P>
<P>
   2. Did you feel any added responsibility because you were
portraying a true story?
</P>
<P>
   Reilly: Oh, absolutely, it felt more serious than your typical
job. One of the things that got us through how difficult the
shooting actually was was that we are telling a real story. This is
real human drama, we're not creating some amusement park ride for
the summer. Even though the movie is really exciting to watch, it's
got a real pathos behind it.
</P>
<P>
   3. Were you ever scared during filming?
</P>
<P>
   Reilly: There was a lot of time when we were shooting that I was
really crossing myself beforehand and saying a prayer. There's only
so much you can do to plan for water. They had this thing called
the dump tank, which looked like a free-standing elevator shaft.
And they put 2,000 gallons of water in and released it, and it goes
down and hits a ramp at the end that causes the water to go up in
this huge wall of a wave. And then the actors had to stand in front
of it! Your body is like a piece of driftwood. You just obey the
water.
</P>
<P>
   4. Many of your roles have been supporting roles. Are you
looking forward to leading roles?
</P>
<P>
   Reilly: I'm not complaining about having supporting roles. It's
allowed me to grow slowly and mature as a person and as an actor
and gain an understanding of this business. But I am looking to do
more leading roles.
</P>
<P>
   5. Do you have any dream roles?
</P>
<P>
   Reilly: I would love to do something like Gene Hackman in 'The
French Connection,' or a period movie, some medieval thing. I'm a
big history buff.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Western Beat  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Early in its first episode, ''Western
Beat With Billy Block'' reveals itself as a different kind of
country music TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it's done: A large man comes on the screen. His name
is Lonesome Bob. He sorely lacks the shape and looks of
country-music pinups Tim McGraw and Bryan White.
</P>
<P>
   But Lonesome Bob's sing-along about a woman who can't quite put
her finger on why her life is so dissatisfying (''Heather's All
Bummed Out'') is filled with a depth and humor that is missing in
today's mainstream country music.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just try to be honest when I write a song,'' Lonesome Bob
explains during an interview on the show, ''and drunk when I
perform it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Western Beat With Billy Block'' offers a look into a rich side
of the Nashville music scene that doesn't get much exposure. The
show premieres Sunday (July 2) at 11 p.m. Eastern on CMT, a cable
network that reaches about 40 million homes and specializes in
country music videos. The show repeats Monday (July 3) at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Performers on the first show are Lonesome Bob with harmonies
from Allison Moorer, Charlie Robison and Trisha Yearwood. Videos by
Moorer and Kim Richey are included. Promoter Block and his wife
Jill conduct interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Western Beat, also known as Alternative Country or No Depression
music, is country music with the rough edges firmly in place. Some
of the best country music you've never heard comes from this genre.
Although some performers try to pass off amateurism as
authenticity, the good stuff is very good.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the industry as a whole is looking at what we're doing
as possibly the future of country music,'' Block said. ''Music Row
has been serving vanilla for so long, and I'm offering
Neapolitan.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is expecting Western Beat music to topple Shania Twain
from the top of the charts, but some in Nashville believe it can
attract a new audience.
</P>
<P>
   There's some evidence that it could work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Transcendental Blues,'' the new album by alternative country
star Steve Earle, sold 20,000 copies during its first week of
release, good enough to debut at No. 5 on the country album chart
with virtually no airplay from country radio stations. Moorer,
Robison and Eric Heatherly have snagged record deals in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   All that's missing is a breakthrough hit or artist to convince
radio programmers that there is an appetite for rawer music.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to combine the mainstream with the alternative.
Sometimes (mainstream country music) seems a little too
manufactured, a little too contrived. There's a reality factor
that's kind of missing for me,'' Block said.
</P>
<P>
   Yearwood, one of mainstream country's brightest stars, agrees.
She hopes her appearance on the show will draw an audience to
Lonesome Bob and other Western Beat artists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've lived in Nashville for 15 years,'' Yearwood said. ''I
wanted to find a way to support the local cool things that are
going on in this town. ... It's a good way to draw attention to
something that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Block started doing live Western Beat shows at clubs around
Nashville in 1996. He patterned his shows after the weekly Ronnie
Mack Barn Dance shows at the Palomino Club in Los Angeles, where
Block was the house drummer for nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now based at the Exit/In nightclub, the shows are the
centerpiece of a growing Western Beat empire that includes a radio
show, magazine, Internet site and record label. ''It has
exploded,'' Block said. ''So obviously there's an audience for this
music.''
</P>
<P>
   CMT hopes the show will attract new viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we didn't think that it had mass appeal, we wouldn't be
doing it. It's that simple,'' said Chris Parr, head of programming.
''I think that someone in Atlanta would enjoy this because it's
entertaining, but I also think it might be that one thing that
grabs someone's attention who's watching in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, it will make them realize that this country music
really isn't so bad after all.''

<HEADLINE> Panel: Customs Needs Outside Advice  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Customs Service, accused of harassing
minorities, should get outside experts to review techniques that
agents use to decide which airline passengers to stop and search,
according to an independent panel.
</P>
<P>
   That was among the recommendations included in the four-member
panel's report aimed at improving the agency's personal search
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Wednesday, was based on a year of work and
visits to 14 airports that handle 66 percent of the air passengers
arriving in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also suggested that the Customs Service seek judicial
approval ''at the first opportunity'' after determining that a
passenger should be detained. In general, customs officials can
detain passengers for long periods of time without court approval.
</P>
<P>
   Customs, in a new policy announced last year, said it would seek
legal advice from U.S. attorneys whenever it wants to hold an
airline passenger for more than eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly has taken a number of steps
to address allegations of unfairly targeting minorities and of
abusive searches including setting up the panel in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly has repeatedly stated that the agency does not use racial
and ethnic profiling as part of its procedures to select passengers
to stop and possibly search.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, agents operate on, among other things, training
information on smuggling trends, patterns of past seizures,
intuition and experience. They make observations on behavior and
physical condition, ask questions and analyze documents.
</P>
<P>
   These factors should be ''reviewed by professionals outside the
Customs Service to determine whether they are based on stereotypes
and for the findings of that review to be made public,'' the report
said. Psychologists or sociologists should be part of that review.
The panel also suggested customs bring in outside diversity experts
to help train agents.
</P>
<P>
   A General Accounting Office report, released earlier this year,
found that black women were much more likely than other passengers
to be subjected to strip searches and X-rays. The report was based
on 1998 data.
</P>
<P>
   Customs' searches are intended to catch smugglers who hide
cocaine or heroin inside their clothes or who swallow drug packets.
The searches usually begin with a pat-down and, with reasonable
suspicion, can proceed to a partial or full strip search, an X-ray
or a monitored bowel movement.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also recommended customs simplify paperwork associated
with body-scanning machines -- which can detect whether a passenger
is concealing drugs under clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The report said only 13 percent of passengers given the option
of the body scan have chosen it over the body search. Many
passengers have complained that it takes more time, in part because
of the time to fill out forms before the scanning.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was chaired by Constance Berry Newman, former
undersecretary at the Smithsonian Institution. Other members were
Hubert Bell, a 29-year veteran of the Secret Service, now at the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Robin Renee Sanders, a State
Department official, previously with the National Security Council;
and Ana Maria Salazar, the Defense Department's deputy assistant
secretary for drug enforcement policy and support.

<HEADLINE> Paul Revere, Raiders Still Rocking  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF SIMONS
<TEXT>
<P>
   TESUQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Party on, Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the past 40 years, Paul Revere and the Raiders have
carved out a niche as America's quintessential rock 'n' roll
pranksters.
</P>
<P>
   ''From day one, we've always been a party band that accidentally
had some hit records and accidentally got on a hit television
series,'' said Revere, 62, outfitted in a Revolutionary War-era
tunic, epaulettes, knee-high boots, black jodhpurs and a plumed
colonial tricorn hat.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, at the Camel Rock Casino, Revere and company
resurrected the era of eight-tracks and AM Top 40 hits. During a
two-hour set, the band punched out tight covers of ''Gimme Some
Lovin','' ''Great Balls of Fire,'' ''Joy to the World'' and Joe
Cocker's gritty rendition of ''With a Little Help From My
Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In between, with Revere perched behind the facade of a mock
Edsel, the Raiders strutted through a sampling of originals that
included ''Kicks,'' ''Good Thing,'' ''Him or Me...What's It Gonna
Be?'' and ''Louie Louie,'' a three-chord dinosaur that was a big
hit for the Kingsmen.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably easier to understand our version than the
Kingsmen's, because in their version, the lead singer in the middle
of the song forgot the lyrics,'' Revere said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He started mumbling and repeated a verse and kind of mumbled
through it because he didn't want to sound like he was repeating
himself. And he wore braces and couldn't say 'Lou-ee, Lou-ee,' so
it came out 'Lou-Eye, Lou-Eye.'''
</P>
<P>
   While interpretations about muffled rock lyrics are legion,
Revere has the inside scoop on this classic.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no dirty lyrics in 'Louie, Louie','' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 600 at Camel Rock was a dancing, clapping,
pumped-up mix of twenty-somethings and baby boomers. Even after the
band delivered a full-tilt cover encore of ''Takin' Care of
Business,'' the fans begged for more.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen great bands that couldn't keep an audience,'' said
''Crazy'' Dave Rarick, the show's master of ceremonies. ''This band
can. As an oldies band, they're right at the top. Revere is the
last madman of rock 'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders drew big cheers when they dedicated the Animals'
''We Gotta Get Out of This Place'' to all the Vietnam veterans in
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The Raiders) bring back a lot of old memories, and it
especially touched me when they dedicated that song to Vietnam
vets,'' said Roman Solano, a veteran who lives in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   Revere was born Paul Revere Dick, a derivative of the Dutch
VanDyck, in 1938. He grew up on a farm near Caldwell, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, he got a jump-start as an entrepreneur, running
three barber shops and managing his own drive-in restaurant. He
also taught himself to play piano. In the late '50s, he put
together his first band, which quickly developed a strong following
at parties and dances across the state.
</P>
<P>
   His first recording was ''Beatnik Sticks,'' a rock variation on
''Chopsticks.'' A year later, he scored his first big hit, ''Like
Long Hair.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Revere formed a new version of the Raiders and moved to
Portland, Ore. One year later, Revere and the Raiders became the
first rock group to sign with Columbia, recording ''Louie, Louie.''
</P>
<P>
   Their string of 20 consecutive hits during a 15-year period
included ''Just Like Me,'' ''Hungry'' and 1971's ''Indian
Reservation,'' which sold 3 million copies. The band has recorded
26 albums and 41 singles, and has sold more than 50 million
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hard part was the early years -- having the hits,'' Revere
said. ''After you have some success, you're afraid it's gonna go
away and you need to take advantage of it, so you work as hard as
you can, because it might disappear tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess that's part of why I've always worked so hard. It's
because next year, nobody's gonna want to see Paul Revere and the
Raiders.''
</P>
<P>
   The band got its big break in the mid-1960s when Dick Clark's
''Where the Action Is'' TV show was in full stride. Revere and the
Raiders were a regularly featured act in 1965 and 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody from (Clark's) company had seen us and recommended us
because we were visual and fun and crazy and were America's answer
to the British music invasion,'' Revere said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Revere and the Raiders co-hosted ''Happening,'' another
Dick Clark production. In the late '60s and early '70s, the band
appeared on hundreds of other TV shows including ''The Ed Sullivan
Show,'' Johnny Carson's ''Tonight'' show and ''The Smothers
Brothers Comedy Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I chased the rock 'n' roll business to see if I could be
lucky, and we were lucky,'' Revere said. ''And I know everybody
likes to hear other reasons for being successful, but in the
entertainment business, it's luck.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had we come along earlier, it would have been too early. If
we'd have come along later, it would have been too late. We just
happened to be at the right time and had the right name and had the
right gimmick.''
</P>
<P>
   That gimmick included flashy costumes, a choreographed martial
two-step and sparring guitarists.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I started my band, I wanted them to move,'' he said. ''I
hate seeing a band that stands there like they're dead because
people hear with their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to see people sweat and move, and if you ain't sweatin'
and you ain't movin', you're in the wrong band.''
</P>
<P>
   The current lineup -- Dan Krause (keyboards), Carl Driggs
(vocals), Ron Foos (bass), Omar Martinez (drums and vocals), Doug
Heath (guitar) and Revere (keyboards) -- has played together for 20
years and averages 150 to 200 shows a year.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, Heath and Foos were part of the Raiders when Mark
Lindsay, the band's original lead singer, left in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Revere rests a little easier on his laurels.
</P>
<P>
   ''As time goes on, the work is always going to be there because
your fans grow up with you,'' he said. ''And until they die,
somebody's going to show up.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Plans on Treaty Unclear  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The United States still has no clear idea of the
proposed Russian alternative to its national missile defense plans,
weeks after President Vladimir Putin announced it, a top U.S.
defense official said Wednesday after talks with Russian military
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Russia strongly opposes American proposals to modify the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty so it can develop a limited national
missile defense system. In early June, Putin proposed an alternate
plan that he claims wouldn't break the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But details of the plan haven't been released, and Russian
officials said little new about the proposal during three days of
talks with American defense officials in Moscow this week, said
Edward Warner III, U.S. assistant secretary of defense for strategy
and threat reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russians were asked some questions and were willing to
understand some of the issues,'' Warner told The Associated Press.
''But they did not provide us with any information about the
systems that they have under development.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner was in Moscow for a meeting of the Defense Consultative
Group, which consists of defense officials from both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow says the U.S. missile defense plan is a threat to its
security because it could be expanded to defeat a Russian missile
attack, making Russia's nuclear arsenal useless. The United States
insists that is not the case, saying the defense aims to stop
missile attacks by small states with nuclear potential such as Iran
and North Korea. Putin has warned that Moscow will pull out of all
nuclear arms agreements if the ABM treaty is breached.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said the Russian side in the talks, led by Gen. Valery
Manilov, first deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, showed no
sign of changing its adamant opposition toward modifying the ABM
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''There certainly was no breakthrough this time,'' Warner said.
''They don't want to open the door to any missile defense beyond
the very geographically limited system permitted under the current
treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said Putin's proposed alternative would use a
so-called boost-phase defense, in which interceptor missiles would
destroy enemy nuclear missiles just after launch. That differs from
the American system, which would destroy warheads in space or as
they descend.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have not said whether their plan involves
boost-phase defense. Some analysts have said Russia's plan is
poorly developed and may be more of a political bargaining tool
than a legitimate defense strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said the two sides discussed boost-phase defense
alternatives, but the Americans made clear the opposition such a
plan would face at home. The U.S. defense proposal calls for the
initial phase to be ready by 2005, and American officials say
boost-phase defense isn't yet technically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was the problem of the timeliness by which one could
have this capability,'' Warner said. ''Certainly the current strong
movement of the Congress and the plans the administration has been
developing have been all premised on the fact that you need to have
an operational system by roughly 2005.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Warner said the two sides agreed on further cooperation,
including plans for joint peacekeeper training and reciprocal
military visits. The two will also resume a training program to
protect jointly deployed troops against nuclear missile attacks,
known as theater missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Russia had been cooperating with NATO in military exercises
until early 1999, when Moscow froze virtually all ties with the
U.S.-led alliance after it began its air campaign in Yugoslavia.
Russia resumed relations with NATO earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Diana Ross: This Time I Can Enjoy It  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ROGERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The best thing about being a Supreme again,
says Diana Ross, is that this time, she really gets to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   The first time, Ross was just out of her teens -- and Detroit's
rough-and-tumble Brewster Projects -- with one overriding ambition:
to sing. And there she was, singing with one of the biggest pop
groups of its time.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of Beatlemania in 1964, the Supremes strung
together six consecutive No. 1 hits, starting with ''Where Did Our
Love Go.'' By the end of the decade, they had 12, ending with
''Someday We'll Be Together.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you can be looking too far into the future or too
inside your own head,'' Ross said of those days. ''This time, it's
like when you're sitting outside and you really see the trees. You
know what I mean? I'm really seeing the audience this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 56, she believes it's time to be a Supreme again, that
for at least one summer it can be 1964 again. It can be a time when
three young women from Detroit put on the most outlandish evening
gowns and sang and danced their way into the public's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very interesting time in my life,'' Ross said from her
home in Connecticut. ''It's like going full circle and coming back
and just watching the journey.''
</P>
<P>
   She had just returned from Atlanta, where she performed as part
of Diana Ross and the Supremes for the first time in 30 years,
before an audience of 16,000 delighted fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to ask the audience to sit down so I could sing to
them,'' said Ross, speaking in an excited, nonstop,
stream-of-consciousness, hardly-got-time-to-take-a-breath rush of
exuberance, as she recounted the show.
</P>
<P>
   She sounded like a happy school kid who had just aced a test,
which is at odds with her better-known image as the icy-cool diva.
But this is the one, she said, that is really her.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you can see, I'm long-winded. For that, I apologize,'' she
giggled with embarrassment when she finally came up for air.
</P>
<P>
   But for Ross, there's so much to do this year and so little time
to stop and talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   First came the weeks of rehearsals with the newly constituted
Supremes, backup singers Scherrie Payne and Lynda Laurence.
Although both are former members of the group, they didn't join
until well after Ross had left in 1970, and had never worked with
her.
</P>
<P>
   She said the new trio quickly clicked. ''There's just so much
love and respect between us that it just makes me very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she would have liked for things to have come together
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ''Absolutely. I wish, I wish, I wish,'' she said when asked if
there is sadness that Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong, her
contemporary Supremes, aren't there, negotiations with them having
broken down.
</P>
<P>
   But the odd thing, she said, is that she never intended to bring
the group back together.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had recorded a new album and we were going on tour to
promote it,'' she said. ''The promoters said maybe it would be nice
to have a nice segment of Supremes songs to help sell the tour. I
said, 'Sounds like a good idea to me.'
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I don't know how it got on the Internet and in the
media, but suddenly it was everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The word was the Supremes were getting back together.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was doing the Image Awards show, and you know how you go
down the red carpet when you walk in there?'' Ross continued. ''I
was doing that and the fans and the press were all there saying to
me, 'Is this really going to happen?'
</P>
<P>
   ''I finally turned to them and I said, 'Is this what you guys
want? Because if it is, I'll try to make it happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   So she contacted Wilson, her Supremes co-founder, and Birdsong,
who had replaced the group's other founding member, the late
Florence Ballard, in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ''I called them and said, 'Have you been hearing the rumors?'
And of course they had. So I said, 'What I need to know from you
guys is are you willing to make a commitment for 30 shows for the
summer?'''
</P>
<P>
   When they said they were, Ross turned the matter over to the
show's producers.
</P>
<P>
   ''And that's the last I heard from Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   The next the public heard was that Wilson was balking at going
on the road for 15 or 20 times less money than Ross would get. Then
Wilson and Birdsong were out and Payne and Laurence were in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't think that Mary had the vision at all to
understand that this was not about money,'' said Ross, whose
handlers point out she is contributing a portion of her earnings to
charity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really think it's shortsighted, if you know what I mean.
Because five years from now, we wouldn't be able to do this tour.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it's getting harder for her to sing ''Baby Love''
and ''Love Is Here and Now You're Gone'' in the same high register
she used in her 20s.
</P>
<P>
   But she insists that she will sing all of her old hits in the
keys she recorded them in. Even ''Love Child.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really high. It has those, you know, those 'Ohhhh, ohhhh,
ohhhhs' at the end,'' she said, bursting into song to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   With mild embarrassment, she quickly caught herself. ''No! I'm
not even going to try to sing for you. Not today,'' she laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there aren't plenty of other songs she can still do
easily. Since leaving the Supremes, she has had a string of hits,
including ''Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand),'' ''Upside
Down'' and ''Good Morning Heartache.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been several movies as well, most notably ''Lady
Sings the Blues,'' which earned her an Oscar nomination for her
portrayal of Billie Holliday.
</P>
<P>
   She credits her varied success to Berry Gordy Jr., the Motown
mogul who shepherded her career from its earliest days with the
Primettes, the forerunner of the Supremes that put out eight failed
singles before changing its name and finally hitting with ''Where
Did Our Love Go.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Berry Gordy was absolutely visionary in my career because all
I wanted to do was sing,'' she said. ''We used to say we were a
team. If he could dream it, I could do it. I have always said if
somebody believes in me, I'll figure out a way to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Regis Brings Fashion to Masses  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCINE PARNES
For The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Cosmopolitan editor Helen Gurley Brown
once joked that it took an act of Congress to get men out of the
basic white shirt and regulation tie.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, it is quiz-show host Regis Philbin, a newly minted
menswear purveyor, who is legislating this summer's hot new look, a
cotton men's dress shirt with the same-color glossy necktie, both
in solids, in black, tan, blue or green.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings powerhouse attracted a crowd that snaked out the
door and on to the sidewalk at Macy's Herald Square during the
recent launch of the Regis by The Van Heusen Company label.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Cole, Richard Tyler, Hugo Boss and Joseph Abboud have
sent the monochromatic look down the runways. And a squadron of
Hollywood's hottest, from Tom Cruise to Tom Hanks, have worn it on
the red carpet. But it took Philbin, host of ABC's ''Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire,'' to bring it to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll probably see (the Regis look) in middle America in
droves only because, remember, his 'Millionaire' show is the
top-rated show across America; it's a phenomenon and it's on
several nights a week. Now that's what I call penetrating a
market,'' said Mike Cannon, men's fashion editor at Town &AMP; Country
magazine, who expects the Regis-label ensemble to saturate Kiwanis
Clubs across the heartland, even if it doesn't show up at
social-page soirees.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regis Philbin is cool to a lot of guys -- real men, not
style-setters,'' said Cannon. ''I think his universal appeal will
penetrate the country much like the Farrah Fawcett hairstyle and
the pashmina (shawl) did for women, and the Cabbage Patch doll did
for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   That's no accident. ''What made this so exciting is that Regis
had the ability to not only introduce fashion to mass America,''
said Lee Terrill, president of Van Heusen, ''but give it an
acceptability and a comfort level. We are getting calls from all
over America and Canada because people feel like they know him.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend ''might prove that men are less influenced by fashion
designers and runway presentations than the industry would like to
believe,'' said Karen Alberg, editor of MR, a menswear trade
magazine. ''Television and music and sports today are far more
important to the typical American man.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana Pacers basketball coach Larry Bird wore a beige
shirt-and-tie combo during this season's NBA finals. And the host
and two commentators on CNBC's ''Squawk Box'' gave the Regis look a
recent tryout on the early morning financial news program.
</P>
<P>
   Van Heusen projects retail sales of $50 million for the Regis
line this year. ''We found that despite the fact this look is not
fashion-forward or new, a lot of America really didn't relate to it
or wasn't aware of it,'' Terrill said.
</P>
<P>
   The ''dark tonal look where the tie almost blends into the
shirt'' was launched on runways about two years ago, Alberg said.
It became popular at the higher end, thanks to Calvin Klein,
Giorgio Armani and other prominent designers.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the typical middle-America consumer always associated ties
with bright red or yellow; that power-tie look of bold stripes that
contrast to the shirt,'' she said. ''This monochromatic look was
the exact antithesis, so it never caught on at the middle level.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it has a bright future. Men relate to clothes that take the
guesswork out of getting dressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't go wrong even if you wanted to,'' said Elina Kazan,
public relations director of Macy's East. ''It's like gift-giving
101.''
</P>
<P>
   Launched at her Herald Square store as $77.50 boxed sets, the
shirts, about $40 to $45, and ties, about $38 to $42, will be
rolled out at department and specialty shops nationwide mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   The look has legs, said trend analyst Tom Julian of Fallon
advertising agency. ''As I have traveled around the country, (I see
that) it should continue strong as a trend for the fall as well as
the holiday season. The shirt-and-tie market has been quiet through
the end of the '90s, and now the renewed interest is a direct
result from Regis.''
</P>
<P>
   The shirt-and-tie combo just might reinject the $56
billion-a-year menswear industry with a turn away from casual
Friday clothing, Alberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like there is a resurgence in dressing up,'' she
said, noting recent increases in sales of suits and ties.
''Executives are frustrated with how shlumpy the whole casual thing
has gotten. Now there's somewhat of a backlash to all this casual
dressing in the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a rebirth,'' Cannon said. ''Six months ago, people were
saying, 'The tie is dead. The tailored shirt is dead. The suit is
dead.' If Regis has piqued even 100 people's interest in more
sartorial dressing, God love him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cannon, recently named to the International Best-Dressed Poll,
added, ''It's not my favorite look by any means. But I'd much
rather see a man in a tone-on-tone Regis shirt and tie than in a
generic polo shirt and Capri pants and sandals.''

<HEADLINE> Serbs Mark First Loss of Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OBILIC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a bitterly symbolic ceremony, Serb
religious leaders Wednesday commemorated their first loss of Kosovo
centuries ago, little more than a year after Serbs were forced to
accept another defeat in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Pavle, head of the Serb Orthodox Church, preached a
nonpolitical message to the small crowd of priests, nuns and other
Serb faithful gathered at the stone monument marking the loss of
Kosovo to the Turks in 1389.
</P>
<P>
   As black-robed clergy swung incense burners and others lit
beeswax candles in memory of past heroes, Pavle urged the gathering
to pray for ''those who shed their blood for the cross.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, he was more outspoken. In comments alluding
to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the frail, white-bearded
churchman blamed Serb defeats on ''leaders who messed things up
leaving the people to suffer for their mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate comments critical of Milosevic, Father Sava Janjic
said that unlike the battle against the Turks, led by Serb Prince
Lazar, ''in the last Kosovo battle, we didn't have a noble prince
but a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Kosovo belongs to the people who live here,'' he added. ''It
cannot belong to only Serbs or (only) Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   The monument, erected a former battlefield just north of
Pristina where a Serb-led Christian army was defeated by Ottoman
Turk forces more than 600 years ago, also has a more recent place
in Kosovo history.
</P>
<P>
   It was from here in 1989 that Milosevic set loose the Serb
nationalism that he used to climb to power as he unleashed wars
first in Croatia, then in Bosnia and finally in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serb history books define Kosovo as the heart of medieval
Serbia, a land of Slavic culture and religion with few, if any,
ethnic Albanians among them.
</P>
<P>
   Serb dominance began to fade on June 28, 1389, with the Turkish
defeat. But over the centuries, the loss grew into a mythological
triumph of the Serb soul and became the founding legend of Serb
nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   In a fiery speech 11 years ago, Milosevic told hundreds of
thousands of cheering Serbs that their dominance would never be
questioned -- in Kosovo and elsewhere in Yugoslavia. His resulting
popularity allowed him to back Serb rebellions, first in Croatia
and then in Bosnia, even as he cracked down on Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   He lost both those wars, and support for him plummeted. Still --
because of the special place Kosovo holds in the hearts of most
Serbs -- he again managed to rally popular sentiment against
Kosovo's Albanians. The fight was lost this time to NATO, which
last year forced a Kosovo settlement through 78 days of bombing
that made Milosevic pull his forces out and let NATO peacekeepers
in.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands would gather at the tall stone marker to
commemorate the battle against the Turks in past years, when the
Serbs still ruled.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear sign of how things have changed, no more than 100
people came Wednesday -- all under heavy NATO and U.N. police
escort. NATO peacekeepers swept the area for mines the day before
the ceremony and surrounded the monument with armored vehicles and
sandbagged fortifications to prevent possible attack from Kosovo's
new masters -- the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 100,000 Serbs remain in Kosovo, less than half of
their original number. Most others have fled the rash of attacks by
members of the ethnic Albanian majority seeking to avenge the Serb
crackdown ordered by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Dragan Todorovic was in the crowd listening to Milosevic 11
years ago. On Wednesday, his eyes lit up as he reminisced about the
heady emotions the speech aroused.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were all sky high, nothing could stop us then,'' he said.
''Now, our souls are blackened by fear.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Gains 79; Dow Adds 45  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher Wednesday as Wall
Street awaited a decision from the Federal Reserve on interest
rates. Technology names were driving the gains.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was
up 78.97 at 3,937.93.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 44.90 at 10,549.36 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 7.09 at 1,457.64.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed was expected to announce Wednesday afternoon whether it
will raise interest rates for the seventh time since last June.
</P>
<P>
   In recent sessions, signs of a slowdown have convinced many
analysts that the Fed will leave rates unchanged. The Fed began its
long course of rate increases in a bid to cool off inflationary
pressures in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's going to be some recognition that the economy has
decelerated,'' said Michael Strauss, managing director of
Commonfund Asset Management. Strauss was anticipating that the Fed
would leave rates unchanged at this meeting, but would leave the
door open to a possible rate increase in August.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still a very, very cautious Fed,'' he said. ''They have
some room to hold off on a tightening now, but the economic numbers
in July and August could paint a picture of a stronger economy than
they really want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, certain economic gauges have been pointing to continued
growth. Wednesday morning, the Commerce Department said orders to
U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods shot up 6 percent
in May, led by a burst in demand for electronics equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Economists cautioned that the durable-goods data tend to be
volatile, but worried that the report signified that the
manufacturing sector has not cooled off as much as many analysts
had believed.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fed's decision looming, investors continued moving
money from sector to sector. Technology and telecommunications
stocks fared best, with Hewlett-Packard rising $6.188 to $122.813
and JDS Uniphase up $5.125 at $124.125.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom rose $5.063 to $44.75. Salomon Smith Barney analyst
Jack Grubman ''strongly'' reiterated his buy rating and $87 price
target on the stock, despite the Justice Department's threat to
block the company's proposed merger with Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fell $4.75 to $53.625.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 456.51 million
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said end-of-the-quarter buying and selling was
preventing the market from hitting the lull that typically precedes
Fed announcements.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.95 to 513.03.

<HEADLINE> Iran Arrests Pro-reform Lawyers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Police have detained two lawyers who
allegedly got a leader of an Islamic vigilante group to discuss his
links to hard-line Iranian politicians on videotape, state-run
radio reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen Rahami and Shirin Ebadi, both pro-democracy activists,
were arrested because of ''allegations against some officials''
made in a tape recording, Tehran radio quoted the Tehran Justice
Administration as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The radio gave no details, but newspapers have reported for
several weeks that the two lawyers were behind the taped
confessions of Amir Farshad Ebrahimi, a member of a violent
vigilante group controlled by political hard-liners. Vigilante
groups have frequently attacked reformist meetings and
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   In a videotape widely circulated in Tehran, Ebrahimi names
several senior members of the government, all of them hard-liners,
and alleges they used his group to attack their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' arrests and Ebrahimi's confessions are part of the
unfolding power struggle between reformists led by President
Mohammad Khatami and hard-liners who look for support to Iran's
supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In the past two months, the
hard-line-controlled judiciary has closed 19 newspapers and ordered
the detention of several journalists and political activists.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the managing director of one of the closed papers,
Mostafa Izadi, went on trial in Tehran. The prosecution says his
weekly paper, Ava, violated the country's press law.

<HEADLINE> More Arrests in Smuggler Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Dutch police said Wednesday they
have arrested five more men and are seeking another, allegedly part
of a ring that tried to smuggle 58 Chinese immigrants into Britain
inside a sealed truck, where they suffocated to death.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch police claimed ''remarkable progress'' in their
investigation, saying they had traced the rented warehouse where
the immigrants were put into the large truck for the ill-fated
ferry trip across the English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The gruesome discovery of the 58 corpses at the English port of
Dover 10 days ago threw light on the huge illicit trafficking of
people, mostly from Asia to western Europe, which United Nations
officials described as the world's fastest growing international
crime. Two migrants survived the journey.
</P>
<P>
   The five new arrests bring the number of suspects in Dutch
custody to seven. Another suspect ''is still on the run,'' the
prosecutor's office said in a statement. Another man was detained
and released after several days, it said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dutch police have managed to get a pretty clear picture of
the organization and of the individuals that have been organizing
the transport,'' the office's Unit of Illegal Human Trafficking
said.
</P>
<P>
   All the suspects were men from the Rotterdam area, it said.
</P>
<P>
   It said the ''front man'' for the operation was Arie van der
Spek, who registered the trucking company that carried the Chinese
to their deaths and whose arrest was one of two previously
announced.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, British police were holding the driver of the
truck, and two ethnic Chinese allegedly linked to the smuggling
ring.
</P>
<P>
   A warehouse in Waalhaven, a part of the Rotterdam harbor, was
identified as the assembly point for the immigrants. They were
brought there in small vans, then loaded onto a truck bought by Van
der Spek's company and driven to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge,
from where they were ferried to Dover.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Drug Proposals Comparison  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   House Republicans and the Clinton administration,
joined by
congressional Democrats, are pushing competing proposals to add
prescription drug coverage to Medicare.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under both plans, participation by senior citizens would be
optional. The Republican legislation would make benefits available
starting in 2003, as would congressional Democrats. Clinton is
calling for an earlier start, in 2002. Republicans say the cost to
the government of their plan would be $155 billion over 10 years;
Democrats have budgeted $253 billion.
</P>
<P>
   GOP PLAN:
</P>
<P>
   Medicare would oversee enrollment of senior citizens in
government-subsidized and approved prescription drug plans sold by
private insurance companies. HMOs participating in Medicare would
also have to offer drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket charges could
vary, but benefits would have to be at least as generous as under a
standard policy, set by law.
</P>
<P>
   The standard policy includes:
</P>
<P>
   -- Monthly premiums around $35 to $40.
</P>
<P>
   -- $250 annual deductible.
</P>
<P>
   -- 50 percent co-payments for each prescription.
</P>
<P>
   -- An end to coverage for the year at $2,100 in total drug
spending after deductible. That means insurance would pay an annual
maximum of $1,050 in prescription costs. However, if out-of-pocket
spending by a beneficiary for one year tops $6,000, insurance kicks
back in with so-called catastrophic coverage, paying all costs for
the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Senior citizens with annual incomes below 135 percent of the
federal poverty level -- about $11,200 for an individual and $15,200
for a couple -- would not have to pay monthly premiums or
deductibles and their co-payments would be lower, around $2 to $5
per prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Those with incomes between 135 percent and 150 percent of
poverty -- about $12,600 for an individual and $16,900 for a couple
-- would have their monthly premiums subsidized on a sliding scale.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS' PLAN:
</P>
<P>
   Medicare would operate a standard prescription drug benefit, the
same for everyone, with some help from benefit management companies
that many private health plans use. HMOs participating in Medicare
would have to offer the same benefit. It would have:
</P>
<P>
   -- Monthly premiums starting at $25 and gradually rising to $50
over several years.
</P>
<P>
   -- No deductible.
</P>
<P>
   -- 50 percent co-payments for each prescription.
</P>
<P>
   -- An end to coverage for the year at $2,000 in total drug
spending, gradually rising to $5,000 as premiums increase. That
means Medicare would pay an annual maximum of $1,000 in
prescription costs at first, rising to $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   -- Catastrophic coverage paying all costs would kick in after
$4,000 in annual out-of-pocket spending by a beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   Senior citizens with incomes below 135 percent of poverty would
not have to pay monthly premiums, deductibles or co-payments. Those
with incomes between 135 percent and 150 percent of poverty would
have their monthly premiums subsidized on a sliding scale.

<HEADLINE> Greek Church Targets ID Cards  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK QUINN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- In a decision blurring the line between
faith and politics, Greece's Orthodox Church said Wednesday it will
begin a petition drive to force the government to include religion
on national identity cards.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide campaign to collect signatures, which the church
has dubbed an ''informal referendum,'' marks the first time in its
150-year history that the Greek church has so openly challenged the
authority of a government to legislate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Holy Synod, in accordance with the expectations of its
faithful children and to fulfill its promises for the most broad
popular expression, has decided to hold an informal referendum of
religious conscience,'' said church spokesman Metropolitan
Kallinikos.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Costas Simitis' Socialist government said the church's
decision could endanger the unity of the Greek people. He has said
the entry runs counter to Greece's efforts to become a modern
European country and violates 1997 privacy protection legislation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said the government will not repeal its decision to
abolish a religion entry on the ID cards all Greeks are required to
carry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone takes responsibility for their actions, much more in
view of procedures that could result in the division of Greek
society,'' government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
</P>
<P>
   He called on the church to respect the constitutional separation
of authority and reminded clerics that religious groups were not
supposed to meddle in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, academics and critics say the church crusade has
essentially transformed the religious group headed by Archbishop
Christodoulos into a political party.
</P>
<P>
   Christodoulos has also angered politicians and academics by
saying that those opposed to includin greligion on ID cards
''belong to the forces of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an open challenge to our democratic system,'' said
Dimitris Papadimoulis, a deputy with the left coalition party.
</P>
<P>
   According to a decision by the Holy Synod, the church's ruling
body, the petition drive will begin this fall and will be
restricted to ''responsible adults.''
</P>
<P>
   The church claims it can collect nearly 5 million signatures in
this country with a population of 10.5 million. Greece has an aging
population, and according to the National Statistical Service there
are 8.28 million men and women in the country over age 15.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Christodoulos' senior clerics have expressed the hope
that the government will collapse because of the campaign and a
series of mass rallies.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued Tuesday by the European Commission on Racism and
Intolerance called on Greece to remove the religion entry ''in
order to limit covert discrimination against members of
non-Orthodox religions, who may in some cases be considered less
Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   Many church leaders are deeply suspicious of the modernization
drive. They see it as a threat to the Christian Orthodox character
of the nation and possibly the stirrings of an eventual separation
of church and state in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   About 97 percent of Greece's native-born population is baptized
into the Orthodox Church, which sees itself as the true guardian of
Greek identity and traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox leaders have traditionally enjoyed deep respect as
keepers of an essential element of the Greek ethnic identity during
four centuries of Muslim Ottoman rule. The church helped fan the
1821 independence revolt and itself became independent from the
Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul, Turkey, in 1850.
</P>
<P>
   Christodoulos has repeatedly said Greece owes its independence
to the church.

<HEADLINE> Chronology of Abortion Decisions  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A chronology of some of the Supreme Court's major
decisions on
abortion:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Jan. 22, 1973. In Roe v. Wade, the court for the first time
legalized abortion nationwide. The court based its 7-2 ruling on a
woman's constitutional right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   --Jan. 22, 1973. In Doe v. Bolton, the court struck down by a 7-2
vote restrictions on facilities that could be used to perform
abortions. The decision gave rise to a new kind of medical
facility, the abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   --July 1, 1976. In Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, the court, by
a 6-3 vote, said states cannot give husbands veto power over their
pregnant wives' decision to abort their pregnancies. By a 5-4 vote,
the court said parents of minor, unwed girls cannot be given an
absolute veto over abortions.
</P>
<P>
   --Jan. 9, 1979. In Colautti v. Franklin, reached by a 6-3 vote,
the court reaffirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion
in determining the timing of ''fetal viability'' -- when a fetus can
live outside the mother's womb. The justices said states may seek
to protect a fetus that has reached viability, but the
determination is up to doctors, not courts or legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   --June 15, 1983. In three decisions led by one called City of
Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, the court said, 6-3,
that states and local communities may not require all abortions
beyond the first trimester be performed in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   --June 11, 1986. In Thornburgh v. American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the court struck down, 5-4,
Pennsylvania abortion regulations that would have required doctors
to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and about
available medical assistance benefits for prenatal care and
childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   --July 3, 1989. In a series of split votes in Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services, the court provided states with new
authority to limit a woman's right to abortion but stopped short of
reversing its 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The justices allowed Missouri to restrict the use of public
money, medical personnel or facilities in performing abortion
procedures. Also upheld was a requirement that doctors determine,
when possible, whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is capable of
surviving outside the womb, by testing lung capacity and conducting
other tests.
</P>
<P>
   --June 29, 1992. In its most important abortion ruling since
1973, the court voted 5-4 to uphold the core of its Roe v. Wade
decision and ban states from outlawing most abortions. But, by a
7-2 vote, the court said states may raise new hurdles for women
seeking to end their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey abandoned
the trimester-by-trimester approach of its 1973 ruling and adopted
a new test -- abortion regulations will not be allowed if they
represent an ''undue burden'' on women's constitutional right.
</P>
<P>
   --June 28, 2000. In Stenberg v. Carhart, the court voted 5-4 to
strike down Nebraska's ''partial-birth'' abortion law because it
imposed an ''undue burden'' on women's right to end their
pregnancies. The court said the law, similar to those in 29 other
states, lacked an exemption to preserve women's health and could
have been used to ban more than one abortion method.

<HEADLINE> Everglades Plan Gets Committee OK  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A $1.4 billion plan to restore the Florida
Everglades cleared a Senate committee Wednesday as lawmakers pushed
to save a ''world treasure for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure is the first installment on an overall restoration
plan estimated to cost $7.8 billion over 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a historic act of preservation and restoration,'' Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said shortly before the vote by the
Environment and Public Works Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Added Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., ''We are going to save this world
treasure for future generations. We need to move forward
expeditiously.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone dissenter to the measure was Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H. and the committee's chairman had said
passing an Everglades measure was his ''top priority for the
committee this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's plan seeks to save the one-time
''River of Grass'' which stretches more than 100 miles across South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, as governments tried to guard against flooding
and ensure adequate water supplies, much-needed water was diverted
from the Everglades. As a result, there is not enough water for the
environment, causing disastrous effects for an ecosystem once
filled with panthers, alligators and flocks of birds.
</P>
<P>
   The plan aims to capture fresh water and deliver it when and
where it is needed most in the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   It would eliminate some 240 miles of levees and canals as well
as construct aboveground reservoirs, underground aquifers and
develop new wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush recently signed into law Florida's
contribution of $2 billion over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Sparks, a spokesman with the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection, said the federal government and the state
were ''on the way to a long-term marriage in our efforts to
undertake the greatest restoration project this country has ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some senators expressed concern the measure committed too
much federal involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This project is going to be a giant sucking machine,'' said
Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, attempted unsuccessfully to stall
plans to convert the Homestead Air Force Base into a regional
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich said spending billions on Everglades restoration while
allowing commercial flights to land and take off over the area
seemed contradictory.

<HEADLINE> Refugees Rush To English Port City  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLINE RNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, England (AP) -- Locals call it ''Asylum Alley'' --
Folkestone Road's mile-long stretch of shabby bed-and-breakfast
motels that cater to Britain's most desperate newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20,000 illegal immigrants passed through here in 1999.
Another 1,000 have taken up full-time residence, most young men
hoping to gain asylum from the troubled hot spots of Afghanistan,
Somalia, Iraq or Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For their Folkestone Road neighbors -- many low-income retirees
and World War II veterans who remember a city center pummeled by
German bombs -- the white cliffs of Dover may as well be under siege
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are standing around all day and all of us old-age
pensioners are paying for them,'' said Reginald Power, 70, a
retired engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Dover's refugee problem was brought to the world's attention
last week when port authorities discovered the bodies of 58 Chinese
migrants who suffocated in the back of an airtight truck during a
five-hour ferry crossing from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   But the grisly June 20 discovery simply hardened the resolve of
many who believe Britain's immigration policies and border
enforcement policies are too lax, resulting in a nationwide backlog
of about 100,000 asylum requests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The local people, instead of being sympathetic, were saying
'Tough. Dover's had enough,''' said resident Sheila Farrell.
</P>
<P>
   Added Paul Watkins, a Conservative Party representative on the
Dover district council, ''People were sympathetic, but they see the
port as a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dover council spent $16.5 million in 1999 providing housing
and other services to asylum-seekers, many of whom used this
southeast England city as a pit stop before moving to London and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Home Office, which oversees asylum issues, reimbursed
the city, but the local authority complained of a $600,000
shortfall. As a result, this year's tax bill was hiked an average
$225 per household, leaving residents fuming.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are fed up to the teeth here in Dover,'' said Farrell, who
persuaded 3,000 of the city's 33,000 residents to sign an anti-tax
petition in May. ''We feel we've been dumped on from a great
height.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortified by its craggy, steep cliffs and military might, Dover
has played a strategic role in securing Britain's coastline since
the 11th century, when it was one of five key defense ports.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the town again proved itself by offering a
base for Britain's Royal Navy. Dover Castle, built by the Normans
in 1168, was the headquarters for Operation Dynamo, the British
evacuation of more than 300,000 Allied troops during Germany's 1940
invasion of Dunkirk, France.
</P>
<P>
   But today, once-proud Dover has morphed into a dowdy port city
favored by economic migrants and smugglers who ferry tobacco and
alcohol across the Channel from Calais, France.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the council wrote to Immigration Minister Barbara
Roche warning that the coastal city was becoming a ''tinderbox''
for racially motivated violence. Two weeks later, 11 people were
stabbed during two nights of violence between refugees and local
youngsters at a fair. An 13-year-old girl needed 46 stitches on her
arm and back.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't go out. Everyone shouts at you all the time and calls
you an asylum-seeker,'' said Gazmend Hoti, a 20-year-old Kosovo
refugee who was smuggled into Dover in a truck and discovered by
customs officials last year. ''Even if you go into the shops to buy
something, they look at you like you are an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Caseman, chairman of the Dover-based Kent Refugee Action
Network, said many legitimate asylum-seekers are afraid to speak
out, fearing they, too, will become targets.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is ridiculous to be paranoid about immigrants,'' said
Caseman. ''We would say to the government: You have to stop
listening to these racist arguments and recognize that we need
migrant workers to do the work that the British people refuse to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Dover may get some relief from the Labor Party government's new
Immigration and Asylum Act, which took effect in April, and shifts
the burden of housing and financing new arrivals from local
councils to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also gives the government the power to force
other local councils to accept their share of refugee claimants to
alleviate the pressure on port towns.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,800 new immigrant arrivals and their families have been
transported out of Dover for resettlement since April, said Annie
Leger, spokesman for Dover's Migrant Helpline, which is funded by
the Home Office.
</P>
<P>
   But residents like Farrell and Power say they won't be satisfied
until the government takes a harder line by withdrawing welfare
benefits for asylum-seekers and coordinating border patrols with
the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a silly little country of 60 million people,'' Power
said. ''We can't take them, too.''

<HEADLINE> BC-CT--Murder in Greenwich, 3rd Ld-Writethru,600  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other members
of his extended family turned out Wednesday to support Michael
Skakel, accused of beating a Greenwich teen-ager to death in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's father, Rushton Skakel Sr., is a brother of Ethel
Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. Robert Jr. and Skakel
are cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel is charged in juvenile court with beating Martha Moxley
to death on Oct. 30, 1975. Both he and Moxley were 15 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing that began last week and continued Wednesday will
determine whether there is enough evidence to proceed with the case
against Skakel, and whether he should be tried as a juvenile or as
an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Jr. said Wednesday that he and Mrs. Kennedy want to
support Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a horrible, unspeakable tragedy, but it only compounds
it to blame Michael Skakel, who is innocent,'' Kennedy said. He
said Mrs. Kennedy was planning to attend Wednesday's court session
but had to cancel at the last minute because of a family
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Michael Sherman began presenting his case
Wednesday, calling a former student at the Elan School, a
residential drug and alcohol treatment center in Maine which Skakel
attended as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   Last week two former students at the school testified that
Skakel had confessed to them that he killed Moxley, who was
bludgeoned with a golf club. The 6-iron used in the murder was
traced to a set owned by the Skakels.
</P>
<P>
   One student, John Higgins, said Skakel confessed to him one
night 20 years ago during an erratic, tearful conversation. But
Higgins admitted he lied to investigators when they initially
questioned him about the alleged confession. He also admitted
asking about a $50,000 reward.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Coleman, another former Elan student, said Skakel told
him he drove Moxley's skull in with a golf club and declared: ''I'm
gonna get away with murder. I'm a Kennedy.'' Coleman went on to
describe his own life - filled with alcoholism, drug addiction, a
criminal record, homelessness, and living under a bridge at times.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, former student Alice Dunn said she never heard
Skakel admit to killing Moxley, even while undergoing therapy that
involved being pummeled in a boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   ''He denied vehemently, over and over again, 'No, no, no, no!'''
Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel was subjected to the treatment after he ran away from
Elan, Dunn testified. The ring was used to break down students'
resistance and force them to confront the root cause of their
emotional problems, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear from the testimony whether school employees or
other students struck the patients in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn cast doubt on Higgins, saying he had ''a terrible
reputation for truthfulness'' and that she doubted Skakel would
confide in him.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she was present during a ''primal scream'' therapy
session and disputed allegations by Coleman that Skakel confessed
during the session.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict,
Dunn admitted telling the one-judge grand jury investigating the
case that Skakel had made statements indicating he was involved in
Moxley's death.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict said her grand jury testimony included a recollection
that Skakel said, ''I don't know if I did it myself, or my
brother.''
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, she said, Skakel told her that ''as far as
he was concerned, he might have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   But she insisted that Skakel never confessed to the crime to her
and that she never heard of a confession while she was at the
school.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes Marriage Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican bill cutting income taxes by $248
billion over 10 years for all married couples, including the 25
million who now pay more than they would if single, was approved
Wednesday by the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   GOP sponsors described the measure, more expansive than a $182
billion version passed by the House, as the centerpiece of their
election-year tax cut strategy. Republican leaders intend to bring
the bill to the Senate floor in July.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill is fair, this bill is responsible and this bill is
pro-family,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the
Finance Committee. ''It is time that we divorce the marriage
penalty from the tax code once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   After previously issuing veto threats, President Clinton now
says the budget surplus is projected to be large enough that he
could sign the bill into law -- but only if Congress also sends him
an acceptable Medicare prescription drug bill. Republicans are
inviting a confrontation with the White House if they insist on
sending the president the tax cut as a stand-alone bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be better if we could all agree on a marriage penalty
bill and prescription drugs,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. ''I'm
not sure it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The House was debating a GOP prescription drug measure
Wednesday. Roth said he intended to bring a bipartisan bill before
his committee in July.
</P>
<P>
   The tax bill would gradually enlarge the 15 percent and 28
percent income tax brackets between 2002 and 2007 for married
couples and raise their standard deduction in 2001 so that it is
equal to twice that of single filers.
</P>
<P>
   This would eliminate a disparity in the tax code in which about
25 million two-earner married couples pay higher income taxes than
if they remained single. But it would also give a big tax cut to
millions of other married couples in which one spouse earns most of
the family income that do not pay the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill masquerades as marriage penalty relief,'' said Sen.
Richard Bryan, D-Nev. ''It is certainly much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they'd gladly suffer criticism for giving all
married taxpayers a tax cut, penalized or not.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're for love, and we're for marriage, and this bill gives us
more of both,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would increase by $2,500 the limit for
couples who claim the earned income tax credit and permanently
ensure that taxpayers who claim personal credits such as the $500
per child tax credit do not get snared by the complex alternative
minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they, too, favor eliminating the marriage penalty
tax and pushed an alternative sponsored by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., that would give married couples the option of
filing as two single people on the same return. But that was
rejected on an 11-9 vote by the Finance Committee, which later
approved the GOP bill 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is identical to a measure approved this spring by the
Finance Committee, but blocked on the Senate floor by Democrats'
delaying tactics. This time, the measure was approved under special
budget rules that limit debate and prevent a filibuster that would
otherwise require 60 votes to break.

<HEADLINE> Diseases Said Biggest World Disaster  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Earthquakes and other natural disasters may have
captured donations and headlines, but preventable diseases killed
far more people -- 13 million people in 1999, according to a report
published Wednesday by the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 150 million people have died from AIDS,
tuberculosis and malaria alone since 1945, compared to 23 million
in wars, said the World Disasters Report issued by the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need only to look at the death toll from infectious disease
to see the results of this dangerous trend. We need to make
treating infectious disease a priority,'' Didier Cherpitel, the
federation's secretary general, said at a press conference
releasing the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 160 times more people died from AIDS, malaria,
respiratory diseases and diarrhea than were killed by natural
disasters, including massive earthquakes in Turkey, floods in
Venezuela and cyclones in India, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The escalation of AIDS infections in Africa was singled out as
one of the key areas of concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once a disease like AIDS reaches the kind of proportions we
see in sub-Saharan Africa it is no longer a disease, it is a
disaster,'' said Peter Walker, director of disaster policy for the
federation. ''Such a widespread disease destroys the work force and
shatters the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 23 million people in the region are estimated to have
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS -- 70 percent of the global total,
the report said. Across the world, 300 people now die hourly from
AIDS, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Government budget cuts were partly to blame for the high
numbers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a government has to cut back on spending, where does it
cut back? Inevitably on health care and education,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that in 1998, the level of international
emergency aid rose for the first time in four years, but funding
for primary health care continued to drop. Health funding for
developing nations from the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development sank to the lowest levels since 1991, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Public expenditure on health in poor countries averages just 1
percent of gross domestic product, compared to 6 percent in rich
countries, the report said. As a result, diseases that once were
under control are reappearing, it said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Red Cross does not track the rise of preventable
diseases on a year-to-year basis, figures for diseases such as
malaria showed worrying trends, the federation said.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria -- which kills 2.6 million people a year, 70 percent of
them children -- is appearing in countries such as Azerbaijan and
Tajikistan. North Korea has reported 40,000 new cases of
tuberculosis this year. And Russian cases of syphilis have
increased 40-fold since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said changing people's behavior saves more lives than
spending money on expensive institutions and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Impressive real results come from widespread community health
programs to vaccinate children against preventable disease and
encouraging people to protect themselves from malaria by using
treated bed nets or from AIDS by using condoms,'' it said.

<HEADLINE> Reactions to Court's Abortion Vote  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Reactions to Wednesday's 5-4 Supreme Court ruling
striking down
Nebraska's law banning so-called ''partial-birth'' abortions:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''There has never been a greater need to speak out against the
barbaric procedure of 'partial-birth' abortion.'' -- American Center
for Law and Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''While it looks like a victory, this is a beginning -- not the
end. Anti-choice state legislatures and governors across the
country will use this ruling as a blueprint for drafting new bans
on abortion procedures -- laws which will soon be tested by the
Supreme Court once again.'' -- Planned Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Ten, 15 or 20 years from now, today's Supreme Court decision
will be cited to justify the selective termination of infants,
toddlers, grandparents and the disabled.'' -- American Life League.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''This so-called 'partial-birth' abortion ban was a direct
assault on Roe v. Wade and the Supreme Court was right to reject
it. Americans support Roe because they don't want the government or
politicians interfering in this most private and personal
decision.'' -- National Women's Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to the day when a Republican president will
replace retiring liberals with justices who will truthfully
interpret the Constitution rather than impose their activist views
against states and the people.'' Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma,
chairman of the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, women's health prevailed over extremism. By reaffirming
Roe v. Wade, the court has upheld a woman's basic constitutional
right to make private, personal decisions.'' Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''A procedure in which a child is intentionally killed in the
birth canal can only be described as infanticide. It is astounding
that the court would allow a doctor to pull a defenseless child
from its mother's womb, pierce its skull and suck out its brain.''
-- Council on American-Islamic Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great day for American women. 'Partial-birth'
abortion laws do not primarily involve late-term abortions, and the
U.S. Supreme Court has unmasked the false propaganda effort of the
anti-choice movement as being unconstitutional and inconsistent
with the fundamental liberty interests of women.'' -- Former New
York State Attorney General Bob Abrams, one of a group of attorneys
who filed a friend-of-the-court brief.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''The Supreme Court's decision today, in Stenberg v. Carhart, to
strike down the state of Nebraska's ban on 'partial-birth'
abortions represents a stunning rejection of the role of medicine
and science in helping to decide our nation's abortion policies.''
-- Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''The court's decision in Stenberg v. Carhart exposed these bans
for what they are: extreme and deceptive attempts to outlaw
abortion, even early in pregnancy, that jeopardize women's health.
The court's decision will have the domino effect of rendering
similar bans passed in over 30 states and Congress unconstitutional
or unenforceable.''-- Center for Reproductive Law and Policy.

<HEADLINE> Ed workers still sorting out summer-school confusion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Board of Education workers were faced with the
daunting task Wednesday of figuring out which children, and how
many, were erroneously told they would have to go to summer school.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second year in a row that some students were wrongly
told they would have to attend summer school, but board spokeswoman
Pam McDonnell said the error was made for a different reason this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 8,600 city elementary and middle school
students were told to attend summer school or were held back
because a testing company incorrectly evaluated their grades.
</P>
<P>
   This year, McDonnel said, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy did
not receive properly updated lists of which students were failing
to meet the qualifications for promotion to the next grade and
would therefore have to attend summer school.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not get the most updated data'' from the various city
school districts, she said. ''Parents appeal. Kids take tests and
pass them. We thought we had reached a point where numbers were no
longer fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the incorrect lists, McDonnell said, Levy ''sent
letters to those students - encouraging letters - saying, 'You're
getting a second chance,'' said McDonnell. Translation: You have to
go to summer school.
</P>
<P>
   She said the districts had compiled the lists based on several
criteria. To be moved ahead, students must have at least a 90
percent attendance rate, have their classwork up to speed and pass
standardized tests. She did not know the weight each criterion was
given.
</P>
<P>
   How outdated was the data? How many letters were sent to
students and which were in error? ''We don't have a clue,'' said
McDonnell. ''We're going district by district, school by school,
one by one by one'' to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   School workers were up against the clock to figure out which
letters were sent in error: Summer school begins July 5.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 79; Nasdaq Rises 74  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher Wednesday as Wall
Street awaited a decision from the Federal Reserve on interest
rates. Technology names were driving the gains.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the Fed was expected to announce its decision,
the Nasdaq composite index was up 74.37 at 3,932.33.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 78.84 at 10,583.30 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 8.82 at 1,459.37.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed was expected to announce Wednesday afternoon whether it
will raise interest rates for the seventh time since last June.
</P>
<P>
   In recent sessions, signs of a slowdown have convinced many
analysts that the Fed will leave rates unchanged. The Fed began its
long course of rate increases in a bid to cool off inflationary
pressures in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's going to be some recognition that the economy has
decelerated,'' said Michael Strauss, managing director of
Commonfund Asset Management. Strauss was anticipating that the Fed
would leave rates unchanged at this meeting, but would leave the
door open to a possible rate increase in August.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still a very, very cautious Fed,'' he said. ''They have
some room to hold off on a tightening now, but the economic numbers
in July and August could paint a picture of a stronger economy than
they really want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, certain economic gauges have been pointing to continued
growth. Wednesday morning, the Commerce Department said orders to
U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods shot up 6 percent
in May, led by a burst in demand for electronics equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Economists cautioned that the durable-goods data tend to be
volatile, but worried that the report signified that the
manufacturing sector has not cooled off as much as many analysts
had believed.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fed's decision looming, investors continued moving
money from sector to sector. Technology and telecommunications
stocks fared best, with Hewlett-Packard rising $6.188 to $122.813
and JDS Uniphase up $5.125 at $124.125.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom rose $5.063 to $44.75. Salomon Smith Barney analyst
Jack Grubman ''strongly'' reiterated his buy rating and $87 price
target on the stock, despite the Justice Department's threat to
block the company's proposed merger with Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fell $4.75 to $53.625.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was running ahead of
Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said end-of-the-quarter buying and selling was
preventing the market from hitting the lull that typically precedes
Fed announcements.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.95 to 513.03.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Would Sign Cuba Food Bill  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday he would sign
a bill to allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba if he can be
convinced it would work. But he said he would not now go further to
normalize U.S. relations with Fidel Castro's Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   He said he supports the current sanctions law. ''I don't believe
that we can change the law until there is a bipartisan majority
which believes that there has been some effort on the part of the
Cuban government to reach out to us as well,'' Clinton told a White
House news conference.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans have agreed to a bill that would permit the
sale of food and medicine to Cuba in the most substantial easing of
trade sanctions in 40 years. Clinton said he supports that aim.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ''I have some concerns'' about the bill,
questioning whether it really would lead to increased sales to Cuba
and whether it would fit with other U.S. foreign policy objectives.
The president said it may include travel restrictions that would
impede the administration's person-to-person openings to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Clinton said it is not time to ease the broader
anti-Castro sanctions reinforced after Cuban fighter jets shot down
unarmed American protesters flying off Cuba's coast in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his news conference with a lecture to Congress
seeking action on his legislative program, particularly the
Democractic plan for prescription drug benefits for senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of that coverage is ''a fatal flaw'' in American health
care, he said, and the Republicans would not cure it.
</P>
<P>
   He said the GOP bill awaiting House approval ''amounts to an
empty promise,'' benefitting drug makers, not the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeated his offer to trade the Democratic version of
government financed prescription drug coverage for a tax bill
sought by Republicans to end the marriage penalty on two-job
couples.
</P>
<P>
   He also urged action on a patients' bill of rights, gun control
legislation, a hate crimes bill, and a Senate vote to complete
approval of the bill to normalize trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''With less than 35 days left in the legislative year, time is
running out for Congress,'' he said, demanding an end to
legislative logjams.
</P>
<P>
   While Secretary of Madeleine Albright, during a trip to
Jerusalem, was finding prospects dimming for a Middle East summit
this summer in the United States, Clinton urged Israelis and
Palestinians to agree to face-to-face negotiations quickly. He said
the issues they are seeking to resolve are only going to become
more difficult with the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not believe that they can resolve the final, most
difficult issues without having the leaders get together in some
isolated setting and make the last, tough decisions, or decide not
to make them,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> 50 Years Ago, Greatest Soccer Upset  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The score flashed across the news wires: England
0, United States 1. Newspaper editors throughout Britain
immediately assumed it was an error, and the actual score was
England 10, United States 1.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the many legends that grew from the World Cup
game in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, on June 29, 1950. And no, it was
not a mistake. It was, instead, the greatest upset in World Cup
history.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's 50th anniversary has rekindled memories of a game
that has taken on epic proportions in the soccer world.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the stories about the match, none is more indicative of
its mythical nature than Charlie Colombo's late-game tackle of
England's Stanley Mortensen.
</P>
<P>
   In about the 80th minute, with England repeatedly pushing
forward looking for the tying goal, Mortensen broke free of Colombo
and was bearing down on U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then Charlie takes a headlong dive and hits him at the
knees,'' U.S. right back Harry Keough recalled. ''Most (American)
football guys don't tackle that well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something he should have been thrown out of the game
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombo grabbed Mortensen just outside the penalty area, but by
the time they stopped tumbling, they were on top of the penalty
spot. Referee Generoso Dattilo immediately whistled a foul and a
free kick, but instead of ejecting Colombo, the Italian ref
supposedly came up to him wagging his finger, saying ''Buono, buono
(Good, good)!''
</P>
<P>
   ''Charlie claimed that to his dying day,'' Keough said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to England's frustration, on the ensuing free kick, Billy
Mullen bounced a header downward that got behind Borghi. But Borghi
reached back and palmed it away for Keough to clear.
</P>
<P>
   England claimed the ball crossed the line, but Dattilo said no.
</P>
<P>
   That was England's last gasp, to the delight of about 20,000
fans at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer the game went on, the more the crowd was on our
side,'' said Walter Bahr, the U.S. left halfback. ''I'm sure they
were expecting a slaughter. I thought a three- or four-goal loss
would have been respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   Borghi was expecting an even bigger defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought when we did score a goal, the roof would cave in and
they would score like crazy,'' he said. ''I was hoping to keep them
to six or seven goals.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a disastrous day for English sports, with the national
cricket team routed by the West Indies. As the Daily Herald wrote
in its front-page headline: ''England lose by 1 goal and 326
runs.'' And another headline read, ''England Fall to U.S.
Amateurs.''
</P>
<P>
   By the strictest definition, the Americans weren't amateurs.
Bahr was getting all of $25 a game playing with the Philadelphia
Nationals at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But Bahr also was a school teacher; Joe Gaetjens a dishwasher;
Keough a postman; Borghi was driving a hearse; and Gino Pariani was
working the line at Continental Can Company.
</P>
<P>
   The English lineup had Alf Ramsey and Tom Finney, both of whom
would go on to be knighted for their soccer exploits.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the result was met with little fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times ran a story on the fourth page of its sports
section, behind baseball, Wimbledon, a track meet between the
United States and Finland in Helsinki, and a local women's amateur
golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Only one American reporter traveled with the U.S. team to the
World Cup -- Denton McSkimming of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, who
was there on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   There was some controversy about the makeup of the U.S. squad.
Three players weren't even Americans: Gaetjens was from Haiti, Joe
Maca from Belgium and Eddie McIlvenny from Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Eligibility rules were looser in those days and the U.S. Soccer
Football Association used players who merely had declared their
intention to become citizens. Later in 1950, FIFA would absolve the
USSFA of any wrongdoing. Maca was the only one of the three who
later became a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans didn't exactly outplay the English, who were
plagued by poor finishing. Shots went high, wide and off the
crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   The goal by Gaetjens wasn't particularly artistic, either.
</P>
<P>
   ''The right wing (Bahr) came down, moved inside and took more of
a shot than a center,'' recalled England fullback Laurie Hughes.
''And the ball struck (Gaetjens) on the side of the head and ended
up in the top corner of the net. I consider that a fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Borghi remembers is being carried off the field by the
locals.
</P>
<P>
   ''They carried me to the clubhouse,'' Borghi says. ''They picked
up Gaetjens, they picked up John Souza and carried him off.
</P>
<P>
   ''People came at us and I didn't know if they were mad at me or
what.''
</P>
<P>
   England's players for the most part conceded they were beaten
fairly, although some groused about the result.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pitch wasn't very good and the dressing rooms were bad,''
halfback Billy Wright told the London Daily Mail in 1993. ''But we
lost, history was made and they will never let us forget it.''

<HEADLINE> Chicken Movie Creates Stir  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Babe the talking pig led some people to swear
off pork. Might chattering chickens do the same for poultry, even
though the hens are made of clay?
</P>
<P>
   The new animated movie ''Chicken Run'' depicts an endearing
gaggle of fowl trying to escape stalag-like conditions on a poultry
farm.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King, which has a toy promotion pegged to the movie, has
had some fun running ads urging, ''Save a chicken, eat a Whopper.''
The fast-food chain also hired people to wear chicken suits and
stage mock poultry protests at some of its restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Others take it more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seen 'Chicken Run?''' asks a link on the Web site of the
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which encourages
meat-free diets. ''Ready to switch to a vegetarian diet?''
</P>
<P>
   The link leads to a question-and-answer page about fat content,
food poisoning and other health issues. Neal Barnard, the group's
president, said he expects people will so sympathize with the
penned hens in ''Chicken Run'' that they will think twice about
eating poultry.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people run from the theater screaming for a veggie burger,
I'd be thrilled,'' said Bernard, a vegetarian. ''It's what happened
with 'Babe.' I can't tell you how many people saw that movie and
happened to sit down to a pork chop and were so overcome with
guilt, they said, 'Make mine the veggie platter, please.'''
</P>
<P>
   The National Chicken Council, a trade group for poultry
processors, is unconcerned, said spokesman Richard Lobb.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our feeling is this is just a movie, and people are going to
take it as just a movie,'' Lobb said. ''Chicken is the most popular
food at the center of the plate, and we think it will stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, in the 1995 ''Babe,'' the title character was played by
a real pig. The movie became a rallying point for vegetarian and
animal-rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   John Wagner of Los Angeles said he had no thoughts about
avoiding chicken after catching ''Chicken Run.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a cartoon,'' Wagner said, adding that the movie actually
made him a bit peckish because the hens ''looked like nice, plump
little suckers.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-year-old Vincent Joseph came out of ''Chicken Run'' at a
Hollywood theater with no qualms about eating a drumstick. When his
mother, Claire Joseph, asked if he wanted chicken for dinner,
Vincent told her, ''Uh-huh.''
</P>
<P>
   His twin sister, Maddie, though, announced, ''I want to eat
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire Joseph said the movie did make her reconsider whether she
wanted to eat chicken. ''Chicken farms are terribly brutal,'' she
said. ''They're very much like Nazi concentration camps.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its tongue-in-cheek ads, Burger King expects no actual
backlash against poultry consumption. ''We don't expect any
protests from the chicken farmers of America,'' said Richard
Taylor, Burger King vice president of marketing.

<HEADLINE> West Bank Water Taps Are Drying Up  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   YATTA, West Bank (AP) -- It's laundry day, and Fatma Zetad drags
buckets of water from a well to wash clothing for her seven
children.
</P>
<P>
   Her tap has been dry for a month, the result of a regional water
shortage caused by drought, rapid population growth and reckless
overuse. Palestinians have felt the crisis more acutely than their
neighbors -- Israel allots them less than one-third the amount of
water pumped to Israeli households.
</P>
<P>
   Water knows no political boundaries, but allocating it is one of
the difficult issues negotiators are trying to resolve in a final
Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty that will divide the land but
mandate sharing the water.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians, control over water sources in the West Bank,
where they plan to establish a state, would alleviate shortages in
hard-hit places like Yatta.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the southern West Bank town of 45,000 are piped
water once a month for a day or two on a rotating basis. The rest
of the time, they fill up from commercial tanks at $4 per 35 cubic
feet or draw water from local wells -- sweaty, time-consuming work
done mostly by women.
</P>
<P>
   Children are washed infrequently in basins.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel doesn't run water from the main pipes, and we don't
have enough money to buy water,'' Zetad, 36, said Wednesday,
pointing to her dry tap. She counts herself lucky -- she has access
to a nearby well that has not gone dry, and she can meet her
family's basic needs by lugging home a five-gallon bucket a dozen
times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Yatta Mayor Khalil Younis said town residents use just 4.5
gallons of water per person per day -- less than one-fifth the
minimum water allowance recommended by the World Health
Organization. The average Israeli uses about 75 gallons of water a
day for all household purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli human rights group Betselem says the average
Palestinian consumes one-fifth the water used by his Israeli
counterpart, though Israel puts the ratio at 1:3.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is similarly harsh in the Gaza Strip, where
overflowing septic systems pollute the aquifer and overpumping
allows sea water to seep in. Israel controls 80 percent of West
Bank and Gaza aquifers.
</P>
<P>
   Betselem activists brought bottled water and water tanks to
Yatta on Wednesday to protest the water shortages, accusing Israel
of depriving Palestinians of basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli water officials say they are providing the
Palestinians with the amount of water agreed upon in interim peace
accords. They explained the discrepancy in distribution between
Palestinians and Israelis as a function of differences in
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the standard of living rises, there are washing machines,
dishwashers -- people need more water,'' said Noga Blitz, the
Israeli Infrastructure Ministry's director of water consumption
management. She blamed the Palestinian Authority for not setting up
pipes to receive an additional 175 million cubic feet of water that
Israel had promised to give Gaza annually.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, Blitz said, the poor quality of the pipes
leads to loss of half the water pumped for household use.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not simply one of allocation. Overpumping has
deteriorated water quality throughout the region, and population
growth and a rising standard of living for both sides have
increased demand.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has cut water to farmers by 40 percent and is considering
an emergency purchase of water from Turkey. Both sides are
developing desalination projects.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians particularly resent Jewish settlers in the West
Bank who are allotted three to five times more water than they
receive.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be very big conflicts in this area if the water
issue is not solved,'' warned Said Galala, the director general of
the Palestinian Environment Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In Yatta on Wednesday, children crowded around a truck in the
hot sun as Betselem activists handed out bottles of water.
</P>
<P>
   ''Water! Water!'' they shouted, reaching out their hands.

<HEADLINE> Envirotest to pay $1 million to guard against fraud  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Stung by allegations that its inspectors
were taking bribes, the company that runs Connecticut's auto
emissions testing centers is spending $1 million to safeguard
against future problems.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland announced Wednesday that Envirotest will
pay for 16 more emissions inspectors to be stationed at testing
facilities around the state. Those inspectors will come from the
state Department of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The company also will pay the state as much as $250,000 to hire
a private auditor who will evaluate the company's 25 testing
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, four former testing inspectors pleaded guilty to
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, the leaders of the Legislature's Transportation
Committee said they will hold hearings July 12 to determine how
useful the emissions program has been in cutting down on air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to find out exactly what is going on, where the
problems lie, and what we can do as a legislative body to help
remedy the situation,'' said Sen. Biagio Ciotto, D-Wethersfield.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Sanders, a spokeswoman for Envirotest, said the company
is willing to work with the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very glad the governor and the lawmakers are taking an
interest in the testing program,'' Sanders said. ''Any issues that
crop up we take very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Envirotest agreed to install video cameras to record emission
inspections, and will hire people to review the videotapes of
questionable cases. The company also will require supervisors to OK
re-inspections of vehicles that fail the emissions test and are
re-tested the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are real solutions,'' Rowland said. ''Nothing is 100
percent, but clearly having the supervision will have a huge impact
on the employees there and, most importantly, bring back public
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said he believes the problems with Envirotest are not
widespread.

   ''The truth is, there have only been five instances of abuse,''
Rowland said. ''Those employees have been fired and we are looking
at some ways to improve the system and return public confidence to
the testing program.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, four Bridgeport residents - Thadius Bullock, 24;
John Ricky Brown, 43; Frank Norris, 28; and Roxann LaFountain, 46 -
pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree forgery.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant State's Attorney Charles Stango said he will recommend
prison time when the four are sentenced in August. However,
Superior Court Judge Burton Kaplan said he may consider imposing
terms of probation instead.
</P>
<P>
   State police said the four would run a ''passed'' car through
the Bridgeport emissions station twice, then use the false report
to cover a failed vehicle after receiving cash from the owner of
the failed car.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Melendez, 21, of Stamford, an inspector at the Darien
station, was later arrested on similar charges. His case is
pending.

<HEADLINE> Eagle Scout turned lessons against Boy Scouts  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - James Dale, a troop leader expelled by the Boy
Scouts for being gay, said Wednesday that the scouting organization
will ultimately suffer for its exclusionary policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dinosaurs became extinct because they didn't evolve,'' Dale
said hours after the Supreme Court ruled against him. ''The Boy
Scouts are making themselves extinct, and that's a very sad
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale, 29, said other youth groups have an opportunity to fill a
void created by the Boy Scouts' anti-gay declaration. ''Gay kids
need resources,'' he said. ''Gay kids are coming out at younger and
younger ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale waged a 10-year battle against Boy Scout policy that
considers homosexuality contrary to the oath requiring scouts to be
''morally straight.'' The fight landed at the U.S. Supreme Court
and culminated Wednesday with the high court's 5-4 decision that
the Scouts can bar homosexuals from serving as troop leaders - a
loss for Dale.
</P>
<P>
   Dale lives in New York City and is advertising director for POZ
magazine, which addresses the needs of people who are HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say he was helped on his legal crusade by a supportive
family and a healthy attitude toward the public spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not gotten a big head and he doesn't enjoy all these
(public appearances), but he's a soldier for the cause,'' said
James Anderson, faculty adviser to the Rutgers University gay and
lesbian organization, through which he became friends with Dale.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's always been very good on his feet, talking from his heart
as well as his head,'' Anderson said. ''So that part has been
relatively easy to him. He's also managed to maintain his life and
his privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in April after the Supreme Court heard
arguments in the case, Dale said he does not consider himself the
leader of a movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only person I am is me, and I've always been true to
myself, and I think that's the most important thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dale - who changed his name before the dispute with the scouts -
grew up in New Jersey, the younger of two sons of Gerald Dick, a
lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, and his wife Doris.
</P>
<P>
   He was a Cub Scout at 8, a Boy Scout at 11, an Eagle Scout at
17. At 18, he became an assistant scoutmaster.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from a military high school, Dale attended
Rutgers University. He accepted his homosexuality the summer
between his freshman and sophomore years and joined the campus gay
and lesbian organization, becoming co-president after three months.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that capacity that Dale attended a daylong conference
in 1990 on the struggles of lesbian and gay adolescents. A story on
the conference in the July 8, 1990, Newark Star-Ledger quoted Dale
describing his difficult path toward accepting his homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The article drew the attention of officials at the Monmouth
Council of the Boy Scouts, which 16 months earlier had made Dale an
assistant scoutmaster of Troop 73 in Matawan, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The council revoked Dale's registration, citing ''the standards
for leadership established by the Boy Scouts of America, which
specifically forbid membership to homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale sued the scouts under a 1992 New Jersey law protecting the
civil rights of gay people.
</P>
<P>
   He lost round one in 1995, but last year the New Jersey Supreme
Court ruled unanimously in Dale's favor. The court called the Boy
Scouts a public accommodation to which anti-discrimination laws
apply.
</P>
<P>
   In public comments over the years, Dale has spoken highly of his
scouting experience. He even said he looks forward to rejoining the
national organization if its ban on homosexuality is dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I first learned the definition of morally straight, when
I was 11 years old and in the Boy Scouts, it said to respect and
defend the rights of all people, to be honest and open in your
relationships with other people,'' he told reporters after the
Supreme Court heard his case. ''That's what being morally straight
is all about: standing up for yourself and being honest.''

<HEADLINE> German States Agree on Attack Dogs  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Nadia Rouhani is close to tears as she talks about
the vicious killing of a 6-year-old boy mauled to death in a
schoolyard by two attack dogs as his classmates watched in horror.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're shocked, stunned, full of sorrow and rage,'' said the
mother of two at a protest by worried parents, holding flowers and
pushing their own tots in carriages.
</P>
<P>
   If the government can't keep such ''attack machines'' off the
streets, she asked, ''What are the conclusions? Should we arm
ourselves?''
</P>
<P>
   Months of mounting concern about dangerous dogs on the streets
of German cities exploded into outraged cries for action after
Monday's attack in Hamburg by a pit bull and a Staffordshire bull
terrier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Away with these beasts!'' the nation's most-read newspaper,
Bild, screamed across its front page Wednesday after two more
attacks sent an elderly man and a young jogger to hospitals this
week.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, German officials announced nationwide bans on
breeding and importing attack dogs and other measures, including
possible jail time for violators.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Otto Schily, who had advocated a ban for
months, said the measures would be drafted and presented to the
Cabinet in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that these steps are necessary in view of the
immense danger that comes from such aggressive animals,'' he said.
''It's unacceptable that children especially ... are endangered
because of the quirks of dog owners.''
</P>
<P>
   The action would bring Germany in line with some of its other
European Union neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   A law that took effect in January in France requires dangerous
dogs to be sterilized -- a move aimed at eliminating pit bulls from
France within 10 years. Britain has had a similar law since 1991.
Italy is planning to introduce one this year.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is a country where dogs are coddled, even allowed to
accompany their owners into stores and sit under tables at fancy
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Attack dogs, though, tend to be favored by neo-Nazis and other
young toughs, usually in low-income areas where the dogs are
brandished like weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Some breeders accused the government of going too far with a
ban, saying irresponsible owners are to blame if a dog is trained
to fight, not the animals.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Weder raises pit bulls and Staffordshires as a hobby at
his Top Gun Kennel in Atzendorf, about 90 miles southwest of
Berlin. The three pit bulls he keeps in his apartment have never
posed a danger to his children or anyone else, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're totally normal dogs like any other ... good with
children,'' he said. ''The greatest danger is from the people'' who
raise them improperly.
</P>
<P>
   While the attack in Hamburg was regrettable, he said, the
government's action is ''extremely excessive'' and will hurt
professional breeders.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal and state officials discussed curtailing
ownership and breeding of attack dogs in May, no concerted action
was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is determining which breeds to classify as
attack dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The southern state of Baden-Wuerttemburg drew up a list of 11
banned breeds in 1992, but it was thrown out by a court that said
it violated the rights of dog owners to equal treatment. Some
breeds that weren't on the list -- such as German shepherds or
Rottweilers -- had just as many biting incidents recorded as those
listed, the judges said.
</P>
<P>
   Schily said the Agriculture Ministry will prepare a breeding ban
that will apply not only to pit bulls and Staffordshires but also
to especially aggressive individual animals of other breeds or
mixtures.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin officials intend to require permits for existing pit
bulls, American Staffordshires, and Staffordshire bull terriers.
They would be granted only to adults who can prove the dogs are
needed for protection. The city says it has no estimates of how
many exist, but a similar rule in Munich since 1992 has brought the
number registered there down to four.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of eight other breeds, from mastiffs to Rhodesian
Ridgebacks, will have to get a certificate from a veterinarian
attesting that the dog is not dangerous. Other measures include
requirements that the animals be muzzled and on leashes when in
public places.
</P>
<P>
   The parents who gathered Wednesday outside the federal Interior
Ministry in Berlin say they will continue their protests to make
sure the government follows through on the laws -- and enforces
them.
</P>
<P>
   They note the two dogs who attacked the first-grader in Hamburg,
who was identified only as Volkan S., had bitten three dogs in
April and were supposed to be kept muzzled and on leashes when in
public. They had neither when they jumped over a school fence and
went for the boy's throat.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs' owner faces up to five years in prison if convicted of
negligent homicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are five attack dogs I know of in my neighborhood -- one
woman has three,'' said one of the protesters, Angelika Schueller,
a 33-year-old mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far they haven't attacked anyone,'' she said. ''But I don't
want my children to be the first.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Gains 102; Dow Rises 101  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks held their gains Wednesday after the
Federal Reserve said it would leave interest rates unchanged for
now but warned that inflation risks remain in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Fed announced its decision, the Nasdaq
composite index was up 101.64 at 3,960.60.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 101.11 at 10,605.57 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 16.40 at 1,450.55.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were responding enthusiastically to the Fed's decision
to hold interest rates steady. Six rate increases within the past
year have shown some evidence of slowing the economy to a more
sustainable level. Yet the rising rates, which make it more
expensive to borrow money, have also taken a toll on some
companies' earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to hold rates steady was largely expected, but the
Fed gave investors little room to rejoice, warning that inflation
dangers may be lurking and hinting that higher rates could be
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed said it believes the ''risks continue to be weighted
mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation
pressures in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, certain economic gauges have been pointing to continued
growth. Wednesday morning, the Commerce Department said orders to
U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods shot up 6 percent
in May, led by a burst in demand for electronics equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Economists cautioned that the durable goods data tend to be
volatile, but worried that the report signified that the
manufacturing sector has not cooled off as much as many analysts
had believed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still a very, very cautious Fed,'' said Michael Strauss,
managing director of Commonfund Asset Management. ''They have some
room to hold off on a tightening now, but the economic numbers in
July and August could paint a picture of a stronger economy than
they really want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The market's gains broadened after the Fed's decision.
Technology and telecommunications stocks fared best, with
Hewlett-Packard rising $7.375 to $124 and JDS Uniphase up $5.125 at
$124.125.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom rose $5.063 to $44.75. Salomon Smith Barney analyst
Jack Grubman ''strongly'' reiterated his buy rating and $87 price
target on the stock, despite the Justice Department's threat to
block the company's proposed merger with Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fell $4.75 to $53.625.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which were lower for most of the session, made
some gains. Citigroup rose 81.25 cents to $81.25.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was running ahead of
Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said end-of-the-quarter buying and selling was
preventing the market from hitting the lull that typically precedes
Fed announcements.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.89 to 514.97.

<HEADLINE> Lawrence M. Kelley, 1936 Heisman trophy winner, dies at age 85.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HIGHTSTOWN, N.J. (AP) - Lawrence M. Kelley, who was the second
college football player to receive the Heisman Trophy, died of an
apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home here. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley won the Heisman Trophy, college football's highest honor,
in 1936 while at Yale University. He was an All-American end for
Yale that year, when the team finished with a 7-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   Hightstown police rushed to Kelley's home Tuesday after a report
of a person with a gunshot wound, said Angelo Onofri,
administrative assistant with the Mercer County prosecutor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley was pronounced dead at the scene. An autopsy is planned,
Onofri said.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 13, 1934, Yale recorded one of its greatest upset wins
ever when Kelley made a one-handed grab of a 49-yard pass from
quarterback Jerry Roscoe, scoring the only touchdown in a 7-0
victory over a Princeton team that had won 15 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Another Kelley play against Navy in 1936 prompted a change in
the football rule book. With Yale trailing 7-6, a Navy player
fumbled a punt. The loose ball bounced off Kelley's foot and
bounded toward the goal line. Kelley fell on it at the Navy 2-yard
line, and two plays later Clint Frank scored the winning touchdown
for Yale. Afterward, rules makers dictated that free balls that are
kicked become dead at that point.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1999, Kelley became the second Heisman Trophy winner
to auction his prize to the public. The trophy sold for $328,110 -
$100,000 more than the price paid for O.J. Simpson's Heisman in
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley had suffered a stroke six months earlier and said he
wanted to raise money for his 18 nieces and nephews. His wife, Mary
Ruth, was also in failing health. The couple had no children.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm 84 and not doing too good, so I decided to let go of all
my memorabilia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Downtown Athletic Club, the site of the annual
award presentation for college football's most prestigious award,
were saddened by Kelley's decision. The 1936 Heisman was the first
to bear the name of coach John Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   ''What am I going to do with it?'' he said. ''I can't split it
among'' his 18 nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley was born in Ohio and raised in Williamsport, Pa. After
graduating from Williamsport High School in 1932, he completed a
year of postgraduate studies at the Peddie School, a private
academy in Hightstown, before attending Yale.
</P>
<P>
   During his senior year at Yale, he served as captain of the
football and baseball teams and played varsity basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley returned to the Peddie School to teach and coach football
for several years, said his niece, Pat Hullfish. Her uncle also
taught at the Cheshire Academy in Cheshire, Conn., for several
years. He then went back to the Peddie School, where he served as
alumni director until he retired in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He often attended Peddie sports events during the 1990s and
signed autographs at trade shows. Kelley also corresponded with
other Heisman winners, and helped organize gatherings during the
annual dinner, said Rudy Riska, executive director of the Heisman
Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Berwanger, who won the first Heisman Trophy in 1935 while at
the University of Chicago, signed autographs with Kelley a few
weeks ago at an event in New York, sponsored by the Downtown
Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a grand person,'' said Berwanger, 86.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley was a member of the Heisman Foundation and the Yale and
Peddie School alumni associations.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife and niece, survivors include a brother-in-law,
two sisters-in-law, and 17 other nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete Tuesday. They are being
handled by Glackin-Saul Funeral Home in Hightstown.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Urges Calm, Dignity for Elian  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cubans arranged a small airport homecoming
ceremony for Elian Gonzalez, and the government urged the public to
remain calm Wednesday after the way was cleared for the boy to
return home.
</P>
<P>
   President Fidel Castro was expected to greet the 6-year-old, his
family and his schoolmates upon their arrival Wednesday night from
the Washington area, where the group had lived together during the
last court appeals by Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's friends in his hometown of Cardenas, meanwhile, were
preparing to travel to Havana to greet Elian as he returned after
seven months in the United States, residents told journalists
there.
</P>
<P>
   The government announced in a statement on state-run television
that the U.S. Supreme Court had refused to hear the appeal of the
Miami relatives, who were seeking to keep Elian in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now more than ever, our population must behave with the most
dignity, serenity and discipline,'' the statement said. ''Let us
remember that at all times, our fight has just begun and that a
long road before us still remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro has said that even after Elian returns, Cubans must not
take a moment's rest in demanding an end to the four-decade-old
U.S. embargo on the island and American policies that allow Cubans
who reach U.S. soil to remain.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana on Wednesday, there were little visible signs that the
country's seven-month-long campaign was nearing an end. Along the
seaside boulevard Malecon, a construction worker plastered a new
poster on a billboard: ''Return Elian to his country.''
</P>
<P>
   The muted reaction by Cubans appeared to be part of a determined
effort by the government to make Elian's return as low-key as
possible in contrast to what government officials have called the
''circus'' that surrounded much of his life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wait with tranquility the triumph of justice and the end of
the kidnapping,'' ran a headline Wednesday in Granma, the official
daily of Cuba's Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, Castro promised there would be no street
celebrations, no parades when the boy returns -- despite a national
campaign in Cuba that put Elian's face on billboards, placards and
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Wednesday afternoon, foreign correspondents were
advised of an airport welcoming ceremony that would be televised
live by state television. Castro's official cameraman was expected
to attend, an indication the Cuban leader might personally greet
the boy and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cubans were cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until he arrives, we won't believe it,'' said Ana Julia Villa,
a housewife from the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Although plans had called for Elian to live discreetly during
his first three months back in a specially prepared boarding school
in Havana, there are indications he may just return to his hometown
of Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over Elian began in late November when the child was
rescued off the Florida coast. His mother and 10 other people
drowned when their boat sank en route from Cuba to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was turned over to his Miami relatives, who began fighting
to keep him with them. The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
fought to have the child returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Cubans backed the effort to return the boy to Cuba --
a campaign that has seen over 100 government organized rallies
across the country attended by hundreds of thousands of Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Sambiente, sitting on a park bench in Havana's Parque
Central, said Elian and his family should remain in the United
States because they would have a better life than in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm one of the 50 percent who wants him to stay,'' Sambiente
said. ''The mother wanted him to stay. She died doing that. It was
the last wish of the mother.''

<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Women's professional basketball was followed
quickly by women's boxing. Next up is women's football.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Professional Football League features 15 teams and
is scheduled to open its season Oct. 14. A 10-game schedule is to
be followed by playoffs and a championship game Feb. 3, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   One of the teams is the Colorado Valkyries, a club still without
a stadium, coach or starting date for training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''A Valkyrie is one of 12 Nordic war goddesses,'' said Mike
Monetti, one of the team's owners and its acting general manager.
''She would take the fallen soldiers off the battlefield on their
shields and take them to the heavens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Valkyries will play in the central division of the American
Football Conference with the Chicago Blaze, Minnesota Vixens and
the Milwaukee Minx.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams in the league are the Atlanta Amazons, Austin Rose,
Dallas Wildcatz, Daytona Beach Barracudas, Houston Energy, Miami
Fury, Nashville Dream, New England Storm, New York Sharks,
Rochester Galaxy and Tampa Tempest.

<HEADLINE> Standard and Poor's lowers Nassau's bond rating  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) - A state bailout plan is only a good first
step toward reviving the fiscal health of Nassau County, the Wall
Street agency Standard &AMP; Poor's said Wednesday in announcing
another drop in the county's bond rating.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the county has made limited progress by reducing some
expenses and enhancing some revenues, thus far most of the actions
taken in fiscal 2000 are non-recurring, and therefore do not
benefit upcoming fiscal years,'' S&AMP;P said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The county - where the median annual income is $58,155, one of
the highest in the nation - got into the financial mess in part
because its property tax assessments had not been updated since
1938.
</P>
<P>
   The new rating, triple-B-minus, is just one notch above junk
status but still investment-grade and is assigned a ''stable
outlook,'' S&AMP;P said. The previous rating was triple-B. The lower
the bond rating, the more a municipality must pay in interest on
its borrowing; theoretically, the money lost to interest could have
been used for something else, for instance, youth programs or new
traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   The rating drop follows a bailout that was approved by the state
legislature earlier this month. The state created an independent
financial oversight board to review the county's finances, and
committed $105 million in bailout funds over the next four years.
For their part, county officials agreed to cut spending about $200
million over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The Nassau Interim Finance Authority held its first meeting
Wednesday and approved more than $50 million in budget cuts.
Without the cuts and the state aid, the county's 2000 budget
deficit had been projected at $117 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think S&AMP;P acted in a professional way,'' said Frank G. Zarb,
chairman of the interim finance authority. ''Frankly, had it not
been for the formation of this august panel ... it would have
turned to junk. And that would have been a pity, because the people
of Nassau County would have had to pay for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Jacobs, the presiding officer of the county legislature,
said she was ''disappointed we were downgraded one notch. ... I
really believe we're on the right track and I think that Wall
Street recognizes that.''
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P noted that it approved of the state action to create the
Finance Authority, but still expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances
are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to
meet its financial commitments,'' S&AMP;P said.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County had been projected to see its budget deficit soar
to $300 million by 2003 before the Finance Authority was created.
If local officials fail to take a fiscally prudent course, the
panel will turn into a formal financial control board with more
direct budgeting powers.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Parolla, the county's Republican comptroller, blamed the
problems on the county going eight of the last 10 years without a
property tax increase while expenses grew because of the county's
contract with police unions and other obligations.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Gains 103; Dow Is Up 92  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks held their gains Wednesday after the
Federal Reserve said it would leave interest rates unchanged for
now but warned that inflation risks remain in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's willingness to wait and see whether the economy
continues dodging inflation heartened investors. But analysts were
quick to caution that the central bank's decision leaves the stock
market on an uncharted course.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they had gone for an increase today, that probably would
have been it for the year,'' said Milton Ezrati, senior economist
and strategist at Lord, Abbett &AMP; Co. ''But this has set the market
up to worry right through August'' when the Fed holds its next
meeting on rates.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was up 103.24 at 3,962.20.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 91.53 at 10,596.03 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 14.73 at 1,450.55.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were responding enthusiastically to the Fed's decision
to hold interest rates steady. Six rate increases within the past
year have shown some evidence of slowing the economy to a more
sustainable level. Yet the rising rates, which make it more
expensive to borrow money, have also taken a toll on some
companies' earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to hold rates steady was largely expected, but the
Fed gave investors little room to rejoice, warning that inflation
dangers may be lurking and hinting that higher rates could be
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed said it believes the ''risks continue to be weighted
mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation
pressures in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, certain economic gauges have been pointing to continued
growth. Wednesday morning, the Commerce Department said orders to
U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods shot up 6 percent
in May, led by a burst in demand for electronics equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Economists cautioned that the durable goods data tend to be
volatile, but worried that the report signified that the
manufacturing sector has not cooled off as much as many analysts
had believed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still a very, very cautious Fed,'' said Michael Strauss,
managing director of Commonfund Asset Management. ''They have some
room to hold off on a tightening now, but the economic numbers in
July and August could paint a picture of a stronger economy than
they really want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of investors' lingering uncertainty about rates,
economically sensitive stocks failed to get a boost from the Fed's
decision. Financial stocks were lower, with American Express down
37.5 cents at $53.813.
</P>
<P>
   Technology and telecommunications stocks fared best, with
Hewlett-Packard rising $7.375 to $124 and JDS Uniphase up $5.125 at
$124.125.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom rose $5.063 to $44.75. Salomon Smith Barney analyst
Jack Grubman ''strongly'' reiterated his buy rating and $87 price
target on the stock, despite the Justice Department's threat to
block the company's proposed merger with Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fell $4.75 to $53.625.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 825.42 million
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace. Traders said end-of-the-quarter
buying and selling was helping spike volume.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 9.59 to 517.67.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Debate Swirls Around MD  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA SINDERBRAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The former Air Force surgeon who challenged
Nebraska's ban on ''partial-birth'' abortion said Wednesday that
the fallout he faced for performing abortions had taken an
''enormous toll'' on him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's verdict makes me feel that the price we've paid in
terms of harassment, personal loss and legal and financial
difficulties has been worth it,'' said 58-year-old Dr. Leroy
Carhart.
</P>
<P>
   He said he plans to go back to ''work as usual'' within a day or
two. That means wading through swarms of protestors outside his
Bellevue, Neb. clinic, where he also practices general medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have large groups of protestors every week, every day. I
don't expect that to change at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carhart has seen adversity before: nine years ago, his family's
rural home and belongings burned in a fire. The family dog and cat
were killed, as were 17 horses trapped in a barn.
</P>
<P>
   ''The next day, we received an anonymous letter postmarked the
day of the fire saying that the killing of the horses was justified
to try to make a statement against the killing of the babies,''
Carhart has said of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   County workers bulldozed the rubble and destroyed any evidence
before arson investigators arrived, and no one was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Carhart said that with Wednesday's ruling, he expects more of
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been greater and greater incidents after each
judicial decision'' on the Nebraska statute, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Am I afraid? No. Am I concerned? Yes, of course I am,''
Carhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Carhart is one of only three doctors in Nebraska known to
perform abortions, and he has maintained that the state ban was
written in such a way that it could be used to outlaw all
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our grandfathers fought World War I because it was the 'war to
end all wars,''' said the Air Force veteran. ''Our grandfathers did
the same in World War II. Roe vs. Wade was supposed to decide this.
But the fight goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Carhart now varies his daily routine as a safety precaution.
Most mornings, protesters taunt him, his staff and patients as they
enter the clinic, where he also has a general medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   His clinic is not easy to find: Carhart works in a plain
two-story building behind a gas station in a working-class
neighborhood of Bellevue, Neb., an Omaha suburb surrounding Offutt
Air Force Base. There is no sign on the clinic. The glass on the
front door is painted brown.
</P>
<P>
   Carhart, a New Jersey native, was stationed at Offutt before he
retired as a lieutenant colonel in 1985 and opened a practice. He
is the only doctor in Nebraska known to perform abortions after the
16th week of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   He performs more than 1,200 abortions a year, of which he says
about 20 involve the D&AMP;X procedure. The procedure is estimated to
be used in one out of 1,800 abortions performed nationwide, yet it
has become the rallying point of anti-abortion groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court had taken the Nebraska case because of
contradictory rulings by federal appeals courts. One overruled the
Nebraska law along with measures in Iowa and Arkansas, saying the
laws were vague and too broad. Another upheld nearly identical laws
in Illinois and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Heisman Winner Larry Kelley Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGHTSTOWN, N.J. (AP) -- Larry Kelley, the second college
football player to win the Heisman Trophy, apparently shot himself
to death at his home. He was 85 and had been ailing.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrived at Kelley's home Tuesday after a report of a
person with a gunshot wound, said Angelo Onofri, an assistant in
the Mercer County prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley was pronounced dead at the scene. An autopsy is planned.
He had suffered a stroke in May 1999, and his wife, Mary Ruth, was
also in failing health.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley won college football's highest honor in 1936 at Yale. He
was an All-American end and led the team to a 7-1 record that year.
He was elected to the National Football Hall of Fame in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 13, 1934, Yale recorded one of its greatest upset wins
ever when Kelley made a one-handed grab of a 49-yard pass, scoring
the only touchdown in a 7-0 victory over a Princeton team that had
won 15 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   During his senior year at Yale, he was captain of the football
and baseball teams and also played varsity basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Kelley became the second Heisman Trophy winner to
auction his prize to the public. He had said he wanted to give the
money to his many nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm 84 and not doing too good, so I decided to let go of all
my memorabilia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trophy sold for $328,110 -- $100,000 more than the price paid
for O.J. Simpson's Heisman earlier that year. Kelley's award was
the first to bear the name of coach John Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Berwanger, who won the first Heisman Trophy in 1935, signed
autographs with Kelley a few weeks ago in New York. ''He was a
grand person,'' said Berwanger, 86.
</P>
<P>
   After his years at Yale, Kelley taught and coached at the Peddie
School, a private academy in Hightstown that he had attended in his
teens, said his niece Pat Hullfish. He also taught at the Cheshire
Academy in Cheshire, Conn., for several years before returning to
Peddie as alumni director. He retired in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife and nephews and nieces, Kelley's survivors
include a brother-in-law and two sisters-in-law.

<HEADLINE> Terrorism Hearing Postponed in Canada  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- An extradition hearing for an Algerian man
suspected by the United States of links to an alleged terrorist
plot was postponed Wednesday, the second delay in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled Wednesday hearing for Mokhtar Haouari, 31, was
moved back to July 17 to give both sides more time to prepare, said
Ronald Schacter, who is representing the U.S. government in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari faces seven U.S. charges in connection with an alleged
plot by Ahmed Ressam, also Algerian, to smuggle explosives across
the border from Canada. U.S. authorities believe Ressam was
involved in plans to bomb millennium celebrations in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was arrested in December at Port Angeles, Wash., after
bomb-making materials were found in the trunk of the car he was
driving. He and another Algerian suspect, Abdelmajid Dahoumane,
were charged with several counts, including illegal possession of
explosives. Ressam awaits trial in the United States in February,
while Dahoumane remains on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari arrived in Canada in 1993 and made an unsuccessful claim
for refugee status. Because Canada halted deportations to Algeria
in the mid-1990s due to political instability in the North African
country, Haouari continued to live in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Haouari won his first extradition hearing postponement on June
13, when he showed up for the hearing with a swollen right jaw that
his lawyer said was broken in a jailhouse fight. The case was
delayed until Wednesday to allow Haouari time to recover.

<HEADLINE> Korean War Encounter Recalled  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If anyone would remember the U.S. Army's
shocking first encounter with North Korean troops on July 5, 1950 --
10 days into the Korean War -- it would be Charles ''Brad'' Smith.
</P>
<P>
   He was there.
</P>
<P>
   As a lieutenant colonel commanding of Task Force Smith, a
400-man team fielded from ill-equipped and ill-prepared occupation
troops in Japan, Smith witnessed the desperation of the moment on
that rainy day near Suwon, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here we are at the beginning of another war, was the thought
that went through my mind,'' says the retired brigadier general who
had been present in Hawaii when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor nine
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, 84-year-old Smith stood erect and square-jawed
among the fields of white grave markers at Arlington National
Cemetery to commemorate the sacrifices made by soldiers of Task
Force Smith. Under a gray and drippy sky, he joined 31 other
surviving members of his unit, as well as Gen. Eric Shinseki, the
Army's Chief of Staff, and other Army leaders in laying a wreath at
the Tomb of the Unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Smith recalled that when President Harry Truman
authorized Gen. Douglas MacArthur on June 30, 1950, to send U.S.
ground forces under his command in Japan to meet the invading North
Korea forces south of Seoul, ''the general feeling was, if the
Americans show up the North Koreans will turn tail.''
</P>
<P>
   The unfortunate surprise was that the North Koreans, in columns
of Russian-supplied T-34 tanks, not only swept through Task Force
Smith's blocking positions but inflicted heavy casualties as they
rumbled south to Osan and beyond -- an advance that was not stopped
until early August at the Pusan perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's men fired bazookas and 75mm recoilless rifles at 33
advancing North Korea tanks, but to little effect. The U.S. Army
had developed a 3.5-inch rocket launcher capable of penetrating
North Korean armor, but none were available in South Korea.
Anti-tank mines could have worked, but they had none of them
either.
</P>
<P>
   ''We held them up for seven hours,'' Smith recalls, by drawing
the tanks off the main road into firing positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time I ordered a withdrawal we were down to about two
clips of ammunition per rifleman,'' he said, and forced to retreat
through rice paddies, leaving weapons behind. ''Some men took off
their shoes because it was easier to walk through the ooze of a
rice paddy with shoes off. It was a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of July 6, after his makeshift battalion had to
withdrawn toward Osan, Smith could account for only 185 of his
400-plus men, members of the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment
of the 24th Infantry Division and the 52nd Field Artillery
Battalion. Among the losses was the first U.S. soldier killed in
the war. (Six American airmen had been killed in aerial combat
several days earlier, north of Seoul.)
</P>
<P>
   In today's Army, the rout of Task Force Smith is often cited as
an example of the disastrous consequences of failing to keep the
military modernized in arms and fully trained for short-notice
combat.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, while acknowledging that his men faced a mismatch they
could not possibly have won, speaks proudly of their effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a man left his position until he was ordered to do so,''
he said. ''Everyone of them could see what I could see after the
tanks went by: three more tanks coming down, then about 25 vehicles
loaded, and behind them North Korean soldiers walking four abreast
for as far as I could see.''
</P>
<P>
   Task Force Smith may have been little more than a bump in the
road for the invading North Koreans, but in Smith's opinion that
encounter on July 5 gave MacArthur's field commanders the time they
needed to get reinforcements to South Korea in time to build a
defensive line at the Naktong River west of Pusan.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-September Smith's 1st Battalion of the 21st Infantry
helped lead the allied breakout from the Pusan perimeter --
coinciding with the U.S. amphibious landing at Inchon -- and within
weeks he and his troops were within 11 miles of the Chinese border
at the mouth of the Yalu River. Smith had orders to leave Korea on
Oct. 20, but he ignored them, thinking, ''This is a hell of a time
to leave; we are winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately China then entered the war, and Smith and the rest
of the 8th Army were forced to withdraw back below the original
dividing line between North and South Korea, and the war became a
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally left in early November, Smith was awarded the
Distinguished Service Cross for heroism.

<HEADLINE> Philosophical 'shifts' not so dramatic, or one-sided  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - There is the tendency in Albany to see the
just-completed state legislative session as conclusive evidence of
the Republican state Senate's swerve from the right to the middle
philosophically.
</P>
<P>
   But left-of-center Democrats in the state Assembly made some
philosophical concessions, too.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, both sides worked hard to lay claim to the middle
ground heading into the elections of 2000. The lawmakers elected
this November will redraw the lines of the 211 Assembly and Senate
districts for the next five elections, essentially meaning that
control over the Legislature for the next decade will be decided
this Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Both Assembly Democrats and Senate Republicans aim to guarantee
that their pre-eminent positions will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Both majorities clearly concluded that 2000 was not the time for
the ideologues among their ranks to dominate their agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Both were willing to work with each other and Republican Gov.
George Pataki - another middle-grounder - to get the bills passed
they believe their members needed to face the voters this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The two most publicity-grabbing bills approved at the end of the
2000 session were a gun-control measure and legislation creating
special penalties for ''hate crimes.'' Both bills approved were
substantially the same as measures proposed by Pataki and both
concepts were long championed by Democrats in the Assembly and long
opposed by Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Their passage was regarded as either the abandonment of
long-held Senate principles - by those who opposed their passage -
or by supporters as a reasonable acknowledgment by the Senate
Republicans that their continued opposition made less and less
sense.
</P>
<P>
   As Bruno acknowledged repeatedly in the days leading up to the
end of the session, ''times change.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a member of the Senate in its more conservative days,
said it would be wrong to be too cynical about the Senate's
acceptance at last of the hate crimes bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe ultimately, at the end of the day, a majority of the
senators thought that this was the right law for the people of New
York,'' he said. ''I believe they thought it was the right law not
for just political reasons but because they believed, as I did,
that bias crime is something that tears us apart as a society and
should have a higher level of penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Other bills approved by the Senate after opposition in the past
were measures requiring people to be formally notified about the
impending use of pesticides at their neighbors' house and to
require that the work and educational histories of physicians be
made available to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly, meanwhile, accepted a complex sex crimes bill
containing some provisions that its liberal Democratic members have
had problems with philosophically in the past. It also acceded to
the fingerprinting of prospective teachers and other parts of an
anti-school violence package pushed by Republicans which it has
balked at in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said both Assembly Democrats and Senate Republicans
deserve credit for making what were sometimes unpopular choices
internally.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of these issues were difficult and the Assembly has had
difficulty for years in passing them and some others the Senate has
had difficulty passing for years,'' the governor said. ''And we
were able to put aside those differences and put the public
interest first.''
</P>
<P>
   By being amenable to certain issues - sometimes surprisingly so
- the majorities in each chamber in 2000 also accepted many ideas
that were initially proposed by the minority parties in their
chambers. They didn't actually give those minority party
legislators credit, of course, but both Assembly Minority Leader
John Faso and Senate Minority Leader Martin Connor were more than
willing to make the connections where valid.
</P>
<P>
   In the tightly orchestrated and constrained world of the state
Legislature, this is about as close as minority party legislators
will get to participating in a meaningful way in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the gun-control bill, Connor praised Bruno for
having the ''courage to put it out here for a vote,'' knowing that
19 of Bruno's 36 Republicans in the 61-member Senate would vote
against it. That and some other key bills were passed at the end of
the Senate's 2000 session with the help of Democratic votes,
counter to Bruno's usual practice of getting the 31 votes bills
need for approval from among his own Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''That really is what this Senate ought to be, a small 'd'
democratic body where these issues are worked out by
representatives of the people expressing themselves and voting for
the interests of their constituencies,'' Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   On minority party legislators getting credit for being the first
with some issues, Connor paraphrased the late speaker of the U.S.
House, Tip O'Neill: ''There is no limit to what you can accomplish
in a representative body if you're willing to let someone else take
credit for it.''

<HEADLINE> Court: Elian Can Return to Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez, the little Cuban castaway who
won America's heart, was cleared to return home Wednesday when the
Supreme Court decisively ended a seven-month custody battle between
his father and fervently anti-communist U.S. relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by his family and schoolmates brought to the United
States to keep him company, Cuba's ''boy hero,'' as he is known in
his homeland, was expected in Havana as early as Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court rejected a formal appeal by the boy's Miami
relatives and a separate emergency request, filed with Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy, aimed at postponing his departure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The legal battle is over,'' said Gregory Craig, attorney for
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. ''The family will now make
immediate arrangements to return to their home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives who had fought so long to keep Elian in the
United States had no immediate comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, after the months of heated words, high emotions,
legal wrangling and his seizure by federal agents in the home of
his Cuban-American relatives, Elian's course was set by a brief
order from the high court.
</P>
<P>
   ''The application for stay presented to Justice Kennedy and by
him referred to the court is denied. The petition for a writ of
certiorari (the appeal) is denied.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving in a motorcade for Dulles International Airport
in suburban Virginia, where two chartered planes were to take the
entourage home, Juan Miguel Gonzalez thanked his hosts at the Youth
for Understanding International Exchange in Washington's Cleveland
Park neighborhood for their hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made a lot of really nice friends and we appreciate your
humanity and your kindness and your warmth and understanding to me
and my family in a period that has been difficult for us,'' he told
them in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Grooms Cowal, president of the organization, described the
Gonzalez family as ''very restrained ... They are obviously very
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his Cuban playmates were given pillow globes. Gonzalez
got a book to give to Cuban President Fidel Castro on the
organization's behalf. An inscription read, ''We hope that someday
soon, we will be able to establish cultural relations and cultural
normalization between Cuban and the U.S. and would be willing to
play a role in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Their passions stoked for months over the custody dispute,
Cubans were urged by their communist government to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now more than ever, our population must behave with the most
dignity, serenity and discipline,'' the government said on Cuban
state television.
</P>
<P>
   People in Cardenas, Elian's hometown, said friends were
preparing to go to Havana to greet him. But no plans were announced
for a splashy homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Summoned by the government, Cubans had demonstrated by the
hundreds of thousands for the return of the boy they call not just
a hero but ''symbolic child.'' But Cuban officials said in
anticipation of the boy's eventual return that they would try to
give him a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, Craig said the Gonzalez family ''is
gratified by the Supreme Court's swift action today. Juan Miguel is
happy that his family is together, safe and now free to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a White House news conference if he had any thoughts
about sending Elian back to Cuba, President Clinton said, ''If he
and his father decided they wanted to stay here, it would be fine
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that Juan Miguel was determined to be ''a good
father, a loving father, committed to the son's welfare. And we
upheld here what I think is a quite important principle, as well as
what is clearly the law of the United States. Do I wish it had
unfolded in a less dramatic, less traumatic way for all concerned?
Of course I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said she was ''very pleased that the
Supreme Court declined to review the case.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This little boy now knows that he can remain with his
father,'' Reno added. ''All involved have had an opportunity to
make their case -- all the way to the highest court in the land. I
hope that everyone will accept the Supreme Court's decision and
join me in wishing this family, and this special little boy,
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Through June 11, the Justice Department spent $1.8 million on
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Among the protesters outside the Miami courthouse, Laura
Vianello cried: ''This is an outrage, there is no solidarity among
us. This is the land of the free?''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators were turned back when they tried to march
toward the building. Angry protesters also gathered outside the
Little Havana home of Elian's Miami relatives, the home where
agents burst in to snatch him in April and give him back to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court's stay on Elian's departure was
dissolving at 4 p.m. EDT Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, now 6, barely survived a perilous boat journey from Cuba
that claimed the life of his mother. Since his rescue from the
Atlantic Ocean on Thanksgiving Day, he has been at the center of a
custody battle between his Cuban father and Cuban-American
relatives
</P>
<P>
   For Castro, getting Elian out of the clutches of his powerful
adversary was a priority -- although Washington has been in
agreement with Havana that the boy belongs with his father, and
acted with force to reunite the two.

<HEADLINE> With BC-NJ--Gay Scout  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Boy Scouts can bar homosexuals from
serving as troop leaders, the Supreme Court said Wednesday in a 5-4
decision on free-association rights that may also let the
6.2-million-member organization reject gay boys as members.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing the Scouts to accept gay troop leaders would violate the
organization's right of ''expressive association'' under the
Constitution's First Amendment, the justices ruled on the last day
of their 1999-2000 term.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Boy Scouts asserts that homosexual conduct is inconsistent
with the values it seeks to instill,'' Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring the organization to have a gay scoutmaster would force
it ''to send a message, both to the youth members and the world,
that the Boy Scouts accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form
of behavior,'' the chief justice said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased,'' said Scouts spokesman Gregg Shields.
''It's going to allow us to continue our mission of providing
character-building programs for youth.''
</P>
<P>
   But the New Jersey assistant scoutmaster ousted when the
organization learned he is gay expressed dismay at the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm definitely saddened by the decision,'' said James Dale.
''People don't join the Boy Scouts because they're anti-gay. People
join the Boy Scouts because they want acceptance, they want
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling did not specifically give the Scouts permission to
bar homosexual boys from membership, but its language left room for
that interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it suggests that they can'' ban homosexual boys from
being Scouts, said Evan Wolfson, Dale's lawyer. ''They won the
right to declare themselves an anti-gay group.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Southern California law professor Erwin
Chemerinsky agreed, saying, ''I don't see any basis for drawing a
distinction between Scout leaders and Scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts organization, formed in the United States in 1910 and
now boasting 6.2 million members and adult leaders, has a policy
that ''avowed homosexuals are not extended membership or leadership
positions,'' Shields said. He would not say whether the
organization has withdrawn membership from gay youths.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Cozza, an adult Scout leader in California and
president of Scouting For All, which advocates letting homosexuals
join, said: ''They've kicked out gay Scouts and now they'll
continue to do so because they've been given the go-ahead by the
Supreme Court to continue to discriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices reversed a New Jersey Supreme Court decision that
said the Scouts wrongly ousted Dale, an Eagle Scout. The state
court said the Scouts violated a New Jersey law banning
discrimination in public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   But Rehnquist wrote, ''The forced inclusion of an unwanted
person in a group infringes the group's freedom of expressive
association'' if it harms the group's ability to advocate its
viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   His opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, Stevens said the New Jersey law does not
force the Scouts ''to communicate any message that it does not wish
to endorse. New Jersey's law, therefore, abridges no constitutional
right of the Boy Scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson, Dale's lawyer, had cited Supreme Court decisions during
the 1980s that let states force the Jaycees and Rotary
International to admit women as full members.
</P>
<P>
   But Rehnquist said requiring such groups to accept women members
would not interfere with the message they seek to express.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the chief justice likened Dale's case to a 1995 Supreme
Court ruling in which the justices let the private sponsor of the
Boston St. Patrick's Day Parade exclude a group of gays and
lesbians, saying parades are a ''form of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative advocacy
group that supported the Scouts' appeal, said the ruling ''will
have a dramatic impact on all private organizations - including
religious groups - to define their own mission and set their own
criteria for leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale was 19 and an assistant scoutmaster of a Matawan, N.J.,
troop when in 1990 he was identified in a newspaper article as
co-president of a campus lesbian and gay student group at Rutgers
University. The Scouts' Monmouth Council revoked Dale's
registration as an adult leader, and he sued, citing the New Jersey
anti-discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said, ''You'd never know from the way the court
characterized it how important this organization is in the lives of
kids.... The court has said that (the Scouts) have the right to
discriminate, but it certainly did not say that discrimination is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale now lives in New York City and is advertising director for
a magazine for people who are HIV-positive.

<HEADLINE> Pop Group Buying Madonna's Mansion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- An aspiring pop group is buying Madonna's mansion --
and a bit of publicity -- for $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member Burgundians are backed by an unnamed investor
whose identity will be revealed on closing day, July 12, said group
publicist Dindy Yokel. A $750,000 cash deposit is being held in
escrow.
</P>
<P>
   Yokel described the band's sound as similar to The Monkees, the
Spice Girls and 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   The group's new 7,100-square-foot home off Biscayne Bay has nine
bedrooms and 8&AMP;frac12; baths.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna bought the place in 1992 for $4.9 million. Her pal Rosie
O'Donnell reportedly wanted to buy it in 1998, but the deal fell
through.
</P>
<P>
   The singer recently bought actress Diane Keaton's Beverly Hills
house for $6.5 million and a mansion in London for $16 million.

<HEADLINE> Inmate linked to homicides from 1987, 1990  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Two old Westchester County killings
have been linked to each other - and to a prison inmate - by
investigators who had to wait for DNA technology to catch up with
their suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   County Police Commissioner Louis D'Aliso said Wednesday that a
blood sample taken from Patrick Baxter, 31, connected him to the
slaying of a Yonkers girl in 1987 and a Tuckahoe woman in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''His DNA was linked to certain evidence found at the scene,''
the commissioner said. He would not elaborate, but both victims had
been sexually assaulted and The Journal News, which first reported
the story, said the evidence was semen collected from both bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter, who is serving a prison term for reckless endangerment
and possession of stolen property, has not been charged in the
killings and the office of District Attorney Jeanine Pirro would
not comment. D'Aliso said additional evidence is being sought but
he expects a grand jury to hear the case against Baxter ''in the
very near future.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no rush on this guy,'' he said. ''We don't think Mr.
Baxter's going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said detectives from the county force and the
Yonkers Police Department began working together in 1995 when they
compared cold cases and ''came up with some common notes of
interest'' - each had a killing in which Baxter had been a suspect:
</P>
<P>
   -Michelle Walker, 14, of Yonkers, was sexually assaulted and
strangled on June 5, 1987, while returning to her home after buying
pizza and milk. Baxter, 18 at the time, lived on the same block.
</P>
<P>
   -Lisa Gibbens, 25, was sexually assaulted and shot in the head
with a shotgun on July 17, 1990, on county property in Tuckahoe. It
was the village's first homicide in 15 years. Baxter's name came
up, though he was never charged, in connection with a shotgun
carjacking in nearby Yonkers a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been interested in Mr. Baxter for a number of years,''
D'Aliso said.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal News said the DNA sample taken from the 1987 crime
scene was too small to be tested under existing technology, even in
1995, so detectives decided to wait for a more advanced method. In
the past, a dime-sized sample was needed. Now, the sample can be as
little as a 16th of an inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   By this year, the county forensics lab was able to determine
that the same person was involved in both killings. The district
attorney's office then obtained a court order to test Baxter's DNA,
D'Aliso said. Baxter's lawyer, Eugene Traynor, fought the testing,
but an appellate judge refused to block it, and Baxter's blood was
drawn on Friday at a prison in Fishkill.
</P>
<P>
   Traynor did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, technicians matched Baxter's DNA to the crime-scene
evidence, rewarding the investigators' long pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Detectives from both police departments were bulldogs,'' the
commissioner said. ''The tenacity was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Walker's mother, Elaine, also praised the detectives,
saying, ''God sent them to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Baxter, she said, ''I hate him. I know I shouldn't, but I
hate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, an inmate at Sing Sing was linked through DNA
to a 21-year-old killing in Mount Vernon. That was the result of a
1999 law that added robbery to the list of offenses requiring a
convict to supply a DNA sample. Baxter's convictions are not
included in the law, so the court order was needed to obtain a DNA
sample.

<HEADLINE> Ballybunion To Host Irish Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALLYBUNION, Ireland (AP) -- The European Tour breaks new ground
this week when the Irish Open is played for the first time on the
links of the Old Course at Ballybunion.
</P>
<P>
   While the name may be the same as the Old Course at St. Andrews,
where the British Open is to be played in three weeks, Ballybunion
may turn out to be far tougher -- especially if the wind blows.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson invariably includes this links course in southwest
Ireland on his pre-Open itinerary. He fell in love with it years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''After playing Ballybunion for the first time, a man would
think the game of golf originated here,'' he said. ''There is wild
look to the place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other big names to play are defending champion Sergio Garcia,
past winners Ian Woosnam and Bernhard Langer and Darren Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   Most, though not all, of Europe's best will be there, the
exceptions being Colin Montgomerie, Lee Westwood and Paul Lawrie.
</P>
<P>
   Seve Ballesteros called the course ''a piece of art, a unique
stretch of land.
</P>
<P>
   ''It made me feel the same way as when I first saw St. Andrews.
The magic is the same,'' said the Spaniard, who won the second of
his three British Opens at St. Andrews in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The winner could be one of Ballesteros' two compatriots, Jose
Maria Olazabal or Miguel Angel Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   Irishman Padraig Harrington had never played the course before
this week. He is coming off a fifth-place finish in the U.S. Open
at Pebble Beach 11 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pebble Beach, then Ballybunion,'' he said. ''You don't always
have events at such great venues.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It asks every question of you,'' Harrington added. ''After 18
holes, you know you've been out there. It's very difficult
mentally.''

<HEADLINE> LeAnn Rimes Cancels Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Country's teen singing sensation LeAnn Rimes
is doubly blue.
</P>
<P>
   The ''How Do I Live'' singer had to cancel a 30-date concert
tour, and her parents are squabbling in court over who gets how
much of her millions.
</P>
<P>
   Rimes' tour was supposed to start July 13 in Mount Pleasant,
Mich., but her doctor diagnosed a strained right vocal cord and
ordered 60 to 90 days of vocal rest and therapy, publicist
Elizabeth Chanley said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old is hoping to reschedule some shows, Chanley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Dallas, Rimes' dad, Wilbur, is striking back at
her mom, Belinda.
</P>
<P>
   Belinda sued her ex-husband on her daughter's behalf in May,
saying he and a former manager, Lyle Walker, defrauded the singer
out of millions of dollars with an unfair and fraudulent contract.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur filed a petition Monday saying he and she split most of
the management and producer fees he received from their daughter's
career, and he has check stubs to prove it, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   LeAnn Rimes became a top star with the debut of her album
''Blue'' in 1996. She won Grammy awards in 1997 for best new artist
and best female country vocal.

<HEADLINE> 12 Russians Killed in Chechen Fight  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian soldiers pulled back from a battle
with a large group of rebels in Chechnya on Wednesday after two
days of close combat killed 12 Russians and wounded 16 others,
military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting began Monday when Russian Interior Ministry troops
approached the town of Serzhen Yurt, southeast of the capital of
Grozny,to conduct document checks and ran into a band of rebel
fighters in nearby woods, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   After a shootout, paratroopers and army special forces units
were rushed to the area and encircled the rebels, government
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two days of fighting in the forest ensued before troops pulled
back Wednesday to let federal artillery and fighter jets pound the
area, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The battle near Serzhen-Yurt was apparently the fiercest in
Chechnya in weeks. As of Wednesday, 12 Russian soldiers had been
killed and 16 wounded, military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzhembsky, speaking on NTV television, said the battle could
last for days, citing previous pitched fights in Chechnya's thick
beech forests.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are adept at evading detection in the wooded slopes
of their republic, which are lush with greenery in the warm
Chechnya summers. They hide in dugout shelters during the day and
move about at night, and have held off vastly larger Russian
detachments for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fighting is continuing,'' Yastrzhembsky said. ''The area
is tightly surrounded,'' while the Russians were bombarding the
rebels, he told NTV television.
</P>
<P>
   The military said up to 60 rebels had been killed by government
fire. The claims could not be confirmed, and Russian officials
often understate their casualties and overstate enemy losses.
</P>
<P>
   The battle began a day after Russia's top general in Chechnya,
Gennady Troshev, said Sunday that all coordinated rebel resistance
had abated.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Europe's top human rights watchdog is debating
suspending Russia's membership over the 9-month-old Chechnya war. A
vote is expected Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Council of Europe has already denied Russia voting rights
until progress is made in punishing perpetrators of human rights
violations in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces took control of lowland Chechnya soon after
entering the republic in September, but have stalled in the
southern mountains. Rebels, meanwhile, have continued hit-and-run
attacks behind Russian lines, inflicting casualties with ambushes,
sniping, car bombs and remote-controlled mines.
</P>
<P>
   Four Chechen men died Wednesday when a bomb exploded inside
their car near the village of Gremenchug, in the same district
where the fighting near Serzhen-Yurt was under way, the Interior
Ministry reported.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen fighters won de facto control of the breakaway region in
a 1994-96 war with Russian forces. Russian forces returned last
year after Chechnya-based militants attacked villages in the
neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, and after about 300 people
died in apartment bombings the government blames on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> French Parliament Targets Hunting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The French parliament adopted a law Wednesday
shortening the hunting season on migrating birds -- a first step
toward bringing France into line with European Union directives it
had been violating.
</P>
<P>
   The National Assembly passed the law 269-255, with 36 deputies
abstaining.
</P>
<P>
   The measure allows hunting from Aug. 10 through Feb. 10, shorter
than the previous July 14-Feb. 28 season. That should reduce the
period when the hunting season may overlap with birds' nesting
period.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the EU decided to take France to court for failing to
guarantee complete protection of wild birds during their return to
breeding grounds and during nesting and rearing.
</P>
<P>
   The new law did not pass without strong opposition. Hunters have
denounced Environment Minister Dominique Voynet, a member of the
Green party who drew up the bill, and at least one National
Assembly deputy used foul language Wednesday when referring to
Voynet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to shortening the hunting season, the law
temporarily lifts a ban on night hunting in some regions, makes
Wednesday a non-hunting day and lets landowners ban hunting on
their property and prevent hunters from crossing their lands.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Panel Backs Missile Plan  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of a Pentagon-appointed panel of
experts told Congress on Wednesday that he has no reservations
about the soundness of the technology behind the current plan for a
limited national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Gen. Larry Welch said his main concern remains
whether a 2005 timetable can be met for putting in place the first
20 interceptor missiles in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of work to be done,'' Welch told the House
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected to decide this fall whether to
begin construction of the missile shield system.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House news conference, Clinton said he still had not
made up his mind, ''but I will do so ... over the next several
weeks.'' Clinton said he has tried to say as little as possible
about the decision and wants to ''keep our options open.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also praised North Korea for seeking to normalize
relations with South Korea -- but suggested it was not a reason to
back away from the missile shield program, designed to protect
against attacks from unpredictable nations like North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''They still have a missile program. And so it's still something
that the United States has to be mindful of and to prepare and to
deal with and ... to keep up with,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial U.S. test flight is scheduled for next week in the
South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   In the congressional testimony, Welch as well as current
Pentagon officials presented a generally upbeat assessment of
progress on the missile shield program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are continuing with the schedule we have now, based on both
his (Welch's) assessment and our own, that we have the ability to
meet the 2005 date if things go according to plan,'' said Jacques
Gansler, the Pentagon's top technology official.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who charge that the system cannot be technologically
feasible simply do not have all the information they need to make
such a conclusion,'' Gansler said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has suggested that some unpredictable emerging nuclear
powers, such as North Korea, may have ballistic missiles in place
capable of reaching the continental United States by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the missile defense system have used the Welch
panel's report to bolster their arguments that a decision on
deployment should be put off at least until the next
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But Welch, in his first public comments on the matter, suggested
that his report -- most of which remains classified -- had been
mischaracterized by some on both sides of the issue. ''It's a
reasonably balanced report,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe capable technical abilities are in hand. We say
that without caveats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, as to meeting the 2005 schedule, ''there is a lot of
risk,'' he added. Defense Secretary William Cohen and other
Pentagon officials have expressed the same concern.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, asserted that the missile defense project would be
further along now if the Clinton administration hadn't been so
devoted to upholding the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Spence called the ABM Treaty ''a Cold War relic entered into
with a country that doesn't exist any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's optimistic assessment came amid increasing calls
for Clinton to leave the decision to the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George Bush, the GOP contender, has proposed an even
larger-scale system than the administration is contemplating.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., a strong missile
defense advocate, recently told reporters he wouldn't be that upset
if Clinton left the decision to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, senior Democrat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said he may introduce a resolution in
the Senate calling for Clinton to leave the decision to whomever
wins November's election, whether it's Bush or Democratic contender
Al Gore.

<HEADLINE> Wednesday's Supreme Court Briefs  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Supreme Court took these actions Wednesday:
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- Narrowly struck down Nebraska's ban on ''partial-birth''
abortions -- a decision sure to escalate the bitter national debate
over abortion. By a 5-4 vote, the justices said the law violates
women's constitutional rights by imposing an ''undue burden'' on
their decisions to end their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gave states greater leeway to restrict anti-abortion
demonstrations outside health clinics, upholding 6-3 a Colorado law
that bars people from counseling, distributing leaflets or
displaying signs within 8 feet of others without their consent
whenever they are within 100 feet of a health clinic entrance.
</P>
<P>
   -- Said the Boy Scouts can bar homosexuals from serving as troop
leaders, in a 5-4 ruling that may also let the organization reject
gay boys as members. The justices said forcing the Scouts to accept
gay troop leaders would violate the organization's rights of free
expression and free association under the Constitution's First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   -- Decided 6-3 that taxpayer money can be used to buy computers
and other instructional materials for religious schools. The
decision lowered the figurative wall of separation between church
and state and should speed federal efforts to connect every
American classroom to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   -- Rejected a last-ditch effort by Elian Gonzalez's Miami
relatives to keep the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor in this
country, ending a seven-month international custody battle. The
court turned down a formal appeal by the Miami relatives and a
separate emergency request aimed at postponing his departure. The
action was announced in a brief order.

<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Russians Olga Brusnikina and Maria
Kisseleva turned in a sparkling performance Wednesday to win the
technical routine in synchronized swimming's duet competition at
the European Swimming Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Competing in the 12-day meet's opening event before a sparse
crowd in Helsinki's new swimming arena, the defending champions
collected 34.650 points from the judges.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just the beginning and I don't know what will happen
after tomorrow,'' Kisseleva said. ''But our coaches said it was not
bad, so it's good for us. We believe our coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginie Dedieu and Myriam Lignot, former European champions
from France and runners-up last year, were second with 33.908
points followed by Italians Alessia Lucchini and Maurizia Cecconi
with 33.250 points.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the duet, the free routine, is Saturday with
the final set for later that day. The top 12 pairs out of 19
advance to the final, when only the free routine is performed.
Points from the first two sessions are not carried over to the
final.
</P>
<P>
   The European Championships is the last major meet before the

<HEADLINE> Political Secrets in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- The opposition movement that made
sweeping gains in Zimbabwe's weekend elections has denounced
President Robert Mugabe's economic policies, his decision to send
troops to the Congo and his threats to seize white farms.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition, called the Movement for Democratic Change,
has given few details of its own policies. It plans to keep its
strategies secret at least until it stands across the aisle from
the ruling party in Zimbabwe's colonial-style parliament house.
</P>
<P>
   Movement leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who was defeated in the
legislative election but will run in the 2002 presidential
election, said Wednesday the party will take immediate legal action
to contest 10 election results that they alleged were rigged. He
also announced that party vice president Gibson Sibanda will lead
the parliamentary opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement released after party leaders met for the
first time since they won 57 seats this weekend, Tsvangirai offered
no insights into what their parliamentary strategy will be.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our real work begins now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The labor-backed party Tsvangirai formed just nine months ago is
wise not to show its hand, said Brian Kagoro, legal adviser in the
National Constitutional Assembly, a coalition of reform groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's smart. If there's a time to be ambivalent, it's now,''
Kagoro said. ''Mugabe still controls the coercive arms of the state
and on past form he has never hesitated to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, he said, could be tempted to get into a
''bare-fisted fight'' with Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African National
Union Patriotic Front to appease voters it attracted by tapping
into popular anger, especially among younger voters.
</P>
<P>
   But ''they would be well advised to marry activism with
constraint and, more importantly, work toward building their
experience and public profile,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bruising campaign leading up to the parliamentary vote here
left at least 30 people dead and thousands driven from their homes.
Despite alleged voter intimidation, the Movement for Democratic
Change managed to capitalize on discontent with the floundering
economy to make huge gains.
</P>
<P>
   The MDC will control 57 of 150 seats in the new parliament, up
from just three before the vote. It is the first time since
Zimbabwe achieved independence 20 years ago that any opposition has
won enough seats to prevent the ruling party from achieving a
two-thirds majority -- the margin needed to change the constitution
and entrench the autocratic president's powers.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition candidates fell short of the majority needed to
force Mugabe and his party to adopt economic reforms. Mugabe's
party won 62 seats, and the constitution permits him to appoint 30
members to the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   During the election campaign, Tsvangirai's party promised to
fight to restore law and order. Mugabe has allowed ruling party
militants to occupy hundreds of white-owned farms illegally. The
opposition says it also wants to rebuild strained relations with
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Tsvangirai said Tuesday, his newly elected
lawmakers will lead a campaign for change and accountability in
government.
</P>
<P>
   With their new strength, opposition lawmakers should be able to
force the ruling party to disclose policies that until now were not
questioned or publicly aired. Tsvangirai said among these are the
costly and unpopular deployment of 11,000 Zimbabwe troops to back
President Laurent Kabila in the distant Congo civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe had one of Africa's strongest economies at independence
in 1980. Today, it is wracked by corruption and economic
mismanagement. Unemployment and inflation have soared and fuel and
hard currency shortages have crippled agriculture, industry and
transportation.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Brings Message of Hope  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE GANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Lance Armstrong saw a message of hope in his Tour
de France victory last year -- an affirmation of life that touched
millions.
</P>
<P>
   With its daunting Alpine peaks and winding passes, the
millennial edition of cycling's premier race, which begins
Saturday, will give the Texan who defeated cancer a chance to
reaffirm the message he pronounced on the victory podium on the
Champs-Elysees:
</P>
<P>
   ''We can return to what we were before, and even better.''
</P>
<P>
   That could serve as the mantra for the 180 riders in the 87th
Tour, a grueling three-week trek around France.
</P>
<P>
   It also could serve as a motto for the Tour, still trying to
recover from a doping scandal that nearly did in the 1998
competition and sullied the image of a beloved summer ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers are so determined to clean up the Tour, they decided
to test for the banned performance-enhancing hormone
erythropoietin, or EPO, which was at the center of the 1998 scandal
-- even though there is no approved testing method. Urine samples
are to be saved for analysis once the test is validated, probably
in three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the current situation, I don't think we can be more
dissuasive than this,'' the head of the International Cycling
Federation, Hein Verbruggen, told the French sports daily L'Equipe.
</P>
<P>
   Even Armstrong was not spared sneers last year in the French
media, suspicious that drugs helped him to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong replied, indirectly, in a recently published
autobiography ''It's Not About The Bike,'' written with Sally
Jenkins, and, directly, in a television commercial for Nike.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody wants to know what I am on. What am I on? I'm on my
bike ... six hours a day,'' goes the ad.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, subtitled ''My Journey Back to Life,'' Armstrong
says he was transformed in a ''second life'' with his recovery from
testicular cancer. The cancer, diagnosed in 1996, spread to his
abdomen, lungs and brain.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he would rather have the title of cancer survivor
than winner of the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The counterclockwise tour around France -- with five high
mountain climbs -- starts at Futuroscope in the west with the
traditional time trial. It dips into Switzerland -- Lausanne -- and
Germany -- Fribourg-En-Briscau -- on its 18th and 19th legs after
moving through central France, the Basque country, the southern
Provence region and northward through the Alps. There are two rest
days and two transfers -- one by plane and one by train.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,250-mile course is 36 miles shorter than last year's.
However, Dan Osipow, operations director for Armstrong's U.S.
Postal Service team, said he considers the course about 10 percent
harder, due notably to three mountaintop finishes and a July 4 team
time trial.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain stages, one ending at the ski resort of Courchevel,
could prove ominous, and the 14th stage, at Briancon, with three
6,000-foot-plus peaks, could decide the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Unknowns on the 2000 Tour include some strong climbers and
riders who have been lying low.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Tour winner, Deutsche Telecom's Jan Ullrich -- who did
not ride in last year's tour -- is back, as is Italian cycling star
Marco Pantani, winner of Italy's Giro and the Tour de France in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani and Frenchman Richard Virenque, riding for Polti, are
both known for their climbing skills and are embroiled in the legal
aftermath of doping scandals.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Pantani was ordered to stand trial for his alleged use
of EPO in a 1995 race. Virenque and nine others are to appear
before a French court in October in connection with the 1998 Tour
scandal that exploded around his former Festina team.
</P>
<P>
   Among the less-visible but still-skillful riders who have chance
of pulling an upset are French star Laurent Jalabert and Spain's
Abraham Olano, both riding for Spain's ONCE team; and Belgian
Franck Vandenbroucke of France's Cofidis.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service team is confident.
</P>
<P>
   Osipow said the team has been streamlined to meet this Tour's
demands. Armstrong -- not known as a climber -- is backed by Tyler
Hamilton, winner of the Dauphine Libere in June, with Armstrong,
who supported him, placing third.
</P>
<P>
   An addition to U.S. Postal, Frenchman Cedric Vasseur is known
for his climbing skills, while Russian Vjatceslav Ekimov is a
strong time-trial rider.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong ''physically, is at least equal to what he was last
year,'' said Osipow. ''And we feel, mentally, he is stronger than
last year.''

<HEADLINE> A life of crime -- and eluding police -- ends with apparent drug overdose </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - On his first day on the lam, Jamal Hightower
managed to steal some clothes and score some drugs. On his second
day, Hightower was found dead of an apparent drug overdose in the
Bronx, wearing a stolen Rite Aid vest.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange end for a man who had some success - at least
for a time - at running away from police.
</P>
<P>
   His body was in a park across from the 40th Precinct
stationhouse Wednesday, blood pouring out of his nose, drug
paraphernalia strewn about him. The medical examiner's office will
determine the exact cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   In April, he had held police at bay, shooting at them and using
a woman as a human shield during a terror-filled chase in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the 24-year-old Bronx native apparently faked
seizures - using an Alka Seltzer tablet to create foaming at the
mouth - and was taken to a Bronx hospital. Early Tuesday, he
managed to walk calmly out of the emergency room, eluding three
corrections officers.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower's body was found near a shopping bag filled with
clothes he had apparently stolen, police said. Why he was wearing
the drugstore vest remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The police and court cases are now closed, but the city
Corrections Department has suspended its three officers pending a
review of how Hightower escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower's life of crime began with robberies. In 1994, he was
arrested for a pair of robberies, where he also sexually abused his
victims. He was paroled in September 1998, having served two-thirds
of his sentence. But after assaulting his parole officer in October
1999, Hightower went back to prison, then was paroled on March 15.
Six weeks later, he graduated to attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, Hightower and two men went to the Bronx apartment
of Michael Ortiz where they got into a fight. Hightower stabbed
Ortiz and his mother, Miriam Ortiz, apparently over drugs.
</P>
<P>
   With a gun stolen from Ortiz, Hightower and his friends fled.
When they saw a police cruiser, Hightower opened fire. Officers
fired back, and a bystander was struck in the face; he remains in a
coma.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower fled with police in pursuit. Hightower then boarded an
out-of-service city bus and held a gun to the driver's head, but
the driver ran to safety. Back on the street, Hightower headed for
the Metro-North railroad tracks near Fordham University.
Hightower's two friends were captured, but he grabbed a bystander,
used her as a human shield, and fired once at police. A detective
fired back and missed.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower released his hostage, jumped onto the tracks, but was
finally nabbed as he tried to climb a fence. Hightower was taken to
Rikers Island, where he remained until he faked his seizure.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, where he spent
the night. Shortly before 7 a.m. Tuesday, Hightower asked to go to
the bathroom and his leg shackles were removed. Hightower then
pushed his way past two of the officers - the third was not in the
area - and fled down the eighth-floor hallway. Hightower was seen
on a surveillance tape leaving through the emergency room entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower eluded police for a day, despite a search for him.
Then Wednesday morning, police received a complaint about a drunken
man on a park bench. Officers responded and noticed the resemblance
to Hightower, down to a scar on his right cheek. Fingerprints
confirmed the dead man's identity.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Disclosure Bill Passed  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After an overwhelming vote in the House, the
Senate is poised to approve legislation that would force popular
but secretive groups to disclose the money sources of their
television commercials and other political activities.
</P>
<P>
   Senate GOP leaders, who have fought the measure, have agreed to
a quick vote on the bill, although there was talk Wednesday of a
delay until after lawmakers' July Fourth recess, said Sen. Russell
Feingold, one of the measure's backers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great victory that will give us substantial momentum
for broader campaign finance reform,'' said Feingold, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The bill cleared the House early Wednesday by a 385-39 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Senators have approved similar legislation and passing the House
version would send the bill to President Clinton, who is ready to
sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold said that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott pushed for
an agreement that would permit a vote if key campaign finance
reformers Feingold and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., would not push
any other such legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We rejected out of hand,'' Feingold said. ''This is about
momentum to do more if possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would require disclosure of groups that organize
under section 527 of the tax code, which allows nonprofit groups to
run campaign-style commercials as long as they do not directly
advocate the election or defeat of any candidates.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, at a White House news conference Wednesday,
praised the House vote. The legislation, he said, will shine light
on ''mysterious interest groups whose financial backers are cloaked
in secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the disclosure measure note that every day of
delay allows groups to collect more secret cash. Even if a bill
does become law, groups will not have to disclose the names of
anyone who donates money before the legislation is signed.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has a ''very narrow window'' to pass the legislation in
time for disclosure to mean anything for the 2000 elections, said
Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas. He suggested opponents purposely have
delayed the bill to keep the cash rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill approved Wednesday is similar to Democrats'
originally proposal. Republican leaders blocked those efforts,
saying the legislation should be broadened to include unions and
other nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats complained that if unions were included,
corporations should be, too. Republicans balked.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also complained that such a broad bill was probably
unconstitutional. The GOP version included year-round nonprofit
activity, whereas Democrats wanted to limit it to activity within a
month or two of an election.
</P>
<P>
   ''You shoot as high as you possibly can and end up with
something the majority feels is the best practical solution,'' said
Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., who led the Republican effort.
</P>
<P>
   The final legislation covers any 527 group that raises at least
$25,000 a year. It requires those that do not already report to the
Federal Election Commission to report to the Internal Revenue
Service, which will make the reports public.
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 is reserved for political groups, giving them
certain tax advantages. It was created for political parties and
political action committees, which report their spending to the
FEC.
</P>
<P>
   But a new brand of 527 reports to no one. As far as the FEC is
concerned, these groups claim to be involved in issues, not
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Other nonprofits also avoid disclosure with the FEC by claiming
to be involved in issues, although they also spend large sums on
television ads that attempt to influence elections. Still, unlike
527s, these other groups do face some limit on how much political
activity they can conduct without losing their nonprofit tax
status.
</P>
<P>
   Using a 527, a pair of Texas brothers ran $2.5 million in ads
praising Texas Gov. George W. Bush and attacking McCain in the days
before a crucial GOP primary election. Another 527, with ties to
House Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, is assisting a variety of
Republicans running for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who did not participate in the House debate, said in a
statement that the bill ''is reality nothing more than a last-ditch
effort by the Democrats to protect their vulnerable incumbent
members from valid attacks on their positions and beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4762.

<HEADLINE> Russian Economic Program Approved  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's Cabinet on Wednesday approved an
ambitious 10-year economic reform plan with a pro-market bent
likely to please foreign lenders -- but analysts said it may end up
existing only on paper.
</P>
<P>
   The plan urges introduction of private land ownership, an end to
barter, encouragement of greater competition and firm guarantees
against re-nationalization of private property. It also envisages
social reforms designed to narrow the huge divide between the
nation's rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan contains few details of how the government will
implement its goals in a country that had one of the world's
worst-performing economies over the past decade. Russia's
bureaucracy and rampant corruption have proved immune to several
previous reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''This program is rather general, and rather contradictory,''
said Natalya Orlova, an economic analyst with Alfa-Bank. ''There
are different views within the government on what should be done,
and the program includes only compromises. So there is a very big
question about how it will be realized.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk that reforms will be purely cosmetic is very high,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the approval of the program lifts the main stumbling
block in Russia's talks with the International Monetary Fund, which
has refused to discuss more loans with Russia until the government
presents a detailed economic program.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement with the IMF will also clear the way for
negotiations with other lenders, most immediately the Paris Club of
government creditors, which is considering alleviating Russia's
huge debt burden.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has missed a number of payments to the Paris Club and
other creditors, but tried to stay current on its IMF loans. The
Finance Ministry reported paying $60 million to the fund on
Wednesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The draft program calls for a minimum of 5 percent growth
annually, which would lead to a 150 percent increase in the gross
domestic product by 2010. Inflation is to be held to a maximum of
10 percent annually, and internal investment should rise by 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   As one way of attracting investment and preventing capital
flight, the plan proposes a law that would guarantee that
privatization results will not be reversed. Many Russians resent
post-Soviet privatization, which has enriched a few insiders, but
Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said most deals were legal and
would stay in place.
</P>
<P>
   ''The privatization processes that took place, took place on the
basis of laws ... And even if these laws and regulations seem
imperfect from today's point of view, there can be no talk of
reversing privatization results,'' Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
   The program also calls for Russians' private bank accounts to be
guaranteed by the state. Many Russians lost their savings in the
1998 economic crisis, which saw the bank system virtually collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''A market economy is not a goal in itself, but a method of
providing benefits for all the citizens of the country,'' Kasyanov
told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The government will introduce supporting legislation for the
reform plan in the fall, Kasyanov said.

<HEADLINE> Gay Eagle Scout Loses Court Fight  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- James Dale fought the Boy Scouts of America
for 10 years, then fell one Supreme Court vote shy of forcing the
90-year-old organization to change its ways.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss Wednesday, Dale sounded more nostalgic than
bitter about the group that expelled him for being gay.
</P>
<P>
   ''The program they are saying they are today is not the program
I joined when I was 8 years old,'' Dale said hours after the court
rejected his challenge to the Scouts' policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was a kid,'' he said, ''the Boy Scouts made me feel
very good about myself and gave me self-respect and self-esteem,
which all kids need.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boys Scouts consider homosexuality contrary to their oath
requiring scouts to be ''morally straight.'' Dale challenged the
policy and the fight culminated with the high court's 5-4 decision
that the Scouts can bar homosexuals from serving as troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Dale, an Eagle Scout who became a troop leader after turning 18,
said the Boy Scouts will ultimately suffer for the exclusionary
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dinosaurs became extinct because they didn't evolve,'' he
said. ''The Boy Scouts are making themselves extinct, and that's a
very sad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale, 29, lives in New York City and is advertising director for
POZ magazine, which addresses the needs of people who are
HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers called him an ''exemplary Eagle Scout.'' His first
scoutmaster, Norman Powell, now 85 and slowed by a stroke, said
through his wife Elizabeth that Dale was ''a first-class scout.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That is one wonderful young man,'' Mrs. Powell said. ''It
shouldn't have happened to him in this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in April after the Supreme Court heard
arguments in the case, Dale said he does not consider himself the
leader of a movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only person I am is me, and I've always been true to
myself, and I think that's the most important thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dale -- who changed his name before the dispute with the scouts --
grew up in New Jersey, the younger of two sons of Gerald Dick, a
lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, and his wife Doris.
</P>
<P>
   He was a Cub Scout at 8, a Boy Scout at 11, an Eagle Scout at
17. At 18, he became an assistant scoutmaster.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from a military high school, Dale attended
Rutgers University. He accepted his homosexuality the summer
between his freshman and sophomore years and joined the campus gay
and lesbian organization, becoming co-president after three months.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that capacity that Dale attended a daylong conference
in 1990 on the struggles of lesbian and gay adolescents. A story on
the conference in the July 8, 1990, Newark Star-Ledger quoted Dale
describing his difficult path toward accepting his homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The article drew the attention of officials at the Monmouth
Council of the Boy Scouts, which 16 months earlier had made Dale an
assistant scoutmaster of Troop 73 in Matawan, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The council revoked Dale's registration, citing ''the standards
for leadership established by the Boy Scouts of America, which
specifically forbid membership to homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale sued the scouts under a 1992 New Jersey law protecting the
civil rights of gay people.
</P>
<P>
   He lost round one in 1995, but last year the New Jersey Supreme
Court ruled unanimously in Dale's favor. The court called the Boy
Scouts a public accommodation to which anti-discrimination laws
apply.
</P>
<P>
   But a majority of Supreme Court justices said the New Jersey law
must yield to the Scout organization's right of ''expressive
association'' under the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Dale said his case forced the Boy Scouts to be explicit about
its policy toward gays and created a void that can be filled by
more inclusive youth groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gay kids needs resources,'' he said. ''Gay kids are coming out
at younger and younger ages.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Execs Testify Before House  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oil company executives insisted Wednesday in
congressional testimony that short supplies and high demand caused
the skyrocketing gasoline prices in the Midwest and strongly denied
any collusion to drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, which is
investigating the gasoline pricing, said the agency has begun
issuing subpoenas to refiners, pipeline operators and others in the
production and distribution chain to try to determine if companies
acted illegally in raising prices.
</P>
<P>
   So far there isn't ''any obvious complete explanation,'' FTC
Chairman Robert Pitofsky told members of the House Commerce
Committee. While he promised an interim report by the end of July,
he warned the investigation ''is not a quick fix'' to solving the
price spike mystery.
</P>
<P>
   High oil and gasoline prices and what is being done about them
dominated no fewer than three House committees Wednesday with
administration witnesses jumping from one hearing to the next. Some
lawmakers, mostly Democrats, accused the industry of price gouging,
while Republicans largely blamed EPA regulations for cleaner
burning gasoline and a lack of domestic oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Oil company executive, testifying for the first time on Capitol
Hill since the high Midwest gasoline prices unleashed an uproar
among lawmakers two weeks ago, said they are unfairly being
vilified.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are doing everything we can to meet our supply commitments
during this peak driving season,'' insisted Ross Pillari, vice
president for BP Amoco, adding that the supply system ''has become
very stressed'' and any unusual event ''can cause product
shortages.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil executives and key Clinton administration officials,
appearing before the House Commerce Committee, disagreed sharply
over the impact government-mandated cleaner burning gasoline has
had on supplies and prices in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Both Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and EPA Administrator
Carol Browner said no explanation had yet been given why the new
blend of cleaner gas should have caused a steep price increase when
the new fuel should cost no more than 8 cents to produce.
Reformulated gas outside the Midwest is about the same as
conventional gasoline, said Browner.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that the cleaner burning gasoline is not the problem.
We know ethanol (an additive to the gas, especially in the Midwest)
is not the problem,'' she insisted.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry Thompson, senior vice president of Citgo Petroleum
Corp., complained about a ''patchwork quilt of regulations'' that
is forcing refiners to produce many different blends of gasoline in
different parts of the country. This prevents easy movement of
fuels into areas with shortages, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive, J. Louis Frank, president of Marathon Ashland
Petroleum Co., blamed the ''fragile nature'' of gasoline refining
and distribution in parts of the Midwest where a fourth of the
demand must be met from outside the region.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that refinery and distribution problems this
spring exacerbated the supply picture in the Midwest just as the
industry was preparing for the heavy summer driving season.
</P>
<P>
   Refiners ''no longer have the flexibility to quickly shift
supply to areas of greatest need,'' Thompson argued.
</P>
<P>
   But the oil executives acknowledged that while refineries are
running at full capacity now -- about 96 percent in the Midwest,
according to the Energy Department -- some refiners pulled back on
producing reformulated gasoline this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said one Citgo refinery had the ability to produce
15,000 barrels per day of summer grade, cleaner burning gasoline,
but production was cut to 4,000 barrels a day to avoid problems
with a patent controversy.

<HEADLINE> Federal agency warns water systems to do quality reports  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A federal agency warned nearly 400 water
systems throughout New York to provide customers with reports on
the quality of their drinking water by this Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday the
systems were supposed to have had the water quality reports to
customers by Oct. 19, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Fox, EPA's regional administrator, said the rate of
noncompliance in New York with that requirement was about 16
percent of the approximately 2,400 water systems in the state. She
called that percentage ''relatively high.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Fox noted that most of the recalcitrant water systems
were tiny ones covering only a few customers each. Ninety-nine
percent of New York's water consumers have had systems generate the
reports, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The list used by EPA was compiled by the state Health
Department. The EPA has the power to enforce the water quality
reports and other requirements established in amendments in 1996 to
the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   The water reports are designed to provide people with
information about the purity of the drinking water and details of
any instances where federal water quality standards were violated
within the past year. If there were such instances, the effects on
human health of the contaminants must also be provided, EPA
spokeswoman Mary Mears said.
</P>
<P>
   The first report went out by Oct. 19, 1999, and by this
Saturday, July 1, water systems throughout New York are supposed to
send out their second reports. Mears said that under the 1996
federal law, the July 1 date will become the deadline for annual
reports in subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   Any residents get a water bill are also supposed to get the
water quality reports. Some larger systems have also posted theirs
on the Internet, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   Mears said scores of water systems in the state have generated
the required reports since warnings went out from the EPA in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, the EPA's regional office reported that 187
systems were still not in compliance and 26 others were not public
water systems in the meaning of the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the systems served small areas such as trailer parks,
mobile home parks, housing developments or apartment complexes and
institutions like adult homes.
</P>
<P>
   Mears said the districts are subject to penalties including
fines if they ignore the reporting requirements but she could not
say what the range of those fines would be.

<HEADLINE> Nevada Bet Regs May Be Altered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- A longtime ban on casinos taking bets
on Nevada's university teams could be eliminated as Gov. Kenny
Guinn seeks to quiet congressional foes of wagering on college
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ''Removal of the regulation will be discussed in the near
future,'' said Nevada Gaming Commission chairman Brian Sandoval.
''It is ripe for reconsideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandoval talked this week with Guinn, state Gaming Control Board
chairman Steve DuCharme and board member Bobby Siller on strategy
to stop congressional legislation to outlaw collegiate sports
betting.
</P>
<P>
   A bill banning betting on college sports, sought by the NCAA,
may be dead in Congress this session, but Guinn is looking for ways
to bury the antigambling legislation forever.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional proponents suggest Nevada is hypocritical because
it bans betting on the state's college teams but allows wagering on
all other schools. They say Nevada protects its own athletes
against possible corruption but not those in the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Sandoval said the state regulation banning betting on Nevada
teams is 50 years old. It was adopted when there were only about
200,000 people in the state and there was a closeness with the
athletic teams. There was a perception, he said, that insider
information would be available.
</P>
<P>
   Sandoval said he's confident the present state regulatory system
can guard against Nevada teams being involved in point-shaving or
throwing games, if the betting ban was lifted. The chairman noted
that it's not legal to bet on in-state teams in Nevada, but those
who want to place wagers can make them in Mexico or the Caribbean.

<HEADLINE> US Ski Team, Malls Sign Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The U.S. Ski and Snowboard Teams have some
new sponsors -- two downtown malls.
</P>
<P>
   The teams signed a three-year marketing alliance this week
allowing ZCMI Center Mall and Crossroads Plaza to use the teams'
logo to promote and market their properties.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the teams are allowed to sell their licensed
products throughout the malls, which have 230 retail stores and
some 10 million visitors per year.
</P>
<P>
   All coins tossed into the malls' wishing wells will also go
directly to the ski and snowboard teams.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to increase exposure and generate revenue for
athletes training for the 2002 Winter Games.

   ''It's harder and harder to tap into corporate dollars,'' said
David Johnston, U.S. Ski Team licensing manager. ''Partnering up
with the downtown malls will help us attract additional sponsorship
and create fund-raising opportunities.''

<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A man convicted of selling $20 worth of
drugs three decades ago who fled to Canada returned to court
Wednesday where he was sentenced to four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Harvie Richardson, 50, and his wife pleaded for leniency
before Monroe County Court Judge John J. Connell. The judge said
his decision ''brings me no happiness'' but that he had no choice
but to order Richardson to complete his initial sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Richardson sold LSD to an undercover police officer at
the Rochester Institute of Technology, where he was a student.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's defense lawyer that he deserves mercy because he
became an exemplary citizen and poses no threat to society.
</P>
<P>
   ''The man who is coming to court is a very different man from
the young, impetuous and reckless student of 30 years ago,''
Michael Kennedy told the Democrat and Chronicle of Rochester, who
is Richardson's lawyer in Vancouver, where Richardson has lived
since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also argued his incarceration will have a dire effect
on his wife, Amalia, who suffers from breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've tried to be a good man and a just man,'' Richardson said
at the sentencing. He told the court he was sorry for the acts of a
''foolish, radical young man'' and decided to surrender to make
peace with the justice system and pay his debt to society.
</P>
<P>
   Letters of support for Richardson could be reviewed by a parole
board to help determine when he could be released. District
Attorney Howard R. Relin, who opposed setting aside the sentence,
said Richardson likely could be released within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Relin was unavailable for comment after the sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting Richardson's arguments previously and ordering his
surrender to finish his sentence, Connell said Richardson needs to
take responsibility for his actions and shouldn't be rewarded for
escaping.
</P>
<P>
   Because Richardson was a prison escapee, he could have been
taken into custody when he entered the United States. He was
allowed to voluntarily surrender.
</P>
<P>
   When he was convicted in 1971 of selling for $20 worth of LSD,
the New York City native and Vietnam War protester served six weeks
in Attica Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison. He then
was transferred to Camp Georgetown, a minimum-security work camp in
Madison County.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was at the work camp for six weeks when the riot and
retaking of Attica killed 43 inmates and correctional officers. He
said he walked away from the camp and fled to Canada when a guard
told him that he would return to Attica.
</P>
<P>
   The past of the research technologist who lives in a $700,000
home was revealed in 1998 when New York authorities tracked him to
Vancouver. Because Richardson had not changed his citizenship,
Canadian immigration authorities ordered him to leave.

<HEADLINE> Blood Thinner May Reduce Cancer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The common blood thinner warfarin may ward off
cancer in people being treated for blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that are still a mystery, people who suffer clots in
their legs or lungs run a substantially higher than usual risk of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A new study found that treatment with warfarin, also known as
Coumadin, appears to cut this risk, though how it might do this is
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish doctors who conducted the study said their work
''strongly supports the impression'' that the drug has an
anticancer effect, although they conceded that ''this idea will
remain controversial in the absence of a demonstrated biochemical
explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, directed by Dr. Sam Schulman of Karolinska Hospital
in Stockholm, was published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The research involved 854 patients who had suffered either
deep-vein thrombosis in a leg or a pulmonary embolism, a clot that
blocks an artery that supplies the lungs. Half got warfarin for six
weeks, the rest for six months.
</P>
<P>
   During six years of follow-up, cancer was diagnosed in 16
percent of the patients who received warfarin for six weeks and in
10 percent of those who got the drug for six months. The biggest
reduction was in cancer of the kidney, bladder, prostate, ovaries
and uterus.
</P>
<P>
   A Veterans Administration study in the early 1980s looked at the
same question but reached less sweeping conclusions. It found that
warfarin seemed to improve survival in people with small-cell lung
cancer but not other kinds of malignancy.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in the journal, written by Drs. Christoph C.
Zielinski and Michael Hejna of University Hospital in Vienna, said
warfarin's potential is worth further study. But it cautioned
against offering the medicine yet as a way to prevent cancer.

<HEADLINE> Religious School Computers Ruled OK  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government can provide computers for
religious schools, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in a decision
that significantly narrowed the constitutionally required
separation of religion and government.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 ruling was praised by supporters of private school
tuition vouchers -- government initiatives to help parents of
children who do not attend public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said a Louisiana parish can distribute money for
instructional equipment -- including computers, books, maps, and
film strip projectors -- to private schools as long as it's done in
a ''secular, neutral and nonideological'' way.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the majority of the court has signaled that school
vouchers are constitutional,'' said Matthew Berry, a lawyer with
the Institute for Justice. He defended, among other programs being
challenged in lower courts, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's statewide plan
to give parents of poor children money for private schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Removing the constitutional cloud from school choice will
encourage more legislatures to support such programs,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics warned against giving religious schools and their
missions new access to the public treasury.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Supreme Court certainly took a sledgehammer to the wall of
separation between church and state today,'' said the Rev. Barry W.
Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of
Church and State. ''The silver lining is that this decision gives
no aid or comfort to voucher supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Public school officials Wednesday lamented they could be sued
over Bible lessons that show up on computers they've bought.
</P>
<P>
   ''A computer contains instructional content that no one can
monitor,'' said Anne Bryant, executive director of the National
School Boards Association. ''Once you are connected to the
Internet, this technology could be used for religious
instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The association, representing the nearly 15,000 boards entrusted
with spending a school systems' money, filed a friend-of-the-court
brief with the Supreme Court, arguing that the separation of church
and state forbids public funds from being diverted to religious
schools in any form, including technology and computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the court's main
opinion: ''We see no basis for concluding that Jefferson Parish's
Chapter 2 program 'has the effect of advancing religion.' ...
Chapter 2 does not result in governmental indoctrination, because
it determines eligibility for aid neutrally, allocates that aid
based on the private choices of the parents of schoolchildren. ...
Nor does Chapter 2 define its recipients by reference to
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy in an
extraordinarily sweeping opinion that would allow almost any
government aid to religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen G. Breyer -- who
supplied the critical votes to reach a majority on the nine-member
court -- refused to go that far. In an opinion by O'Connor, they
called the Thomas opinion's ''expansive scope ... troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg dissented.
</P>
<P>
   The court's latest word on public funding for private
schoolchildren overturns two previous Supreme Court bans on giving
public materials to parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   Three parish taxpayers had relied heavily on those cases when
they sued federal, state and local officials in 1985. Parents of
the religious school children were backed by the Clinton
administration, which sought to defend its $425 million program to
connect every American classroom, in public and private schools, to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Religious school leaders welcomed the inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Internet is a global classroom to which all students --
public and private -- must have entry,'' said Leonard DeFiore,
president of the National Catholic Schools Association, adding that
3 million children in 9,000 parishes will benefit. ''It would be
tragic if parents had to choose a religious education, but the
price would be their children didn't have access to the best
educational tools.''

<HEADLINE> Ebersol: NBC Will Turn Profit Games  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It won't be live. It will be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Sports expects to make money with its broadcasts of the
Sydney Olympics, where all the action will be tape-delayed for U.S.
audiences half a world away.
</P>
<P>
   NBC paid $705 million for the rights to the 2000 Olympics, which
will run Sept. 15-Oct. 1, as part of a $3.5 billion package that
gives the network exclusive U.S. broadcast rights to the next five
games, through 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the time of the deal, we anticipated losing money with
Sydney, in the environs of $50-$75 million,'' NBC Sports chairman
Dick Ebersol said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are already assured of a small profit. Our (advertising)
sales target for these games was $780 million, $100 more than
Atlanta, where $680 million was a record in terms of gross sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still selling and we anticipate closing up around Labor
Day at just over $900 million.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the IOC bribery scandal, centering on Salt Lake City's
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics, ''never affected our
sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol spoke at a news conference held -- inappropriately enough
-- at the studio used for ''Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be nothing live about NBC's coverage from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the 15-hour time difference between Sydney and the
East Coast, and the number of evening finals at the Summer
Olympics, particularly in higher-profile events such as swimming
and track, all competition will be shown on tape.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for the 162&AMP;frac12; hours on NBC plus the 279 on cable
outfits MSNBC (214) and CNBC (65). There is a slightly decreased
number of hours from the 1996 Atlanta Olympics on NBC proper (171&AMP;frac12;)
-- but more than double overall.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really important for us to come 100 percent clean and
say what we were going to do,'' Ebersol said of letting audiences
know the games will be entirely on tape. ''The first three days of
the Olympics we've made a commitment to telling viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   If competition were shown live, it would be on in the early
morning hours in the United States, when, Ebersol said, ''there's
nobody watching TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of NBC's daily coverage, with Bob Costas as host, will
be in prime time from 7 p.m. to midnight EDT/PDT, and Ebersol said
he anticipates the average national Nielsen rating to be between
17.5 and 18.5.
</P>
<P>
   NBC averaged a 21.6 rating at the 1996 games.
</P>
<P>
   A rating point for NBC represents 1,080,000 households, or 1
percent of the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The competition is tougher with pro football, prime-time fare,
maybe some meaningful baseball pennant races,'' Ebersol said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I never look at (the Olympics) as having a particularly
tough road to hoe against other sports.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable channels will be used as outlets for team sports,
including women's soccer and softball, and boxing.
</P>
<P>
   As always with the Olympics, viewers can expect plenty of
feature pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ''Storytelling is our mantra,'' said David Neal, head of
production. ''It's what we do. It's what Americans expect.''

<HEADLINE> Farm-State Democrats Rip EPA  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm-state Democrats blasted the Clinton
administration Wednesday for moving forward with a plan to clean up
polluted waterways despite strong opposition from agricultural
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rep. Charles Stenholm, the House Agriculture Committee's
senior Democrat, told officials with the Environmental Protection
Agency and the Agriculture Department that the program was
''ill-conceived'' and certain to face ''strenuous opposition in
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tim Holden, D-Pa., accused the EPA of displaying
''arrogance'' and a ''complete lack of concern'' for the views of
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which the EPA intends to make final this summer,
would require states to submit plans within 15 years to clean up
every waterway that fails to meet water quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   Landowners would be required to get a pollution discharge permit
if the EPA found they were contributing to nearby water quality
problems and if a state had failed to draft an adequate plan for
improving water quality.
</P>
<P>
   The agency estimates more than 20,000 streams and lakes don't
meet water-quality standards, or about 40 percent of all lakes,
rivers and streams in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a serious problem on our hands and the people of this
country have made it clear that they expect us to respond,'' Fox
told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   EPA has exempted forestry operations from the plan because of
opposition from the wood-products industry. But opponents of the
program still say it would impose huge costs on farms and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the hostility that the plan has met with, Rep.
Marion Barry, D-Ark., demanded that Fox and a USDA official who
accompanied him take an oath before testifying before the committee
Wednesday. The House committee almost never swears in witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Barry said the clean-water plan, which is known by the acronym
TMDL, for Total Maximum Daily Load, had no ''scientific or
practical basis.''
</P>
<P>
   James Lyons, the USDA official, conceded that the plan was
unpopular, saying that ''TMDL is the new four-letter word in rural
America.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said, ''The facts are that there are 20,000 impaired
bodies of water in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress hasn't done enough to clean up waterways
because it hasn't provided enough money for farm-conservation
programs that pay farmers to take environmentally sensitive land
out of production.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans also oppose the clean-water plan, although
they let Democrats take the lead in criticizing the administration
at Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   EPA probably should withdraw the proposal ''so that the public
and Congress can have another opportunity to work through the
difficult issues,'' said the committee's chairman, Rep. Larry
Combest, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Combest and Stenholm have introduced legislation that would
delay implementation of the program while the National Academy of
Sciences studied the issue. An appropriations bill approved by the
House earlier this month contained a provision that would at least
temporarily delay the EPA plan.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, meanwhile, has disputed the EPA's
claim that the program would cost governments and the private
sector less than $100 million.

<HEADLINE> Injured Williams Quits Basketball  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Jayson Williams, a star rebounder
whose career with the New Jersey Nets was undercut by injuries,
retired Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the quick-witted, 32-year-old center came 14
months after he broke his right leg and tore up his knee in a
collision with a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jayson did everything he possibly could in rehabbing and
trying to get well so he could play,'' Nets president Rod Thorn
said during a conference call. ''It just hasn't worked out. He has
done everything he possibly could.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorn said Williams was in Arizona for an undisclosed reason and
the Nets had his approval to make the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very saddened by it because not only was Jayson a
terrific basketball player but he also brought the intensity and
brought a work ethic to the game as well as a rebounding skill that
I think every team needs,'' Thorn said. ''Jayson has so many
intangibles that you cannot replace.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by the club, Williams said:
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a hard choice for me. I loved playing
basketball, I loved being a Net and I loved the fans in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe strongly in our ownership's commitment to bringing
our team up to championship quality -- and I wanted very much to be
a part of that effort. But I know from the pain in my knee and what
my physicians have told me that my injuries won't allow me to
return.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has not played since the collision with Stephon Marbury
in a game against Atlanta on April 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He attempted a comeback late last season but he broke his left
foot while landing on the foot of rookie teammate Evan Eschmeyer
during practice.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement, expected for weeks, came hours before the Nets
were to take the first pick in the NBA draft. Thorn said the Nets
had planned to make the announcement on Tuesday, but they held off
because Byron Scott was hired as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn said there was no urgency to announce the decision on
Williams on Wednesday, but since the retirement was common
knowledge the club chose to make it official.
</P>
<P>
   ''There needs to be a closure about it,'' Thorn said. ''He
obviously couldn't play. You all know him. You know how much he
wants to play and if there were any chance he could play obviously
from Jayson's standpoint, he would pursue it. He had pursued it.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has petitioned NBA league office for an injury
exception, which would give the team about $3.8 million more salary
cap room.
</P>
<P>
   The team will have to wait until April 1 to petition the NBA to
have Williams declared a permanent medical disability, which would
totally remove his salary from the team's cap.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who always could be counted on for a joke in the
locker room, is in the second year of a six-year, $85 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The team will honor the contract, Thorn said, adding insurance
will pick up a huge chunk of that if Williams was declared a
permanent medical disability.
</P>
<P>
   Williams played at St. John's and spent his first two NBA
seasons in Philadelphia. He was traded to the Nets in 1992 for a
couple of second-round draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   After being dogged by injuries in his first three seasons,
Williams started to blossom in 1995-96 when he started a run of
four straight years in which he averaged more than 10 rebounds a
game.
</P>
<P>
   He was named an All-Star in 1997-98 when he averaged 13.4 points
and 13.5 rebounds. He was averaging 8.1 points and 12 rebounds when
he was injured.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Ruling May Affect Race  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN O'HANLON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court's rejection of
Nebraska's ban on a late-term abortion procedure opponents call
''partial-birth abortion'' was a legal defeat but not necessarily a
political one for the state's attorney general, who has built his
Senate campaign around defending the law.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Don Stenberg, a conservative Republican, argued
the abortion case in front of the high court in April -- two weeks
before soundly winning Nebraska's GOP primary -- and has often
pointed that out in his campaign advertisements and speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ''This negative decision may have a positive payoff in that it
might energize his conservative Christian support to elect him all
the more,'' said John Comer, a political scientist at the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Stenberg is up against Ben Nelson, a moderate Democrat who left
the governor's office in 1999 with an 80 percent approval rating.
The two candidates are seeking the seat being vacated by Democrat
Bob Kerrey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were on the right side,'' Stenberg said Wednesday. ''There
isn't a single founding father of this nation, when they wrote the
Constitution ... who would have said, 'We are proud to have done
this so that children can be pulled from their mothers' wombs and
killed in the most barbaric fashion.'''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Jon Bruning promised to introduce a bill on the first
day of the 2001 session to ban the procedure. ''My intention is to
do the most careful research and drafting of this bill so there is
almost no chance of it being struck down by the court again,''
Bruning said.
</P>
<P>
   In this largely conservative, GOP state, Nelson has wide support
among Republicans because of his moderate views. GOP officials even
approached him in the past about switching parties. And he made
sure Wednesday not to alienate those voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am pro-life, and as governor I signed the bill into law,''
Nelson said, referring to the ban. ''I abhor the procedure and hope
the Legislature will go back and make the changes needed to make
the ban work in Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   Comer emphasized that as much as Stenberg would have liked to
have won the case, it probably won't make a difference to most
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''People pretty much have made up their mind already on Don
Stenberg,'' he said. ''Elections seldom turn on the outcome a
Supreme Court decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Stenberg, 51, is a Harvard Law graduate who was elected attorney
general in 1990 and re-elected in 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Stenberg said the abortion issue will instead affect the
presidential election and confirmation hearings for Supreme Court
justices
</P>
<P>
   ''My test as a U.S. senator in confirming justices to the U.S.
Supreme Court is going to be whether they limit themselves to
following the Constitution or whether they want to impose their own
social views on America,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Leaders Want Pay Raise  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House leaders of both parties have agreed to
push for a 3 percent cost-of-living pay raise for members of
Congress, participants said Wednesday, an increase that would be
legislators' third in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Should the raise take effect, lawmakers' salaries would rise in
January by $4,200 to $145,500. Congress is likely to address the
issue next month.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made last week at a meeting of top House
Republicans and Democrats at which the leaders also agreed not to
use the boost as an issue in this fall's congressional elections.
Polls usually show that most members of the public oppose raising
lawmakers' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't make it partisan, members can vote the way they
want to'' when they vote on it, said Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va.,
chairman of the House GOP's campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all agreed we need good people to serve here, and they've
got to be properly compensated,'' said Rep. Patrick Kennedy,
D-R.I., chairman of the House Democrats' campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of high-level executive branch officials would also
receive the 3 percent increase, since their salaries are linked by
law to members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Davis attended last week's meeting, along with House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.; House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo.; and other leaders. Participants said the unusual
gathering of political foes lasted 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Senate leaders were also checking on the prospects
for moving the raise through that chamber. In recent years,
opposition to increasing lawmakers' salaries has been stronger in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   A 1989 law allows automatic pay raises for members of Congress
unless they vote to block it. The process has avoided annual votes
on what can be a politically touchy subject. The increase is based
on a measurement of private industry pay raises, minus 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders have decided to allow opponents a vote aimed at
stopping the raise when the chamber debates a fiscal 2001 spending
bill for the Treasury Department, probably next month. That bill is
the traditional vehicle for the pay raise fight.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, pay raise opponents forced a House vote. But
underlining the low political risk most lawmakers saw, the House
supported the increase by 276-147.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers last got increases that took effect this year and in
1998, but prior to that had blocked them for four consecutive
years.
</P>
<P>
   The recent run of pay raises has paralleled the federal budget's
transition from annual deficits to surpluses, which some lawmakers
have used to help justify their higher salaries. Members also argue
that the increase would only keep them even with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But critics on the left and right say higher pay is not
deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ''Members of Congress already receive overly generous salaries,
and a list of perks a train-length long,'' said Gary Ruskin,
director of the liberal Congressional Accountability Project.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sepp, spokesman for the conservative National Taxpayers'
Union, said lawmakers should not get raises because they have
failed to enact dramatic tax or spending cuts and ''have had
nothing to do with this prosperity'' the country is enjoying.

<HEADLINE> BC-CT--Murder in Greenwich, 4th Ld-Writethru,600  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - There is ample evidence to justify trying
Kennedy nephew Michael Skakel as an adult in the 1975 beating death
of a Greenwich teen-ager, a prosecutor declared Wednesday at the
close of three dramatic days of hearings into the affair.
</P>
<P>
   State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict said Skakel's purported
confessions in the late 1970s to two former classmates at a
substance-abuse rehabilitation center were reason enough to make
him stand trial. Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, accused those
witnesses of lying outright on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding Judge Maureen Dennis told the lawyers she would issue
a written ruling, though she did not indicate when. She said she
would take as much timne as she needed to review the law and the
transcript of the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings, which began last week and ended Wednesday
afternoon, were held to determine if there was enough evidence to
proceed with the case against Skakel, and if so, whether he should
be tried as a juvenile or as an adult in the Oct. 30, 1975 beating
death of Martha Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, 39, a former neighbor of Moxley's who was 15 at the time
of the killing, is the son of Rushton Skakel Sr., a brother of
Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing arguments, Benedict cited the testimony of a
childhood friend of Skakel's who testified that more than 15 years
after the murder, Skakel admitted being in the same spot where
15-year-old Moxley was killed - and at the time she was slain. He
said that effectively placed Skakel at the scene at the time of the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict said Skakel should be tried as an adult because ''no
Connecticut juvenile institution has the ability to deal in any way
with a 39- or 40-year-old man.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, the defense lawyer, said the state's case was built on
testimony that amounted to lies. He said Skakel's clean criminal
record served as ''a crystal ball'' that showed he is an upstanding
citizen incapable of a murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the benefit of 25 years of hindsight. For 25 years, he
has led an exemplary life,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, members of Skakel's extended family -
including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. - turned out to support Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a horrible, unspeakable tragedy, but it only compounds
it to blame Michael Skakel, who is innocent,'' Kennedy said. He
said Mrs. Kennedy was planning to attend Wednesday's court session
but had to cancel at the last minute because of a family
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman called to the witness stand a former student at the Elan
School, a residential drug and alcohol treatment center in Maine
which Skakel attended as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two former students at the school testified that
Skakel had confessed to them that he killed Moxley, who was
bludgeoned with a golf club. The 6-iron used in the murder was
traced to a set owned by the Skakels.
</P>
<P>
   One student, John Higgins, said Skakel confessed to him one
night 20 years ago during an erratic, tearful conversation. But
Higgins admitted he lied to investigators when they initially
questioned him about the alleged confession. He also admitted
asking about a $50,000 reward.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Coleman, another former Elan student, said Skakel told
him he drove Moxley's skull in with a golf club and declared: ''I'm
gonna get away with murder. I'm a Kennedy.'' Coleman went on to
describe his own life - filled with alcoholism, drug addiction, a
criminal record, homelessness, and living under a bridge at times.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, former student Alice Dunn said she never heard
Skakel admit to killing Moxley, even while undergoing therapy that
involved being pummeled in a boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   ''He denied vehemently, over and over again, 'No, no, no, no!'''
Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel was subjected to the treatment after he ran away from
Elan, Dunn testified. The ring was used to break down students'
resistance and force them to confront the root cause of their
emotional problems, she said.

<HEADLINE> USC CB Simmons May Miss 2000 Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Senior cornerback Antuan Simmons, a
three-year starter at the University of Southern California, may
miss the 2000 season due to recovery from surgery to remove an
abdominal tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Trojans coach Paul Hackett said Wednesday that Simmons, who had
surgery May 16, may sit out the season as a redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Antuan underwent a very serious operation but he has fought
through it in an extraordinary way,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald G. Skinner, who performed the surgery to remove a
non-cancerous growth near Simmons' left kidney, said it is expected
Simmons would achieve ''a complete recovery in his ability to
return to competitive athletics without limitations in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons has made 175 tackles, seven interceptions and blocked
six kicks for USC over three seasons. He missed the last two games
of 1999 and spring practice this year due to herniated disc
surgery, not related to his May surgery.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: President's Curiosity Key  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the assessment of the departing incumbent,
a president's curiosity is more important than raw brain power.
President Clinton passed up an opportunity Wednesday to assess
whether the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has enough of
either.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's so much a question of intelligence,
generically. I mean, I think it's more a question of curiosity and
willingness to learn what you think is important,'' Clinton said
during a White House press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, himself a Yale graduate, Rhodes scholar and generally
acknowledged smart fellow, paused before answering a question about
whether Texas Gov. George W. Bush, also a Yale graduate, is an
intellectual lightweight. After all, some scholars say Ronald
Reagan was effective by concentrating on a few big ideas while
leaving the details to others, a reporter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a dead-bang loser, isn't it?'' Clinton said, laughing.
''No matter what I say, I'm in a big hole.''
</P>
<P>
   He did say that while voters should not be satisfied with a
president who simply takes the recommendations of good advisers, it
is also important not to micromanage from the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ''So what you try to do is to find a balance between this,
because it's a deciding job,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said as president he tried to learn as much as he could
so he could best evaluate the advice he got.
</P>
<P>
   As for his plans for when someone else is president, Clinton
seemed to rule out a run for the Senate, as first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton is now doing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think maybe I'll run for the school board someday. That's
about the only thing I can imagine doing,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who leaves office in seven months, has said he intends
to work closely on establishing his presidential library in Little
Rock, but has otherwise offered few insights to his post-White
House plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to be a good citizen,'' Clinton said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Former POWs Ask Congress on Suits  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Choking back tears, Frank Bigelow asked
Congress why the federal government opposes his lawsuit against the
Japanese company he says made him a slave laborer during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Bigelow, a former seaman from Brooksville, Fla., spent two years
as a prisoner of war, suffering beatings and illness such as
malaria, jaundice and dysentery. Fellow prisoners cut off part of
his leg after a rock fell and broke it while he mined for Mitsui
and Co. Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''What do I think the company owes us? My leg, a couple of years
of our lives and at least miner's wages for what we did,'' Bigelow,
78, told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government says lawsuits like Bigelow's are
prohibited under the 1951 peace treaty between the United States
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   California became a magnet for such cases last year when the
legislature enacted a law allowing victims of slave labor to sue
multinational corporations. Several pending lawsuits from former
World War II prisoners seek compensation from companies including
Mitsubishi Corp., Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., Nippon Steel Co.
and Japan Energy Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco
asked the Justice and State departments for an opinion on one such
lawsuit. The agencies, quoting the treaty, said ''the Allied Powers
waive all reparations claims of the Allied Powers and their
nationals rising out of any actions taken by Japan and its
nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Bettauer, deputy legal adviser for the State Department,
reiterated to the committee that there is no legal recourse for the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we sympathize with the plaintiffs and acknowledge
that they suffered great injuries in the service of their country,
we are convinced that the treaty precludes these lawsuits and that
we have no legal basis upon which to approach Japan and its
nationals for additional compensation for war claims,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
responded that the government should not be able to prevent
lawsuits by citizens against private companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think your arguments are ridiculous,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, four former prisoners recounted horrific details
of the Bataan Death March in April 1942 after Japan overran the
Philippines. U.S. forces surrendered and sick and starving soldiers
were forced to march 65 miles in the hot sun. Denied food and
water, they were beaten -- and some were killed -- if they fell out
of line.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel as if I am once again being sacrificed, abandoned not
for the war effort as in the past, but for the benefit of Japanese
big business,'' said Lester Tenney of La Jolla, Calif. ''Worse than
abandonment, our own government is encouraging the court system to
ignore our sacrifices, our dignity and our sense of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettauer said the government has long had the power to negotiate
settlements to prevent potential lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be too late now -- 40 years later -- to seek to
renegotiate the benefits we received under the peace treaty because
of something we insisted upon doing back then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch asked Bettauer and David Ogden, acting head of the Justice
Department's civil division, to review their interpretation of the
treaty and report back to Congress.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Parochial Aid  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government can provide computers for
religious schools, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in a decision
that significantly narrowed the constitutionally required
separation of religion and government.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 ruling was praised by supporters of private school
tuition vouchers -- government initiatives to help parents of
children who do not attend public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said a Louisiana parish can distribute money for
instructional equipment -- including computers, books, maps, and
film strip projectors -- to private schools as long as it's done in
a ''secular, neutral and nonideological'' way.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the majority of the court has signaled that school
vouchers are constitutional,'' said Matthew Berry, a lawyer with
the Institute for Justice. He defended, among other programs being
challenged in lower courts, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's statewide plan
to give parents of poor children money for private schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Removing the constitutional cloud from school choice will
encourage more legislatures to support such programs,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics warned against giving religious schools and their
missions new access to the public treasury.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Supreme Court certainly took a sledgehammer to the wall of
separation between church and state today,'' said the Rev. Barry W.
Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of
Church and State. ''The silver lining is that this decision gives
no aid or comfort to voucher supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Public school officials Wednesday lamented they could be sued
over Bible lessons that show up on computers they've bought.
</P>
<P>
   ''A computer contains instructional content that no one can
monitor,'' said Anne Bryant, executive director of the National
School Boards Association. ''Once you are connected to the
Internet, this technology could be used for religious
instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The association, representing the nearly 15,000 boards entrusted
with spending a school systems' money, filed a friend-of-the-court
brief with the Supreme Court, arguing that the separation of church
and state forbids public funds from being diverted to religious
schools in any form, including technology and computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the court's main
opinion: ''We see no basis for concluding that Jefferson Parish's
Chapter 2 program 'has the effect of advancing religion.' ...
Chapter 2 does not result in governmental indoctrination, because
it determines eligibility for aid neutrally, allocates that aid
based on the private choices of the parents of schoolchildren. ...
Nor does Chapter 2 define its recipients by reference to
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy in an
extraordinarily sweeping opinion that would allow almost any
government aid to religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen G. Breyer -- who
supplied the critical votes to reach a majority on the nine-member
court -- refused to go that far. In an opinion by O'Connor, they
called the Thomas opinion's ''expansive scope ... troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg dissented.
</P>
<P>
   The court's latest word on public funding for private
schoolchildren overturns two previous Supreme Court bans on giving
public materials to parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   Three parish taxpayers had relied heavily on those cases when
they sued federal, state and local officials in 1985. Parents of
the religious school children were backed by the Clinton
administration, which sought to defend its $425 million program to
connect every American classroom, in public and private schools, to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Religious school leaders welcomed the inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Internet is a global classroom to which all students --
public and private -- must have entry,'' said Leonard DeFiore,
president of the National Catholic Schools Association, adding that
3 million children in 9,000 parishes will benefit. ''It would be
tragic if parents had to choose a religious education, but the
price would be their children didn't have access to the best
educational tools.''

<HEADLINE> Con Ed, feeling the heat, says there is enough power to meet demand </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - While saying it's relatively certain there's
enough power to meet city demand as temperatures rise, Consolidated
Edison has already steamed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for its handling
of a brownout barely one week into summer.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Giuliani questioned the company's response to
power problems on the Upper East Side that caused a hospital to
switch to its backup generator earlier this week. The mayor said he
had tired of wondering if the city could make it through a summer
without a power failure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea that they just don't have enough power doesn't make
any sense at this stage,'' Giuliani told a news conference. ''It's
no excuse to say people use too much power. Con Edison should be
prepared for people using too much power.''
</P>
<P>
   Utility officials have said the latest brownout - which prompted
a request for Mount Sinai Hospital to switch to its own generator -
was caused by a problem with feeder cables.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed has also said it's stretched to provide sufficient energy
because a thriving economy increases demand for power, more people
are using air conditioning, and because fuel prices are so high.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Donohue, Con Ed's senior vice president of electric
operations, said the energy supply is ''tight - very, very tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could guarantee that there would be no blackouts
this summer, Con Ed spokesman Joseph Petta said utility officials
believe they have enough power to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   He also said, however, that the amount of power the utility can
supply the city is limited because there are too few power plants
from which to buy electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another summer and another crisis is what we have,'' said
Ashok Gupta, a senior economist with the Natural Resources Defense
Council.
</P>
<P>
   And although Petta said more power plants are needed, City
Council Speaker Peter Vallone said no new ones should be built
until the old ones are torn down and electric companies guarantee
the new facilities will be cleaner burning and more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone also said blaming problems on insufficient power is
simply Con Ed's latest excuse. During last year's 19-hour blackout
in Washington Heights, for example, the company blamed failing
cables.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, we don't know what ... they're doing,'' said Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed plans to spend $315 million over the next five years to
improve the city's power supply system, and has spent $100 million
replacing feeder cables and upgrading substations since the
Washington Heights blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Wednesday that he will meet with Con Ed officials
next week, and both the mayor and Vallone said they will charge
separate task forces with investigating the city's power problems.

Olympic gymnastics team haven't seen the athletes perform in the
monthly training camps team coordinator Bela Karolyi has held to
track their progress.
</P>
<P>
   It's a quite different scenario than Karolyi envisioned when he
agreed to work with the team, hoping to pump life into the
struggling U.S. program in time for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The selection situation, it's still messy,'' Karolyi said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, officials at USA Gymnastics named 1984
Olympian Tracee Talavera, longtime U.S. judge Marilyn Cross and
either gymnast Chari Knight or Larissa Fontaine to team with
Karolyi to choose the six members of the Olympic team after the
trials in August.
</P>
<P>
   It's a more subjective process than in years past, when weighted
scores from the trials and the U.S. Championships were the main
criteria in the selection. This year, finishing in the top six
won't guarantee a spot on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at USA Gymnastics insist the scores will still play a
major role in determining the team.
</P>
<P>
   But the new process creates more wiggle room in case key
athletes are injured. It also allows the committee to shore up
weaknesses on certain apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe most importantly, it was intended to give the selection
committee a broader set of performances upon which to base its
decision. Karolyi envisioned his training camps, which began in
January, as the perfect time for the selection committee to judge
the athletes and track their improvement.
</P>
<P>
   But Talavera and Cross haven't been to any of the camps, because
they weren't named to the committee until this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tracee, I highly respect her, but I haven't seen her in last
nine to 10 years,'' Karolyi said. ''Marilyn, I highly respect her,
too. But I haven't seen her. She hasn't been at the camps. She
hasn't been around.''
</P>
<P>
   Talavera and Cross were selected by coaches of potential Olympic
athletes. They didn't attend the camps because the coaches didn't
make their choices until USA Gymnastics finalized its selection
process. That happened in April.
</P>
<P>
   Senior team director Kathy Kelly, who hired Karolyi last
November, understands his complaints, but thinks the system will
still work.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a little departure from the way he saw it and that makes
him uneasy,'' Kelly said. ''But we're quite confident that we have
really knowing and caring people. We feel the coaches feel that
way, too. In the end, his plan won't be hampered, it will be
enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is the prickly question as to what happens if
Karolyi is outnumbered on the committee over the selection of a
certain athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is a difference of opinion, the loser will be the one
I appreciate the most,'' he said. ''I just hope everyone realizes
what the best interest of the team is, and what the strengths and
weaknesses of the athletes are.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi said the process will
still work.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are tremendous, competent people with a strong breadth
of experience,'' he said. ''There's a mutual level of respect
between a group of qualified individuals. I think it will be all
right.''

<HEADLINE> Analysis of a new TV ad from state Democratic Party  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of the new state Democratic Party issue
ad attacking
Rep. Rick Lazio's vote against the Patients' Bill of Rights.
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITLES: ''Right''
</P>
<P>
   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: David Axelrod.
</P>
<P>
   AIRING: In upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: Nurse: ''If a patient is denied medical care or surgery
or even prescriptions because a company has decided that this is
not something that they cover, the patient suffers.'' Voice Over:
''HMO bureaucrats are making life-and-death decisions. Yet in
Congress, Rick Lazio voted against the real Patients Bill of
Rights, favored by health professionals so they can do their jobs.
Call Lazio, tell him he works for us ... not the insurance
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   IMAGES: Nurse Sandra Morales, a stethoscope around her neck,
speaks over the image of a woman holding a crying infant. Later,
during the voice over, she holds a phone and shakes her head ''no''
toward a disappointed gray-haired patient. The words ''Rick Lazio
voted against real Patients Bill of Rights'' flash across the
screen, followed by the phone number of his Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: This issue ad is the first run by the New York state
Democratic Party since Rep. Rick Lazio entered the Senate race
against Hillary Rodham Clinton. It continues the strategy used in
some of the first lady's own earlier ads - to define Lazio in a
negative light before voters form a more favorable impression. By
not mentioning Clinton at all, the ad allows the first lady to keep
her distance. Polls show Clinton has high negative ratings that
could increase if she attacks Lazio too often.
</P>
<P>
   Casting a Manhattan nurse against the backdrop of a clinic
provides the spot with real-life credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio last year voted against a Democratic-sponsored Patients
Bill of Rights that would have given patients the ability to sue
their health maintenance organizations. While it was supported by
some ''health professionals,'' as the ad claims, it was not favored
by HMOs that would have faced lawsuits if it passed.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has voted for a weaker Republican Patients Bill of Rights
that would have stepped up some protections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made health care one of her key campaign issues. Her
campaign recently ran its own spot also attacking Lazio's vote
against the patients' rights bill. The first lady led the failed
effort by her husband's administration to reform the nation's
health care system.

<HEADLINE> Airline Complaints Are Skyrocketing  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tired of airline delays? Lost luggage?
Overbooked flights? You're not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the American airline industry are skyrocketing
this year even as air carriers try to live up to their promise to
improve customer service, federal investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines last year staved off legislative action by promising to
treat customers better and to be more forthright with passengers
all the way through their travel experience. When Transportation
Department inspectors checked earlier this year to find out whether
the airlines were living up to that pledge, they found varying
degrees of success.
</P>
<P>
   ''Airlines are making a clear and genuine effort at
strengthening the attention paid to customer service, but
bottom-line results to date are mixed,'' the department's inspector
general said in a preliminary report to Congress. ''The airlines
have a way to go to restore consumer confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, complaints were up 74 percent in the first four months
of 2000 when compared with the same period in 1999 -- 6,916 to
3,985. Delay complaints, the department's top complaint about
airlines -- were up 84 percent -- 2,842 in the first four months of
2000, compared with 1,546 in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   While the increase can be attributed to the Transportation
Department's introduction of complaint filing over the Internet,
that doesn't mean that there's not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The air carriers receive 100 to 400 complaints for every
complaint filed with the DOT,'' inspectors said.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines' chief executive acknowledged problems still
exist.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realize that many of you are not satisfied with the results
so far. You might be surprised to learn that neither am I,'' said
Donald Carty, who is also chairman of the Air Transport
Association's executive committee. ''... But I firmly believe that
we have made very significant strides in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are getting better at warning customers about delays
and cancellations, inspectors found. However, they still aren't
telling customers the truth about the delays, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several airlines pointed to the air traffic control system as
the reason for delays, even in cases of extremely bad weather, crew
unavailability or maintenance problems,'' inspectors said. In fact,
some airlines knew about delays as much as four hours beforehand
but didn't tell passengers until they had boarded the plane and
couldn't get back inside the airport, inspectors found.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are only six months into their pledge, and none of them
were identified in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce Committee, which requested the report,
lashed out at the airlines Wednesday. Many senators have to fly
home out of Washington every weekend and recounted delays, lost
luggage and lies about the departure times.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., said he hasn't given up
on the idea of passenger fairness legislation. ''Unfortunately, the
report indicates that the airlines still have a long way to go to
make significant inroads on the customer service front,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it doesn't happen, (legislation) is going to be our only
recourse,'' added Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said his staff called an airline six
minutes before he arrived at the airport and were assured the plane
for Boston was leaving on time. But he arrived to find a long line
of stranded passengers. ''Any dolt could tell you these planes were
delayed for hours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In their pledge, the airlines promised to volunteer the lowest
airfares or cheaper travel options when people call for
reservations, to give passengers at least 24 hours to cancel ticket
purchases and to find lost luggage within 24 hours. They also said
they would update passengers at 15- to 20-minute intervals when
there were delays.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court ruling should get Boy Scouts on state charity list, lawyer says </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that the
Boy Scouts can ban homosexual leaders means Connecticut state
employees should be allowed to contribute to scouting through
payroll deductions, a lawyer for the organization said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Connecticut State Employee Campaign
Committee removed the Boy Scouts from a list of charities that
state employees could contribute to through a payroll deduction
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was based on a ruling by the state's Commission on
Human Rights and Opportunities that including the Boy Scouts on the
list violated the state's anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   But the Irving, Texas-based Boy Scouts and one Connecticut
scouting council filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against the
state, arguing that exclusion from the list was a First Amendment
violation.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts also appealed the campaign committee's decision
to take them off the list. The board is reviewing the appeal.
Committee chairwoman Carol Carney was on vacation and unavailable
for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Supreme Court decision bolsters and further strengthens
our arguments,'' said Daniel L. Schwartz, the Scouts' lawyer who
filed the suit against the state employee campaign board and state
Comptroller Nancy Wyman. ''The Boy Scouts have the constitutional
right to their membership policies.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be the case, a civil liberties lawyer said, but the
state should not be using its resources on behalf of an
organization with a discriminatory policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state employee contribution program uses state resources
and money,'' said Joe Grabarz, executive director of the
Connecticut Civil Liberties Union. ''Should the state be forced to
do that for an organization that violates state law and state
policy? The (American Civil Liberties Union) clearly says 'no.'''
</P>
<P>
   When the CHRO unanimously decided last month that the Boy Scouts
could not be included in the employee contribution campaign, the
board declined to rule directly on whether the organization's
policy violates state anti-discrimination laws. But it did find
that including a group with such a policy on the employee
contribution list violated state anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign committee had asked the CHRO for a ruling in
November after the New Jersey Supreme Court found the Boy Scouts'
policy of banning gay leaders was unconstitutional. The Boy Scouts
appealed, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in their favor
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say it's too early to tell how the high court
ruling will affect the payroll deduction program.
</P>
<P>
   A CHRO spokeswoman declined to comment on the ruling until the
board had a chance to review it. Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal, who is representing the campaign committee and Wyman,
said he is also reviewing the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign committee hires the United Way to collect the
employee payroll deductions. But the state has the right to prevent
the fund-raiser from giving the Boy Scouts any contributions not
designated for a particular agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999 campaign, $9,950 was contributed directly to the Boy
Scouts by state employees. The Scouts also received a portion of
$200,000 in non-designated contributions.

By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Calling all cars - and RVs and motorcycles -
that are toting tourists tired of well-trod attractions. Just in
time for the summer travel months comes ''Crime Scene USA,'' a
guide to murder and mayhem in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Although the book has its humor (check ''Cowabungled, Dude!'' in
the Hawaii chapter, about a surfer turned not-so-bright murderer)
the more than 150 crime scenes listed are historically accurate and
well-researched.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites are well-known (the scenes where President Kennedy,
John Lennon and Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated); some are
very recent (the homes of JonBenet Ramsey and Nicole Brown
Simpson); and others are from the era of Jesse James and the Wild
West.
</P>
<P>
   The book, published by Hyperion, was written by Neal S. Yonover
and edited by members of a loosely organized group called BADGE -
the Bureau of Amateur Detectives and Gatherers of Evidence.
</P>
<P>
   BADGE member David Borgenicht says that because ''the country is
really fascinated by crime,'' the attractions indeed draw visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody's using it as their sole travel book,
but if you happen to be traveling through that town, there's
something different to see,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The book's introduction puts America's fascination with crime
rather succinctly: ''The bottom line, as one true crime fan
described it, is that the place where Lincoln gave the Gettysburg
address is interesting, but not like the place where he was shot.
Because it's history, only better.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Monkkonen, a professor at the University of California at
Los Angeles who studies urban murders, said there are two reasons
people are fascinated by crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''One, because crime is truly damaging to both individuals and
the society, and two, because the crime stories we follow have a
comforting narrative pattern, beginning, middle and end,''
Monkkonen said. ''So, the story of a crime both worries and then
comforts us.''
</P>
<P>
   When researching the book, BADGE members had a lot to choose
from in the big states like California and New York (sites
associated with Son of Sam and Charles Manson, among others). The
smaller states were a challenge but, alas, crime even occurs in the
serenity of New England.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's just an amazing mix of stuff that you can see, whether
you're interested in historical outlaws, or sort of contemporary
tabloid celebrities,'' said Borgenicht.
</P>
<P>
   The book lists every state. It includes narratives on unsolved
serial murders and asks the public's help in solving them. It also
alerts travelers to bed and breakfasts, bookstores and museums with
crime themes.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has the most crime scenes listed, and tourists
have already discovered the spot where John Lennon was gunned down
in 1980. Tourists flock on a daily basis to take pictures outside
the Dakota apartment building where Lennon lived opposite Central
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's that famous doorway,'' Sally Johannsen of New Orleans
said as she pointed to the Dakota entrance where Lennon was shot.
''It's in the tour book, so we came to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   But tourist buses have yet to run to other crime scenes: the
site where the Son of Sam (David Berkowitz) was arrested after he
spent the summer of 1976 terrorizing the city; the park where
rocker David Lee Roth was busted in a 1993 drug sting; and the
seedy spot that spawned this famous 1983 New York Post headline:
''Headless body in topless bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists in California already visit Alcatraz, but how many
actually trek to the site where the body of a woman later dubbed
''the Black Dahlia'' was found in 1947, or to the house where
gangster Bugsy Siegel was gunned down the same year?
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, tourists are told to head for Chicago, the site of
the St. Valentine's Day massacre as well as to Al Capone's
speakeasy, house and tombstone.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild West lives again in Globe, Ariz., where tourists can
see where Pearl Hart, the West's only female stagecoach robber, was
captured in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   ''The robbery was successful, but the escape wasn't,'' the book
reads. ''Hart and her partner promptly got themselves lost
galloping off into the hills.'' They were captured the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Several key moments in the Civil Rights movement are chronicled,
from the Birmingham, Ala., church where four young girls died in a
bombing in 1963, to the site of King's slaying in 1968 at a motel
in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the offbeat entries, such as ''Cowabungled, Dude!''
In 1996, Richard Star went to a Honolulu surf shop and bought a
surfboard bag. To make sure it was the right size, he climbed into
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once inside the bag, he told the salesperson, 'Gee, it sure is
spooky in here. I'd hate to have it zipped up,'' the entry reads.
</P>
<P>
   When police found Star's wife in the bag, they didn't look far
for her killer. ''Star is now hanging ten-to-life in a mainland
prison,'' the book adds.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller and more rural states proved to be a challenge, but
the book manages to find crime there as well. The Maine chapter
begins: ''There's so little noteworthy crime here, it's hard to
believe that master horror writer Stephen King makes it his home.''
</P>
<P>
   And the lone entry from Maine is from 1937, when then ''Public
Enemy No. 1,'' Al Brady - who had committed four murders and 150
robberies - was killed in a shootout with FBI agents in Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the places listed in the book, Borgenicht said to him,
the most famous crime scene in American history is the site
opposite the Texas Book Depository in Dallas where President
Kennedy was killed in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is a site that has memorialized the event,'' he said.
''It's part of our national consciousness, you can really visualize
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 176-page book, costing $12.95, includes advice on visiting
crime scenes. Respect private property, it says, or you could end
up in jail. Another tidbit - ''With few exceptions, the most
vicious sociopathic killers look just like everyone else'' - seems
to advise visitors to think about who could be standing next to
them at any given crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   And one last tip: Enjoy your trip and don't forget your
fingerprint kit.

<HEADLINE> Ray Lewis To NFL Rookies: Watch Out  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Silence fell over the room full of 254 NFL
rookies, many of whom will soon be flush with cash and fame, when
Ray Lewis was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't just another routine session at the annual rookie
symposium, where the young pros are counseled on topics such as
handling their money, dealing with agents and even preparing for
their lives after football.
</P>
<P>
   No, Lewis' message might have been the most critical of any the
rookies heard at the plush La Costa Resort and Spa, and it came
from an impeccable source, one just off a trial on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis told the rookies that they lead very public lives, need to
be careful of who their friends are and must be able to control
difficult situations they might find themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had problems saying 'no' to friends,'' Lewis told the
rookies, according to an NFL spokesman who was in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to pick and choose things we do,'' Lewis said. ''We're
being watched 24 hours a day. Be firm and stand on your own two
feet. Understand that saying no to a lot of people is very
important. Be firm when you say no.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis initially was charged with murder in two fatal stabbings
outside a post-Super Bowl party in Atlanta. The murder charges were
dropped, but he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of lying to
police. Two other defendants who were traveling with Lewis in his
limousine were acquitted two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fourth orientation session for rookies conducted by
the NFL, which has faced several embarrassing off-field problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis attended the symposium at the suggestion of commissioner
Paul Tagliabue. His appearance wasn't on the agenda, and neither
the NFL nor Lewis wanted reporters there.
</P>
<P>
   ''His speech was definitely moving to everyone here,'' running
back Thomas Jones, a first-round pick of the Arizona Cardinals,
said as the symposium ended on Wednesday. ''You hear a lot of
different things about guys being in different situations, but when
you hear it from a guy in that situation, it definitely hits home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of all the things here they did for us, that was the major
thing. It was great for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Henderson, chairman of the NFL Management Council, shared
the stage with Lewis. He said the rookies ''were sitting there
breathless'' through the 20-minute session.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis answered questions for about 10 minutes before Henderson
had to end the session. ''They booed me for cutting off the
questions,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said Lewis told the budding pros there were things he
could have done to avoid the situation outside the Cobalt Lounge in
Atlanta, but wasn't forceful enough. Now, he'll never be able to
fully put it behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can try to be the greatest linebacker ever, but this is
always going to follow me,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the rookies have a better understanding of how being
in the wrong place at the wrong time can scar their lives and
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can happen to anyone, and once it happens, people will
perceive you differently, even though you're not that kind of
person,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personally, I don't think he did it anyway,'' Jones said. ''I
watched on Court TV. I met him at the Super Bowl a few nights
before, and he seemed like a great person. The way our society is,
that's a very difficult subject. Instead of being innocent until
proven guilty, they say you're guilty right off the bat. He was
proven innocent, so hopefully people will believe it. I do.''

<HEADLINE> Court upholds charter school law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state's highest court Wednesday upheld
New Jersey's landmark charter school law.
</P>
<P>
   In its unanimous ruling, the state Supreme Court turned back
attempts by school districts in Englewood, Clifton, Franklin
Township and Highland Park to revoke charters of new schools in
their towns.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature in 1995 allowed for the creation of
charter schools, which are outside the control of local boards of
education and are free of many state mandates and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state law, charters receive 90 percent of their
funding from local districts.
</P>
<P>
   Public school officials who filed the lawsuit complained about
the loss of funds. They also questioned whether charters could
exacerbate racial divisions by siphoning off white students.
</P>
<P>
   While upholding the charter law, the justices ordered the state
education commissioner to assess the racial and financial impact of
a charter school's approval on the local school district.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the 1995 law stands, according to the 33-page opinion
penned by Associate Justice Jaynee LaVecchia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The choice to include charter schools among the array of
public entities providing educational services for our pupils is a
choice appropriately made by the Legislature so long as the
constitutional mandate to provide a thorough and efficient system
of education is satisfied,'' the opinion said.

<HEADLINE> Authorities say they can't stop tribe's closing of Appalachian Trail </HEADLINE>
By DAVE COLLINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Federal and state officials say they
don't have the power to stop the Schaghticoke American Indians from
closing a portion of the Appalachian Trail that runs through the
tribe's reservation in Kent.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's chief, Richard Velky, announced Wednesday that the
Schaghticokes would close a two-mile section of trail from Saturday
to Tuesday to protest the federal government's handling of the
tribe's recognition petition.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers with the Appalachian Mountain Club, a private group
that maintains the trail in Connecticut and Massachusetts, will
detour hikers around the tribe's land, said Brian King, a spokesman
for the club's parent organization. Detour signs will be posted, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal deplored Velky's plan
Wednesday, urging the chief to keep the trail open. But Blumenthal
conceded that the state has little power to stop the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ''While our legal options may be limited, the moral high ground
in this landscape is clear: Innocent hikers and campers should not
be made pawns in the Schaghticokes' dispute with the federal
government,'' Blumenthal wrote in a letter to Velky.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said his office was looking into the extent of the
state's legal rights in the matter. But under a long-standing
legislative act, the tribe has most ownership rights over the
property, located in the northwest part of the state, the attorney
general said.
</P>
<P>
   But Blumenthal emphasized in the letter that state police have
authority to enforce laws on reservation land.
</P>
<P>
   State police spokesman Sgt. Paul Vance said there were no plans
to send troopers to the reservation over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''We under no circumstances expect any confrontation
whatsoever,'' Vance said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service, which oversees the 2,167-mile trail
that stretches from Georgia to Maine, said it too is powerless to
stop the tribe from closing the trail because that portion of trail
is on private property.
</P>
<P>
   Velky said tribe members and private security guards would close
the trail from 8 a.m. Saturday through 8 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Velky said the Bureau of Indian Affairs has been to slow to act
on the recognition petition the tribe first filed in 1994. The
chief said he has been told that it could take another 10 to 12
years for the tribe's application to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Velky also claimed the federal Department of the Interior
promoted trespassing on the 312-member tribe's land by routing the
Appalachian Trail through the reservation, which was recognized by
state government in 1736.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shouldn't have to wait an ungodly amount of time,'' Velky
said. ''We just want to show them that they are trespassing. It is
our land.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal recognition makes tribes eligible for several federal
assistance programs and classifies them as sovereign nations.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan tribes opened
successful casinos after being federally recognized, Velky has said
that his tribe has no plans for a casino.
</P>
<P>
   Velky apologized to hikers, but he said the government's
inaction left him no choice but to close the trail.
</P>
<P>
   King, spokesman for the Appalachian Trail Conference, said the
trail's closing will be a minor inconvenience for hikers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just one more change in the schedule,'' King said.

<HEADLINE> House votes down Andrews' amendment to stall Delaware deepening  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Despite defeat of his amendment that would
have withheld nearly $30 million to deepen the Delaware River, U.S.
Rep. Rob Andrews is pledging to work to halt the project, which he
calls ''environmentally risky.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first round in a long fight,'' Andrews said
Wednesday, hours after the House, in a 249-176 vote late Tuesday
night, defeated an amendment he had sponsored to withhold $29.8
million for the project.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with the backing of the
Delaware River Port Authority, plans to deepen 108 miles of the
river to 45 feet, from its current depth of 40 feet. That would
allow ships to carry more cargo to the Port of Camden and
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority and shippers say this is crucial to keep the
port open and to continue to attract ships. But environmentalists
oppose it, saying dredging could stir up toxins at the river
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   They're also concerned about what will be done with 22 million
cubic yards of sediment that would be dredged. Plans call for it to
be put along the river and Delaware Bay in Delaware and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority also is exploring putting some of the fill in
abandoned mines in Pennsylvania and selling it to companies for use
as highway and construction fill.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the federal government would fund about
two-thirds of the $311 million cost and the Port Authority would
pay about one-third, with contributions from New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews' amendment would have held back $29.8 million until next
June so the project's economic and environmental effects could be
studied.
</P>
<P>
   ''The burden of proof is on those who want to do this project to
prove that it makes sense economically,'' Andrews said Wednesday.
''Then environmental questions need to be answered about toxic hot
spots in the river and effects on wetlands.''
</P>
<P>
   On the House floor Tuesday night Andrews said, ''We're being
asked to invest nearly $30 million in a project that is
economically unproven, environmentally risky and fundamentally
unfair to the people of southern New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen is among the supporters of the
deepening project.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not and have not supported any project in New Jersey that
would harm my state's environment,'' he said during the House
debate. ''The Delaware deepening project meets all environmental
standards and has been approved by the Environmental Protection
Agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Frelinghuysen, the state's only member of the House
Appropriations Committee, also said, ''If this amendment passes, I
can assure this body that some other worthy project somewhere other
than New Jersey will benefit. Some other state will benefit and
again, New Jersey's priorities fall further down the list at the
bottom of the federal barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was to the House's Energy and Water Appropriations
bill, which passed early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate must vote on its own Energy and Water Appropriations
bill, then the two will be merged. That bill would then be sent to
President Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Exiled Laotian Royals Visit U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of the exiled Lao royal family are in
Washington as part of a monthlong U.S. trip aimed at generating
support for peacefully removing the communists who have ruled their
country for a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will request that the U.S. government press for
negotiations to restore democracy in Laos,'' said Prince Sauryavong
Savang, 63, the patriarch of the family, which lives in France. He
is the brother of Laos' last king, who died in a ''re-education''
camp after the communists took control in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the prince is the king's son, Prince Soulivong
Savang, 37, the heir to the throne, and Tiao Bouavong Kattygnarath,
a special adviser to the family.
</P>
<P>
   The two princes spoke through a translator during an interview
Wednesday at Washington's Army-Navy Club. They plan to meet this
week with a half dozen members of Congress. But the family was
rebuffed in its attempt to meet with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The crown prince has offered to return to Laos, a tiny, poor,
landlocked nation in Southeast Asia, and preside over a
constitutional monarchy while elections are held. Laotian
government officials have dismissed the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the family met with an official from the
United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights,
pressing him to investigate human rights violations in Laos.
</P>
<P>
   Laos does not tolerate political dissent, and last October
police arrested at least five people at an anti-government rally.
Their fate remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The government also has been fighting a low-level insurgency
from Hmong rebels, the highland people who aided the CIA during the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, two Hmong-Americans, Houa Ly, 56, of Appleton, Wis.,
and Michael Vang, 36, of Fresno, Calif., disappeared while on
vacation. They were last seen boarding a boat from Thailand to
Laos.
</P>
<P>
   Mai Sayavongs of the Laotian embassy in Washington dismissed the
allegations of human rights violations in his country.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Lao government is improving human rights in Laos,'' he
said, adding that people have ''individual rights and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The royal family will travel to Denver on Friday for a 10-day
visit, then heads to St. Paul, Minn., for six days. Both cities
have relatively large Lao populations.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion Protests Face Limits  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying the right to avoid ''unwanted
communication'' sometimes outweighs free-speech rights, the Supreme
Court gave states greater leeway Wednesday to restrict
anti-abortion demonstrations outside health clinics.
</P>
<P>
   By a 6-3 vote, the court upheld Colorado's limits on ''sidewalk
counseling'' of patients who show up at clinics where abortions are
performed.
</P>
<P>
   The state since 1993 has enforced a ''bubble'' law that
prohibits people from counseling, distributing leaflets or
displaying signs within 8 feet of others without their consent
whenever they are within 100 feet of a clinic entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court that the law is
not aimed at the content of someone's speech but only at where,
when and how a message is delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's law ''simply empowers private citizens entering a
health care facility with the ability to prevent a speaker, who is
within 8 feet and advancing, from communicating a message they do
not wish to hear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Violators can get up to six months in jail and a $750 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Anthony M. Kennedy
dissented. Scalia, writing for himself and Thomas, derided the
ruling as ''one of the many aggressively pro-abortion novelties
announced by the court in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy complained that the decision ''contradicts more than a
half century of well-established First Amendment principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens acknowledged that freedom of speech ''includes the right
to attempt to persuade others to change their views, and may not be
curtailed simply because the speaker's message may be offensive to
his audience.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ''The protection afforded to offensive messages
does not always embrace offensive speech that is so intrusive that
the unwilling audience cannot avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion activist Corine Miller said she will continue her
sidewalk counseling in Denver despite Wednesday's ruling. ''Do you
love me mommy,'' she shouted to patients of a Planned Parenthood
clinic while using a paper cup as a megaphone. ''Please don't do
this to me mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision marked the first time the nation's highest court
reviewed a state legislature's attempt to regulate anti-abortion
demonstrators outside health clinics. The justices twice previously
had ruled in abortion-protest disputes but those had stemmed from
court injunctions aimed at specific clinics, not laws with
statewide effect.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the court upheld a 36-foot demonstration-free zone
around a Florida clinic's entrances but struck down provisions for
a larger buffer zone. And the justices in 1997 upheld a
court-ordered 15-foot buffer zone around New York clinic entrances
but struck down a judge's call for a ''floating buffer zone''
requiring protesters to stay at least 15 feet away from people as
they entered or left the clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado law was enacted, state officials had told the
court, after abortion patients complained of being spat on, kicked
and harassed outside clinics. But the three anti-abortion
demonstrators who challenged the state law called their tactics
gentle and compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling comes at a time when abortion rights activists cite
statistics of clinic violence. The Feminist Majority Foundation
said 20 percent of 360 clinics that responded to a 1999 survey said
they experienced incidents such as blockades, invasions, bomb
threats or bombings within the previous year.

the Supreme Court cleared the way for the 6-year-old refugee's return home.
Seven months after he was lifted from the sea -- his mother lost in that

Court Upholds 'Partial-Birth Abortion'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today limited states' power to ban
so-called ''partial-birth'' abortions, a 5-4 ruling that escalated the bitter,
decades-old debate over women's right to end their pregnancies. Closing out its
1999-2000 term with some of the most divisive rulings in years, the court struck
down Nebraska's partial-birth abortion law as an ''undue burden'' on women's
rights. The court also ruled that the Boy Scouts can bar homosexuals from
serving as troop leaders. The decision may also let the 6.2-million member
organization reject gay boys as members.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Inclined To Sign Cuban Bill  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday that he is
inclined to sign legislation easing the 38-year-old embargo on Cuba
if he is convinced that it will provide for sales of U.S. products.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he does not plan any further steps to normalize
relations with Fidel Castro's government.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always wanted to sell more food and medicine, not only to
Cuba but to other countries as well,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans agreed Tuesday to allow sales of food to Cuba
provided they are not financed by either the federal government or
private U.S. sources. Cuba would have to pay cash, of which it has
little, or else obtain credit from a third country, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise also would write into law an existing ban on U.S.
tourist travel to Cuba. Sales of medicine to Cuba have been allowed
since 1992 with certain restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is part of legislation that would also bar Clinton and
future presidents from stopping shipments of food and medicine to
any country without congressional approval. The White House has
expressed concern with that provision for some time but has stopped
short of threatening a veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I believe that the legislation essentially allows for the
sales of American food and medicine to Cuba or to other countries,
but has some protection for us for extraordinary circumstances that
foreign policy might require ... then I would be inclined to sign
the bill to support it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Farm and business groups have praised the agreement, but some
Democrats say it didn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   New York Rep. Charles Rangel, the senior Democrat on the House
Ways and Means Committee, said it wouldn't bother him if Clinton
vetoed legislation that contained the Cuba measure. Sen. Chris
Dodd, D-Conn., threatened to filibuster a military appropriations
bill if Republicans went ahead with plans to attach the Cuba
legislation to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a clear case of one hand giving while the other takes
away, because while it purports to allow for the sale of food and
medicine, it proceeds to make it almost impossible to do so,'' Dodd
said, adding that a ban on tourism was a ''giant step backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd contended the legislation wouldn't even allow third-country
financing of food sales to Cuba. A spokesman for Rep. George
Nethercutt, the House GOP's leading proponent of easing the
embargo, said that the agreement was intended to allow for such
financing and that the wording of the legislation might be altered
to make that clear.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration decided last year to allow sales of
food and medicine to three other countries listed as terrorist
states -- Iran, Libya and Sudan -- but was barred by law from
including Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe that we can change that law until there is a
bipartisan majority which believes that there has been some effort
on the part of the Cuban government to reach out to us as well,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was moving forward in normalizing relations with
Castro until the Cuban air force shot down two private planes in
the Florida Straits in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we're in a position where, until there is a bipartisan
majority of Congress persuaded that there that there has been a
fundamental change, we can't do more than what I've been doing,
which is try to aggressively expand people-to-people contacts,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats said that sentiment for easing the embargo had
grown significantly this year because of the ordeal of Elian
Gonzalez, the young castaway who returned to Cuba Wednesday after a
protracted legal struggle between his father and his Florida
relatives.

<HEADLINE> Cubans in NJ angered by Supreme Court decision  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) - Cuban-Americans in New Jersey said
Wednesday that Elian Gonzalez is returning home to a life much
worse than the one he could have had in America.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he has no future over there,'' said Joseph Larin, who
came to Union City from Cuba in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of one of the nation's largest Cuban-American
communities were disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court's refusal
to consider granting 6-year-old Elian an asylum hearing before his
father could take him back to Cuba. But nearly all said they had
expected this end to the story long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not surprised by the outcome,'' said Mayor Rudy Garcia,
a Cuban-American. ''We're just surprised by the process. Everyone
has had their day in court but Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said American courts have emphasized that Elian's father
has a right to make decisions for his son while ignoring Cuba's
communist politics and living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''He always wanted to stay. I remember him saying that to me,''
said Garcia, who visited the boy when he was staying in Miami with
his great-uncle and cousin.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said that unlike other Cuban
children over 6, Elian will likely receive milk because of his
American saga, but will still have to spend his childhood laboring
four months a year in fields. He said the Supreme Court decision
will have consequences for other immigrants seeking asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very sad day when the highest court in the land
decides that a young boy does not have the same rights as an adult
refugee fleeing from oppression,'' Menendez said. ''Today, the
Supreme Court consciously set a precedent that will reject future
political asylum applications based on age, nor merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Perez, a 76-year-old Cuban-American who spent 18 years as
a political prisoner in Cuba, had stronger words for the court. He
said the justices had to be ''a bunch of orphans'' for being able
to deny Elian a hearing to keep him in America.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Cuban-American community, numbering about 150,000
in Hudson County, marched in the streets and blocked traffic near
the Lincoln Tunnel after federal agents seized Elian from the home
of his Miami relatives. Remberto Perez, regional director for the
Cuban American National Foundation, says the issue galvanized the
community, especially its younger members.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never in my years with the foundation got as many calls
as I've gotten from students, young executives,'' Perez said,
''people who are usually leaving the fight up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But one Union City resident, who wouldn't give his last name
because he feared retribution, said the issue had created too much
debate among Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am happy that he's going. At least we got rid of an issue,''
said Leon A. ''We have to talk about other things.''

<HEADLINE> Court Says Boy Scouts Can Bar Gays  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Boy Scouts can bar homosexuals from
serving as troop leaders, the Supreme Court said Wednesday in a 5-4
decision on free-association rights that may also let the
6.2-million-member organization reject gay boys as members.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing the Scouts to accept gay troop leaders would violate the
organization's right of ''expressive association'' under the
Constitution's First Amendment, the justices ruled on the last day
of their 1999-2000 term.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Boy Scouts asserts that homosexual conduct is inconsistent
with the values it seeks to instill,'' Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring the organization to have a gay scoutmaster would force
it ''to send a message, both to the youth members and the world,
that the Boy Scouts accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form
of behavior,'' the chief justice said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased,'' said Scouts spokesman Gregg Shields.
''It's going to allow us to continue our mission of providing
character-building programs for youth.''
</P>
<P>
   But the New Jersey assistant scoutmaster ousted when the
organization learned he is gay expressed dismay at the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm definitely saddened by the decision,'' said James Dale.
''People don't join the Boy Scouts because they're anti-gay. People
join the Boy Scouts because they want acceptance, they want
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling did not specifically give the Scouts permission to
bar homosexual boys from membership, but its language left room for
that interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it suggests that they can'' ban homosexual boys from
being Scouts, said Evan Wolfson, Dale's lawyer. ''They won the
right to declare themselves an anti-gay group.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Southern California law professor Erwin
Chemerinsky agreed, saying, ''I don't see any basis for drawing a
distinction between Scout leaders and Scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Matt Coles, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
lesbian and gay rights project, said he did not believe the court
answered the question of gay Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts organization, formed in the United States in 1910 and
now boasting 6.2 million members and adult leaders, has a policy
that ''avowed homosexuals are not extended membership or leadership
positions,'' Shields said. He would not say whether the
organization has withdrawn membership from gay youths.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Cozza, an adult Scout leader in California and
president of Scouting For All, which advocates letting homosexuals
join, said: ''They've kicked out gay Scouts and now they'll
continue to do so because they've been given the go-ahead by the
Supreme Court to continue to discriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices reversed a New Jersey Supreme Court decision that
said the Scouts wrongly ousted Dale, an Eagle Scout. The state
court said the Scouts violated a New Jersey law banning
discrimination in public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   But Rehnquist wrote, ''The forced inclusion of an unwanted
person in a group infringes the group's freedom of expressive
association'' if it harms the group's ability to advocate its
viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   His opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, Stevens said the New Jersey law does not
force the Scouts ''to communicate any message that it does not wish
to endorse. New Jersey's law, therefore, abridges no constitutional
right of the Boy Scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson, Dale's lawyer, had cited Supreme Court decisions during
the 1980s that let states force the Jaycees and Rotary
International to admit women as full members.
</P>
<P>
   But Rehnquist said requiring such groups to accept women members
would not interfere with the message they seek to express.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the chief justice likened Dale's case to a 1995 Supreme
Court ruling in which the justices let the private sponsor of the
Boston St. Patrick's Day Parade exclude a group of gays and
lesbians, saying parades are a ''form of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative advocacy
group that supported the Scouts' appeal, said the ruling ''will
have a dramatic impact on all private organizations -- including
religious groups -- to define their own mission and set their own
criteria for leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coles of the ACLU disagreed, saying, ''This ruling is
limited to groups that exist for the purpose of expressing views
and ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale was 19 and an assistant scoutmaster of a Matawan, N.J.,
troop when in 1990 he was identified in a newspaper article as
co-president of a campus lesbian and gay student group at Rutgers
University. The Scouts' Monmouth Council revoked Dale's
registration as an adult leader, and he sued, citing the New Jersey
anti-discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said, ''You'd never know from the way the court
characterized it how important this organization is in the lives of
kids.... The court has said that (the Scouts) have the right to
discriminate, but it certainly did not say that discrimination is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale now lives in New York City and is advertising director for
a magazine for people who are HIV-positive.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Insurance Commissioner Quits  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HOWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Insurance Commissioner Chuck
Quackenbush, embroiled in one of the state's largest political
controversies in years, resigned Wednesday after being accused of
using millions of dollars from insurance settlements to further his
own political career.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican's decision averted the possibility of impeachment
by the Legislature, which has been investigating the deepening
scandal. However, Attorney General Bill Lockyer said his own
investigation of Quackenbush's actions will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush's attorney, Don Heller, said his client resigned
because he could no longer serve effectively as commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a decent man with very human and decent feelings about
people ... and in his effort to fulfill campaign promises he made
as to reaching out, mistakes were made,'' Heller said. ''I am
satisfied he has done nothing illegal or criminal or improper in
any way. He made mistakes which he readily admitted.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal centers on money paid by several insurance companies
that had been accused by the state Insurance Department of
mishandling claims filed by policyholders after the 1994 earthquake
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony, the insurance companies were threatened
with billions of dollars in fines by the department but were let
off the hook if they paid far less into a nonprofit fund
established by Quackenbush's office.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the fund was supposed to go toward victim assistance
and earthquake research. But it was spent instead on TV ads
featuring Quackenbush and also went to causes such as a sports
program attended by the commissioner's children.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush had been set to testify before the Assembly
Insurance Committee on Thursday, after which the panel was to
determine whether he should face censure, criminal charges,
impeachment proceedings or whether no punishment was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   With the commissioner's resignation, the committee will cancel
the hearing and publish a report on its findings, said the
chairman, Assemblyman Jack Scott, a Democrat. ''I take no joy in
the ruin of a man,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush's resignation followed what sources said were days
of negotiations with lawmakers in an attempt to limit any civil and
criminal liability. The Insurance Committee made no deal with
Quackenbush, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush's wife, Chris, said earlier Wednesday that she was
hoping he wouldn't resign. She said he was being targeted by
powerful enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you are elected by 5.5 million people, you don't get
unelected by the newspapers. He's been convicted in the court of
public opinion and that's a mistake in a democracy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and
Consumer Rights, said: ''There's a sort of 'ding-dong the witch is
dead' feeling around here. He took an office that was born out of
voter frustration with the insurance companies and betrayed the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush was re-elected to a second four-year term in 1998.
He is one of only two Republicans holding statewide office in
California. The other is Secretary of State Bill Jones.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Iraq UN Agency Attack  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- An Iraqi gunman forced his way into a U.N.
building in Baghdad on Wednesday, demanding an end to international
sanctions on his country and provoking a shootout that left two
staffers dead.
</P>
<P>
   The attacker, Fowad Hussein Haydar, was holed up in the United
Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization building for two hours
until he surrendered to Iraqi authorities, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two FAO staffers -- a Somali administrator and an Iraqi database
operator -- were killed in the shootout, said Amir A. Khalil,
director of FAO operations in Baghdad. He said the gunman held a
U.N. consultant hostage at the reception desk during the siege.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.N. staffers and four Iraqi government guards were wounded,
Khalil said. A seventh casualty, a U.N. worker, was hurt trying to
jump from a window of the building.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dead and wounded remained in the corridor of the second
floor for many hours,'' Khalil added.
</P>
<P>
   At an unusual press conference afterward in a Baghdad police
station, Haydar, 38, denied he had killed any of the victims. He
said his original aim was to kidnap Khalil -- who was out of the
building at the time -- and then negotiate his demands. But the
guards opened fire while he was talking to a U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't shot anyone. When I left the building they told me
two people were dead,'' Haydar said, wearing handcuffs but
appearing composed.
</P>
<P>
   ''True, I fired at random. But the operation lasted more than
two hours and there was heavy fire,'' he said, referring to
shooting by Iraqi guards.
</P>
<P>
   The siege left the FAO building, a converted house near Baghdad
University, riddled with bullet holes with broken glass strewn
across its reception area.
</P>
<P>
   Haydar said U.N. trade sanctions, which have impoverished
millions of Iraqis since they were imposed following the 1990
invasion of Kuwait, had driven him to the point of despair.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason is the embargo, the death and murder of thousands
of Iraqi children and elderly. I wanted to relay a message, to
explain the tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed he was not recruited by any party to carry out his
operation and warned that there are millions of people like him in
the country ready to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I will be sentenced to death, but I am not sorry,'' he
said, adding that he surrendered after talking to Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned the attack,
deploring ''the senseless loss of life'' of the two FAO staffers,
said U.N. deputy spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the U.N. Office of the Iraq Program,
Benon Sevan, said the gunman first tried to enter the U.N. compound
at the Canal Hotel and was turned away by security guards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then he managed to enter the FAO offices in Baghdad and he
took hostage about 50 people. He had two machine guns and made some
demands,'' Sevan said in New York.
</P>
<P>
   His four demands were the establishment of regular flights
between the Iraqi and Jordanian capitals, a halt to allied
airstrikes, compensation for victims of the sanctions and erection
of a monument to Iraqi children at U.N. headquarters, Sevan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sevan praised Iraqis for their cooperation. He said U.N.
facilities in Baghdad were ''pretty well guarded'' by government
security, but he had ordered security to be reinforced at U.N.
headquarters in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil, the FAO representative, has been among the most
outspoken critics of the effects of U.N. economic sanctions on
ordinary Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil has pushed the sanctions committee to release holds on
medical and agricultural supplies he says are crucial to helping
Iraq feed itself, but that members of the sanctions committee fear
could have military uses. The United States has been the most
active at blocking supplies to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.N. resolutions, the embargo cannot be lifted
until U.N. weapons inspectors report Iraq has destroyed its banned
weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 81; Dow Gains 23  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Wednesday after the Federal Reserve
said it would leave interest rates unchanged for the time being.
But the central bank's warning that inflation risks linger put
pressure on financial stocks and other interest rate-sensitive
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the central bank's decision leaves the stock
market on an uncertain course and sets the stage for several more
weeks of volatile trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they had gone for an increase today, that probably would
have been it for the year,'' said Milton Ezrati, senior economist
and strategist at Lord, Abbett &AMP; Co. ''But this has set the market
up to worry right through August,'' when the Fed holds its next
meeting on rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose 81.38 to 3,940.34.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.33 to 10,527.79 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 4.27 to 1,454.82.
</P>
<P>
   All three major market indexes lost momentum in the final hour
of trading as investors debated the impact of the Fed's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to hold rates steady was largely expected, but the
Fed gave investors little room to rejoice as it warned that
inflation dangers may be lurking and hinted that higher rates might
be ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed said it believes the ''risks continue to be weighted
mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation
pressures in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, certain economic gauges have been pointing to continued
growth. Wednesday morning, the Commerce Department said orders to
U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods shot up 6 percent
in May, led by a burst in demand for electronics equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Economists cautioned that the durable goods data tend to be
volatile, but worried that the report signaled that the
manufacturing sector has not cooled as much as many analysts had
believed. Six rate increases within the past year have shown some
evidence of slowing the economy to a more sustainable level.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still a very, very cautious Fed,'' said Michael Strauss,
managing director of Commonfund Asset Management. ''They have some
room to hold off on a tightening now, but the economic numbers in
July and August could paint a picture of a stronger economy than
they really want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of investors' lingering uncertainty about rates,
economically sensitive stocks failed to get a boost from the Fed's
decision. Financial stocks were lower, with J.P. Morgan down $2.125
at $116.625.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, which might see business suffer if interest rates
are rising, fell $1.25 to $48.50.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, investors focused on leading technology stocks, which
are expected to post the strongest profit growth. Hewlett-Packard
rose $7.063 to $123.688 and JDS Uniphase gained $2.875 to $121.875.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom rose $4.875 to $44.563. Salomon Smith Barney analyst
Jack Grubman strongly reiterated his buy rating and $87 price
target on the stock, despite the Justice Department's threat to
block the company's proposed merger with Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fell $5.625 to $52.75.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors' rapid rotation from sector to sector is
likely to continue through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll continue to be volatile,'' said John H. Shaughnessy,
chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. ''The economic reports
coming out of Washington may still be mixed, and the market will go
up on the benign ones and down on the threatening ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Ezrati agreed, adding that it isn't yet clear which sectors
investors will favor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to establish leadership when you're stuck in the
waiting game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.28 billion,
compared with 1.25 billion at the same time Tuesday. Traders said
end-of-the-quarter buying and selling helped spike volume.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 12.91 to
520.99.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.5 percent.
Germany's DAX index rose 0.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.0
percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bush Prepares New TV Ad Blitz  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With just over a month before the Republican
National Convention, George W. Bush is raising money for a final
pre-convention TV ad blitz touting his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please click on my Web site and contribute to my campaign,''
the Texas governor wrote in an e-mail to supporters. ''Every cent
will go to TV ads to let Americans know what I would do as
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush cannot spend privately raised money after he becomes the
official Republican presidential nominee at the July 31-Aug. 3
convention in Philadelphia. At that point, he will get $67.6
million in taxpayer money to run his fall campaign. Vice President
Al Gore, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, will get the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised more than $90 million, had $7.1 million left at
the end of May and continues to raise more. ''The money is still
coming in,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee pulled its Bush ads
this week, concluding that spots paid for by the Democratic
National Committee on Gore's behalf have not been effective. And
the DNC prepared to air a new spot on education.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to people who registered on his Internet site, Bush
pleaded for donations to counter the DNC ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the Democrats are running a multimillion-dollar TV ad
campaign,'' Bush wrote. ''Will you help me overcome this new
assault, this latest attempt by Al Gore to try to 'reinvent
himself' for the American people?''
</P>
<P>
   He noted the RNC also has run ads, but said: ''I would like my
campaign to be able to run Bush for President ads in key
battleground states. To do that, I need your help.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said plans have not been finalized, but a TV ad
campaign is the most likely course. The ads could appear any time
between now and Aug. 3. An ad blitz in the days immediately before
the convention or during its opening days is one possibility.
</P>
<P>
   After an exhaustive and expensive primary season, the Bush and
Gore campaigns haven't run ads since March. This month, the DNC
launched its ad campaign featuring Gore, which was immediately
matched by the RNC ads focusing on Bush's Social Security plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign estimates the DNC will have spent $9.2 million
on its ads by Sunday. But since the ads began running, Bush has
gained on Gore in national polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the DNC's ads are already doing Al Gore sufficient
damage,'' said RNC spokesman Cliff May.
</P>
<P>
   DNC spokeswoman Jenny Backus scoffed at the assertion. ''If
their ads had been working the way they claim they have been
working, they would leave them up,'' she said. ''This is a sign of
panic over at the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The DNC ads, all of which feature Gore, have focused on
prescription drugs, the patients' bill of rights and fatherhood. A
new ad on education will begin running Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Whitman signs bill aimed at shore 'animal houses'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Local towns can now bar underage drinking
on private property.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman signed a bill Wednesday that allows each
municipality in the state to pass an ordinance saying people under
the age of 21 are not allowed to drink or even possess alcoholic
beverages in private settings. Exemptions are made for religious
ceremonies or if a parent or guardian is present.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation will enable municipalities to take steps to
prevent underage persons from illegally consuming alcoholic
beverages in areas where they once could drink and not be affected
by the law,'' Whitman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Violators would be subject to a $200 fine for a first offense
and a $350 fine for any subsequent conviction. In addition to the
fine, up to 180 days of community service would be required.
Driving privileges could be either suspended or postponed for six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is levied if offenders have a driver's license.
If they do not, they cannot apply for one until six months after
they turn 17 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Bill sponsors said the law was designed to help police at towns
along the Jersey shore.
</P>
<P>
   ''So-called 'animal houses' with rampant underage drinking are
notorious problems at the shore. In many cases our local police
have their hands tied because they lack the tools to enforce laws
against underage drinking when it occurs on private property,''
state Sen. Leonard Connors, R-Ocean, said after the bill passed the
Legislature in March.

<HEADLINE> Low Said To Be Next Rangers Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Edmonton coach Ron Low is set to rejoin
former Oilers boss Glen Sather with the New York Rangers, the
Hartford Courant reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Low, who coached the Oilers for parts of five
seasons, will be introduced as the replacement for fired coach John
Muckler within the next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless there's a sudden change, I expect him to get the job,''
an unidentified source told the Courant.
</P>
<P>
   Sather, who resigned as Edmonton's general manager following
last season to become the New York GM, was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A Rangers spokesman said Wednesday that Sather was out of town
and that an announcement of a new coach was not expected before the
July 8 wedding of Sather's son.
</P>
<P>
   Low was 139-162-40 with Edmonton, leading the Oilers to
first-round playoff upsets of Dallas and Colorado in 1997 and 1998.
He coached Houston of the International Hockey League last season.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, John Paddock, the coach of the Rangers' American
Hockey League affiliate in Hartford appeared to be in line for the
job with the parent club.
</P>
<P>
   ''Glen hasn't told me anything, but I guess it's more than
likely I'll be back in Hartford next season,'' Paddock told the
Courant.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Lowe, who coached the Oilers last season, was believed to
be Sather's first choice but instead took over for Sather as the
Oilers' GM. Assistant Craig MacTavish, who was also considered,
took over for Lowe behind the Edmonton bench.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate who has been mentioned is Walt Kyle, the coach
of Hamilton -- Edmonton's AHL affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler and general manager Neil Smith were fired on March 28,
with only a handful of games left in the regular season, when it
became clear the Rangers would not make the playoffs for the third
straight year.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which had the NHL's highest payroll of $61 million,
was 29-41-12.
</P>
<P>
   Sather worked as a consultant with the Oilers for a few weeks
following his resignation as GM. He was introduced as the Rangers'
new boss the morning of Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers assistant John Tortorella coached New York's last four
games and is not considered a candidate to keep the job.

<HEADLINE> France 2, Portugal 1, OT  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREAS EVAGORA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Zinedine Zidane made a penalty kick
with three minutes left in overtime as World Cup champion France
beat Portugal 2-1 Wednesday to reach the final at the European
Soccer Championship.
</P>
<P>
   After Portugal's Abel Xavier used his left hand to block Sylvain
Wiltord's angled shot, Zidane stepped up to shoot the ball into the
top corner and out of goalkeeper Vitor Baia's reach.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last minute, it was tough to concentrate,'' said
Zidane, who scored twice in the 1998 World Cup final.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the knockout punch.''
</P>
<P>
   In chaotic scenes afterward, with Portuguese players protesting,
referee Guenther Benko ejected Nuno Gomes, whose fourth goal of the
tournament gave Portugal a 1-0 lead in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese coach Humberto Coelho announced his resignation after
the game. ''It was an unfortunate decision,'' Coelho said of the
referee's awarding of the penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th minute, Sergio Conceicao stole the ball from Didier
Deschamps and passed it to Nuno Gomes, who quickly turned and fired
in a 16-yard shot.
</P>
<P>
   France made it 1-1 six minutes into the second half. Nicolas
Anelka, seemingly offside, was allowed to turn around and pass back
to Thierry Henry, who shot the ball in from 10 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   The French were saved by goalkeeper Fabien Barthez with a minute
left in regulation, when he palmed Abel Xavier's header over the
crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really tough for us,'' 1998 FIFA world player of the
year Zidane said. ''The Portuguese were great.''
</P>
<P>
   The action was frenetic in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane almost gave France the victory one minute in, but his
header sailed high. French defender Laurent Blanc had the same
thing happen six minutes later. Sa Pinto's long shot flew just wide
for Portugal in the 20th minute of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands plays Italy in the other semifinal Thursday in
Amsterdam. The final is Sunday at Rotterdam, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our objective was not to be in the final. It is to win the
final,'' Zidane said.
</P>
<P>
   France came into Euro 2000 trying to become the first world
champion to also hold the European title. And the team's tough
defense eventually wore down the Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   Gomes' score was Portugal's lone shot on goal in the first hour.
</P>
<P>
   French president Jacques Chirac was among the 50,000 fans at the
King Baudouin Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Italy takes a 6-2-5 record against the Dutch into the other
semifinal. Both countries have won the European Championship once.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our strength is our patience,'' Italian defender Alessandro
Nesta said. ''We have a great history behind us and all the teams
hope they won't come up against Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy will be able to field captain Paolo Maldini, who has
recovered after straining his thigh in a 2-0 quarterfinal victory
over Romania.

<HEADLINE> Lazio campaign questions first lady's appearance aboard USS Kennedy </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAY SHORE, N.Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio's campaign staff fired a
shot across Senate rival Hillary Rodham Clinton's bow on Wednesday,
questioning her expected appearance aboard an aircraft carrier
during a July Fourth celebration next week in New York Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first lady's campaign should reimburse the taxpayers for
the massive costs of this event,'' said Lazio campaign manager Bill
Dal Col.
</P>
<P>
   The combined OpSail 2000 and the sixth International Naval
Review are expected to draw 50,000 or more visiting ships and small
craft to New York Harbor, believed to be the largest convergence of
vessels ever in one place.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is to review the 17-mile long line of warships
from aboard the missile cruiser USS Hue City, then board the
carrier USS John F. Kennedy to watch the stately tall ships sail up
the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clearly no accident that the first lady and her husband
have chosen New York - a state whose only connection to them is
Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign - as the site of their Independence
Day activities,'' Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has come under scrutiny for her use of taxpayer funds to
travel, but her campaign has maintained that she follows election
law. She flies on government aircraft on the advice of the Secret
Service and reimburses the government the same way presidential
candidates do: at the rate of a first-class commercial ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Lissa Muscatine, the first lady's White House press secretary,
said the president and his wife were invited by the Defense
Department last October and the president accepted in his role as
commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is going with him as first lady,'' Muscatine said. ''There
are these sort of official events every now and then, but in this
particular case she's going with the president and obviously, he's
the one who will be doing the speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col said that defining the celebration that way is
''laughable and shows a lack of respect for the intelligence of New
Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is expected to be in Albany on July Fourth on the second
leg of a five-day statewide bus tour.

<HEADLINE> Mercury Coach Fined $500  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Phoenix Mercury coach Cheryl Miller was fined
$500 by the WNBA on Wednesday for making derogatory remarks about
the officiating after her team's loss at Cleveland on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rules were being broken,'' an angry Miller said about the
officiating after the Rockers' 64-61 victory. ''They are paid to
know the rules, but messed up this call.''
</P>
<P>
   With 23.6 seconds to play, referees allowed Cleveland substitute
Mery Andrade to enter the game when Phoenix called a 20-second
timeout.
</P>
<P>
   Under WNBA rules, a team can substitute on a 20-second timeout
only if the team that called the timeout also makes a change.
Phoenix (8-4) did not make any changes.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade blocked a 3-point attempt by Tonya Edwards with 10.9
seconds to play as Phoenix had three chances to tie.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we acknowledge an error was made by the referees
regarding a substitution near the end of the game, we simply cannot
condone public criticism of the officiating by our teams,'' said
Connie Hurlbut, WNBA Director of Basketball Operations.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Navy Fleet Budget Short  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said in a report to Congress that
under President Clinton's current budget it cannot afford to
sustain the fleet of about 306 Navy ships that it deems a bare
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The report released Wednesday also said the Pentagon is
considering an accelerated shipbuilding plan that would cost $4
billion to $5 billion more per year than is budgeted in the current
Pentagon spending plan through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   After a review of the nation's military needs in 1997, the
Pentagon concluded that the Navy should reduce its fleet to about
306 ships, including 12 aircraft carriers. In the years since, that
has proven problematic because it does not allow for continual
carrier presence in the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean and the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Sustaining a 306-ship fleet requires the construction of 8.7 new
vessels each year to replace decommissioned ships. The report
acknowledged that Clinton's budget for fiscal years 2001-2005
allows for a shipbuilding rate of only 7.8 per year.
</P>
<P>
   In its report to Congress on Monday, the Pentagon said the next
major review of U.S. defense needs, scheduled to start in 2001,
would consider as ''one possible option'' building up the fleet to
360 ships, including 15 aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Building such a force would take a major commitment of
resources and require pacing over 15 to 20 years,'' the report
said. It would require building ships at an average rate of 11 per
year, which would cost an additional $4 billion to $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement responding to the Pentagon report, Sen. Olympia
Snowe, R-Maine, said it revealed ''a disturbing gap'' between what
the Pentagon says is needed for the long term and what Clinton's
budget provides.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe is chairwoman of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on
seapower. Bath Ironworks in Maine is a major shipbuilder.

<HEADLINE> Networks Mark End to Elian Story  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Television news networks kept vigil on Wednesday
as a boy whose story had sustained them for months boarded an
airplane and took off for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS and NBC interrupted regular programming to watch the
chartered plane lift off from a Washington-area airport, carrying
Elian Gonzalez to Havana and marking the end of the bitter,
politically charged custody fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been a long, emotional, political and dramatic odyssey
for this young man,'' said NBC's Tom Brokaw shortly before the
takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   ABC juxtaposed pictures of the plane moving into position for
takeoff with videotape of a helicopter plucking the 6-year-old from
the sea on Nov. 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A restrained sense of anticlimax characterized Wednesday's
broadcast coverage of Elian's departure, hours after the boy's
Miami relatives exhausted their legal appeals. At the cable news
networks -- where the debate over Elian's fate provided hundreds of
programming hours -- it was more heated.
</P>
<P>
   CNN, whose ratings have tumbled dramatically over the past year,
had the rare chance to juggle two major stories. The network
covered President Clinton's news conference and the developing
Elian story simultaneously by splitting its screen.
</P>
<P>
   CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC all used a helicopter to trace
the movements of Elian and his family during their final hours in
the United States. The boy and some of his friends pointed and
waved at a helicopter hovering above them.
</P>
<P>
   From there, each network followed Elian's motorcade to
Washington Dulles International Airport from the air -- pictures
eerily similar to the slow-speed chase of O.J. Simpson in his Ford
Bronco in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   All of the networks covered Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's
father, as he delivered a short statement before boarding the
airplane. Not all seemed to realize Gonzalez would be speaking in
Spanish; ABC and CNN were quickest to translate his words into
English.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras also caught an angry outburst by one of Elian's Miami
relatives, Lazaro Gonzalez, as he realized his fight to keep the
boy in the United States had ended. He shouted at photographers but
was pulled away by his daughter, Marisleysis, who had taken care of
Elian before the April raid that removed the boy from their home.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Waive A.C. Green  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A.C. Green, the NBA ironman who won two
championships with the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s and returned
to earn another this year, was waived Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Green, 36, who ran his league record for consecutive games to
1,133 this season, averaged 5.0 points, 5.9 rebounds and 23&AMP;frac12;
minutes. In the playoffs, he averaged 3.9 points and 4.2 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''A.C. Green played an important role in helping us win the NBA
championship and has obviously meant a lot to this franchise over
the years,'' Lakers executive vice president Jerry West said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers reacquired Green, who was on their ''Showtime''
championship teams in 1986 and 1987, from Dallas in exchange for
Sean Rooks last September.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who often perches a stuffed green bear on his head while
on the bench during games to promote his chastity for youth
programs, has been in the league for 15 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He played for Phoenix after leaving the Lakers in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He last missed a game on Nov. 18, 1986, when then-Lakers coach
Pat Riley did not play him in Dallas. The previous mark for
consecutive games was 906 by Randy Smith.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Pollution With Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN POPE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Tiny pollution particles produced by everything
from cars to power plants are responsible for higher death rates
and more hospital stays among the elderly, according to a study.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 90 large American cities, released Wednesday by the
Health Effects Institute, confirms a link suggested by previous
smaller-scale studies. But it goes farther in isolating
''particulate matter'' as the cause of higher rates of death and
disease, separating it from pollutants such as ozone, sulfur
dioxide and carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at tiny atmospheric particles of 10 microns or
less in diameter. A micron is equal to one thousandth of a
millimeter.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of particulate matter comes from combustion
sources, such as cars and power plants. The other 40 percent comes
from construction, agriculture and road-related pollution, such as
minute pieces of brakes and tires.
</P>
<P>
   The report claimed to ''provide new and strong evidence linking
particulate air pollution to adverse health effects.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that on average, deaths increased 0.5 percent
for every 10 microgram increase in the number of particles per
cubic meter of air. Among the elderly, hospital admissions for
cardiovascular problems increased 1 percent for each 10 microgram
increase and cardiopulmonary admissions rose 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important to remember that a 0.5 percent increase
reflects a broad population base. A small percentage can affect a
large number of people,'' said Robert O'Keefe, the institute's vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not attempt to calculate how many lives increased
pollution might cost, or to fully address whether pollution merely
sped the deaths of people who already were gravely ill.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in death and disease was actually less than that
reported in several previous studies. But the authors of the latest
study said it uses more sophisticated statistical methods and
surveys a broader area -- meaning the results are less dramatic but
more credible.
</P>
<P>
   The highest correlation was found in cities in the Northeast,
especially New York, where the increase in mortality was more than
twice the average of other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said that might be due to more accurate data for
that area, or to a more unhealthy combination of pollutants there.
</P>
<P>
   The institute is funded in equal parts by the federal
Environmental Protection Agency and the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''We respect their findings,'' said Phil Colley, a spokesman for
Ford Motor Co., which also issued a statement calling for more
research on the issue.

<HEADLINE> BC-CT--Murder in Greenwich, 5th Ld-Writethru,1,000  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - There is ample evidence to justify
putting Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel on trial as an adult in the
1975 beating death of a Greenwich teen-ager, a prosecutor declared
Wednesday at the close of three dramatic days of hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict said Skakel's
purported confessions in the late 1970s to two former classmates at
a substance-abuse rehabilitation center were reason enough to make
him stand trial. Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, accused those
witnesses of lying outright on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile Judge Maureen Dennis told the lawyers she would issue a
written ruling, though she did not indicate when.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings, which began last week and ended Wednesday
afternoon, were held to determine if there was enough evidence to
proceed to trial with the case against Skakel, and if so, whether
he should be tried as a juvenile or as an adult in the Oct. 30,
1975 murder of 15-year-old Martha Moxley. Because he was 15 at the
time of the killing, Skakel's case has so far been handled in
juvenile court.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, now 39, is the son of Rushton Skakel Sr., a brother of
slain U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel. The Skakels lived
across the street from the Moxleys in Belle Haven, an exclusive
gated community in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   For years, authorities suspected Skakel's older brother, Thomas,
then 17, in Moxley's killing. But no arrests were ever made, and
the case stalled until a grand jury consisting of a single judge
was appointed in 1998. In January, Michael Skakel was arrested
based on the grand juror's findings.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing arguments, Benedict cited the testimony of a
childhood friend of Skakel's who testified that more than 15 years
after the murder, Skakel admitted being at the spot where
15-year-old Moxley was killed at the time of her murder, although
he denied having anything to do with her death.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley's bludgeoned body was found on her family's estate on
Oct. 31, 1975. She had been with the Skakel brothers and other
teen-age friends the night before, when authorities believe she was
murdered as she left the Skakel house to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict said Skakel should be tried as an adult because ''no
Connecticut juvenile institution has the ability to deal in any way
with a 39- or 40-year-old man.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said the state's case was built on testimony that
amounted to lies. He said Skakel's clean criminal record since 1975
served as ''a crystal ball'' that showed he is an upstanding
citizen incapable of murder and does not require any kind of
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the benefit of 25 years of hindsight. For 25 years, he
has led an exemplary life,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Moxley's brother, John, later pointed out that Skakel has
not had a completely clean record since the killing, citing his
arrest in 1978 in Windham, N.Y., after leading police on a
high-speed chase. He was sent to Elan shortly after that incident.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, members of the Kennedy clan turned out to
support Skakel, including two of his cousins - Robert F. Kennedy
Jr. and Douglas Kennedy, both sons of Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a horrible, unspeakable tragedy, but it only compounds
it to blame Michael Skakel, who is innocent,'' Robert F. Kennedy
Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman called to the witness stand a former student at the Elan
School, a residential drug and alcohol treatment center in Maine
which Skakel attended in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two former students at the school testified that
Skakel had confessed to them that he killed Moxley, who was
bludgeoned with a golf club. The 6-iron used in the murder was
traced to a set owned by the Skakels.
</P>
<P>
   One student, John Higgins, said Skakel confessed to him one
night 20 years ago during an erratic, tearful conversation. But
Higgins admitted he lied to investigators when they initially
questioned him about the alleged confession. He also admitted
asking about a $50,000 reward.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Coleman, another former Elan student, said Skakel told
him he drove Moxley's skull in with a golf club and declared: ''I'm
gonna get away with murder. I'm a Kennedy.'' Coleman went on to
describe his own life - filled with alcoholism, drug addiction, a
criminal record, homelessness, and living under a bridge at times.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, former student Alice Dunn said she never heard
Skakel admit to killing Moxley, even while he was undergoing
therapy that involved being pummeled in a boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   ''He denied vehemently, over and over again, 'No, no, no, no!'''
Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel was subjected to the treatment after he ran away from
Elan, Dunn testified. The ring was used to break down students'
resistance and force them to confront the root cause of their
emotional problems, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But later, during cross-examination, Benedict read portions of
Dunn's earlier testimony before a grand jury that appeared to
contradict what she said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In her grand jury testimony, Dunn quoted Skakel as saying, ''I
don't know if I did it; it was myself or my brother. It was one of
us, but I was in a blackout and I don't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other Elan students testified for the defense that they
never heard Skakel confess.
</P>
<P>
   But Benedict said in his closing arguments that prosecutors do
not claim Skakel made confessions to all of the more than 200
students at Elan. He said Higgins and Coleman had no reason to
fabricate the alleged confessions or to agree to testify against
Skakel after so many years other than wanting to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman also called a child advocate and state magistrate who
was a Skakel family friend.
</P>
<P>
   Bernadette Coomaraswamy said that in the early 1980s, when
Skakel was in his early 20s, she frequently asked him to speak to a
child advocacy group she helped found because he had overcome his
substance abuse problems and wanted to help others.
</P>
<P>
   She said she later introduced him to Mother Teresa because, ''He
seemed to want to give so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman then asked Coomaraswamy if she would go as far to say
that Skakel, even if he did kill Moxley - which she does not
believe - does not need rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, that's correct,'' she said.

By The Associated Press	   Storms speckled the Southeast and Plains and the West
stayed
fair and dry Wednesday, while partly to mostly cloudy skies covered
the Northeast.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms stretched from Maryland and
Delaware, through Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee, with the
strongest storms packing locally heavy downpours across easterain
Tennessee and westerain Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   A warm, moist and unstable air mass covered most of the
Southeast and along the Gulf Coast, and showers and thunderstorms
started forming over southerain Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the remainder of the Southeast saw a mix of sun and
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   A large area of rain and thunderstorms lingered in southerain
Missouri, westerain Arkansas, Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, with
the heaviest rainfall falling occurring in easterain Oklahoma and
northwesterain Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Two to four inches of rain pelted those areas, and flash flood
warainings were in effect for Oklahoma's Adair, Cherokee and Delaware
counties and Benton and Washington counties in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was looking for fish to be going across the highway,'' said
Sandy Stafford, a clerk at the Seminole County Sheriff's Department
in Wewoka in central Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Less intense showers and thunderstorms remained in the southerain
Plains, and a few light showers moved across parts of Iowa,
southerain Wisconsin and northerain Illinois. Rainfall amounts totaled
less than a tenth of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the northerain and central Plains, as well as the
Great Lakes and Ohio Valley were under partly cloudy skies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the westerain United States had fair, dry weather. The
exception: some of the Southwest and southerain Rockies, where there
were clouds and scattered showers.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures around the Lower 48 on Wednesday ranged from 99
degrees in Las Vegas to 34 in Leadville, Colo.

<HEADLINE> School construction bill, state budget up for final votes Thursday  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - There's a lot on state lawmakers' plates
Thursday, the last scheduled voting day before their summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   Promising the most drama is the multibillion dollar school
construction bill, details of which were still up in the air less
than 24 hours before the scheduled vote.
</P>
<P>
   A $21.5 billion state budget will also take center stage
Thursday as the state Assembly and Senate meet for the last
scheduled voting session before the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   A host of other bills, including those outlawing the drug
Ecstasy, mandating sprinklers in college dorm rooms, and putting
sex offenders names on the Internet, are also scheduled for action.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Senate President Donald DiFrancesco and Assembly
Speaker Jack Collins said late Wednesday there was still no
agreement on the school construction bill.
</P>
<P>
   The measure provides $6 billion for the state's 30 so-called
special needs school districts to replace or repair crumbling
buildings, and $2.6 million for all other districts.
</P>
<P>
   But differences between Senate and Assembly leaders over how to
parcel out the money and between the Legislature and Gov. Christie
Whitman over its escalating pricetag have led to the current
logjam.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman and the legislative leaders want to agree ahead of time
on what changes the governor will make to the bill, in the form of
a conditional veto, after the Senate votes on the version
previously approved by the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would then be for lawmakers in both houses to vote
again to agree with her changes.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a possibility the Assembly may postpone action on
the bill if members are not given enough time to digest any
agreed-upon changes, said Chuck Leitgeb, a spokesman for the lower
house.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a chance we may not do it if a conditional veto just
lands on us late,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the possibility that Assembly leaders may not be
happy with an agreement largely crafted between the Senate and the
governor's office, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are changes that move some Republican members off the
bill, there could be a problem,'' the spokesman said. ''The real
test will be what the conditional veto language is.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman released a statement Wednesday night acknowledging the
school construction bill's uncertain fate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're close to a compromise with the Senate and we expect them
to take action. But at this point, we have no commitments from the
Assembly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the state budget, meanwhile, is virtually assured.
</P>
<P>
   The $21.5 billion spending plan passed legislative committees in
bipartisan fashion earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Overall school aid will hit $6.65 billion, with $2.75 billion of
it earmarked for the special needs districts.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also spends $701 million for the Transportation Trust
Fund, lowering the amount that will need to be financed with
long-term bonds.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Legislature Expels Senator  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian Senate expelled one of its
members Wednesday for allegedly misappropriating public funds, the
first time in its history the body has ejected a lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 52 in favor, 18 against and 10 abstentions, the
upper house impeached developer and Senator Luiz Estevao and
stripped him of his congressional immunity. The move paved the way
for his arrest on charges of embezzling nearly $93 million in the
building of the yet-unfinished Sao Paulo State Labor Courthouse by
his construction firm.
</P>
<P>
   Estevao has also been charged with overbilling the Sao Paulo
state government for the construction of the courthouse which
already cost public coffers $145 million. It was unclear by how
much he overbilled the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate expelled Estevao for ''lack of parliamentary
decorum'' because he allegedly lied about the involvement of his
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''The expulsion is another blow against politicians who use and
abuse their mandates to break the law with impunity and then hide
behind their mandates,'' said attorney Reginaldo de Castro,
president of the Brazilian Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the lower house Chamber of Deputies expelled
Congressman Hildebrando Pascoal, who is now behind bars on charges
including drug trafficking, torture and murder.

   DETROIT (AP) -- Juan Gonzalez was a late scratch from the Detroit
Tigers' lineup against the New York Yankees on Wednesday night with
a recurrence of soreness in his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was injured Saturday night in Cleveland when he fouled

   Tuesday's game was the Tigers' first after a proposed trade that

<HEADLINE> Royals Outright Johnson, Batista  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Kansas City Royals outrighted
catcher Brian Johnson and right-hander Miguel Batista to Triple-A
Omaha on Wednesday and recalled right-hander Doug Bochtler and
catcher Jorge Fabregas, who had been sent down earlier in the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, recovering from knee surgery, was hitting .208 in 125
at-bats with four homers and 18 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Batista had won just two of eight decisions and had an ERA of
7.74 since being acquired from Montreal. He had also given up 17
home runs in 57 innings as the Royals continued to lead the majors
in homers allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Royals manager Tony Muser said Johnson, 32, indicated he would
not play in the minor leagues. He had been splitting time with
Gregg Zaun until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been a tremendous professional,'' Muser said. ''He wanted
to be the everyday guy and felt he wasn't given the opportunity.
These are decisions managers have to make. Tool-wise, he didn't
show me enough to be the everyday catcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochtler will be used as Batista was -- everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll use him in the middle, try to get out of innings,''
Muser said. ''We'll use him long and short. We'll use him anywhere
we possibly can. He'll come in the middle, he'll set up.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Wins Case Against Yashin  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The NHL said it has won its case against Ottawa
Senators holdout center Alexei Yashin, a decision that means he
owes the team another year of service.
</P>
<P>
   The league, which confirmed the decision Wednesday, would not
release any other details of the case, except to say the decision
was rendered by arbitrator Lawrence Holden of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The high-scoring Yashin played four seasons of his five-year
contract with the Senators before sitting out the 1999-2000 season.
He contended he would become a restricted free agent July 1 because
the terms of his deal concluded June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL claimed the contract, worth $3.6 million for last
season, would not be complete on Friday because the Russian star
had not worked during the fifth year of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a legal perspective, we think the arbitrator reached the
wrong decision,'' Ian Pulver, associate counsel of the NHL Players'
Association, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case was not about whether Alexei should or should not
have played during the 1999-2000 season. This was a case about
whether Alexei owed another year on his contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The last session with the arbitrator was May 30 in Ottawa.
Holden had up to 30 days from that day to render a decision,
meaning Thursday was the last possible date for an announcement.
</P>
<P>
   A second arbitration hearing is scheduled for July over the
league's contention that the Senators should receive $7 million in
damages because Yashin's refusal to report to Ottawa hurt the
club's performance on the ice as well as in sales of tickets and
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is the possibility that the Senators might trade
Yashin.
</P>
<P>
   Holden's decision isn't a factor in a trade. His decision
matters only to the league, which -- through the case -- was trying
to get something it couldn't through negotiation: language to
prevent a player from getting around a contract by sitting out.
</P>
<P>
   This is a standard clause in the collective agreements of the
other major professional sports. The NHL tried but failed to get it
in its last round of bargaining with the NHL Players' Association.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A plane carrying Elian Gonzalez and his father left for
Cuba today after the Supreme Court cleared the way for the 6-year-old refugee's
return home. Seven months after he was lifted from the sea -- his mother lost in
that desperate journey to America -- Elian took off in one of two chartered

Court Upholds 'Partial-Birth' Abortion

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today limited states' power to ban
so-called ''partial-birth'' abortions, a 5-4 ruling that escalated the bitter,
decades-old debate over women's right to end their pregnancies. Closing out its
1999-2000 term with some of the most divisive rulings in years, the court struck
down Nebraska's partial-birth abortion law as an ''undue burden'' on women's
rights. The court also ruled that the Boy Scouts can bar homosexuals from
serving as troop leaders. The decision may also let the 6.2-million member
organization reject gay boys as members.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today after the Federal Reserve said it would

<HEADLINE> Mayor: New complex makes Manhattan's West Side world's cultural center </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - New York's most spectacular new development is a
twin-tower media center designed as the headquarters of AOL and
Time Warner and the city's CNN base, ringed by retail and
residential space.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.7 billion Time Warner Center, a 55-story, glass complex
filling 2.8 million square feet above Broadway at the corner of
Central Park, ''is the city's icon for the 21st century - the way
Rockefeller Center was for the 20th,'' said Stephen Ross, head of
The Related Cos., one of three partners in the project.
</P>
<P>
   To be completed by 2003, it promises the world's first
performing arts theaters devoted to jazz, as well as shops,
restaurants, a five-star hotel, a garage and condominiums
overlooking the Hudson River and the Manhattan skyline.
</P>
<P>
   ''The complex will create a vibrant 24-hour-a-day community at
Columbus Circle,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   He credited Mayor Rudolph Giuliani with pushing forward a
project that has faced financial and bureacratic hurdles for almost
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The process began in 1985, when the city and the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority first tried to sell the land to a
developer. Mort Zuckerman's Boston Properties held the rights for
nine years, but did not finalize a deal. In 1997, Related submitted
a proposal that beat out several others.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to yield to New York City another tremendous
landmark,'' the mayor told a news conference hosted by CNN anchor
Bernard Shaw and attended by top executives of Time Warner and
other companies, as well as city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani spoke under a tent in the middle of Columbus Circle,
near a statue of Christopher Columbus. Across the street lay the
rubble of the old New York Coliseum convention center, which was
built in 1953 and has since deteriorated. The Coliseum occupied
land that Related is to purchase from the MTA by the end of next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Dominating one of the city's most valuable and best-known sites
- two blocks at the southwest corner of Central Park - the Time
Warner Center will link Manhattan's Upper West Side with midtown
Manhattan and Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   According to the design by Skidmore Owings &AMP; Merrill architect
David M. Childs, the 750-foot tall glass towers, topped by metal
and glass ''lanterns,'' will rest on a base that curves around the
circle. The Time Warner studios will be housed behind a glass
facade on the eighth floor, above a retail gallery, with other
offices on lower floors.
</P>
<P>
   AOL awaits federal approval of its merger with Time Warner,
which would unify the world's largest Internet and media companies.
</P>
<P>
   The center's 203 condominium apartments will be on the 20th to
the 49th floors of the south tower, and the 36th to the 49th floors
of the north. The 249-room Mandarin Oriental hotel is to occupy
floors 15 to 35 of the north tower.
</P>
<P>
   The main public entry will be through a 150-foot high cable net
glass wall, with a circular shopping gallery stretching behind it
from West 60th Street to West 58th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is being financed with a $1.3 billion loan from
GMAC Commercial Mortgage Corp., which bills it as the largest loan
ever made for a private development project in the United States.
Apollo Real Estate Advisors and The Palladium Co. complete the
development partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The $103 million jazz center - tucked behind the main entrance -
will include a 1,100-seat theater flanked by rehearsal studios
wired for recording, broadcast and Webcast. A 600-seat performance
atrium with a dance floor and tables will feature star performers
playing in front of a 50-foot window overlooking Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   The complex, just blocks from Lincoln Center, makes Manhattan's
West Side ''the cultural center of the world,'' said Giuliani.

<HEADLINE> Panel proposes relocating Buffalo's Children's Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Relocating Children's Hospital into a
proposed new $152.5-million facility is considered the best move
for the institution's future, an independent advisory panel
concluded Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel recommended relocating the city hospital to High
Street where it would be linked by an overhead walkway to Buffalo
General Hospital. The proposed new location is also near Roswell
Park Cancer Institute, creating a massive hospital corridor in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations are now in the hands of Kaleida Health
System, which operates both Children's Hospital and Buffalo
General. Kaleida officials have said the recommendations would
serve as a guide in making the final decision on whether to move
the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is essential in the maintenance of keeping Children's
Hospital with a capital C and H, just that, a children's
hospital,'' advisory panel member Dr. Theodore Putman said.
</P>
<P>
   Health care providers worry the special needs of children could
be lost by mixing the facility in with other hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Naturally, I'm disappointed and somewhat surprised that this
conclusion was reached before a plan was drawn up,'' Dr. Steven
Lana said.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse Ann Woloszyn said: ''I would hate to see children be
clumped with adults. Children have special needs and need special
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the facility, in its new location, would allow
the hospital to provide a full range of services to adult female
patients, something it cannot do now, and enhance other medical
services.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Buffalo is also interested in the hospital's
relocation. UB officials are prepared to spend $65 million to
establish a new outpatient center and medical research building in
the High Street area should Children's Hospital move.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo institution has operated out of the same Bryant
Street location for 108 years, and was the state's first children's
hospital when it opened in 1892.
</P>
<P>
   The panel recommendations include coming up with a plan to
determine how to reuse the existing site, allaying the fears of
resident who don't want an abandoned building left behind.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Coming To Close in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOMA BLANCA, Mexico (AP) -- Mexico's presidential candidates made
last-minute appeals to voters Wednesday -- with one even coming to a
rally on horseback -- the final day of an increasingly bitter
campaign ahead of Sunday's tightly fought election.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show conservative opposition candidate Vicente Fox in a
dead heat with Francisco Labastida of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which has governed Mexico since 1929 -- in what
appears to be one of the cleanest races in Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who has the best chance in at least a century to topple a
Mexican government at the ballot box, rode on horseback into a
rally of 10,000 people on a grassy field outside Loma Blanca, a
rural village about 35 miles west of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not one minute more!'' Fox declared in urging an end to the
PRI's 71-year hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Loma Blanca has long been a PRI stronghold. According to
resident Luis Enriquez Alvarez: ''It was pure PRI here. ''Now ask
anyone and they will all tell you they want change -- now.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The PRI made a lot of promises that they never kept,'' said
his wife, Susana Chavez. ''Before the last elections they started
paving the road in our town. After the elections they stopped and
they haven't done anything since.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez claimed the PRI was offering voters 50 pesos for their
votes. ''If you are going to support someone it should be legal,''
she said. ''We don't have any reason to vote for someone for 50
pesos.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of its history, the PRI dominated all aspects of
Mexican political life. When popular support was lacking, it often
resorted to stuffing ballot boxes, intimidation and patronage to
assure itself of landslide victories.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans believe that fraud cost opposition candidate
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas the 1988 election -- or at least widened the
margin of victory of Carlos Salinas de Gortari. With electoral
reforms in recent years, few people believe that kind of fraud
could occur again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tractors, buses and cars carried men in cowboy boots and hats up
a narrow dirt road to the rally, where a band played ''ranchero,''
music and cheers and bottle rockets burst from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Fox noted his own youth on a farm, and promised he was ready
''to die in the line of duty as president to help you advance.''
</P>
<P>
   He also appealed to followers of Cardenas, the No. 3 candidate,
to join his campaign to ''get the PRI out of Los Pinos,'' the
presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas and his leftist Democratic Revolution Party have no
chance for victory, Fox told the cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas has repeatedly refused to join an alliance with Fox and
has repeatedly accused Fox of breaking campaign laws and of being
subservient to U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas appeared before a small crowd of about 500 people in
the gulf coast oil city of Ciudad del Carmen on Wednesday, saying
the oil industry was symbolic of the nation: a promising resource
misused by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Maribel Castillo, 28, had the yellow sun symbol of Cardenas'
party painted on her cheeks, but said, ''If this had been for Fox,
I still would have come... I'm just tired of the PRI and I want a
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida had a quiet schedule Wednesday ahead of his late-night
closing campaign rally in Culiacan in Sinaloa.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he appealed for reconciliation after the election:
''The important thing is that there is neither rancor nor hatred
among Mexicans after the 3rd,'' Labastida said at a rally in
Cuernavaca, south of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of those words was undercut by his repeated
television commercials on Wednesday accusing Fox of being an
anti-patriotic liar.

<HEADLINE> Statistics debunk notion that racial profiling ingrained in troopers </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The rank-and-file troopers have never been
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling may be a tricky and painful door to unlock. But
new statistics seem to show that the individual prejudices, skills
and training of the men and women of the New Jersey State Police
will not provide a key to unlocking it.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic-stop statistics released Tuesday might show racial
profiling is still an issue on the New Jersey Turnpike, but it is
clearly not an issue anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Attorney General John Farmer said the new numbers are
too new to say anything.
</P>
<P>
   An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer called the new numbers
- and the state's lackluster response to them - an outrage.
</P>
<P>
   An official in the troopers' union said the new numbers prove
racial profiling is a myth.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers do show more directly than ever before that if
racial discrimination does exist, there is nothing inherent in the
makeup of the typical New Jersey state trooper to account for it.
</P>
<P>
   If it were true that troopers relied on bigotry to select which
drivers to stop, it would be true off the turnpike. It is not.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, about 26 percent of the 118,000 drivers who got
pulled over by troopers from January to April were minorities,
according to the first comprehensive breakdown ever of traffic-stop
patterns across the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   The race breakdown was as follows: 16 percent black, 6 percent
Hispanic, 4 percent Asians or other racial ethnicities.
</P>
<P>
   A Census Bureau wonk could not have predicted it better. The
census shows 27 percent of New Jersey's 8.1 million residents are
minorities: 13 percent black, 10 percent Hispanic and 4 percent
Asians or other racial ethnicities.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, troopers are pulling over precisely the share of
minority drivers one would expect them to nab as a fair, normal,
random proportion of the state's population.
</P>
<P>
   The results for the turnpike were sharply different. There, 38
percent of the drivers who were pulled over were minorities. Of the
motorists stopped by those troopers who patrol the southern leg of
the nation's busiest highway, 45 percent were minorities.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that something is going on along the turnpike
that will remain a matter of debate at the Statehouse and in
courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Reginald Jackson, executive director of the Black
Ministers Council of New Jersey, was disturbed by the 38-percent
figure, as was Bill Buckman, who handled the state's most famous
racial-profiling litigation in 1996 on behalf of the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   Union vice president David Jones, who patrolled the turnpike for
eight years, said the numbers were normal and to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''What man can look at these numbers and suggest any other
reason than that the people who are getting stopped are the people
who are breaking the law,'' Jones said. ''There is no such animal
as racial profiling. It is jargon that has taken on a life of its
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Paul Zoubek said all of the numbers
are inconclusive, especially since no thorough studies have been
finished on the racial demographics of turnpike travelers.
</P>
<P>
   But what it means off of the turnpike seems clear. When the
turnpike units are extracted, State Police barracks elsewhere in
the state executed 90,382 traffic stops. Of those, 22 percent of
the drivers were minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a trooper supposedly inclined to hunt down black
drivers on the turnpike, treating them like criminal suspects
merely for ''driving while black,'' suddenly lose this inclination
when assigned to work elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   The most logical answer would appear to be that state troopers
who leave the turnpike for other assignments - as most do after
three or four years - do not lose a personal inclination toward
racist treatment because they never had one in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   In the reports from Whitman administration officials and
comments from Gov. Christie Whitman herself and from others, there
has been an underlying message that the New Jersey State Police,
once widely praised as elite, is now soiled by a handful of ''bad
apples.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckman, no friend of the State Police, never accepted the
bad-apple notion, focusing blame on uniformed supervisors and
civilians in charge of law-enforcement policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Turnpike troopers) were exposed to racially stereotypical
training that taught them that color was suspect, and that their
career would be advanced by stopping as many people of color as
possible,'' Buckman said. ''This is agency-driven statistics, not a
few bad apples. This comes from the top down.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the changes imposed by Farmer and the new
superintendent, Carson Dunbar, seem designed to deal with the
mythical bad trooper.
</P>
<P>
   They have begun computer monitoring troopers on patrol,
conducted retraining on the meaning of the U.S. Constitution,
installed video cameras in patrol cars and beefed up the staff of
the hated Internal Affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   Jones calls it all a crackdown. He said with all of this
monitoring, no one could suspect that the high proportion of
minority stops on the turnpike has anything to do with a racist
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is suggesting that our people are either so arrogant or so
stupid to continue in this act with so much public scrutiny on
this,'' Jones said. ''Their careers, their families are at stake.
Who in their right mind would do this?''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Protest GOP Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In pitched partisan battle, Republicans
advanced election-year Medicare prescription drug legislation
toward a House vote Wednesday, brushing aside a veto threat from
President Clinton and the vociferous objections of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time to modernize Medicare by adding a prescription drug
benefit so that all seniors can get the chance to enjoy their
golden years,'' said Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., advocating a
plan that relies on a blend of private insurance companies and
federal subsidies to spread coverage nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, who led
his rank and file on a brief walkout to protest GOP tactics,
sharply disagreed. ''It's a sham. It's a hoax. It's public
relations. It's electioneering. It is not writing a plan that will
help people,'' he said after returning to the Capitol for the
daylong debate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats prepared a costlier alternative with a uniform,
government-defined prescription drug benefit, offered to all 39
million senior citizens now enrolled in Medicare. But majority
Republicans, arguing that the $100 billion price tag exceeded the
$40 billion contained in their budget, refused to allow a vote on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills included provisions to help low-income senior
citizens and those with particularly high annual drug expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Costs under the GOP plan would vary by policy, but Republicans
estimated a $250 annual deductible, a $35 to $40 monthly premium
and a 50-50 split on the first $2,100 in expenses. Catastrophic
coverage would begin after a senior had spent $6,000 out of pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said their plan had a premium beginning at $25 a
month, gradually doubling as benefits increased. There would no
deductible and a 50-50 split up to $2,000 in costs, rising
gradually to $5,000. Catastrophic coverage would kick in at $4,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to cede an easy political triumph to Republicans,
Democrats forced roughly a dozen votes on time-consuming procedural
motions throughout day. In addition, they took the unusual step of
requiring the text of their 78-page alternative be read aloud from
the House podium.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans betrayed little anxiety about the outcome, and one
Democrat, Rep. Jerry Klezcka of Wisconsin, conceded the GOP bill
would ultimately pass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hastert huddled on the House floor at one point with Rep.
JoAnn Emerson, a Missouri Republican who expressed misgivings about
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   She said she feared coverage would not be available in rural
areas, noting that in parts of her district, HMOs no longer offer
coverage for basic Medicare hospital and doctor coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Also, several Democrats referred during the day to a letter from
the head of the Health Insurance Association of America expressing
doubt that companies would choose to write policies under the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most fiery rhetoric of the day came from Rep. Jim
Traficant, D-Ohio, who chastised fellow Democrats for their
walkout. ''JFK would have never walked out from a fight. ...
Warriors do not walk out,'' he said, declaring his intention to
support the GOP measure as a good first step toward prescription
drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans maneuvered in other ways to maximize their support,
inserting a provision at the last minute designed to reassure HMOs
that they are prepared to increase their Medicare payments in
future legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton weighed in with a written veto threat, then criticized
Republicans at a White House news conference: ''The bottom line is
their plan is designed to benefit the companies who make the
prescription drugs, not the older Americans who need to take
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Polling indicates the issue ranks high with Americans 65 and
older, a group that accounted for more than one-quarter of voters
in the 1998 elections and is regarded as a key swing group in the
coming fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With elections to determine control of the House little more
than four months away, the debate was thoroughly political
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, Democrats questioned the motivation of
Republicans, reading from advice a GOP pollster recently gave
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of providing prescription coverage for seniors, it
provides political coverage for Republicans,'' charged Rep. Robert
Wexler, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert acknowledged the issue's political importance, but
rebutted the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Citing reports that Democrats have already tested campaign
advertisements on the issue, he said, ''My friends, put those
commercials away. America is sick and tired of bickering. Americans
just want us to create a product that will benefit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in both parties used pill vials as props. Several
Democrats held them aloft, complaining the Republican plan would
leave them empty. But Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., pulled a length
of rad tape from one bottle, and said that's what senior citizens
would get if the Democratic plan were adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill is H.R. 4680.

<HEADLINE> Questions of U.S. Drug War Plans  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS POZOS, Colombia (AP) -- Washington's escalating drug war in
Colombia is expected to come under sharp attack at an international
peace conference opening Thursday in this tiny village in the
country's coca-growing south.
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by leftist guerrillas and the government as part of
negotiations to end the Andean country's 36-year conflict, the
Conference on Illegal Drug Crops and the Environment will be
attended by delegates from 21 countries, including Britain, Spain,
France, Canada and Japan -- but not the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government declined, citing a prohibition on official
contacts with Colombia's largest rebel band, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials would probably not have enjoyed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who have fought the Colombian government for
decades, intend to use the two-day event to rail against U.S.
policy in the country. They also will try to cultivate resistance
to a planned military push into Amazonian jungles where peasants
grow coca, the plant used to make cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC welcomes its visitors at a time when Washington is
''using the excuse of fighting drugs to try and defeat Colombia's
popular movement and insurgents,'' rebel negotiator Carlos Lozada
said in Los Pozos.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill this week, lawmakers were finalizing the $1.3
billion aid plan the rebels object to. The package aims to help
Colombian troops retake jungles near San Vicente del Caguan, where
the FARC and rival paramilitary groups guard and tax
cocaine-producing plots for huge financial payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Trinidad, a FARC commander, said the U.S. policy was aimed
at poor Colombians who grow coca, describing them as ''the weakest
link in ... this business of drug trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem isn't going to be solved through repression,''
Trinidad said.
</P>
<P>
   One coca grower said he resented being tagged a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not like they say in the United States -- that we're a
bunch of narcotraffickers and guerrillas,'' said the grower, who
gave his name only as Luis. ''We're people who work the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the funds would pay for military helicopters and
Green Beret training for Colombian army battalions. Those
battalions will be given the task of securing rebel-held areas
while fumigation planes eradicate coca from the air.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the plan abound.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists contend fumigation is destroying the rain
forest, while rights activists worry the military push will fuel
violence and upset peace efforts in Colombia. Despite record
spraying, Colombia's coca crop has doubled since 1995 and moved
deeper into the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts believe it would be more effective to attack drug
demand in the United States and Europe, while devoting more funding
in Colombia to help peasants find alternatives to the drug crops.
</P>
<P>
   At this week's conference, rebels will accompany ambassadors on
flights over denuded jungles and invite them to hear shoeless coca
farmers describe how fumigation is killing their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a long-standing wish of the FARC ... to show people
how the peasants live, how they have no alternatives, how aerial
fumigation doesn't work and how the government had done next to
nothing,'' said Klaus Nyholm, director of U.N. anti-drug programs
here.
</P>
<P>
   But, Nyholm said, ''there's a lot of nonsense being said about
fumigation. It's not killing off people and cattle or destroying
the soil.'' He said fumigation is a reasonable strategy for killing
off about half the coca crop in Colombia, located in large
commercial plantations run by drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of fumigation should resonate with some countries
openly critical of the U.S.-backed approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Switzerland, we believe that the drug problem is something
that has to be attacked on the consumption front,'' said Geneva's
ambassador to Bogota, Victor Christian.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be difficult for the FARC to drive a wedge between
the United States and major allies.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats going to San Vicente del Caguan say they have no
intention of becoming rebel propagandists. Some are expected to
carry stern demands for the FARC to halt kidnappings as a show of
its sincerity about peace.
</P>
<P>
   And with an estimated 40 percent of Colombia's cocaine now going
to Europe instead of the United States, governments there have a
compelling reasons to support get-tough efforts.

<HEADLINE> Vieques Bombing Over, For Now  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The Navy concluded its exercises on
Vieques Island on Wednesday after three days of bombing that
sparked protests and ended with scores of activists arrested and
four Navy personnel reported injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ships and aircraft of the USS George Washington Carrier Battle
Group successfully completed essential combat training (in Vieques)
prior to deploying in the Mediterranean and Arabian Gulf this
summer,'' the Navy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The move could mean an end for now to the stream of Puerto Rican
activists who have been sneaking under a chain-link fence and onto
the Navy base on the island. The activists hope to impede the
exercises and eventually force the Navy off the island altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not end the controversy over the base. Puerto Rican
political leaders who met Wednesday with President Clinton said
they wold raise the issue. One of the politicians said she would
press Clinton to hold a promised referendum as soon as possible on
whether to remove the base.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques, a populated Puerto Rican island, is also the site of
the Navy's prime Atlantic Fleet training ground. Exercises on
Vieques had stopped in April 1999 after two 500-pound bombs were
dropped off target, killing a civilian security guard and sparking
protests laced with anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   But the shelling began again last weekend -- this time with
inert, or non-explosive, bombs and shells.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy said 183 people were arrested for trespassing since the
exercise began, most of them Puerto Rican Independence Party
demonstrators who invaded the bombing range Tuesday, some cutting
the chain-link fence, others simply lifting it up to crawl under.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday brought the first reported violent confrontation in 14
months of agitation: The Navy claimed fisherman lobbed 12-inch
metal bars that injured two sailors at sea and that a video
recording of the incident was turned over to the FBI. One of the
fishermen, Yabureibo Zenon, flatly denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's Lt. Jeff Gordon said two other Navy personnel also
were injured. One had some fingers broken Saturday while detaining
a protester inside the range, and another suffered a minor leg
injury trying to free a Navy boat from a reef after the incident
with the fishermen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go home, Yankees! This is our land!'' Elba Diaz, a 43-year-old
Vieques housewife, shouted at helicopters overhead that were
scanning the area.
</P>
<P>
   As trespassing protesters were rounded up Tuesday, shelling was
delayed for 45 minutes, the Navy said. Then fighter jets screamed
overhead and thuds and booms could be heard, presumably from an
aerial bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the last to be arrested was independence activist Enrique
Pesquera, brother of pro-statehood gubernatorial candidate Carlos
Pesquera.
</P>
<P>
   Activists committed to ousting the Navy from Vieques say the
bombing destroys fishing grounds and endangers residents. The Navy
maintains the bombing is safe and provides crucial training.
</P>
<P>
   The first fatality on the range in six decades of bombing united
Puerto Ricans as never before to demand that the Navy leave the
island. Dozens of protesters invaded the range and occupied it for
about a year before being peacefully evicted last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy insists the opposition is coming from a small minority
of Puerto Ricans. It says Vieques is the only place its Atlantic
Fleet can hold simultaneous land, air and sea exercises with live
fire before deploying abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, Clinton negotiated an agreement with the Puerto
Rican government allowing the Navy to resume training using
non-explosive ordnance. Clinton also promised a referendum, perhaps
next year, in which Vieques residents would choose whether to evict
the Navy or allow it to stay and resume live bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meeting Wednesday with the leaders of Puerto Rico's
major political parties had originally been called to discuss the
U.S. territory's ultimate status. But the Puerto Rican politicians
said they would raise the Vieques issue.
</P>
<P>
   San Juan Mayor Sila Calderon, gubernatorial candidate for Puerto
Rico's pro-commonwealth party, said she would ask Clinton ''to use
his authority to resolve the Vieques situation immediately'' by
halting all training and allowing the referendum to go ahead as
soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Nebraska Abortion Law  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court dramatically limited states'
power to ban so-called partial-birth abortions Wednesday, a 5-4
ruling that immediately escalated the bitter, decades-old debate
over women's right to end their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
	   Closing out its 1999-2000 term with some of the most divisive
rulings in years, the court struck down Nebraska's partial-birth
abortion law as an ''undue burden'' on women's rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty other states have similar laws, but the justices
disagreed on just how their ruling ultimately will affect those
other laws. More litigation seemed certain.
</P>
<P>
	   James Bopp, a lawyer for the National Right to Life Committee,
called the decision ''a radical expansion of the abortion right.''
Clarke Forsythe of Americans United for Life added: ''It's the most
extreme decision on abortion ever issued by the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
	   The court first legalized abortion nationwide in its famous Roe
v. Wade ruling, the 1973 landmark based on women's constitutional
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Those rights were upheld in 1992 by a 6-3 vote, the court's last
major ruling on abortion. Nothing in Wednesday's decision suggested
the court's vote split on the core abortion issue had changed.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion-rights advocates expressed more relief than joy.
</P>
<P>
	   Janet Benshoof, whose Center for Reproductive Law and Policy
represented the Nebraska doctor who challenged his state's law,
said the close vote ''demonstrates that the right to choose is a
fragile one.''
</P>
<P>
	   Planned Parenthood added: ''While it looks like a victory, this
is a beginning -- not the end. Anti-choice state legislatures and
governors across the country will use this ruling as a blueprint
for drafting new bans on abortion procedures.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton issued a statement at the White House pledging
to veto any similar legislation that widely restricts late-term
abortions. ''A woman's right to choose must include the right to
choose a medical procedure that will not endanger her life or
health,'' Clinton said. ''Today's decision recognizes this
principle and marks an important victory for a woman's freedom of
choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   In other decisions, the court said:
</P>
<P>
	   --Gave states greater leeway to restrict anti-abortion
demonstrators outside clinics. The ruling upheld a Colorado limit
on ''sidewalk counseling.''
</P>
<P>
	   --The Boy Scouts can ban homosexuals from serving as troop
leaders. By extension, the ruling in a New Jersey case could let
the Scouts exclude as well young boys who say they are gay.
</P>
<P>
	   --Significantly lowered the figurative wall of separation between
church and state by ruling in a Louisiana case that taxpayer money
can be used to buy computers and other instructional materials for
religious schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The emotional abortion issue already had become entwined with
this year's presidential election because Republican George W. Bush
supports bans on partial-birth abortions and Democrat Al Gore
opposes them.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton said the nation's next president is likely to
replace two to four Supreme Court justices. ''Depending on who they
are,'' he said, abortion rights are ''very much in the balance.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican-led Congress is working out final details of a
bill that would ban the surgical procedure. President Clinton has
vetoed two such bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Partial-birth abortion is not a medical term. Doctors call the
method dilation and extraction, or D&AMP;X, because it involves
partially extracting a fetus, legs first, through the birth canal,
cutting the skull and draining its contents.
</P>
<P>
	   A more common procedure is dilation and evacuation, or D&AMP;E, in
which an arm or leg of a live fetus may be pulled into the birth
canal during the abortion operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said the Nebraska law, while purportedly aimed only at
the D&AMP;X method, could criminalize the D&AMP;E method as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The law's other big flaw, Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for
the court, was that it lacked an exemption that would allow the D&AMP;X
procedure if it a doctor concluded it was the best way to preserve
a woman's health.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining Breyer were Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day
O'Connor, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor, who supplied the critical fifth vote, suggested in a
concurring opinion that states can ban some partial-birth
abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   ''A ban on partial-birth abortion that only proscribed the D&AMP;X
method of abortion and that included an exception to preserve the
life and health of the mother would be constitutional in my view,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forsythe, the anti-abortion advocate, called O'Connor's words
''an illusion, a national hoax.''
</P>
<P>
	   The court's dissenters -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas --
appeared to agree that the 30 other states may not be able to come
up with easy remedies.
</P>
<P>
	   Writing for himself, Rehnquist and Scalia, Thomas said, ''Today
we are told (by the majority) that 30 states are prohibited from
banning one rarely used form of abortion that they believe to
border on infanticide.''
</P>
<P>
	   And Kennedy, a co-author of the 1992 ruling that upheld abortion
rights, wrote in a dissenting opinion: ''Justice O'Connor assures
the people of Nebraska they are free to redraft the law.... The
assurance is meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ginsburg and Breyer joined the court after the 1992 decision.
Wednesday's ruling was their first on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   The procedure at issue in the Nebraska case is used for some
abortions close to the point of viability, when a fetus is able to
live outside the uterus. Past abortion rulings make clear that
states can take numerous steps to protect fetal life once viability
occurs, generally around the sixth month of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska's law, along with those in Arkansas and Iowa, was
invalidated by a federal appeals court last year. But another
federal appeals court upheld partial-birth abortion bans in
Wisconsin and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
	   An appeal of that federal appeals court ruling still is pending
before the justices, and likely will be set aside and sent back for
more study when the court's clerk issues new orders from the
justices Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's 1997 law was challenged by Dr. Leroy Carhart, one of
only three doctors in Nebraska known to perform abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   Carhart sat quietly in the ornate courtroom Wednesday and showed
little emotion as the decision was summarized from the bench.
Later, he said, ''This is a victory for all Americans who believe
that the government must not be allowed to meddle in the private
decisions best left to women, their families and their doctors.,''

<HEADLINE> Modern Australian Art on Display  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Paintings by modern Australian Aborigines that
went on show in Washington on Wednesday belong to a tradition that
goes back 40,000 years, said George MacDonald, director of the
Melbourne Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the oldest art tradition in the world,'' he told
reporters at the opening of a show called ''Spirit Country'' in the
headquarters of the National Geographic Society.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Isaacs, curator of the show, sees a continuing line from
ancient rock and cave paintings, through designs drawn on the soil
and on people's bodies, to today's paintings on canvas and bark.
</P>
<P>
   A photo show on Australian scenery that opened a week ago, and
another that also opened Wednesday called ''The Great White Shark:
In Danger Down Under,'' make up a trio on the island continent at
the society's Explorers Hall. An 18-foot model of the shark has
been included to help show the danger to the killer fish from
commercial fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   There will be an Australian film festival -- shorts, features and
documentaries -- from July 19 to 22.
</P>
<P>
   Though more than 350,000 Aborigines remain among Australia's 19
million people, about 50 separate communities produce paintings and
artifacts now in great demand among collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are painting as we have always done, to demonstrate our
continuing link with our country and the rights and
responsibilities we have to it,'' wrote Galarrwuy Yunupingu, leader
of the Gumatj people in northern Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We paint to show the rest of the world that we own the country
and the land owns us. Our painting is a political act.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 works look like abstract art, but the people who
make them see them as maps, personal histories, religious documents
and even title deeds to land. They describe intricate tales and
ceremonies, separate for men and women, easily understood by each
community and its neighbors and now highly valued by outsiders even
though they need experts to explain them.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   ''Spirit Country: Australian Aboriginal Art'' will be in
Explorers Hall through Aug. 13. ''Australia Through the National
Geographic Lens'' and ''The Great White Shark: In Danger Down
Under'' will close Oct. 1. Admission is free.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Arrange Welcome for Elian  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Several hundred children from Elian Gonzalez's
school lined up on an airport tarmac to await the boy's arrival
Wednesday evening while the government urged citizens not celebrate
in the streets when the boy returned to his communist homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them carrying small red, white and blue Cuban flags, the
children, dressed in their school uniforms, were led by adults from
Elian's school in his hometown of Cardenas, a port city east of
here.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly, was to
greet the 6-year-old, his family and his schoolmates upon their
arrival Wednesday night, the government said in a statement read on
state television. Alarcon has served as a key adviser to Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, during the protracted custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that Fidel Castro would greet the
boy, but the statement made no mention of the Cuban president, who
had made the fight for Elian's return a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be no official reception nor will there be a mass
mobilization,'' said the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The million of compatriots who have made so much effort to
achieve this objective will enjoy their celebration in the most
intimate part of their hearts, in their homes, or in conjunction
with their closest neighbors,'' said another government statement,
issued later.
</P>
<P>
   It urged citizens ''not to rush out into the streets, overcome
with enthusiasm in expressions of happiness.'' Such behavior, it
said ''would not be the most correct and convenient in this chapter
of our fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When he took off, we all had goose bumps,'' said airport
worker Gisela Diazo, who watched the live televised takeoff of the
plane carrying Elian and his family home from the United States.
''We are all crazy for Elian!''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have won this battle, but we are going to have to keep on
fighting,'' added Dorelis Gonzalez, who also works at the airport
terminal where Elian was scheduled to arrive later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has said all along that no major homecoming would be
planned for Elian, who he has characterized as a ''boy hero'' and
''symbolic child.'' The idea has been to cause Elian as little
trauma as possible and speed his return to a normal life in his
native country.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's friends in his hometown of Cardenas on Wednesday
afternoon traveled to Havana to greet Elian as he returned after
seven months in the United States, residents told journalists
there. A small group representing Elian's first grade classmates
was to meet him at the airport, then the boy was to travel to an
undisclosed site for a one-hour meeting with the whole group, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, 11 buses filled with 200-300 children of varying
ages arrived at the airport Wednesday night about an hour before
the boy was scheduled to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was to stay with his family and classmates for two or
three weeks in Havana at a specially prepared boarding school
before returning to Cardenas, where he was born and raised.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans learned on state television and radio that Elian was
headed home after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal
of the Miami relatives, who were seeking to keep Elian in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now more than ever, our population must behave with the most
dignity, serenity and discipline,'' the statement said. ''Let us
remember that at all times, our fight has just begun and that a
long road before us still remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro has said that even after Elian returns, Cubans must not
take a moment's rest in demanding an end to the four-decade-old
U.S. embargo on the island and American policies that allow Cubans
who reach U.S. soil to remain.
</P>
<P>
   The muted reaction by Cubans appeared to be part of a determined
effort by the government to make Elian's return as low-key as
possible in contrast to what government officials have called the
''circus'' that surrounded much of his life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wait with tranquility the triumph of justice and the end of
the kidnapping,'' ran a headline Wednesday in Granma, the official
daily of Cuba's Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, Castro promised there would be no street
celebrations, no parades when the boy returns -- despite a national
campaign in Cuba that put Elian's face on billboards, placards and
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over Elian began in late November when the child was
rescued off the Florida coast. His mother and 10 other people
drowned when their boat sank en route from Cuba to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was turned over to his Miami relatives, who began fighting
to keep him with them. The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
fought to have the child returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Cubans backed the effort to return the boy to Cuba --
a campaign that has seen over 100 government organized rallies
across the country attended by hundreds of thousands of Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Sambiente, sitting on a park bench in Havana's Parque
Central, said Elian and his family should remain in the United
States because they would have a better life than in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm one of the 50 percent who wants him to stay,'' Sambiente
said. ''The mother wanted him to stay. She died doing that. It was
the last wish of the mother.''

<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Right-hander Ramiro Mendoza, scheduled to start
for the New York Yankees on Thursday night at Detroit, was placed
on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday with weakness in the back of
his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre said left-hander Andy Pettitte, who
pitched Sunday at Chicago, will start Thursday on three days' rest.
No other roster move was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza (7-3, 3.72 ERA) joins right-handers Roger Clemens and
Orlando Hernandez on the Yankees' injury list. But Torre said
there's some hope that either Clemens or Hernandez or both could
return by this weekend's series at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, on the disabled list since June 15 with a strained
right groin, was scheduled to throw batting practice Thursday at
Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez hasn't pitched since he sprained his right elbow June
18 against Chicago. He'll work out Thursday in Detroit, and Torre
said he'll go on the disabled list if he's not ready to pitch by
the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Old Union Leader Joins Umps Talks  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The president of Richie Phillips' old umpires'
union joined the new union's negotiating team in what may be the
first step toward ending the divisive fight that has engulfed the
sport for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   NL ump Jerry Crawford attended Tuesday's bargaining session and
endorsed a joint statement issued Wednesday by all 68 major league
umps and 187 minor league umps, who are separately trying to form
their own union.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something that can help heal umpires and bring us
together,'' said John Hirschbeck, president of the new union, the
World Umpires Association. ''He participated at the table and was
of great help to us when we were amongst ourselves, talking at
different breaks. His insight was very, very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford did not want to elaborate on the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of things are very sensitive here,'' he said. ''The way
things are going, I would rather just remain silent. I would like
to get a deal done.''
</P>
<P>
   NL ump Bruce Froemming, a board member of the Major League
Umpires Association and a vocal Phillips supporter, said he viewed
Crawford's inclusion ''as a positive step.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about all umpires,'' Froemming said. ''We have to come
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Umpires and management called Tuesday's session productive, then
recessed talks until July 5.
</P>
<P>
   The old labor contract expired Dec. 31, and an interim extension
is due to lapse Friday. Both sides said they wouldn't renew the
extension, which means starting Saturday they can call a work
stoppage on 14 days' notice. But neither a strike nor a lockout
appeared imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The ''joint statement of principles'' attacked some of the
demands made by the commissioner's office in negotiations for a new
labor contract, saying umpires had the right to ''exercise
independent judgment ... to call each pitch or play as they see it,
without threat of recrimination or discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Umpires also said ''none should be disciplined or dismissed
without just cause and only after the right to a full hearing
before a neutral arbitrator'' and that umpires ''must have the
right to express their points of view in public, to speak their
opinions and to defend their good names and reputations in the
press.''
</P>
<P>
   Management wants umpires to agree not to speak with reporters
without prior written consent from the commissioner's office,
except for crew chiefs, who would be permitted to discuss
controversial calls.
</P>
<P>
   None of the four major sports has arbitration clauses in the
labor contracts of officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've expressed their views across the table and they're
inconsistent with the terms of the collective bargaining agreements
of every official in professional sports,'' management negotiator
Rob Manfred said. ''Stating them in a public proclamation makes
them no more likely to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have tried to conduct a private and positive collective
bargaining process and unfortunately for the second time in two
weeks, the umpires have elected to inject publicity into the
process in way that's never helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the new union went public with the divisive areas.
Among them in the status of the 22 umpires let go last September
after Phillips' mass resignation plan backfired. Wednesday's
statement said those umpires sustained harm that ''must be
remedied.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners have offered to rehire an unspecified number of the 22 as
part of a new labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 22 resigned. They were not released,'' Manfred said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for minor league umps, who have asked the federal
government for permission to form their own union, attacked the
governing body of the minor leagues, accusing it of obstructing
organization efforts and of illegally firing two umps because of
their union activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear to us that they're engaging in stall tactics,
trying to break their solidarity, their spirit, trying to drag
these things out,'' said Beth Sandon, a lawyer for the Association
of Minor League Umpires.
</P>

   Umpires and representatives of the National Association of
Professional Baseball Leagues, the governing body of the minors,
had a hearing Monday at the Baltimore office of the National Labor
Relations Board, but could not agree on an election procedure,
leaving the decision to the NLRB regional director.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems that lawyers can't represent umpires without engaging
in misrepresentation,'' said George Yund, a lawyer for the National
Association. ''Minor league baseball has cooperated in every
possible was with the National Labor Relations Board.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the reasons for the termination of the two umps, Steve
Mattingly of the Pacific Coast League and Jeff Kowalczyk of the
International League, were unrelated to union activity.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians recalled
right-hander Kane Davis from Buffalo on Wednesday and optioned
right-handers Paul Rigdon and Jaime Navarro to the Triple-A club.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 25, made his first major league start against the Royals
Wednesday night. He has made two relief appearances for the Indians
this season and was 2-0 with a 3.96 ERA in four starts for Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Rigdon was 1-1 with a 7.64 ERA in five games for the Indians
after being promoted from Buffalo on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians also said Wednesday that second baseman Roberto
Alomar and center fielder Kenny Lofton were not seriously injured
in Tuesday night's against against the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Both players left the game early, Alomar because of a sore left
ankle and Lofton after being hit in the right shin by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was bothering me last night when I got to bed, but this
morning it felt better,'' said Alomar, who was in the lineup
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton is expected to return Friday or Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said if it got better today, I could probably play
tomorrow,'' he said. ''That's the way this game goes.''

<HEADLINE> Maurice Greene Finishes 4th in 100  </HEADLINE>
By LISA ORKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Competing on the track where he set the
world 100-meter record a year ago, a surprised Maurice Greene
finished fourth Wednesday at the Athens Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got here a day ago from the States,'' the visibly upset
Greene said after running 10.16 seconds -- .08 seconds behind winner
Greg Saddler.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I was ready to run. I lost. I tried. It happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-time world champion said he would not let the defeat get
him down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to go to Rome and redeem myself,'' he said. ''I will
run 9.8 in Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who had hoped to better the world record of 9.79 he set
a year ago, will compete Friday at the Golden Gala in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   In the race marred by three false starts, Saddler finished in
10.08, Ato Boldon of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago was second at 10.11, and Tim
Montgomery third at 10.15.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm surprised,'' Saddler said. ''No way I came expecting to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   His time was an improvement on the 10.24 he ran at the Paris
Grand Prix last Saturday, where he finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's Francis Obikwelu was disqualified for two false
starts. Greece's Angelos Pavlakakis also false-started.
</P>
<P>
   Greene did not run in any of the heats, but went straight to the
final.
</P>
<P>
   It was Greene's fourth big race this year, following a 200-meter
victory last week in the Prefontaine Classic at Eugene, Ore., and a
second-place finish in the 100 June 15 at the Ericsson Grand Prix.
He ran a world-leading 9.91 at the Japan Grand Prix last month.
</P>
<P>
   The men's 100 was one of the few events at the meet that
included a final. Most of the other short- and middle-distance
men's and women's races only included heats.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 100, which was run in two heats and no final,
Chryste Gaines had the best performance, 10.97.
</P>
<P>
   China's Yanmei Dong had the world's best performance this year
in the women's 3,000 meters with 8:33.07. But Dong's time was far
off the world record of 8:06.11 set by China's Wang Junxia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time world champion Cathy Freeman of Australia won her heat
in the women's 400 at 50.04, ahead of Michelle Collins, the
runner-up at 50.41.

<HEADLINE> Promoter describes $100,000 payoff for Foreman-Schulz rematch  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Boxing promoter Cedric Kushner testified
Wednesday that he thought he had made a persuasive argument to the
IBF executive board for it to mandate a rematch between his
fighter, Axel Schulz, and heavyweight champion George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   After all, IBF rules allow a rematch in disputed fights, and
many thought Schulz prevailed in the April 1995 bout that Foreman
won in a split decision, Kushner told a federal jury in the
racketeering trial of IBF founder Robert W. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner also maintained that Schulz, a German, got less than a
fair shake from the judges, all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   So Kushner said he was angered when Lee's longtime ratings
chairman, C. Douglas Beavers, told him privately afterward that a
rematch would cost $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used some foul language and suggested that he was crazy,
that all concerned was crazy, and that we were entitled to the
rematch,'' Kushner told the jury during his third day on the stand.
''I was totally outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember Mr. Lee telling me at ringside that my fighter was
robbed, and then coming back 30 days later and telling me a rematch
would cost $100,000,'' said the heavyset promoter, who was called
''Fat Man'' by Lee and Beavers in conversations covertly taped by
the FBI with help from Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers has already testified, with immunity, that he brought
money from Kushner and other promoters to Lee, which was generally
split between them, Lee's son, and longtime IBF championship
committee chairman Bill Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner disclosed Wednesday that he sought, but was not granted
immunity from possible prosecution by the U.S. Attorney's Office
for New Jersey. Prosecutors declined to say why the request was not
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner is the fourth big-time promoter to testify against Lee.
All have said payoffs were required to do business with the East
Orange, N.J.-based IBF. As one of three major sanctioning bodies
for boxing in the world, its rankings and decisions play a large
role in the purses earned by boxers, of which managers and
promoters get a cut.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and other IBF officials are accused of taking $338,000 in a
span of more than a decade in exchange for favors and rigged
rankings, but the bulk of that money stems from the machinations
regarding Foreman and Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the Foreman-Schulz fight, Lee's need for payoffs
was routine, said Kushner, 51, who gained fame in the 1970s as a
promoter of rock 'n' roll concerts before turning to boxing in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   Three to four times a year, from 1987-1994, Beavers, a longtime
Virginia boxing commissioner, would drive from his home in
Portsmouth, Va., to Kushner's home in East Hampton, N.Y., and get
cash ranging from $2,500 to $10,000, Kushner said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the rematch demand, all but one of the payments to Lee
were ''preventive medicine:'' efforts to ensure good treatment for
his boxers, not for any specific action, Kushner said.
</P>
<P>
   After discussing the $100,000 with his co-promoter, German-born
Swiss businessman Wilfrid Sauerland, Kushner said they reluctantly
agreed in late May 1995 at the IBF annual convention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF mandated the rematch on June 6, but Kushner said he was
upset because it ranked Schulz No. 2 in the heavyweight division,
making the top contender Frans Botha of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I understood, because it was (Don) King's fighter,''
Kushner said. He and prosecutors maintain that King was the prime
beneficiary of Lee's manipulations. King, who prosecutors call an
unindicted coconspirator, has not been charged and denies ever
making a payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Sauerland testified earlier this month that he flew back to
Switzerland, withdrew $100,000 in cash from a business account, and
gave the money to Kushner in Las Vegas before a boxing show on June
17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Beavers drove to Kushner's home and got the money,
which Kushner said he confirmed was shared with Lee: ''He
acknowledged that he knew I had met with Beavers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the rematch never happened. Foreman relinquished the
IBF belt, with many saying he did not want to risk defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner and Sauerland did not try to get their money back, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think in the kind of business there were refunds,''
Kushner said.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz did get a title shot, but lost to Michael Moorer in June
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman promoter Bob Arum, of Top Rank Inc. in Las Vegas,
testified early this month that he used a middleman to get $100,000
to the IBF to sanction the initial Foreman-Schulz title fight. An
exception was needed because Schulz was unranked.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 66, of Fanwood, N.J., and his son, Robert Jr., 38, of
Scotch Plains, N.J., are the only defendants on trial. They face
multiyear prison terms if convicted of conspiracy, racketeering,
fraud and tax charges.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Brennan, 86, of Warsaw, Va., past president of the U.S.
Boxing Association, a group that became the IBF, was severed from
the trial because of ill health.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF's South American representative, Francisco ''Pacho''
Fernandez of Colombia, remains at large.

<HEADLINE> Divorced Parents To Swap Child  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A divorced couple will rotate custody of their son
under an Appeals Court decision that eliminates what the father's
attorney called the notion of a main parent and a visiting one.
</P>
<P>
   Under the unusual arrangement, Ippolita Freedman will have son
Alex, 7, during the school week for one year, and Roger Freedman
will have him on weekends. The next year, they'll switch. The
rotation will continue as the boy grows up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hope is that this ruling does show a trend toward really
focusing on the needs of the children,'' said attorney Elizabeth
Lewis, who represented Roger Freedman. ''Every child has a right to
equal access to the parent, unless there is something wrong with
the parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parents had asked for sole custody. The state Probate and
Family Court crafted the rotating custody plan, and the mother
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Rudolph Kass, writing for the appeals court, upheld the
lower court ruling Tuesday but acknowledged potential problems if
one parent moves.
</P>
<P>
   James DeGiacomo, the mother's attorney, said his cient is
concerned that the decision will limit her career.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't in the best interest of the child,'' DeGiacomo told
the Globe. ''When a parent is unsettled, that has to have an
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGiacomo did not immediately return a phone call Wednesday
about whether the mother will appeal the new ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Freedman, 49, lives in Wellesley. Ippolita Freedman, 30,
lives in Brookline, a few miles away. The boy will attend the same
school regardless of where he is living.
</P>
<P>
   Fatherhood Coalition attorney David Grossack applauded the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears as though the appeals court is trying to develop
some sensitivity to the needs of the father, and the need for a
father,'' he told the Globe.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers' Shaw Put on DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw was
placed on the disabled list Wednesday for the first time in his
career because of tendinitis in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The move is retroactive to June 27. Replacing Shaw on the roster
is right-hander Jamie Arnold, who was recalled from Triple-A
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fourteen years I've been playing this game and I've never been
on the DL. Never. Not even close,'' Shaw said. ''I wrestled with
this for three or four days. When I came here yesterday, it was
like, 'All right, let's just get it done, do it, get it over
with.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw felt tightness in his elbow on Saturday morning, after
allowing four hits in 1 1-3 innings at St. Louis the night before.
He pitched once after that, allowing a run in the ninth inning
Monday night against San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who had 124 saves over the previous four seasons, has 12
in 19 opportunities and an 8.00 ERA in 29 outings overall this
year.
</P>
<P>
   He was given 1&AMP;frac12; weeks of rest earlier this season by manager
Davey Johnson because of what Shaw described as a knot behind his
shoulder. He was eased back into the closer role after that
episode, and anticipates the same thing will happen when he is
eligible to come off the DL after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd say it would depend on the situation,'' Shaw said.
''Davey's been talking about matchups, so it's going to be a thing
where if I go out and convert a couple, it's going to be right back
to where we were before.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold is 4-6 with a 5.06 ERA in 15 games (13 starts) with
Albuquerque. He pitched in 36 games for the Dodgers last season,
going 2-4 with a 5.48 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Scandals Won't Hurt Gore  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rushing to Al Gore's defense, President
Clinton brushed off his tumbling poll numbers, a possible campaign
finance investigation and the stigma of ''bogus'' scandals to say
Wednesday, ''It's still more likely than not that he will win''
over George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton combined his measured assessment of Gore's prospects
with lavish praise of his vice president. ''Nobody has ever done as
much for America as vice president as Al Gore has,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than five months before the election, presidential politics
took center stage at Clinton's hour-long news conference in the
East Room, his third this year.
</P>
<P>
   The president refused to express an opinion about whether Bush,
the likely Republican presidential nominee, is smart enough to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a dead bang loser,'' Clinton said with a laugh as he
evaded the question and said the most important qualities are
curiosity and a willingness to learn. He did not judge Bush on
either point, but said Gore has spent 20 years working on arms
control issues.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore trails Bush in public opinion polls, Clinton said
he thinks Americans ''are still trying to figure out what they
think about this race.'' He complained that ''the word 'scandal'
has been thrown around here like a clanging teapot for seven
years'' and said there is no evidence Gore has been harmed by
anything that Clinton did.
</P>
<P>
   Gore trails Bush by 12 or 13 percentage points in a couple of
recent polls, while others still show the race close.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he appreciated the comments. ''I haven't read the full
transcript, but everybody that mentioned it to me said that he had
some really good things to say and I appreciate it,'' the vice
president said aboard his campaign plane.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton misspoke by saying that Attorney General Janet Reno had
decided not to appoint a special counsel to investigate whether
Gore told the truth about a 1996 Buddhist temple fund-raiser.
Reno's decision is still pending; twice before she has declined to
appoint a special counsel in Gore's case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see any reason that the attorney general shouldn't
make a decision in this case as she has in every other one,''
Clinton said. Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton
meant that Reno should make her decision based on the facts and the
law rather than political pressure, and was not suggesting that
Reno should again decline to launch an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the best thing is for the American people to make
their own decision,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was a ''lot of volatility in these polls. ... It's
still more likely than not that he (Gore) will win.''
</P>
<P>
   On other questions, Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   --That ''inherently there's nothing wrong'' with suspending all
or part of the federal gasoline tax to ease prices, but that
Congress would then have to deal with the impact of lost revenues
on highway construction projects and ensure that the lower gas
costs were passed on to motorists.
</P>
<P>
   --The ''only real answer'' to rising gasoline prices is to
develop alternative energy sources and more efficient ways of using
existing energy supplies. ''We can do it in a hurry if we just put
our minds to it.''
</P>
<P>
   --He would be inclined to sign a bill allowing food and drug
sales to Cuba if it does not intrude on the president's foreign
policy powers. But he said he would not support immediate easing of
broader trade sanctions against Fidel Castro's regime.
</P>
<P>
   --He had some regret over the seven-month ordeal of Elian
Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy who became the center of a
political firestorm in a child custody case. ''Do I wish it had
unfolded in less dramatic, less traumatic ways for all concerned?''
Clinton said. ''Of course I do.''
</P>
<P>
   --DNA evidence should be used as much as possible to ensure only
the guilty are sentenced to death. ''I think that those of us who
support the death penalty have an extra heavy responsibility to
assure both that the result if accurate and that the process was
fair and constitutional,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   --The possible threat of a missile attack from North Korea has
not receded because of the recent summit between North and South
Korea. ''Would I like it (the threat) to go away? Of course I
would. Do I think it's gone away because of this meeting? I don't.
Do I think it might? It might, and I hope it will, but we don't
know that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   --He's ''generally against discrimination against gays,'' but he
refused to criticize the Supreme Court's decision that the Boy
Scouts can bar homosexuals from serving as troop leaders. ''The Boy
Scouts still are -- they're a great group, they do a lot of good.''
</P>
<P>
   --All paramilitary groups with secret arms caches in Northern
Ireland should follow the lead of the Irish Republican Army and
allow inspections. ''I think this is a great deal ... a very
hopeful development.''

There are 185
days left in the year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's Highlight in History:
</P>
<P>
   On June 29, 1970, the United States ended a two-month military
offensive into Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   On this date:
</P>
<P>
   In 1767, the British Parliament approved the Townshend Revenue
Acts, which imposed import duties on certain goods shipped to
America. Colonists bitterly protested the Acts, which were repealed
in 1770.
</P>
<P>
   In 1776, the Virginia state constitution was adopted, and
Patrick Henry made governor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, Polish statesman, pianist and composer Ignace Jan
Paderewski died in New York at age 80.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, British authorities arrested more than 2,700 Jews in
Palestine in an attempt to stamp out alleged terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, the government of South Africa enacted a ban against
racially-mixed marriages.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, the Atomic Energy Commission voted against re-instating
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer's access to classified information.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, the United States bombed fuel storage facilities near
the North Vietnamese cities of Hanoi and Haiphong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Jerusalem was reunified as Israel removed barricades
separating the Old City from the Israeli sector.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty, as it

Elian Gonzalez Arrives in Cuba
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Seven months after he was cast adrift in the Florida straits,
Elian Gonzalez returned to his native Cuba tonight, bringing to a close an
international custody battle laced with Cold War passions. Cuba's state
television broadcast live images of the two small jets carrying Elian, his
father, stepmother and baby half brother, along with other Cubans as they landed
in Havana after the three-hour journey from Washington. Elian's return ended the
seven-month national campaign to bring the boy home from the United States,
where his Miami relatives had fought to keep him.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- IBM announced today it has built the most powerful
supercomputer in the world, able to perform 12.3 trillion operations per second,
three times faster than the next-fastest computer. An earlier version proved
capable of defeating the world's greatest chess player in a 1997 tournament. The
latest machine is intended to continue the advance toward matching and
eventually surpassing the computing capacity of the human brain. The computer,
called Advanced Strategic Computing Initiative White, or ASCI White, covers
9,920 square feet of floor space, equal to two NBA basketball courts, and weighs

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today limited states' power to ban
so-called ''partial-birth'' abortions, a 5-4 ruling that escalated the bitter,
decades-old debate over women's right to end their pregnancies. Closing out its
1999-2000 term with some of the most divisive rulings in years, the court struck
down Nebraska's partial-birth abortion law as an ''undue burden'' on women's
rights. The court also ruled that the Boy Scouts can bar homosexuals from
serving as troop leaders. The decision may also let the 6.2-million member
organization reject gay boys as members.

<HEADLINE> Texas Archbishop Taken Hostage  </HEADLINE>
By KELLEY SHANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Archbishop Patrick Flores decided to enter
the priesthood while working in a beer-soaked Texas dance hall as a
teen-ager -- mopping up beer and cigarette butts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just thinking -- not having visions or anything like that
-- but I said 'I should not go to work for smoke and stench,'''
Flores told The Associated Press in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He rose to become the nation's first Mexican-American Catholic
bishop.
</P>
<P>
   While he was held hostage Wednesday by a man said to be
distraught over a passport problem, Flores' colleagues, friends and
parishioners prayed for the man known to many as simply ''Patrick''
or ''Patricio.''
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming archbishop in August 1979, Flores, 70, has gained
a reputation as an advocate for immigrants and the poor and for
determinedly opposing violence.
</P>
<P>
   His bilingualism and humble background have made for close ties
between Flores and the 1 million Roman Catholics in his largely
Hispanic archdiocese, which covers 23 counties and stretches to the
Texas-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   His bilingual Sunday Mass at San Fernando Cathedral is televised
throughout the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Flores was born in Ganado, about 70 miles southwest of Houston,
the seventh of nine children in a migrant farm worker family.
</P>
<P>
   He became a priest in 1956. After working for years as a priest
in Houston, he was named auxiliary bishop in San Antonio in 1970,
the nation's first Mexican-American to reach that level. He was a
bishop in El Paso before becoming archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Flores welcomed Pope John Paul II as his houseguest
during the pontiff's visit to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Flores is no stranger to controversy, whether stirred by his
protests against abortion or modern art he deems sacrilegious. He
has weathered allegations of sexual misconduct against priests in
his district and opposition to archdiocese plans to renovate aging
churches.
</P>
<P>
   He unveiled ''no guns'' signs in early 1996 -- as the state's
concealed handgun law went into effect -- warning in English and
Spanish that weapons were not permitted on church property.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that the good that guns may seem to do is only
temporary,'' Flores said, ''but the harm they do is permanent.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Loiselle Put on DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates put reliever Rich
Loiselle on the disabled list Wednesday with bursitis in his right
shoulder and recalled left-hander Jimmy Anderson from Triple-A
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Loiselle (0-3, 7.31 ERA in 12 games) rejoined the Pirates
several weeks ago after missing most of the 1999 season for
reconstructive elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson began the season in the rotation, but was demoted to
Nashville on June 15 after going 1-5 with a 5.93 ERA in 11 starts,
allowing 67 hits and walking 23 in 54 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In two starts at Nashville, Anderson was 0-0 with a 4.15 ERA,
yielding 18 hits and striking out seven in 13 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson will not immediately return to the rotation. Rookie
right-hander Bronson Arroyo (0-1, 10.66 ERA), who took Anderson's
spot in the rotation, is scheduled to make his fourth major league
start Saturday in Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor: Evidence To Try Skakel  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- After three days of hearings, the
decision on whether a Kennedy relative should stand trial as an
adult in the 1975 beating death of a teen-age neighbor was in the
hands of a judge.
</P>
<P>
   State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict said in closing arguments
Wednesday that Michael Skakel's purported confessions in the late
1970s to two former classmates at a substance-abuse rehabilitation
center were reason enough to make him stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, accused those witnesses of
lying on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding Judge Maureen Dennis said she would issue a ruling,
though she did not indicate when. She said she would take as much
time as she needed to review the law and the transcript of the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings, which began last week and ended Wednesday
afternoon, were held to see if there was enough evidence to proceed
with the case against Skakel. And if so, whether he should be tried
as a juvenile or an adult in the 1975 beating death of Martha
Moxley, 15.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, now 39, was also 15 at the time of the killing. He is
the son of Rushton Skakel Sr., a brother of Ethel Kennedy, the
widow of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing arguments, Benedict cited the testimony of a
childhood friend of Skakel's who testified that more than 15 years
after the murder, Skakel admitted being in the same spot where
15-year-old Moxley was killed -- and at the time she was slain. He
said that effectively placed Skakel at the scene at the time of the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict said Skakel should be tried as an adult because ''no
Connecticut juvenile institution has the ability to deal in any way
with a 39- or 40-year-old man.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, the defense lawyer, said the state's case was built on
testimony that amounted to lies. He said Skakel's clean criminal
record served as ''a crystal ball'' that showed he is an upstanding
citizen incapable of a murder.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman called to the witness stand a former student at the Elan
School, a residential drug and alcohol treatment center in Maine
which Skakel attended as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two former students at the school testified that
Skakel had confessed to them that he killed Moxley, who was
bludgeoned with a golf club. The 6-iron used in the murder was
traced to a set owned by the Skakels.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, former student Alice Dunn said she never heard
Skakel admit to killing Moxley, even while undergoing therapy that
involved being pummeled in a boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   ''He denied vehemently, over and over again, 'No, no, no, no!'''
Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel was subjected to the treatment after he ran away from
Elan, Dunn testified. The ring was used to break down students'
resistance and force them to confront the root cause of their
emotional problems, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, members of Skakel's extended family --
including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. -- turned out to support Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a horrible, unspeakable tragedy, but it only compounds
it to blame Michael Skakel, who is innocent,'' Kennedy said.

<HEADLINE> Drug, green card sting nets 159 arrests in six states  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A yearlong investigation into a heroin and
cocaine ring that traded green cards for cash and drugs, resulted
in the arrest Wednesday of 105 people in six states, federal and
state agents said.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ''Operation Wildcard,'' the sting put federal and state
agents inside a drug ring that operated in New York, New Jersey,
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia and Massachusetts. It started in
April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   One posed as a corrupt Immigration and Naturalization Services
agent offering to create documents like a resident alien card,
known as ''green cards,'' for a fee, paid in large amounts of
heroin, cocaine or cash worth anywhere from $5,000 to $13,000, a
press release from several agencies said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other agents portrayed drug traffickers with connections to
the corrupt INS worker. The drug dealers wanted the documentation
so they and their workers could travel freely between the United
States and their home countries, the agencies said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations resulted in payments and seizures totaling
nearly $400,000 in cash, 10.25 kilograms of heroin, 11 kilograms of
cocaine and three vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Police are still searching for 54 people named in federal
indictments on a raft of charges including conspiracy to distribute
cocaine and heroin, distribution of cocaine and heroin, conspiracy
to bribe a public official, establishing a criminal enterprise for
the purpose of evading provisions of the immigration law,
transportation of illegal aliens, and re-entry after deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Upon conviction of the crimes, depending the amount of drugs
involved, the penalties cover a wide range from a minimum of five
years to a maximum of life in prison. Convictions also can carry a
fine ranging from $250,000 to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of those indicted, 107 were from New York, 28 from New Jersey,
eight from Connecticut, six from Florida and five each from Georgia
and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Operation Wildcard'' was a reprise of a 1991-93 operation
called ''Operation Cali-Cardgame,'' which led to the prosecution of
150 people and the seizure of 26 kilograms of cocaine, eight
kilograms of crack cocaine, two kilograms of heroin, 12 vehicles
and $1.2 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The multi-agency Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force was
comprised of the Unites States Attorney's Office, New York State
Police, INS, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau
of Investigation, U.S. Marshals and U.S. Customs Service.

<HEADLINE> Young Girl's Body Found in Concrete  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Coroner's investigators broke open a concrete
slab Wednesday and found the entombed body of a little girl
believed to be the missing 3-year-old daughter of a couple arrested
for her killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''A female child was encased in concrete. There's decomposition
so identity can't immediately be confirmed,'' coroner's office
spokesman Scott Carrier said.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Foster and his girlfriend, Rakiesha Scott, both 22, were
arrested Tuesday and booked for investigation of murder, Deputy
David Cervantes said. They were held without bail.
</P>
<P>
   The county Sheriff's Department did not identify the girl.
</P>
<P>
   ''The information we have was that about four or five months ago
a body was placed in the trunk in a box and that box was
subsequently filled with cement,'' Lt. Ray Peavey said.
</P>
<P>
   The abandoned car holding the concrete-filled box had been
covered up and parked for months behind the Athens Park home of
Foster's father.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies were tipped about the concrete tomb Tuesday afternoon
by the child's grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ''My main thing is that there was a little girl out there who
deserves to be buried, not to be embedded in a piece of concrete,''
said Bill Foster, father of the man in custody.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Foster said his son told him Saturday that the
couple's daughter died several months ago after an accident in the
bathroom. There were no other details about the death.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Arlen Specter sent a second letter to Al
Gore on Wednesday demanding an apology for a comment by Gore's
campaign spokesman likening the Pennsylvania senator to former Sen.
Joe McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since you have not responded to my (first) letter and your
surrogates are repeating their outlandish, defamatory statements,
if your campaign intends to continue your character assassination
of me, I think you ought to be man enough to say it yourself,''
Specter wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Specter disclosed last week that the head of the Justice
Department's campaign finance task force, Robert Conrad, was
recommending a special counsel be appointed to investigate Gore for
possible false statements in connection with fund raising for the
1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gore spokesman Chris Lehane described the disclosure
as a ''McCarthyite tactic,'' a reference to the Wisconsin lawmaker
who led a bitter campaign in the 1950s to expose public figures
suspected of having communist sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters Wednesday that he stood by Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll let Chris Lehane speak for himself,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Patty Hearst Violated Order  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge denounced Patty Hearst's defiance of
a gag order Wednesday and said he may have to abandon his effort to
restrict statements by all parties in the case of former Symbionese
Liberation Army fugitive Sara Jane Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge James Ideman said he believes that Hearst,
who spoke about Olson in a recent interview with Talk magazine,
''deliberately defied the order in a way to give maximum publicity
to the violation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judge said he was powerless to punish Hearst or prevent
further statements because she lives out of state and he does not
have authority over her.
</P>
<P>
   Olson is accused of conspiring to murder Los Angeles police
officers by putting pipe bombs under squad cars in 1975. The bombs
did not explode. Olson allegedly was trying to avenge the deaths of
six SLA members killed in a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst was kidnapped by the SLA, then joined the group and
helped rob a bank. She has sought to distance herself from her SLA
past since spending two years in prison and has sought to avoid
testifying in the Olson trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, who lives in Connecticut, said in the interview that she
was defying the gag order because she's ''fed up,'' and that the
case will put her on trial, bring up bad memories and invade her
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The judge stopped short of suspending the gag order immediately,
saying he will issue a written ruling in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evil which I sought to prevent was publicity that would
violate the rights of all parties to an impartial jury,'' he said.
''But worse is that one side can talk and the other side can't. ...
I don't see anything but to unleash the other side, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson, formerly known as Kathleen Ann Soliah, was indicted in
1976 but remained a fugitive until her arrest last year in St.
Paul, Minn. Her trial is scheduled for Jan. 8.

<HEADLINE> Elian Gonzalez Arrives in Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Seven months after he was cast adrift in the
Florida straits, Elian Gonzalez returned to his native Cuba
Wednesday evening, bringing to a close an international custody
battle laced with Cold War passions.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, lifted the 6-year-old boy
down the plane's staircase to the tarmac where they were embraced
by Elian's tearful grandmothers and other relatives at the small
airport in the Cuban capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian! Elian! Elian!'' chanted about 800 children from the
first-grader's elementary school, waving small red, white and blue
Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's return ended the seven-month national campaign to bring
the boy home from the United States, where his Miami relatives had
fought to keep him. But Fidel Castro's government vowed that the
homecoming would not end its massive mobilizations, which will now
be aimed at changing U.S. policies that it says encourage the kind
of illegal migration that led to Elian's plight.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, who has said Cuba would not hold boastful celebrations
of Elian's return, did not attend the homecoming ceremony for the
boy, his father, stepmother and baby half brother, who arrived in
two planes along with other Cubans after a three-hour journey from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A military band struck up Cuba's national anthem and the
schoolchildren began singing along. The family drove off in a small
procession of cars to an undisclosed location, where they will
spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   Elian shyly waved at the Cuban television cameras recording the
event, broadcast live across the island on state-run television.
</P>
<P>
   The highest ranking Cuban official on hand was Ricardo Alarcon,
president of Cuba's National Assembly and the man who served as
adviser to Elian's father in his fight to bring his son with him
back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was free to return home after the U.S. Supreme Court
declined to intervene in the international custody dispute between
the child's father and his relatives in Miami, who took him in
after he was rescued from sea and wanted to keep him in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Before boarding the plane at Washington Dulles International
Airport, Elian's father told reporters through a translator, ''I am
extremely happy ... being able to go back to my homeland. I don't
have words, really, to express what I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   He grabbed his little boy's hand and led him up the steps of the
chartered jet, where Elian said goodbye to America with a wave and
a shy smile.
</P>
<P>
   ''The legal battle is over,'' the father's attorney, Gregory
Craig, said, after the Supreme Court issued its simple 26-word
order rejecting an appeal by the boy's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's family was huddled around a television set when they
heard the news they were going home. ''They were elated, absolutely
elated,'' said Christina Fitz, spokeswoman for Youth for
Understanding International Exchange -- a student exchange group
that hosted the Gonzalez family during its last month in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In a farewell message to the exchange group, Elian's father
wrote: ''I am leaving you with two Cuban flags -- one big one and
one little one as a token and the first step in the direction of a
human and beautiful relationship between our two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   At a White House news conference earlier in the day, President
Clinton was asked whether he had second thoughts about returning
Elian to communist Cuba. ''Well, if he and his father decided they
wanted to stay here, it would be fine with me,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do I wish it had unfolded in a less dramatic, less traumatic
way for all concerned?'' he asked rhetorically, ''Of course I do,''
</P>
<P>
   His sentiment was not shared in south Florida. Cuban-Americans,
fervently anti-communist, wept, screamed and jeered the Supreme
Court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Elian's plane take off on television, their sobs and
sniffles gave way to keening wails and angry shouts of disbelief.
Some jeered the U.S. government, some called for God's help and
others collapsed with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not going back, he's not going back,'' Anais Acuna said,
praying with a rosary in her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Estrella Martinez wept, ''Oh my God, my God we love him.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez and cousin Marisleysis
Gonzalez, who took Elian into their home for five months, had no
immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   But a parade of attorneys and activists, speaking for the Miami
family, lamented Elian's return to the same place that his mother
and so many others risked their lives to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Family spokesman Armando Gutierrez cited human rights abuses in
Cuba and asked, ''How many more women and children must die before
the world hears the cries of the Cuban people?
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian's mother brought him to this great country seeking the
promises of our Statue of Liberty,'' he said. ''She and her son
were among the huddled masses yearning ... to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's order ends Elian's life in limbo, said
Attorney General Janet Reno, head of the Justice Department, which
through June 11 had spent $1.8 million on the case. ''All involved
have had an opportunity to make their case -- all the way to the
highest court in the land,'' she said. ''I hope that everyone will
... join me in wishing this family, and this special little boy,
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Elian drama began on Nov. 22 when Elian, his mother and a
dozen others left Cuba in a 16-foot motor boat bound for America.
The boat sank off the Florida coast, and his mother and 10 others
drowned. Elian bobbed on an inner tube in the Atlantic Ocean for
two or three days before he was rescued on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez was granted temporary custody of the boy.
Elian's father demanded his son's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A tug-of-war ensued.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, Elian was an overnight folk hero, a pint-sized symbol
of Cuban pride and allegiance to Fidel Castro, the self-described
''daddy of all Cubans.'' Castro orchestrated protests, one of them
drawing 2 million chanting demonstrators, the largest in Castro's
41-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   In America, the Miami relatives turned him into a symbol of
Cuban-Americans' long struggle against Castro's hard-line
government.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, both Castro's communist regime and the U.S.
government, arch enemies during the Cold War, were on the same side
of the Gonzalez drama. Both wanted Elian to live in Cuba with his
father. And the case helped nudge the House on Tuesday to cut a
deal to ease the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba for the first
time in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Albeit weary of media coverage of his plight, Americans embraced
Elian, who celebrated his sixth birthday in America and learned to
ride a two-wheeler. They watched him wave a miniature Star-Spangled
Banner for television cameras and visit Disneyworld.
</P>
<P>
   Americans watched, too, as he wagged a finger and exclaimed, in
a videotaped message to his father: ''I do not want to go to
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The photo of a frightened little boy being grabbed by a Border
Patrol agent holding an MP-5 submachine gun will be forever etched
in America's conscience. Street riots followed the pre-dawn raid at
the Miami relatives' home in Little Havana. Protesters chanted:
''Clinton, coward, Miami is on fire!''
</P>
<P>
   But the pictures of seething demonstrators were quickly replaced
by snapshots of an emotional father-son reunion that began with a
bear hug in the aisle of an airplane that whisked Elian from
Florida to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Side-by-side, their resemblance was unmistakable. Father and
son's eyebrows arch over the same deep-brown eyes; their smiles
nearly identical.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal, though, was not yet over.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled
for Elian's father, yet ordered the boy to remain in the United
States pending appeal. The Miami relatives appealed to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   When the high court declined to hear the case, Elian was free at
last.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many Cuban-Americans, though, Elian's real
freedom ends when he steps back onto Cuban soil and begins to wave
another red-white-and-blue flag -- the one representing Castro's
Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Panel Works On Kosovo, Colombia Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top lawmakers edged Wednesday toward
completing an emergency package financing Colombia's war against
drug producers, U.S. troops in Kosovo and rebuilding from fires,
storms and other disasters at home.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations committees met
throughout the day, and were said to be close to brokering a
compromise on a bill that President Clinton has wanted passed since
the beginning of the year. Top Republicans hope to push the measure
through Congress and send it to Clinton by Friday, when lawmakers
plan to begin their weeklong Fourth of July recess.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
said the bill would probably total about $11 billion -- more than
double the $5.2 billion Clinton initially proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the daylong, closed-door wrangling over the measure's final
shape, lawmakers scrambled to carve out money for their own
districts. Participants said that as part of the final package, the
House and Senate would each get a $100 million kitty -- perhaps a
bit more -- for various lawmakers' projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'd be surprised how many emergencies you can discover,''
Stevens joked to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Final details remained obscure. But participants speaking on
condition of anonymity said the package was likely to include about
$30 million for a convention center in the Youngstown, Ohio,
district of maverick Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   They said GOP lawmakers had apportioned the money to Traficant,
who during the day spoke out against fellow Democrats for walking
out of the House chamber during debate over prescription drug
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was also said to include $468 million for the Coast
Guard to purchase six C-130 transport planes.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young,
R-Fla., said the measure would include $1.3 billion to help
Colombia's embattled government fight drug traffickers who control
broad swaths of the country, along with their leftist guerrilla and
right-wing paramilitary allies. Included is money for purchasing
helicopters and other supplies and training Colombian troops.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a victory for Clinton and House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., who have pushed for the aid as a way to combat
drug use in the United States. Colombia supplies most of the
cocaine used in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Though final numbers could shift, participants said the
compromise would also include $2.05 billion to repay the Pentagon
for the costs of 5,700 American troops serving with the NATO
peacekeeping team in Kosovo, plus more than $4 billion more for
other Pentagon programs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there was at least $660 million for rebuilding from
the government-set fires that ravaged Los Alamos, N.M., and $250
million to help North Carolina and other states recover from last
September's Hurricane Floyd and other agricultural problems.
</P>
<P>
   Still unresolved was whether to include compromise language
struck Tuesday that would lift the four-decade-old U.S. food
embargo against Cuba. There is strong opposition to that deal among
some senators, and Young indicated it might be left for inclusion
in some later bill.
</P>
<P>
   Aides and lawmakers had said earlier that to keep the bill
acceptable to Clinton, they would avoid including controversial
provisions changing laws.
</P>
<P>
   They said they would therefore omit a provision pushed by
Schering-Plough Corp. to win an extension of its patent for
Claritin, the popular and profitable allergy drug. Also left off
the bill was language by Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., aimed at
extending a lucrative patent his alma mater, Columbia University,
has on a process its scientists invented for making some widely
sold biotechnology drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those measures could end up on other bills.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved $13 billion in March, mostly by adding extra
money for the Pentagon, while the Senate approved roughly $9
billion last month.

<HEADLINE> Davidians Testify About Conditions  </HEADLINE>
By SHERRI CHUNN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- Branch Davidians believed sect leader David
Koresh was a manifestation of ''God, made flesh,'' and if God asked
someone do to something, it would not be considered a sin, a
survivor of the 1993 siege testified Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We gave ourselves, totally, to God,'' sect member Clive Doyle
testified. ''We believe that God was speaking through him.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, a plaintiff in the $675 million wrongful death lawsuit
against the government, was the first witness called by former
Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who represents Doyle and several
other survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Some 80 members died April 19, 1993, as the 51-day standoff with
the government came to a fatal end.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said he could feel skin ''rolling off his hands'' as he
jumped out of the burning building through a hole made by
government tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, government attorney Jim Touhey
presented Doyle with the melted remains of a blue nylon and a
camouflage jacket, which had the name Clive written on it.
</P>
<P>
   Touhey said the sleeves of the blue jacket were covered with
ignitable liquids.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could have come from constantly filling lanterns ... I
don't know,'' said Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   He testified earlier that he had regularly helped refill
lanterns for women and children in the complex, but denied pouring
fuel inside the building or lighting a fire.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said sect members started the fire in the
compound.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Doyle told jurors that conditions in the complex became
increasingly difficult during the standoff. ''It was pretty rough.
We were not able to get to the toilet facilities, which were
outside at the time,'' he said. ''At one point in the siege the
electricity was cut off.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began after agents with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms tried to serve search and arrest warrants on
sect leader David Koresh on Feb. 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Four ATF agents and six Davidians died in an ensuing gun battle.
Doyle later was acquitted of murdering the four agents.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend government agents fired indiscriminately
during the raid; violated a preapproved plan when they had tanks
punch holes in the building to spray tear gas; contributed to or
caused at least some of the three fires that engulfed the compound;
and failed to have firefighting equipment at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers say ATF agents were ambushed during the siege
and were defending their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The jury will act only as an advisory panel to Smith, who will
deliver the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Smith will consider the question of whether federal
agents shot at Davidians during the siege's fiery end.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also asked Doyle a question from jurors about why the
children stayed at the compound during the siege.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were children that didn't want to leave their parents,''
Doyle answered. ''For one thing, we were under the impression from
negotiators we were all coming out. That's what we were waiting on,
I guess.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Archbishop Released  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELE KOIDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A man seeking help on a passport problem and
claiming to have a hand grenade took Archbishop Patrick Flores
hostage in his office for nine hours before releasing him Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic archbishop appeared to be unharmed as he was
escorted out of his office by police and placed on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was led out in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Trevino, a police department spokesman, said police had
been negotiating with the suspect through the day, and said
negotiator could hear Flores in the background while they talked to
the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop's secretary, Myrtle Sanchez, was also held for
about three hours but was freed unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   She said the man had been holding something in his hand that she
believed to be a weapon but she could not identify it, said
Monsignor Larry Stuebben, who spoke to her shortly after she was
released. She described the man as upset but not out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very frustrated by the way he's been treated, and wants
the archbishop to help him,'' Stuebben said Sanchez told him.
</P>
<P>
   The man is believed to be from El Salvador, has been in the
United States about 25 years and has three children. His wife and
one son were at the scene, Stuebben said. It was unknown if the man
was in the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the office about 10 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Yzaguirre, general manager of Catholic Television, a
service run by the archdiocese, said the Spanish-speaking man, in
his 30s, asked for help with a passport problem. He seemed calm and
was respectful to Flores, but the man ''was pretty insistent he
wanted him to help him with this problem,'' Yzaguirre said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could tell the archbishop was kind of caught off guard.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancery is the headquarters for the 23-county San Antonio
archdiocese. Flores, 70, became the first Mexican-American Catholic
bishop in the nation when he was named its auxiliary bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Before Flores' release, as many as 50 law-enforcement officers --
FBI hostage negotiators, SWAT officers and others -- were at the
scene as a crowd of more than 100 gathered outside the Catholic
chancery in 90-degree weather and prayed. About 100 chancery
employees had to be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Archbishop Flores is one of the prominent leaders in this city
who will speak for peace. I don't know of any concerted effort to
do damage to him,'' said Monsignor Terence Nolan, chancellor of the
diocese.
</P>
<P>
   David Garcia, rector of San Fernando Cathedral, said Flores,
though a native Texan, is known as a friend to immigrants. He also
was known to have an open-door policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't think of a person who has more tried to help people
with immigration problems than the archbishop has,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Thompson, executive director of the San Antonio
Community of Churches, said: ''He has taken hostage the man who
probably cares the most and is most willing to listen. One of his
known strengths is his ability to stay quiet and to listen. He is a
humble person and he is willing to sit there and listen to you.''

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A retired Army reserve colonel considered the
highest-ranking military officer ever arrested for espionage
pleaded innocent to the charge Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   George Trofimoff, 73, said nothing during a brief court
appearance. His attorney, Daniel Hernandez, spoke for him.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff is a former civilian chief of the United States Army
Element of the Joint Interrogation Center in Nuremberg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth A. Jenkins set a tentative trial
date for Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Walter Furr said the government
needs additional time to obtain legal assistance from Germany and
Austria to prepare its case.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff was indicted June 14 by a grand jury on a single
espionage charge and arrested the same day.
</P>
<P>
   He is being held in the Hillsborough County Jail without bail.
</P>
<P>
   As civilian chief of the interrogation center from 1969 to 1994,
Trofimoff had access to top-secret information the U.S. obtained
from Soviet defectors. The indictment accuses him of photographing
documents from secured files and passing them on to KGB agents.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Welcome Elian Gonzalez  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cubans obeyed requests not to go overboard in
welcoming home Elian Gonzalez, who received an enthusiastic but
restrained reception -- with Cuban leader Fidel Castro noticeably
absent -- when he returned to his communist homeland on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred schoolchildren from Elian's hometown of Cardenas
cheered and waved small red, white and blue Cuban flags as Elian
appeared at the door of the plane minutes after it landed in
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly, was the
highest ranking Cuban official on hand to greet the 6-year-old, his
family and his schoolmates upon their arrival Wednesday night, the
government said in a statement read on state television.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon has served as a key adviser to Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, during the protracted custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that Castro -- who had launched a
national campaign that included numerous mass demonstrations across
the island to press for the boy's return -- would greet the boy, but
the Cuban leader was nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be no official reception nor will there be a mass
mobilization,'' said the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Another government statement urged citizens ''not to rush out
into the streets.'' Such behavior, it said ''would not be the most
correct and convenient in this chapter of our fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cubans were thrilled that Elian had finally come home.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he took off, we all had goose bumps,'' said airport
worker Gisela Diazo, who watched the live televised takeoff. ''We
are all crazy for Elian!''
</P>
<P>
   Castro has said all along that no major homecoming would be
planned for Elian, who he has characterized as a ''boy hero'' and
''symbolic child.'' The idea has been to cause Elian as little
trauma as possible and speed his return to a normal life in his
native country.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's friends in his hometown of Cardenas, a port city east of
Havana, traveled to the Cuban capital to greet Elian, residents
told journalists. The government statement said a small group of
Elian's first-grade classmates was to meet him at the airport. The
boy would then spend an hour with his classmates, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven buses filled with 200-300 children of varying ages
arrived at the airport Wednesday night about an hour before the boy
was scheduled to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was to stay with his family and classmates for two or
three weeks in Havana at a specially prepared boarding school
before returning to Cardenas, where he was born and raised.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans learned on state television and radio that Elian was
headed home after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal
of the Miami relatives, who were seeking to keep Elian in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now more than ever, our population must behave with the most
dignity, serenity and discipline,'' the statement said. ''Let us
remember that at all times, our fight has just begun and that a
long road before us still remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro has said that even after Elian returns, Cubans must not
take a moment's rest in demanding an end to the four-decade-old
U.S. embargo on the island and American policies that allow Cubans
who reach U.S. soil to remain.
</P>
<P>
   The muted reaction by Cubans appeared to be part of a determined
effort by the government to make Elian's return as low-key as
possible in contrast to what government officials have called the
''circus'' that surrounded much of his life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wait with tranquility the triumph of justice and the end of
the kidnapping,'' ran a headline Wednesday in Granma, the official
daily of Cuba's Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, Castro promised there would be no street
celebrations, no parades when the boy returns -- despite a national
campaign in Cuba that put Elian's face on billboards, placards and
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over Elian began in late November when the child was
rescued off the Florida coast. His mother and 10 other people
drowned when their boat sank en route from Cuba to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was turned over to his Miami relatives, who began fighting
to keep him with them. The boy's father fought to have the child
returned to Cuba.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A former police officer and Baptist
minister was convicted of voluntary manslaughter Wednesday after
being cleared of murder in the death of his lover's husband.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hurth, 44, was accused in the shooting death of car
salesman Ralph Peter Gawor in February. He faces a maximum of 21
years in prison on the lesser charges.
</P>
<P>
   He is to be sentenced Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year officer and former department chaplain had faced a
life sentence if convicted of murder. He is being held without
bail.
</P>
<P>
   There was never any question during two weeks of testimony that
Hurth killed the 43-year-old Gawor, confronting Gawor in the man's
house Feb. 18 and shooting him twice in the chest with his service
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The question for jurors was whether he did it in self-defense --
as he claimed -- or whether it was premeditated -- as prosecutors
contended.
</P>
<P>
   Hurth said he killed Gawor during a struggle about the sexual
affair he had been having with Nancy Gawor.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Hurth plotted the shooting after learning Nancy
Gawor planned to reconcile with her husband of 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hurth was arrested more than a week after the killing and fired
from the force. At the time, the former pastor of the Heritage
Baptist Church admitted the affair, but denied being at the Gawor
house the night of the killing.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Senate Overrides Budget Veto  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SHARP
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Averting a government shutdown, the
Legislature overrode Gov. Don Sundquist's veto and enacted an $18.3
billion budget Wednesday without the state income tax he had
demanded.
</P>
<P>
   The state had risked a full or partial shutdown Saturday because
the state constitution requires a new budget by July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Sundquist, who had demanded creation of an income tax to support
education and health, had vetoed the spending plan on Tuesday. The
House promptly overrode his veto, 78-19. The Senate did the same
Wednesday in a 20-9 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is one of nine states without a broad-based income
tax. The state taxes interest and dividends but not wages.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor had pushed for a change in the tax
structure since last year and called two special sessions, saying a
3.75 percent tax on wages is needed to keep Tennessee from becoming
''a second-rate state.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Legislature used one-time money for recurring
expenses and raised state revenue estimates based on the booming
economy.
</P>
<P>
   All 99 House members and 16 of 33 senators are up for
re-election, and many voters oppose an income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Sundquist said Wednesday that he was disappointed the
Legislative session ended without meaningful tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have missed an opportunity to do what's right for
Tennessee,'' he said. ''We've missed the opportunity to move
Tennessee forward with tax reform, juvenile justice reform, charter
schools legislation and a real commitment to higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   Sundquist has pushed for tax reform since last year and called
two special sessions to address it, and he did not rule out the
possibility of another special session this year, especially if
revenues are lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Jere Hargrove, one of the budget's
sponsors, said: ''We heard our constituents say make responsible
cuts, and we did. We heard people tell us to live within the
available dollars and to the extent we could, we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor has argued that Tennessee is too dependent on sales
taxes, which account for 57 cents of every state tax dollar.
</P>
<P>
   In return for an income tax, Sundquist had proposed exempting
food from the state's 6 percent sales tax, dropping the tax on
interest and dividends, and reducing the overall sales tax to 3.75
percent.

<HEADLINE> Ripken on DL With Back Injury  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken's record streak of 16 straight
All-Star starts appears to be over.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken was put on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday because of
an inflamed lower back, meaning the Baltimore Orioles third baseman
will still be sidelined during the All-Star game July 11 at
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken, who turns 40 in August, was batting .239 with 13 home
runs and 43 RBIs. He had never been on the disabled list until last
season, when he made two trips because of nerve irritation in his
back.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Ripken left for a pinch-runner in the 10th
inning, when the Orioles scored five runs en route to a 6-3 victory
over the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken remained in the trainer's room after the game and did not
comment. He had been healthy this year, playing in 62 of
Baltimore's 74 games and getting his 3,000th career hit.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles manager Mike Hargrove said Ripken appeared to hurt
himself when he swung and missed twice on low pitches by Derek Lowe
during an inning-ending strikeout in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time you run the risk of losing someone like Cal, his
presence, that's a very sobering idea,'' Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken was to fly to Cleveland on Wednesday to be examined by
Dr. Henry Bohlman. Bohlman operated on Ripken last Sept. 23 to
correct an irritated nerve in his back.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken has played in 17 consecutive All-Star games, starting the
last 16. He broke the record of 14 straight starts set by Willie
Mays.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Ripken held a big lead as the AL third baseman in fan
voting to elect starters.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, San Diego outfielder Tony Gwynn was elected to start
for the NL in the All-Star game at Fenway Park while on the
disabled list. He announced he would not play, although he went to
Boston and took part in pregame festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken, whose record streak of playing in 2,632 consecutive
games ended on Sept. 20, 1998, went on the disabled list for the
first time in his career last season.
</P>
<P>
   He missed 22 games from April 20 to May 13, then was disabled
again for 28 games from Aug. 3-31, both times with nerve irritation
in his back.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles recalled third baseman Ryan Minor from Triple-A
Rochester to replace Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Minor was batting .257 with 12 home runs and 38 RBI in 91 games
for Rochester. He appeared in four games with the Orioles in May,
batting .182 (2-11).

<HEADLINE> Campaign Disclosure Bill Considered  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Overcoming Republican opposition, legislation
requiring secretive groups to disclose their donors was moving
toward approval in the Senate, which is now poised to send
President Clinton the first piece of campaign finance legislation
since he took office.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've finally made a crack in the wall that everyone said we
couldn't crack,'' said Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis. ''We have
forced members of Congress to face what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, approved by an overwhelming vote in the House,
would require tax-exempt groups that register under the newly
popular section 527 of the tax code to say who is paying for their
political activities, including TV ads and other attempts to
influence elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate opened debate Wednesday night, with a vote planned on
the measure Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 has been in the tax code since 1975, but only
recently has it become the vehicle of choice for donors who want to
remain secret.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance experts call it a massive loophole that is
undermining one of the pillars of Watergate reforms -- disclosure of
donors. Opponents say it encourages more people to participate in
the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation has already passed the Senate once, as an
amendment to the defense spending bill. The agreement reached
Wednesday would remove the language from the spending bill and
allow for a short debate, followed by an up-or-down vote on the
House bill.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is ready to sign it, eager to shine light on
what he called ''those mysterious interest groups whose financial
backers are cloaked in secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate GOP leaders have fought the measure, but they lost one
vote already, 57-42, and the momentum grew with the strong House
vote early Wednesday morning. House GOP leaders initially fought
the legislation but in the end, most of them voted for it and the
bill passed 385-39.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great victory that will give us substantial momentum
for broader campaign finance reform,'' Feingold said.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold said that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott pushed for
an agreement that bar Feingold and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., from
pushing other campaign finance legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We rejected out of hand,'' Feingold said. ''This is about
momentum to do more if possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would require disclosure of groups that organize
under section 527 of the tax code, which allows tax-exempt groups
to engage in unlimited political activity, including campaign-style
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   It was designed for political parties and political action
committees, who already report their activities to the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But section 527 has become popular with groups across the
political spectrum who disclose their spending and donors to no
one. They avoid the FEC by steering clear of words like ''elect''
and ''vote for,'' claiming that they are engaged in issues not
electioneering.
</P>
<P>
   The bill covers any 527 group that raises at least $25,000 a
year. It requires those that do not already report to the Federal
Election Commission to report to the Internal Revenue Service,
which will make the reports public. They would have to report
contributions of $200 or more and spending of $500 or more.
</P>
<P>
   And within 24 hours of organizing, they must notify the IRS of
their existence.
</P>
<P>
   Using a 527, a pair of Texas brothers ran $2.5 million in ads
praising Texas Gov. George W. Bush and attacking McCain in the days
before a crucial GOP primary election. Another 527 with ties to
House Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, is working to raise $25 million to
help a variety of Republicans running for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the oldest 527s is the Sierra Club, which is running
an $8 million campaign boosting Democrats running for Congress and
attacking Bush's record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the disclosure measure note that every day of
delay allows groups to collect more secret cash. Even if a bill
does become law, groups will not have to disclose the names of
anyone who donates money before the legislation is signed.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4762.

Elian Gonzalez Arrives in Cuba
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- About 800 children from Elian Gonzalez' elementary school
cheered as the 6-year-old boy returned to his native Cuba this evening, bringing
to a close an international custody battle laced with Cold War passions. Elian
and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, stepped off the plane from the United
States and were immediately embraced by the boy's grandmothers and other
relatives on the tarmac at a small airport in the Cuban capital. Elian's return
ended the seven-month national campaign to bring the boy home from the United
States, where his Miami relatives had fought to keep him.

nine hours before releasing him tonight. The Roman Catholic archbishop appeared
to be unharmed as he was escorted out of his office by police and placed on a
stretcher. The suspect was led out in handcuffs. Gabriel Trevino, a police
department spokesman, said police had been negotiating with the suspect through
the day, and said negotiator could hear Flores in the background while they
talked to the suspect. The archbishop's secretary, Myrtle Sanchez, was also held
for about three hours but was freed unharmed.

IBM Announces New Supercomputer

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- IBM announced today it has built the most powerful
supercomputer in the world, able to perform 12.3 trillion operations per second,
three times faster than the next-fastest computer. An earlier version proved
capable of defeating the world's greatest chess player in a 1997 tournament. The
latest machine is intended to continue the advance toward matching and
eventually surpassing the computing capacity of the human brain. The computer,
called Advanced Strategic Computing Initiative White, or ASCI White, covers
9,920 square feet of floor space, equal to two NBA basketball courts, and weighs

Court Upholds 'Partial-Birth' Abortion

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today limited states' power to ban
so-called ''partial-birth'' abortions, a 5-4 ruling that escalated the bitter,
decades-old debate over women's right to end their pregnancies. Closing out its
1999-2000 term with some of the most divisive rulings in years, the court struck
down Nebraska's partial-birth abortion law as an ''undue burden'' on women's
rights. The court also ruled that the Boy Scouts can bar homosexuals from
serving as troop leaders. The decision may also let the 6.2-million member
organization reject gay boys as members.

<HEADLINE> Begay Tries To Keep Ball Rolling  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. (AP) -- Notah Begay was on Cloud Nine last week,
is in Connecticut this week and is aiming to be in Virginia this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off his third career victory with a one-stroke win in the
St. Jude Classic, Begay said he's back on track to make his
preseason goal -- playing on the Presidents Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's my motivation. To play for the U.S.'' Begay said
Wednesday on the eve of the Greater Hartford Open.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 players on the PGA Tour money list get an automatic
bid to play on the squad that will face an International team in
Lake Manassas, Va. in October. The St. Jude's win boosted Begay
from 24th to No. 15 on the list.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly a dream deferred because of his well-documented
drunken driving arrest on Jan. 19, in Albuquerque, N.M., and
subsequent seven-day jail term.
</P>
<P>
   After that setback, that ''bump in the road,'' as he refers to
it, Begay missed the cut in five of 10 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   He forgave himself, used the experience to teach others --
especially other young American Indians -- and hired his brother,
Clint, as his caddie.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once my brother got on the bag, we really started having
fun,'' he said. ''Last week's win put me right back in the race.
Another win, a couple of top-10 finishes and I'm pretty close to
getting in there.''
</P>
<P>
   A big help to getting him back on track was a gutsy shot on the
par-5, 528-yard 16th in Sunday's final round. Twenty yards from the
hole and off the green, Begay went right at the pin with his lob
wedge and landed the ball within 3 feet to set up a birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   It impressed a lot of folks, including an old college teammate --
Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''He called me last night and gave me a hard time,'' Begay said.
''He said 'How the heck did you get that ball to stop on 16. You'll
have to show me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Begay is making his second GHO appearance after missing the cut
last year at the Tournament Players Club at River Highlands. The
winner takes home $504,000 in the $2.8 million tournament,
sponsored by Canon.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Geiberger begins defense of his title Thursday, trying to
become the first back-to-back GHO winner. His victory by three
strokes last year was his first and only on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good challenge for me. I never had the opportunity to
defend,'' said Geiberger, whose father, Al Geiberger, was the first
player on tour to shoot a 59.
</P>
<P>
   Back problems took the younger Geiberger out of his rhythm early
this year. He took last week off to prepare for the GHO and next
week's Western.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm playing catchup. My back is OK as long as I stay loose,''
said Geiberger, who set a 54-hole course record here last year with
a 15-under 198.
</P>
<P>
   This week is all about recall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I picture good shots on the holes,'' he said. ''I feel a lot
of confidence out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the field include Hal Sutton, second on the money list
behind Woods, Davis Love III, Justin Leonard, Jim Furyk and Stewart
Cink.

<HEADLINE> Investigators Rule Out E. coli  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A coroner ruled Wednesday that E. coli had
nothing to do with five of 21 deaths considered possibly linked to
the intestinal bacteria that contaminated a rural town's drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Young, the Ontario chief coroner, said he expected a
similar finding for some of the other deaths being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said seven people died and an estimated 2,000
people were sickened by the bacteria that showed up in the water
supply of Walkerton, 90 miles west of Toronto, in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had enough information on these five cases to determine
that E. Coli was not the cause of death,'' Young said in a
statement. ''It is likely that some of the remaining 16 cases will
ultimately be eliminated as caused by E. coli. However, further
information is necessary before this can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the worst known E. coli contamination in North America,
and residents of Walkerton face at least four more weeks without
their normal water supply as authorities try to clean the system
and determine the source of the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jim Cairns, the Ontario deputy chief coroner, said people
still could get sick if they fail to take proper precautions with
the town water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Four investigations of the E. coli contamination have started or
been announced -- by Ontario Provincial Police, health and
environment officials, the coroner's office, and a public inquiry
to be conducted by a judge.
</P>
<P>
   The province has taken over the Walkerton water utility.
Officials also are studying the town's main wells to try to find
the source of the bacteria, often spread through human and animal
feces.
</P>
<P>
   Walkerton officials have said the local water utility knew of
the contamination before a boil-water order was issued May 21. Some
of the deaths under investigation for a possible link to the E.
coli contamination occurred weeks before the boil order.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore React to Elian Departure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush said he was ''saddened'' by
Elian Gonzalez's departure from the United States on Wednesday
while Al Gore, who broke with the administration over how the case
was handled, said the Supreme Court's refusal to intervene is
''entitled to respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore had argued for the case to turned over to a
family court. He also parted company with the administration by
supporting legislation to grant permanent resident status to the
6-year-old Cuban boy, his father and other relatives in a move that
some criticized as political pandering to Cuban-Americans in
Florida who wanted Elian to remain in this country.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as a chartered jet flew Elian home to Cuba, Gore
said he still believed ''our country would have been better advised
to send the case to a family court.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I still feel that way but this decision is entitled to respect
and the law must be followed,'' the likely Democratic presidential
nominee said aboard his campaign plane. ''And I wish the young boy
well after all he's been through and I hope that the various parts
of his family will all find the healing that they so richly
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. Bush also favored a family court hearing for what
became an international custody dispute between Elian's father and
the Miami relatives who had appealed to the high court to keep him
in the United States. The likely Republican presidential nominee
also had said the administration should try to persuade the boy's
father to stay here with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am saddened when the land of the free sends a young boy back
to communist Cuba without a fair hearing in family court,'' said in
a written statement. ''My thoughts and prayers are with the entire
Gonzalez family, and I hope that one day Elian will live in a free
Cuba and be able to choose for himself whether to return to
America.''

<HEADLINE> Millionaire Bride Poses for Playboy  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Darva Conger, television's multimillionaire
bride, removed her wedding dress and everything else for the August
issue of Playboy.
</P>
<P>
   Conger said Wednesday she gave the Playboy offer a lot more
thought than the decision to wed Rick Rockwell on live TV.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage quickly broke up, and she wanted to go back to her
job as an emergency room nurse, but she lost that job and two other
hospitals wouldn't take her because of the media stigma.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playboy stepped in and helped me out when I had no other
avenues open to me and really saved my bacon,'' Conger said at a
news conference to unveil the photo spread.
</P>
<P>
   She's already thinking of other job opportunities, like moving
into the talk show chair next to Regis Philbin when Kathie Lee
Gifford departs later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anyone could replace Kathie Lee,'' Conger said.
''I'd like to think I could do a good job as Regis' co-host. I
think he and I would get along rather well.''
</P>
<P>
   A Playboy pictorial seemed somehow inevitable ever since Conger
was the chosen one in Fox's February fiasco, ''Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   She had other offers to pose nude, from a Web site and Penthouse
magazine, but considered Playboy ''a respectable mainstream
magazine.'' Conger refused to say how much she was paid for
disrobing.
</P>
<P>
   On Playboy's cover, Conger holds a bouquet and wears a veil on
Playboy's cover. Inside, she reposes on a sun-baked beach, against
a rock and in water -- all wearing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were very kind, very respectful,'' Conger said. ''I never
felt vulnerable. They always held screens up for me. You've seen
the pictorial. It's pretty tame.''
</P>
<P>
   Conger's estranged ex-husband called for a nationwide boycott of
Playboy. ''I am recommending that people walk in to the store, look
through it and put it back on the shelf,'' Rick Rockwell said on
Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ''This might be the first Playboy where men actually read the
articles,'' said Rockwell, a stand-up comedian who has quickly
incorporated his quickie marriage into the act.
</P>
<P>
   Conger is running through the media gauntlet -- an appearance on
''Today'' on Wednesday and visit to Howard Stern on Thursday.
She'll be the featured guest at Playboy's ''Wet 'n' Wild Party'' at
a video distributors conference in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   After that, she'll sift through offers. She'd like to do
television work, even if Regis doesn't call. Maybe, she said,
someone could use her health expertise.
</P>
<P>
   She'd gladly give it all up if she could take back the decision
to participate in Fox's show.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying to make something positive out of something very
bad,'' she said, ''and it was very bad.''

<HEADLINE> New Jersey Picks Kenyon Martin  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Kenyon Martin of Cincinnati, the consensus
college player of the year, broke down in tears Wednesday night as
he was selected first overall in the NBA draft by the New Jersey
Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who wasn't 100 percent certain he'd be picked first,
hugged his family before pulling on a Nets cap. With some of the
reddest, wettest eyes ever seen on a No. 1 pick, he came onstage
and shook commissioner David Stern's hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets had entertained numerous trade offers for the 6-foot-9
center-forward whose collegiate career was ended prematurely by a
broken leg, but they decided to keep it and use it on Martin.
</P>
<P>
   LSU forward Stromile Swift went second to the Vancouver
Grizzlies, keeping a much calmer demeanor than Martin before him. A
6-9 power forward who left school after his sophomore season, Swift
has said he won't mind playing in one of the league's lesser-known
outposts.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Steve Francis grimaced and put his head in his hands
when Vancouver took him second overall, and he eventually forced a
trade to Houston. The selection of Swift means the Grizzlies will
likely end up trading Othella Harrington, who has gone public with
his distaste of playing in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   After weighing a tempting offer from the Orlando Magic, the Los
Angeles Clippers kept the third pick and selected high school
phenom Darius Miles of East St. Louis, Ill. He had committed to St.
John's before changing his mind and deciding to enter the draft
after a stellar showing at the McDonald's All-America game.
</P>
<P>
   Miles, perhaps surprised at being chosen ahead of Marcus Fizer
from Iowa State, came onstage and hugged the commissioner -- yet
another draft night rarity -- before patting Stern on the back of
the head.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic were willing to ship the fifth and 10th overall
selections to the Clippers, along with Michael Doleac or Corey
Maggette, to have a shot at the lanky, 6-9 Miles. Orlando also made
a run at New Jersey's No. 1 pick, but those talks cooled down.
</P>
<P>
   Fizer was scooped up by the Chicago Bulls with the fourth pick
even though the Bulls already have a power forward -- co-Rookie of
the Year Elton Brand. It was the start of what would be a busy
night for the Bulls, who owned three No. 1 picks as well as three
consecutive picks early in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Fizer, whose average of 22.8 points last season was the highest
of the top four picks, left Iowa State after his junior year. If he
stays with the Bulls, he'll be reunited with his former college
coach, Tim Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   Picking fifth, the Magic went for Florida forward Mike Miller.
The somewhat surprising selection brought a burst of applause from
the bus load of friends and relatives who drove down from Miller's
hometown of Mitchell, S.D., and secured seats in the front three
rows just to the commissioner's right.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's selection furthered the trend of the draft becoming a
night for younger and younger players. Martin finished four years
at Cincinnati, but the next five picks were all underclassmen.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who played just two years at Florida, is projected to
play both small forward and shooting guard in the pros.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic also had the 10th pick and the 13th pick, although
they reached agreement earlier Wednesday to trade the 13th pick to
Dallas in exchange for a future No. 1 pick, a second-round pick
(31st overall) and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta selected Cincinnati guard DerMarr Johnson with the sixth
pick, giving Chicago general manager Jerry Krause the option of
picking from any of the available centers with the seventh pick. It
had been expected that Texas center Chris Mihm would be gone by the
time the seventh pick was made.
</P>
<P>
   Krause quickly gobbled him up.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm, who left Texas after his junior year, was widely
considered the best available center. A 7-footer, he averaged 17.7
points and was the first player in school history to accumulate
1,100 points, 800 rebounds and 200 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Cavaliers, who were thought to have coveted a
center, instead went for Michigan freshman Jamal Crawford, a guard
whose stock rose considerably in the days leading up to the draft
after he impressed several teams in private workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford played only 17 games for Michigan after sitting out a
12-game NCAA suspension and averaged 16.6 points. With the Cavs,
he'll replace Bob Sura at shooting guard. Sura was traded to Golden
State on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Joel Pryzbilla by the Houston Rockets with the
ninth pick brought a different kind of impassioned response from
the crowd at the Target Center. They booed -- loudly -- for the 7-1
sophomore center who played locally at Minnesota and quit the team
late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando, picking 10th, took Missouri point guard Keyon Dooling.
</P>
<P>
   Right before announcing the 11th pick -- Jerome Moiso of UCLA to
Boston -- Stern announced that the Bulls had traded the rights to
Mihm to the Cavs for the rights to Crawford and cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought Crawford would be taken as high as fourth -- we
liked him that much,'' Bulls coach Tim Floyd said. ''We've always
liked big guards here. We liked the guard, they wanted the big
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the trade left the Bulls without a center, fueling belief
that they might be able to acquire center Jermaine O'Neal from
Portland. Krause made a run at the center last summer when he was a
free agent, but O'Neal opted to sign with Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks had the next two picks -- their own and the one
they got from Orlando -- and took Syracuse forward Etan Thomas and
Fresno State guard Courtney Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was one of the best shot-blocking forwards, while
Alexander led the nation in scoring with a 24.8 average.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Pistons selected Michigan State guard Mateen Cleaves
with the 14th pick, keeping the captain of the national champions
in-state.
