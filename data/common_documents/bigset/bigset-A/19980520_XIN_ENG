<HEADLINE> UK Prime Minister Calls for Open, Fair Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Tuesday called on all the members of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) to keep markets open and fair despite the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We must ensure that the current financial difficulties in Asia
do not lead to a retreat into protectionism," Blair said in a
speech here Tuesday to mark the 50th anniversary of the WTO's
predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
</P>
<P>
He said he was delighted that at the recent Asia Europe meeting
in London, leaders of 25 countries, representing half of the
world's GDP, pledged "to resist protectionism, keep markets open,
and press ahead with multilateral liberalization."
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the WTO send a clear message to all the
members:
</P>
<P>
-- Protectionism does not bring prosperity;
</P>
<P>
-- More open markets and more trade mean growth and new jobs
for the benefit of all the peoples of the WTO;
</P>
<P>
-- 50 years of trade liberalization have generated
unprecedented growth; the global economy and electronic revolution
can help spread prosperity more widely;
</P>
<P>
-- The members of the WTO will settle their differences on the
basis of rules, not of power; oppose damaging discrimination; and
respect agreements reached freely by consensus;
</P>
<P>
-- The WTO members will work for the further expansion of world
trade in a responsible way, sensitive to the needs of all, so as
to raise living standards, combat poverty, promote sustainable
development and protection of the environment and contribute to
international security.

<HEADLINE> Power Shortage Threatens Vietnam's Major Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, MAY 19 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government is taking
tough measures to limit power consumption in major cities to
ensure a continuous power supply through the current dry spell,
local press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Hanoi, these measures include the
request that offices operate their own diesel generators during
the nightly peak hours between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh city will impose major cuts on electricity for
advertising and street lights and request offices to cut down on
electricity use.
</P>
<P>
For weeks now, the water levels in the reservoirs of Vietnam's
two largest hydro power plants, the Hoa Binh in the North and Tri
An in the South, have been hovering around the "dead level" where
they will be forced to stop operating.
</P>
<P>
However, the demand for electricity has kept increasing as
summer is coming.
</P>
<P>
The overall consumption of electricity in Hanoi will be fixed
at 6 million kwh per day and 15.5 million kwh per day in
Ho Chi Minh city.
</P>
<P>
To make up for this shortage, Vietnam electricity corporation
has so far operated all its thermal, gas and diesel power plants
and stations to supplement the national grid.

<HEADLINE> State Duma Called Upon to Ratify START II by July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian foreign ministry called
upon the State Duma on Tuesday (the lower house of parliament) to
ratify the Second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) by
July.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry expressed the hope
that the State Duma can ratify the START II before a summit
meeting of President Boris Yeltsin and his U.S. counterpart Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with Clinton at last weekend's G8 summit in
Birmingham, England, Yeltsin announced the U.S. leader will visit
Moscow in July.
</P>
<P>
But the White House has not officially confirmed the date
linking this visit to the ratification of START II.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that all the people say the state security
should work hard to get the treaty approved because START II is in
the interest of Russian security.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign ministry is ready to work with the
State Duma constructively to get the treaty ratified.
</P>
<P>
The START II was signed by Russia and U.S. in 1993. It was
ratified by the U.S. Congress two years ago, but Russian lawmakers
have thus far refused to follow suit.

<HEADLINE> China's Prosperity Benefits World Peace, Stability: Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said here Tuesday that China's development and
prosperity will pose no threat to any other countries.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Italian Senate Chairman Nicola Mancino, Li
said that China is an important force in safeguarding world peace
and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese people have a tradition of pursuing peace
and the Chinese government always persists in independent and
peaceful foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader said it is nonsense for some people in the
world to spread the so-called "China threat" theory. China's
prosperity will only benefit other countries rather than
threaten them.
</P>
<P>
Without a strong economy, it would not be possible for China to
play its role, which was praised by the international community
during the Asian financial crisis, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said whether a country constitutes threats to the others is
determined by the foreign policies and the ethic rules it adopts
in international exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Mancino said that Italy attaches great importance to its
traditional relations with China and he is ready to make further
contributions to promote bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said China is an important force in safeguarding regional
and world peace.
</P>
<P>
The senate chairman said there is no fundamental conflict of
interest between the two countries, and both have the common
interest in safeguarding the world peace and promoting
development.

<HEADLINE> Fragile Zimbabwean Stock Market Boosted by IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe stock market, the
second largest in Africa, continues with its fragile recovery on
reported support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the IMF will consider the Zimbabwean
government's request for stand-by credit facility of three
billion Zimbabwean Dollars (170 million U.S. Dollars) next month.
</P>
<P>
The key industrial index gained 34 points Tuesday to close at
6,777 as industrial shares keep firming, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the recovery was largely due to news that the
IMF was no longer likely to delay any further its decision over
Zimbabwe's request due to the sharp decline in tobacco prices.
</P>
<P>
The low tobacco prices have put the Zimbabwean Dollar under
renewed pressure especially after the closure of auction floors
last week following the withdrawal of the crop from the floors by
farmers.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Zimbabwean Dollar was trading at 18.35 against
the U.S. Dollar, compared with 16.5 against the Dollar early this
month.
</P>
<P>
The unstable currency, analysts said, could halt the market's
recovery.
</P>
<P>
They also said the market was increasingly becoming
directionless as it was being constantly affected by new
developments.

JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai Tuesday reiterated that Israel is ready to
withdraw its troops from south Lebanon, according to a
communique released by Israeli Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with visiting Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Victor Possulvalyuk, Mordechai said that the Israeli
government is sincere about implementing U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425 and pull back its troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai also stressed that the withdrawal of Israeli troops
is contingent on getting security guarantees from the Lebanese
government in advance.
</P>
<P>
Israel's proposal to leave south Lebanon was initiated in
April. In response, Lebanon has rejected it, noting that the
withdrawal should be implemented unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Mordechai and Possulvalyuk also discussed a
range of issues related to the Middle East situation and the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 allegely to protect its northern borders from

<HEADLINE> Life Returns to Normal in S. Somali Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The life seems to be returning
back to normal in the Southern port town of Kismayu following the
breaking down of the main Kansuma bridge linking Mogadishu to the
town eight days ago.
</P>
<P>
Some business activities, encouraged by the less probability
for another war break out, can be seen again in the main streets
of the town as many shops, food stores and the markets have
reopened their doors for commercial exercise.
</P>
<P>
According to the VHF radio reports, a vaccination campaign
against the killer diseases of measles, tetanus, polio,
tuberculosis, and whooping cough for children under five has also
begun in the town by the local staff of the few international aid
agencies.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities of Kismayu headed by General Mohamed
Hirsi Morgan have also issued a statement calling on the
international and the United Nations aid agencies to fully resume
their humanitarian opeations in the town.
</P>
<P>
In their statement, General Morgan has pledged that the
security of the international aid workers and their properties
will be guaranteed by what he called the security units of his
forces.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports noted that this call for the humanitarian
assistance by the local authorities of Kismayu, 500 Km South of
Mogadishu, is taking place when the opposing sides of Lower
Jubba, the Majerten led forces of General Morgan and those of
Marehan militiamen are still gathering and building up troop
reinforcements to their front defense positions in the region.
</P>
<P>
The defeated Marehan militia officers, just outside Kansuma
Town, are searching for a possible break-through in the snag
created by the broken bridge of Kansuma, 90 Km North of Kismayu
town.
</P>
<P>
According to their militia commanders, they are now trying to
find another road leading to their former bases in Yontoy, Bulo
Gudud and Gobwein, now occupied by General Morgan's men, in their
decisive counter-attack against the Marehans.
</P>
<P>
People from the area said all those roads have earlier been
blocked by the rain waters and muddy and that they are reportedly
not safe as yet.
</P>
<P>
At least 150 people including several well known militia
commanders have died and more than 300 others were wounded since
the fighting for control of Kismayu has intensified between the
two Darod sub-clans of Majerten and Marehan militiamen in mid
April.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Issue Should Not Be Linked with Others: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot parliament speaker said on
Tuesday that international efforts to solve the Cyprus problem
should in no way be linked to the improvement of Greece-Turkey and
European Union-Turkey relations.
</P>
<P>
"It is a mistake to link the Cyprus problem with the other two
issues, because the Cyprus question is a problem of occupation,
violation of human rights, ethnic cleansing and Turkish
expansionism," Cypriot President of the House of Representatives
Spyros Kyprianou said.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on statements concerning the Cyprus problem
made by United States President Bill Clinton and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair on Monday in London.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Blair said at a press conference that problems
related to Greek-Turkish relations, Cyprus' and Turkey's drive to
enter the EU have to be tackled in a comprehensive manner and not
in isolation.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said that Cyprus should not become a victim of
solutions to the other issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides
told a press briefing Tuesday that Clinton's statements are "in
the framework of the declared positions of the U.S. policy. We do
not interpret them as being part of a package deal solution of all
these problem."
</P>
<P>
"Any positive development in Greco-Turkish relations will
inevitably facilitate the climate of procedures in the Cyprus
problem and vice versa," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government wants first and foremost to see
the resumption of the peace talks between the Greek and Turkish
Cypriots in a bid to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two sides came to a standstill last
summer when Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of the
talks with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides in protest against
EU's decision to start accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has said that he would not return to the negotiating
table unless his entity in northern Cyprus controlled by the
Turkish Cypriots is recognized and the Cypriot government suspends
talks with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island after a failed coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The world community has been making efforts to help Cyprus
reunify under the bizonal and bicommunal formula sponsored by the
United Nations. But so far, no tangible results have been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ANC to Tighten Control on Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- With signs of clashes within
its ruling alliance growing, South Africa's African National
Congress (ANC) is taking steps to ensure its alliance partners
will speak in one voice in next year's general elections.
</P>
<P>
The ANC is finalizing a proposal which would require members
of its alliance partners, the South African Communist Party
(SACP) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu),
to commit to the ANC's policies before being nominated as an ANC
candidate for the 1999 polls, an ANC spokesman told Xinhua
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which is endorsed Monday by the ANC's
decision-making body, the national executive committee, and is
expected to be finalized soon, stipulates that the ANC will not
reserve parliamentary seats next year for its alliance partners
as it did in the 1994 elections.
</P>
<P>
ANC national spokesman Steyn Speed said Tuesday that members
of the SACP and Cosatu will have to follow the same nomination
procedure as ordinary ANC members, who will need the backing of
five ANC structures to become ANC candidates.
</P>
<P>
The move would ensure that any SACP or Cosatu member who
contests the elections under the ANC's banner exactly supports
ANC policies, however different those may be from their own
party's policies, Speed said.
</P>
<P>
At the 1994 elections, the ANC set aside 20 seats for Cosatu,
while the SACP, which took part in the normal selection process,
has about 80 members of parliament (MPs) in the ANC parliamentary
caucus of 252 members.
</P>
<P>
This was because the three parties adopted virtually the same
policy platform and many SACP and Cosatu members are also ANC
members.
</P>
<P>
However, over the past two years, Cosatu and the SACP have
become increasingly critical of some of the ANC's policy
initiatives, especially economic policies and the government's
Growth, Employment and Redistribution (Gear) macro-economic
strategy.
</P>
<P>
They said the policies are pro-liberal and spurring the
economy at the expense of social welfare.
</P>
<P>
Cosatu repeatedly attacked the ANC for not doing enough to
solve the grave problem of high unemployment and for "ignoring
the poor". The conflict reached its climax in March when Cosatu
withdrew from the parliament debate over this year's government
budget.
</P>
<P>
The ANC decision to scrap its 1994 practice of reserving seats
for the other two partners came after criticism from within the
party, that alliance candidates are wearing two hats and have a
dual loyalty - both to the ANC and to their own party.
</P>
<P>
Environment and Tourism Deputy Minister Peter Mokaba, a
vociferous challenger of the dual loyalty, reportedly said Monday
that the move meant that "the SACP and Cosatu have agreed to be
led by the ANC leadership and to be bound by ANC policy
decisions."
</P>
<P>
Speed told Xinhua Tuesday that the SACP and Cosatu had
basically agreed to the proposal and Cosatu itself said it did
not want the seat reservation.
</P>
<P>
But Speed refrained from predicting whether the SACP and
Cosatu would get as many seats in parliament as in the 1994
polls. "It's hard to tell," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, newspaper reports quoted SACP general-secretary
Jeremy Cronin as saying Monday the ANC move followed "thorough
consultations between parties."
</P>
<P>
It was intended to "eliminate the possibilities of MPs acting
as a faction within the national and provincial caucuses," Cronin
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the alliance partners had agreed that they cannot have
people voting differently on certain issues following their
individual party stand-points.

<HEADLINE> Jospin Denies Socialist Involvement in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
Tuesday denied any involvement by his government or the Socialist
Party in the judicial inquiry into a suspected salary fraud by the
wife of the mayor of Paris, Xavier Tiberi.
</P>
<P>
Xavier Tiberi was detained for eight hours Monday by police for
questioning over a salary fraud, in which she was accused of
receiving an illegal payroll from the regional parliament of
Essonne east of Paris in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR), to which both Xavier
Tiberi and her husband Jean Tiberi belong, accused the Socialist
government of "well orchestrated manipulation of public opinion"
which was aimed at destabilizing the president of the republic,
Jacques Chirac, who was predecessor of Tiberi.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question from an RPR deputy, Jospin said that the
government and the Socialists "have nothing to be a party of" in
the judicial inquiry of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
"The political formation (the Socialist Party) from which I
came indicated during the legislative elections that in no way
would it be involved with the questions of justice," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hails Failure of U.S. Sanction Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran said on Tuesday that facts have
justified its prediction that the American D'Amato Act against
Iran and Libya is doomed to failure "from the very beginning."
</P>
<P>
The D'Amato Act should not last long, because it is a
"miscalculated law" in conflict with international trade
regulations, the Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted Iranian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under strong pressures from the European Union and its members,
United States President Bill Clinton announced on Monday to waive
the act and not to punish French, Russian and Malaysian companies,
which have reached a 2-billion-dollar deal with Iran in the field
of gas and oil.
</P>
<P>
Under the D'Amato Act signed by Clinton in 1996, the U.S. would
punish any companies which invest over 40 million U.S. dollars in
the energy sector in Iran. The ceiling was lowered to 20 million
dollars last August.
</P>
<P>
The American act is "contrary to the prevalent trend in today's
world towards cooperation and partnership, thus lacking efficiency
and failing to gain international support," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"From the very beginning, we witnessed opposition of different
countries to it (D'Amato law)," he said, adding that economic
interests have overcome illegal legislation prompted by political
motives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's conservative daily Tehran Times said in a
commentary on Tuesday that Clinton's announcement was "a
face-saving move" facing a "big no" from European countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is the victory of the rational business and economic
community and a big defeat for the Zionists' (Israeli) lobby in
the West and the (U.S.) pro-Zionist Congress," the daily said.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Party Sets Out Future Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BREMEN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party Tuesday set out a
future-oriented working program in a bid to win back voters'
support in the run-up to the general elections in September this
year.
</P>
<P>
Adopted by the CDU party convention at the northern German city
of Bremen, the so-called "future program" called for deregulation,
structural reforms and more private initiative to improve
Germany's competitiveness in the world and fight record
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Jobs for all, a more efficient education system, a slim state
and a streamlined social welfare system combining solidarity with
private responsibility were among the goals outlined in the CDU
platform.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the party pledged to push forward a tax reform
package for a 30 billion mark (17.5 billion U.S. dollar) tax cut
to spur economic growth and employment.
</P>
<P>
In order to combat rising crimes, the party vowed to model on a
U.S. practice of "zero tolerance" against criminals. It also
called for swift deportation of foreigners who commit crimes in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
CDU officials said the program should serve as the basis for
the formulation of a common election platform with its Bavarian
sister party Christian Social Union (CSU).
</P>
<P>
Closing the two-day convention, Kohl again called on his party
members to show unity and self-confidence in an uphill campaign to
win another four years in power in the September election.
</P>
<P>
Kohl hoped that the convention would be the turning point for
his party, which is currently trailing the main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) by some 10 percentage points in opinion
polls.

<HEADLINE> Robust Silver Demand Leads to Substantial Reductions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Robust silver demand exceeded supply
from mine production and the recycling of scrap by 198 million
ounces in 1997, leading to substantial reductions of bullion
stocks, announced Gold Fields Mineral Services (GFMS) here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the ninth consecutive year that conventional supply
failed to keep pace with fabrication demand, Stewart Murray, chief
executive of GFMS, said.
</P>
<P>
Murray quoted the World Silver Survey 1998 as saying, "Strong
demand from India and surging industrial demand in the United
States resulted in record silver offtake last year, totaling 863,4
million ounces."
</P>
<P>
Increases in mine supply and scrap recycling were insufficient
to meet the rise in fabrication demand last year, which grew 6.1
percent, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1997, cumulative silver fabrication demand has
exceeded mine production by 2,226 million ounces.
</P>
<P>
The gap has been filled by recycled silver scrap, and by the
drawdown of 1,084 million ounces of silver bullion inventories,
700 million ounces of which came from identifiable bullion stocks
and the balance from private holdings, the survey said.

SANAA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Yemen and the United States signed
here on Tuesday three agreements on the rescheduling of the Yemeni
debts to the latter which amount to 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, another 20 million dollars owed by Yemen
to the U.S. will be written off in line with the decision made by
Paris Club, a group of rich countries to discuss debt issues with
developing countries, last November,
</P>
<P>
The three documents were signed by Yemeni Minister of Finance
Alawi Saleh al-Salami and the U.S. Ambassador to Yemen Barbaz
Bedoin, the Yemeni News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy in Sanaa said in a statement Tuesday that the
three agreements aim to give a strong U.S. support for the Yemeni
economic reform program and to relieve significantly the Arab
country of its debt burden.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Yemeni government is discussing with Japan, Italy
and Denmark similar documents to reschedule the debts owed by
Yemen to the three countries.

<HEADLINE> CBI Welcomes Government's National Childcare Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry welcomes the government's green paper on a national
childcare strategy released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government's proposals represent a major step forward in
offering better opportunities to balance work and caring
responsibilities for those with younger children.
</P>
<P>
The CBI believes that the strategy should enable parents to
realize their potential, in or out of the workplace, secure in
the knowledge that their children are receiving quality care.
</P>
<P>
It particularly welcomes the emphasis on identifying and
addressing the needs of carers at the local level, the involvement
of regional development agencies to promote childcare in the
regions and the availability of additional money for "pump
priming" local initiatives.
</P>
<P>
However, the CBI believes that if the barriers to greater labor
market participation and equality of opportunity faced by carers
are to be demolished, the government will need a more broad-based
"carers strategy."
</P>
<P>
In an ageing society greater emphasis should be placed on the
needs of those with responsibilities for caring for elderly and
disabled people, it says.

BEIRUT, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Israeli ally South
Lebanese Army (SLA) was killed on Tuesday in a bomb explosion in
south Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place on a road in Kfar Houhoun village in
Jezzine, an area bordering south Lebanon occupied by Israel, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed responsibility for the
blast, saying one of its units set off the roadside bomb when a
group of SLA members were passing by.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
areas from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah is leading a resistance war to drive an estimated
2,000-strong Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA men out of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Heavy casualties suffered by the Israeli troops have pressured
Israel into seeking ways of withdrawing from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Israel decided to endorsed the United Nations
Security Council Resolution 425, which demands unilateral Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But it called on the Lebanese government to negotiate security
arrangements before the troop pullback is conducted.

<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, insisting that the withdrawal
be unconditional under the U.N. resolution.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of
Congo President Laurent Kabila Tuesday shot down allegations of
human rights violations committed by his security forces as false
propaganda spread by supporters of his predecessor, Mobutu Sese
Seko.
</P>
<P>
At a media briefing during the southern African economic
summit under way in Windhoek, Namibian capital, Kabila dismissed
a recent report by Amnesty International as complete propaganda
to misinform the world, saying it was based on statements made by
people connected with the late dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations team investigating the allegations, which
left the Democratic Congo last month, was welcome to return,
South African Press Association quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "DRC, A Year of Dashed Hopes", claimed
widespread human rights abuses in the Democratic Congo since
Kabila took power a year ago and urged world leaders to put
pressure on Kabila to rectify the situation.
</P>
<P>
The human rights group said that Kabila's year in power had
been marked by a deliberate policy to kill, maim and arrest
civilians suspected of supporting government opponents.
</P>
<P>
Kabila also pledged to lift the ban on free political activity
in his country six months before the country's elections, which
is scheduled in June next year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, he told businessmen that "I am not so
naive as to believe that social and economic reform, without
political transformation, will be sufficient to ensure Congo's
success."
</P>
<P>
"We fought for change because our people were deprived of the
fundamental civil, political and economic rights, and we are
determined to secure these for all our citizens," he said, adding
that they have "very disciplined soldiers."

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Sierra
Leonean government said Tuesday that the remnants of the junta in
the northern district of Makeni would be mopped up in a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
"In the next few weeks, we should be reporting that we reach
the end of the road," said Dr. Y.M. Koroma, minister of state
resident in Makeni, quoted by a British Broadcasting Corporation
report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The junta, which overthrew the legitimate government in a coup
last May, was ousted from the capital of Freetown in
mid-February. The remnants of the junta forces, alongside junta
leader Johnny Paul Koroma, then fled to the northern and eastern
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Makeni is one of the strongholds of the junta and allied
rebels.
</P>
<P>
While the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG and allies
are intensifying the mop-up exercise, the junta and allied rebels
have launched a violent campaign against the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
In Makeni over the last three months, they have perpetrated
atrocities, killing and maiming by chopping off people's hands
and legs.
</P>
<P>
"These people are no longer human beings. They have no power
of reasoning. They just continue to do evil things against the
whole people," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government and ECOMOG are doing their utmost
to bring the situation in Makeni under control and the whole
thing is expected to be finished in a few weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa has
welcomed foreign businessmen to invest in Tanzania's tourism
sector.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa extended the welcome at the 23rd African Travel
Association (ATA) Congress which opened on Tuesday in the town of
Arusha in north Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The president said the new investment policy of 1996 and the
new law on promotion and protection of investments last year
offered an attractive package for investors in tourism and other
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government is committed to upgrade the quality
of tourism, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are geared to the development of sustainable high quality
tourism which is guided by an integrated tourism master plan
prepared in 1995 and a national tourism policy promulgated in
1991," he told more than 300 delegates from 18 countries.
</P>
<P>
The president informed participants on the changing role of
the government which has been reduced to policy making and the
performance of regulatory functions, as well as creating
favorable environment for private investors.
</P>
<P>
The central role of private sector, he said, has been under
review by the government policies and laws.
</P>
<P>
President Mpaka welcomed foreign investors to Tanzania, saying
that his government has approved a total of 152 tourism projects
worth 313 million U.S. Dollars between September 1990 and March
1998.
</P>
<P>
Among the approved projects 67 were local, 60 were joint
ventures, and 25 were foreign-funded. He said that tourism is
the second most important investment area after manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism Zakia
Meghji said that Africa possesses abundant natural and cultural
resources but suffers from poor infrastructure and tour~?
facilities. She said Africa must pay greater attention to
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The congress is chaired by the ATA-New York Chairman, Harold
Gordon. The United States is represented by a contingent of
about 140 delegates.
</P>
<P>
Other countries attending the congress are: Ghana, Togo,
Kenya, Nigeria, Swaziland, Zambia, South Africa and Benin.

CAIRO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Zohdi
Al Kedra Tuesday welcomed an Egyptian-French proposal to convene a
Middle East peace conference, Egypt's official Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kedra termed as "effective and positive" the proposal made on
Monday by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and French President
Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak arrived in Paris on Monday for a three-day visit. In a
joint statement issued after their talks, Mubarak and Chirac
called on all the countries which are resolved to save the Mideast
peace process to attend the peace conference.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders assured that the conference would maintain and
confirm all the existing principles and agreements signed by the
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"The call made by presidents Mubarak and Chirac demonstrated
the awareness of both sides of the current situation due to the
Israeli intransigent policies and (Israeli) Prime Minister
(Benjamin) Netanyahu's insistence on not implementing the already
signed agreements," the Palestinian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
It has reflected the deep concern of Egypt and France over the
future of the peace drive, he added.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel have been
in deadlock since March 1997 when Israel started the construction
of a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians
want as capital of their future independent state.

<HEADLINE> France Welcomes U.S.-EU Compromise on Extraterritorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- France Tuesday officially qualified
as "a positive element" the compromise reached by the United
States and the European Union to avoid the threats of economic
sanctions by the U.S. through imposition of extraterritorial laws.
</P>
<P>
These laws include the Helms-Burton law, which bans foreign
companies from investing in the energy sectors of Iran and Libya,
and the D'Amato-Kennedy law, which bans investments in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Finance and Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Tuesday told his EU counterparts in Brussels that France is
satisfied by the U.S. decision not to impose sanctions on the
French oil group Total.
</P>
<P>
Total, together with a Russian company and a Malaysian
company, signed last September a multi-billion dollar agreement
with Iran on developing an offshore gas field in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry said in a declaration that France
took note of the decision by the United States to exempt Total
from the American legislation in force.
</P>
<P>
"This is a positive element. They (the extraterritorial laws)
are of an internal decision by the United States," said the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
France and other EU countries have always said that American
laws should not be applied to a third country as it contradicts
with international laws, it said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-EU compromise, reached in London Monday between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who
is the rotating president of the EU, promises to avoid imposing
sanctions through the Helms-Burton and D'Amato-Kennedy laws.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Economic Summit Calls for Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The three-day Southern
African Economic Summit in Windhoek ended Tuesday, calling for
more action and less talking to resolve the region's economic
woes.
</P>
<P>
Laurent Kabila, President of the Democratic Republic of Congo,
put in his first public appearance at the closing session, urging
foreign investors to help rebuild his war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
In response to Kabila's call, the South African
representatives have expressed willingness to help Democratic
Congo's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
South African corporations are reportedly planning to set up
joint ventures in Democratic Congo to rebuild the country which
was heavily damaged during the civil war last year.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said earlier that
his country would focus on building up state administration, the
central bank and infrastructure in Democratic Congo.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Huges, Chief Executive Officer of the British company
Proudfoot, warned that the southern African region has a narrow
window of opportunity to market itself to international
investors.
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely in the wake of the Asian crisis that investors
would switch their funds to the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), he said.
</P>
<P>
Huges said that there is still limited knowledge about
investment opportunities in Africa and that news from the region
is largely negative.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said that a high-profile regional investment advisory
group is in the process of being formed, which will try and
address the lack of knowledge about investment opportunities in
SADC countries.

<HEADLINE> New Pipeline Eases Nicosia's Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The severe water shortage in
Nicosia is expected to be partly relieved with Tuesday's
inauguration of a pipeline to bring in desalinated water from the
south-east coast of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The 37-kilometer pipeline was inaugurated by Minister of
Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment Costas
Themistocleous.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline now carries 13,000 cubic meters of water to the
Nicosia reservoirs daily, while its total capacity will reach
90,000 cubic meters, ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
The project, which costed 7 million Cyprus pounds (about 14
million U.S. dollars), makes Nicosia less vulnerable to severe
droughts as witnessed in the island over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Themistocleous said the
present quantity of water reaching Nicosia from the Dhekelia
desalination plant through the pipeline will not resolve the
capital's water problem.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed on the need of continuous and tough
water-saving measures, noting that an additional desalination
plant in Larnaca is expected to start operation in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Dhekelia desalination plant, which is the first on the
island, came into operation in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the House of Representatives unanimously passed
legislation imposing tough, new sanctions against anyone found
wasting water.
</P>
<P>
The legislation raises the on-the-spot fine from 15 to 30
Cyprus pounds (about 30 to 60 U.S. dollars) for anyone found
wasting water by using a hose pipe to wash pavements, streets,
verandas, fences and any type of vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The new measures were taken to make consumers more sensitive to
the need to conserve water in face of the serious shortage caused
by the continuing drought on the island.

BONN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The German government Tuesday said
that it had never granted licenses to any German exports to Iraq
before and after the 1991 Gulf War which could be used in making

</P>

Speaking at a parliament hearing, the government officials
noted that after the Gulf War, Bonn had only given green light to
those exports to Iraq which were intended for medical purpose.

There was also no concrete proof about any German deliveries to

<HEADLINE> Russia to Propose Closing Iraq's Nuclear File: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Mideast special envoy Viktor
Posuvalyuk said here on Tuesday that his country would make a
proposal that Iraq's nuclear file be closed, Jordan's official
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russia will put forward the initiative to the United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) in October, Posuvalyuk said during a meeting with
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM is charged with overseeing the elimination of Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction and IAEA is monitoring the country's
nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
As UNSCOM's latest inspections have shown that Iraq possesses
no banned weapons, including nuclear weapons, Russia has decided
to make the initiative, the news agency quoted Posuvalyuk as
saying.
</P>
<P>
If such an initiative is recognized, it may help lift the
crippling economic sanctions on Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions on Iraq in 1990
after its invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions will not be lifted
until the UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has destroyed its nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Russia is always prepared to help lift the sanctions and ease
the sufferings of the Iraqi people, the Russian envoy added.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk arrived here on Tuesday to brief Jordanian officials
on his regional tour, which has taken him to the Palestinian
self-rule areas, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> European Shares End with Big Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
recovered from recent falls and ended with big gains Tuesday,
boosted by Wall Street's buoyant start, fading concerns on
possible U.S. rates rise, Asian markets' steady performance and
possible Indonesian political stability.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE-100 index of leading shares closed 0.89 percent
or 51.6 points higher at 5,877.8, as the market staged a late
recovery from Monday's 91.6 points retreating.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that fading U.S. interest rate concerns, the more
optimistic mood in global markets, a sprinkling of positive
company news and the possibility of a return to political
stability in Indonesia all helped shares' recovery.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares closed at 5,388.90, up 46.05 points
or 0.86 percent, cheered by firmer Asian markets and hopes of a
peaceful resolution to the crisis in Indonesia after Indonesia's
President Suharto promised to hold fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, French shares closed higher in line with
other European markets, with the CAC-40 index ending at 3,980.84,
up 35.53 points or 0.90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The market was also supported by growing optimism that U.S.
interest rates would not be raised later in the day and by a
hopeful view that the Indonesian crisis would be resolved soon.

<HEADLINE> Cook Visits Turkey to Repair EU-Turkey Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook, representing the European Union (EU), said here on Tuesday
that he wants to prepare for a successful meeting of the
Europe-Turkey Association Council next Monday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Cook made the remark upon his arrival in Ankara on a one-day
visit aimed at mending the fences between the EU and
Turkey. Britain is currently holding EU's rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to that meeting and I hope today we can
agree on a basis that will make it a successful meeting to put
Europe and Turkey back on track for closer, successful relations,"
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting between Cook and Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem, the two sides issued a joint statement declaring they
have agreed on the importance of laying the foundation for a
European strategy to prepare Turkey for accession.
</P>
<P>
Cook said he came with a "strategy document" setting up a
framework for future relations between the EU and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cem said the document was positive and hoped that further
dialog between Turkey and Britain representing the EU would lead
to the convening of the Association Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that he told Cook that the EU should abandon its
discrimination policy against Turkey if it wants to mend the
fences with Ankara and resume talks.
</P>
<P>
Cem pointed out that the financial dispute between Turkey and
the EU is not the crux of the matter. "A few hundred million
dollars in EU funds are meaningless for Turkey. We want the
conditions that create the blockage of these funds (to be)
eliminated," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU is supposed to provide Turkey with about 400 million
U.S. dollars to help it become more competitive and offset losses
from a 1995 customs deal that eliminated some trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister added that both sides aim to
boost their annual trade volume to 6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Turkey-EU relations have been tense since the EU decided
last December to exclude Turkey from its immediate enlargement
process.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Cook also met with Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel and Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz. He has ended his visit
and left here.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Urges Russia Not to Help Iran's Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Tuesday urged Russia to immediately halt its involvement
in Iran's military build-up.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique released by the Prime Minister
Office, Netanyahu made such a request to visiting Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Victor Posuvalyuk in Jerusalem Tuesday night and
briefed him on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk handed over a letter from Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov which covers the regional issues.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Netanyahu pointed out to Iran's efforts
to acquire nuclear and missile technology, urging Moscow to stop
helping Israel's arch rival build up its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted that Iran is producing ballistic missiles
capable of striking Israel -- with the help from Russia.
</P>
<P>
During his recent talks with American leaders, Netanyahu also
asked the U.S. to exert pressure on Russia over this
issue.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Reject Russia's Demilitarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
has officially rejected Russia's proposal on full-fledged
demilitarization on Cyprus, according to a report reaching here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan,
Denktash said that Annan is the only person who has the right to
present new proposals on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"Demilitarization has never been on the agenda of the United
Nations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia raised the issue in a proposal submitted to the U.N. on
April 30.
</P>
<P>
Denktash stressed that demilitarization could be realized only
as part of an ultimate solution to the Cyprus problem and only if
the two communities involved are to build full confidence in each
other.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
Mediterranean island after a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Denktash accused the Cypriot government, which is dominated by
the Greek Cypriots, of being "insincere and hypocritical" with
regard to its endorsement of the Russian proposal.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cypriot government is accelerating militarization
efforts, which he said is clearly revealed by its determination to
deploy the Russian-made surface-to-air missiles and open the air
base at Paphos to Greek military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Russia's efforts to promote its plan, Denktash
said that "if Russia really wants to defuse the tension on
Cyprus, it should stop the delivery of the S-300 missiles to the
Greek Cypriots."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Russia signed an agreement in January 1997 on the
missile deal. They have repeatedly expressed readiness to go ahead
with the delivery of the missiles as scheduled in August.

<HEADLINE> New Plan for Angolan Peace Process Adopted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May (Xinhua) -- The Joint Commission for Angolan Peace
Process adopted a "mutual trust restoration plan" here Tuesday,
stipulating concrete tasks for the two warring sides in
implementing the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations envoy to Angola Blondin Beye announced this
at the press conference held Tuesday after the meeting of the
joint commission.
</P>
<P>
Beye said that the "mutual trust restoration plan" which he
himself drew up was unanimously passed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The plan stipulated specific tasks for the two warring sides,
said Beye.
</P>
<P>
According to the new plan, the opposition National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) should make efforts to
facilitate the reestablishment of local governments in such
places as Bailundo, its headquarters, and Andulo, and some other
places which it regards sensitive.
</P>
<P>
Beye said that in line with the plan, the Angolan government
should avoid releasing any news about the maneuvers and other
operations of the so-called "remnants" of UNITA troops without
confirmation by the U.N. observer mission in the war-ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
Beye is confident with the Angolan peace process, saying that
he would resign if the signatories of the Lusaka Peace Protocol
in 1994 still lacked the political will to implement the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy said that he always believes that he can
complete his mission only if both the Angolan government and
UNITA have the political will for peace.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Beye said he would submit his resignation to the
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the Angolan government, UNITA,
and the observers from the United States, Russia and Portugal and
ask them to choose another mediator for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process has been in a deadlock for two
months since the government and the rebel movement have different
ideas about the reestablishment of local administrative
institutions in the UNITA-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
The observers here said that this meeting is important, which
can help wipe out the distrust between the Angolan government and
UNITA so that the suspending tasks could be finished and the
peace process could be revived.

<HEADLINE> Internet Could Reshape World Economy, Says Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Internet commerce is gathering
tidal wave that could totally reshape the world economy, said a
technology pundit at an ongoing conference in San Diego,
California.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Oracle Applications User Group convention,
Nicholas Negroponte, director of the Media Lab at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, predicted that Internet
commerce would reach one trillion U.S. dollars a year by 2000.
U.S. government prediction is 327 billion dollars per year
worldwide by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
Not only could smart cards replace cash, even for transactions
as small as a pack of gum, computers could turn a handshake into a
financial transaction, save books but kill bookstores, Negroponte
said.
</P>
<P>
But before Internet commerce becomes that extensive, he said,
consumers have to overcome two barriers, security and payment
systems.
</P>
<P>
Security is mostly a regulatory issue, he said, since very
strong encryption technology already exists.
</P>
<P>
Encryption could also help crack the other barrier -- to make
transactions as fast and cheap with credit as with cash -- so that
it could become cost-effective to bill a nickel or dime
electronically, Negroponte said.
</P>
<P>
Microcash transactions "will change consumer behavior
enormously," said the expert, whose laboratory focuses exclusively
on the study and experimentation of future forms of human
communication, from entertainment to education.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, readers might be more willing to pay for content
if they only had to pay a few cents for each article that
interested them. Shopping for groceries and other necessities via
the Web might also become more common.
</P>
<P>
Internet commerce is already flexing its muscles, Negroponte
said. On one hand, it is giving consumers more power by broadening
their choices and letting them band together, for example, by
pooling car purchases to get a fleet discount. On the other, it's
killing off such traditional businesses as car dealerships,
department stores and bookstores, turning them into mere showrooms
to tempt online shoppers.
</P>
<P>
And it could wipe out jobs for all kinds of middlemen in the
retail and credit industries, such as accountants, data processors
and store clerks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Negroponte said that the future of Internet commerce will
depend on enterprise information technology users.
</P>
<P>
Internet could make cash obsolete. In a few years, he said,
even "walking around money" could become purely virtual.
</P>
<P>
The Media Lab at MIT is working on weaving computer circuits
into clothing, using the body's own electrical currents to
transmit information. Instead of getting money from an automated
teller machine by sticking a card in and getting printed pieces of
paper out, a consumer could just press his thumprint to the screen
to get the money downloaded to a computer in his shoe.

which has been raging continuously for one week in the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region's Greater Xing'an Range has entered a
crucial stage.
</P>
<P>
The fire is mainly raging on the eastern front, the
fire-fighting headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
Fire in north, south, and west fronts have been extinguished,
with three fires still raging in the east front. The firefighting
headquarters is concentrating its forces to wipe out the remaining
blazes.
</P>
<P>
Fires on the eastern front are difficult to deal with because
of complicated terrain and precipitous mountains. Strong wind made
the firefighting more arduous, and preparations for artificial
rainfall have been made.

<HEADLINE> Tung Encouraged by HK Employees Retraining Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) said Wednesday
that he was encouraged by the success rate of retrained employees
in finding new jobs during a visit to an employees retraining
center in Kowloon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a visit to the Choi Wan Retraining Center of
Hong Kong YWCA Employees Retraining Service in Choi Wan Estate,
Tung said he was encouraged to note that some 80 percent of
employees who took various retraining courses at the center had
been able to find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
"We often urge employees to take training and retraining
courses because we believe that the unemployed must never feel
discouraged and give up," he said.
</P>
<P>
While actively seeking jobs they must also seek to enhance
their competitiveness by acquiring new knowledge and skills, Tung
said. And the maintenance and enhancement of our competitiveness
is an on-going and long-term exercise, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that Hong Kong was going through a difficult period
of economic adjustment. He said that for many years, Hong Kong has
been experiencing high property prices, high inflation and
negative interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"These factors have seriously undermined our competitiveness
and will affect our economic vitality in the long run," Tung said.
It has reached a stage when adjustments are inevitable and the
Asian financial turmoil has sped up the process, he added.
</P>
<P>
"In view of uncertain external factors and the fact that Hong
Kong is going through a process of economic transformation, we can
anticipate that our economic growth will inevitably be slowing
down to some degree
over the next few quarters," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"We must be psychologically prepared that this situation will
last for some time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As the Chief Executive, I share the worries of the people. I
can guarantee that together with my colleagues, we will do our
best to assist people in tiding over this adjustment period," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Our economic fundamentals are undeniably sound and stable,"
Tung said. "All the favorable conditions in Hong Kong which have
underpinned our robust development in the past, such as our
prudent financial policy, low taxation, sound financial and
banking regulation, first-rate infrastructural facilities are
still there and unaffected by external factors."
</P>
<P>
He added that Hong Kong's inflation rate was at its lowest in
many years and was on a downward trend.
</P>
<P>
Together with the decline in wage levels and property prices,
this would contribute to lower operating costs for businesses and
thus increase competitiveness, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government had introduced a number of fiscal measures in
the 1998/1999 Budget to stimulate the economy, he added. "The
drastic tax reductions and increases in public expenditure
together amount to about 52 billion HK dollars (6.67 billion U.S.
dollars), or four percent of our GDP. A high ratio as such is
rarely seen elsewhere," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government had made concerted efforts to assist job
seekers. "Infrastructural projects, the coming into operation of
the new airport and government departments together will provide
some 30,000 new jobs over the next one to two years," he said.

ZHANGJIAKOU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- This important city of north
China's Hebei Province, in an area hit by a serious earthquake
early this year, has started to carry out a project to dig over
10,000 wells for its drought-haunted four counties on the plateau
area.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at providing enough water for drinking and

The four counties will have 1,030,000 farmers by the end of
this century, each of whom will have 0.06 ha of irrigated land,
with the per unit yield expected to rise four folds then, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
The local government will introduce spray irrigation on a total

MOSCOW, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
called on the new Russian government Wednesday to work as a single
team, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to introduce new government members in
the Kremlin, Yeltsin said the new government of Russia is not a
coalition and should work as a single team.
</P>
<P>
He also urged government members to work strictly within the
budget and consider only the proposals envisioned by the federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
On his reason for dismissing the former Chernomyrdin
government, Yeltsin said that it had become inert.
</P>
<P>
"The chairman, on one hand, was too assertive, and on the other
hand, he wanted to coordinate everything with the president," he
said. "This is the big difference of the current government."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he is satisfied with the government and it has
been given more power.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that although younger people comprise the
majority of the new government, the key posts have been retained
by experienced officials "who work excellently and deal with
issues."

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Quake-Stricken Area to Move into New Houses Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHANGJIAKOU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in the
earthquake-hit areas in north China's Hebei Province are
expected to move into new houses by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
The construction of new houses is going on in a "smooth and
planned way", Deputy Mayor Chen Gui of Zhangjiakou city said in a
briefing here today for an inspection team of project officials
of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Chinese
Civil Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said that up to May 11, the construction of houses with
a total of 54,851 rooms for the local homeless has been going on
including the shells of 16,236 rooms erected, 11,983 rooms
completed and 901 rooms renovated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 43 schools are under construction, with the
foundations of 41 schools completed, the shells of two erected and
12 under renovation.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the reconstruction of two rural clinics is under way
and another three are being renovated.
</P>
<P>
In Zhangbei county, which was seriously hit by the earthquake
in January, new villages have sprung up, but many of the houses
are still unfinished, and local farmers are still living in tents
and huts.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that local farmers mainly rely on themselves in
restoring their villages, although financial subsidies from the
local government are available.
</P>
<P>
However, the farmers there are poor and the situation has been
worsened by last year's drought. They have found themselves short
of 36.96 million yuan (about 4.6 million US dollars) for the
reconstruction of their houses.
</P>
<P>
Although the disaster relief work is very difficult, the
Chinese government has been "efficient and prompt" in organizing
the relief activities, with good results, said Lena Lindberg,
deputy representative of the UNDP's Beijing Office, after an
on-the-spot inspection.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale hit Zhangbei,
Shangyi and some other counties in Zhangjiakou on January 10 this
year, causing serious injuries and damages, and disrupting the
lives of over 540,000 local people.

<HEADLINE> Chirac, Jospin Call for Truce to RPR-Socialist Duel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
called for a truce between the Gaullist Rally for the Republic
(RPR) and Socialists over a dispute on alleged salary fraud in the
municipal government of Paris during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting held in the Elysee, Chirac and Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin expressed their concern about the "comments that
risk troubling the political life of France at the expense of
democracy," said officials of the presidential office.
</P>
<P>
Jospin asked his cabinet members to stop making comments on the
revelation that 200 "imaginary jobs" were created in the 1980s by
the Paris city government.
</P>
<P>
These non-existent jobs cost about 100 million francs (about 20
million U.S. dollars, at the rate of exchange at that time) from
the state budget, said George Quemar, former chief of staff of the
Paris City Hall under Chirac, who was mayor of Paris until 1995.
</P>
<P>
Quemar made the revelation to the "Parisien" daily on Monday,
the same day the wife of the mayor of Paris, Xavier Tiberi, was
detained for eight hours and questioned by judicial police on
another alleged salary fraud.
</P>
<P>
She was accused of receiving hundreds of thousands of francs
in wages from the regional parliament of Essonne, controlled by
the RPR, in which she held no formal job.
</P>
<P>
Paris Mayor Jean Tiberi furiously condemned the detention of
his wife, while the RPR cried a conspiracy against President
Chirac and pointed their fingers at the Socialists.
</P>
<P>
RPR deputies in the National Assembly Tuesday counter-attacked
by charging the foreign ministry under the Socialist President
Francois Mitterrand, in which Jospin served as secretary general,
of also creating "imaginary jobs."

<HEADLINE> UNEP to Be Revitalized as UN Environmental Voice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official Wednesday
called for a new United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) for a
new millennium which will become "the voice of the United Nations
in environmental policy".
</P>
<P>
Opening a special session of UNEP's Governing Council here,
UNEP Executive Director Klaus Topfer said in a policy statement
that UNEP must be revitalized as the environmental voice of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP chief told the three-day meeting that "We need a new
UNEP" which would be empowered to serve the international
community in defense of the global environment and make
sustainable development a reality.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was a millennial challenge "we must take up
today" to safeguard the environmental sustainability of the
planet and ensure environmental security for next generations.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting which was designed to discuss the future of
UNEP, Topfer said that UNEP would bring emerging environmental
issues to the attention of the global community, and strengthen
the link among science, management and policy.
</P>
<P>
In the spirit of the Nairobi Declaration adopted at the 19th
session of the UNEP Governing Council last year, he pointed out,
UNEP which was set up 25 years ago is to be the leading global
environmental authority.
</P>
<P>
UNEP will set the global environmental agenda, promote the
coherent implementation of the environmental dimension of
sustainable development within the U.N. system and serve as an
authoritative advocate for the global environment, he added.
</P>
<P>
In order to implement the Nairobi Declaration, Topfer, a
German, who began his four-year term as UNEP Executive Director
on February 1 this year, proposed four areas of concentration for
UNEP activities in the short and medium term.
</P>
<P>
The four areas are as follows: development of an emergency
response capacity and strengthening of early warning and
assessment functions; coordination and development of
environmental policy instruments; fresh water; and industry and
technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of technology transfer, the UNEP chief said that
"our focus will be on providing capacity building and support to
small and medium sized enterprises in developing countries by
improving their access to state-of-the-art clean technologies."
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here Wednesday said that last week
Group-8 foreign ministers pledged their support to the new UNEP
Executive Director and looked forward to a revitalized role for
UNEP as the leading global environment authority.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session, Jose Gabaldon, Chairman of the 19th
session of the UNEP Governing Council, said that people witnessed
a period of the strong political revitalization of UNEP since the
19th session at which "the institution was undergoing a profound
crisis".
</P>
<P>
He attributed the restoration of optimism for UNEP's future
mainly to the approval of the Nairobi Declaration and the
appointment of Klaus Topfer as the new Executive Director.
</P>
<P>
Gabaldon from Venezuela stressed that the renewed optimism and
the restoration of a truly constructive climate are "the basis
for the process of revitalization of UNEP".
</P>
<P>
The UNEP Governing Council is mandated to assess the state of
the world environment, establish UNEP's program priorities and
approve UNEP budget, and is composed of 58 members elected by the
U.N. General Assembly for a four-year term.

<P>
ALMA-ATA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Kasymzhomart Tokayev, Kazakhstan's
foreign minister, said Wednesday that India is opposing world
disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation efforts by conducting
nuclear tests and building nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, Tokayev said the
nuclear tests will have an adverse impact on the regional
situation and put Kazakhstan, which has voluntarily discarded
nuclear weapons, under direct threat in the nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the 21st century, the international community is
once again faced with the threat of nuclear proliferation, which
will make the new century more insecure than the current one,
Tokayev said.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the world's governments to take concrete
measures to avert the nuclear threat posed by India's nuclear
tests.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece Hold Joint Air Defense Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Greece Wednesday began
their two-day joint air defense exercises code-named "Toxotis,"
semi-official Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Four Greek Air Force F-16 fighters flew twice Wednesday over
the recently completed military airbase of Paphos in Cyprus, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Greek warplanes left after attacking mock
sea targets in the area.
</P>
<P>
The military airbase, named after late Greek Premier Andreas
Papandreou who spearheaded a joint defense pack with Cyprus, is
situated near the western coastal town of Paphos.
</P>
<P>
The airbase was constructed within the framework of the joint
defense pact signed by the governments of Cyprus and Greece in
November 1993, under which Greece will provide military
assistance in case Cyprus is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has protested against the construction of the airbase,
which will be used by Greek air force planes.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has warned that if Greek
military aircraft use the airbase, their wings will be broken by
Turkish planes.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
aftermath of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained about 40,000 troops on the northern part
of the island, which was declared by Turkish Cypriots in 1983 as
a breakaway the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Minister's Statement on Salaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Public Service
Association (PSA) Wednesday described as unfortunate a statement
by a cabinet minister that the government has no obligation to
increase civil servants salaries.
</P>
<P>
PSA President Givemore Masongorere said Public Service, Labor
and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro should desist from
making such statements especially when collective bargaining
negotiations between the government and its workers had begun,
the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The PSA president was responding to a statement made by
Chitauro Tuesday which said the government was not obliged to
increase civil servants salaries in July since its financial year
has been shifted to end in December.
</P>
<P>
Masongorere said they had made their submissions to the
government on this year's salary increments considering the sharp
price hikes of basic commodities, the fall of the Zimbabwean
Dollar and the general economic hardships.
</P>
<P>
"If that is the way they (government) are going to respond
then the minister is undermining the forum which was set up by
the government itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was creating a volatile situation as
Chitauro's comments agitated workers.
</P>
<P>
"The change in the financial year has nothing to do with price
increases, economic hardships and the erosion of workers' buying
power," he said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations were also underway with civil servants
representatives asking for a cost of living adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants last year received a 10 percent salary
increment after a series of strikes.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Golkar Faction in Parliament Agrees to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Golkar's (ruling
party) parliament faction Wednesday agreed to hold a special
session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) as soon as
possible in a bid to meet the demand for reforms.
</P>
<P>
Golkar's parliament faction chief Irsyad Sudiro said at the
parliament after a three-hour meeting that his faction had decided
on five alternatives to meet the demand for reforms in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Four of the five alternatives required holding a special
meeting of the MPR and President Soeharto and Vice President
Habibie to resign. The fifth alternative was to accept Soeharto's
proposal for fresh elections in which he would not be a candidate,
and his reform program.
</P>
<P>
He said the Golkar proposed that the special meeting could be
held on June 8.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Development Party's (PPP) parliament
faction said it is consistent that President Soeharto should
resign before conducting total reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
PPP's faction chief Bachtiar Chamsyah said that PPP's stand is
still consistent that President Soeharto should resign immediately
for the start of the reforms.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, President Soeharto proposed to hold a new general
election as early as possible and then convene a meeting of MPR to
elect the president. He also said he will no longer become
candidate for the future president.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Minister/Secretary General Saadilah Mursyid
said the president will announce the formation of a council of
reforms on Thursday as well as the reform program to be launched.

<HEADLINE> Entrepreneurs Donate 200,000 Yuan for Tibet Snow Disaster Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Two entrepreneurs today donated
200,000 yuan (about 25,000 US dollars) for the victims of the snow
disasters which have hit the Nagqu and Ari regions of the Tibet
Autonomous Region since last September.
</P>
<P>
The donation, the biggest ever made by individuals for the
victims, was made by Liu Bangcheng, director of the board of the
Tibet Tai Gong Group, and Dagwa Dundrub, a tibetan who is director
of the board of the Tibet Dashi Industrial and Trade Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The Tai Gong Group has been actively participating in public
welfare activities in recent years, donating 3.3 million yuan for
building schools, constructing highways and purchasing disaster
relief materials over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The prefectures of Nagqu, Ari, Xigaze and Shanna have been hit
by heavy snowstorms since last September. By mid-December new
snowfalls along the Himalayas cut communications between a number
of counties, towns and villages in these four prefectures, where
400,000 people and large number of livestock live.
</P>
<P>
It may take four or five years for some of the worst-hit areas,
where large numbers of livestock have frozen or starved to death,
to recover from the disasters.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March this year the Tibet Autonomous Regional
Government had allocated nearly 60 million yuan for relief
efforts, and production activities are being restored in the
disaster-hit areas.

NEW DELHI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee claimed Wednesday that India was "forced to conduct nuclear
tests" to show its strength
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during his visit to the site where India
conducted five nuclear tests in 48 hours last week.
</P>
<P>
India was strongly condemned by the international community
after it conducted the nuclear tests on May 11 and May 13.
</P>
<P>
Before and during its nuclear tests, India alleged that China
was its main threat and the major reason for its decision to go
nuclear.
</P>
<P>
China refuted the allegations, pointing out that the driving
force behind the nuclear tests is India's desire to seek hegemony
in South Asia.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Agricultural Production Down Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The output of the Philippines'
agriculture sector declined by 3.16 percent in the first quarter
this year from a year earlier, Agriculture Secretary Salvador
Escudero said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report submitted to President Fidel Ramos, Escudero said
the decline in the volume of agricultural production was a result
of the sharp drop of production in the crops subsector because of
the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The gross value of the sector's production amounted to 132.6
billion pesos (3.4 billion U.S. dollars) at current prices and was
up by merely 0.11 percent from the 1997 level.
</P>
<P>
Reeling from the full impact of the disastrous El Nino
phenomenon, the crops subsector posted a 7.82 percent reduction in
production.
</P>
<P>
But Escudero said if the government had not taken measures to
mitigate the impact of the El Nino-caused severe drought, the crop
production would have declined further.

The departments concerned have actively publicized the state
laws and regulations on environmental protection in Tibet in
recent years. At the same time, they regularly mount campaigns to
clean up the garbage left there by visitors.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Wednesday that European Union scientists have approved a new
strain of genetically modified maize, which was developed by a
U.S. firm called Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
The approval allows the commission, the executive body of the
15-nation union, to draft a proposal for further consideration by
scientists to determine whether the genetically modified product
is safe for human consumption and for the environment.
</P>
<P>
EU scientists also approved a genetically modified rapeseed
variety developed by a German company called Genetic Plant Systems.
</P>
<P>
The EU scientific steering committee said it has concluded that
there is no evidence to indicate that marketing these two products
would cause adverse effects to human health or the environment,
the commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
EU ministers agreed last month to allow three kinds of
genetically-modified and high-yield corns to be marketed, but
their final clearance has been delayed by France, where there is
widespread consumer concern.
</P>
<P>
The United States warned on Tuesday that there could be serious
trade repercussions should there be further delays or a boycott of
genetically-modified maize scheduled for import to EU member
states.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran confiscated a total of 4,311
kilograms of narcotics during the past two weeks in the
northeastern province of Khorasan, a security forces official
announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, commander
of the provincial security forces Bahram Nowruzi said that the

smuggling rings, killing six smugglers, wounding three and
arresting 48 others during armed clashes with the rings, adding

and 63 vehicles used by the smugglers were also seized.
</P>
<P>
Nowruzi said that two Iranian security officers were killed

kilograms of opium or 30 grams of heroin.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A month-long '98 Fuzhou
International Investment Promotion Fair, an annual event for
attracting overseas investment for domestic projects, started
today in this port city in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, seven agreements on projects worth 370
million US dollars were inked, including five contracts
totaling 100 million dollars in contractual investment.
</P>
<P>
Total transactions at the fair will be at least as high as last
year's, according to an official forecast.
</P>
<P>
This year's event, which coincides with the city's 2,200th
founding anniversary, has welcomed officials from 12 foreign
embassies in China and over 100 consortiums from 38 countries and
regions, as well as more than 50 organizations of overseas Chinese
and delegates from other provinces and cities in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, and Chen Mingyi, the provincial party
secretary, attended the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Activities to be staged during the month are the International
Investment Promotion Expo, China Inventory Product Trade
Show, Sino-British Trade Promotion Symposium, Asian Economy
Discussion, and Taiwan-Fujian Agro-Tech Exchange and Cooperation
Workshop.
</P>
<P>
At today's Real Estate Investment Promotion Fair, 17 land plots
totalling 126 ha changed hands, worth 210 million US dollars. Of the

Today's largest real estate transaction of 64 million yuan
(about 7.7 million US dollars) was made by the Fuzhou Henderson Land
Development Co. for a commercial housing project on 1.5 ha of
land.
</P>
<P>
Since the Fuzhou investment promotion fair was first held in
1994, it has become one of the largest of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou, capital of Fujian province, has felt little
impact from the Asian financial turmoil, with its number of
newly-approved overseas projects, contractual investment and
exports in the first four months increasing by 24 percent, 40
percent and 26.8 percent on an annual basis, respectively.

<HEADLINE> China's Unofficial Diplomacy Promising: CPAFFC Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China's unofficial diplomacy, an
important part of its overall diplomacy, will make an even greater
contribution to the enhancement of friendship and understanding
between China and the rest of the world under the new historical
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Qi Huaiyuan, president of the Chinese People's Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC), made the remark while
addressing its three-day seventh council meeting, which opened
today.
</P>
<P>
The term of the seventh council is from 1998 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
The CPAFFC is one of China's unofficial diplomatic
organizations; it was established in 1954, when unofficial
diplomacy played a major role in setting up contacts and promoting
normalization of relations between China and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Qi said that unofficial diplomacy still has an important role
to play in promoting understanding among people around the world
due to their different social systems, ideologies and historical
backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
He added that non-governmental exchanges enable the people of
different countries to lay the basis on a people-to-people level
for friendship between China and other countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the CPAFFC will expand areas of unofficial
diplomacy by advancing economic cooperation between China and
other countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The CPAFFC has made new progress in working for the
implementation of official diplomacy, enhancing friendship between
the Chinese people and people in other countries, serving as a
bridge for economic cooperation between relevant Chinese
departments and their foreign counterparts, establishing
sister-city relationships and promoting non-governmental cultural
exchanges over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
The CPAFFC has so far established cooperative relations with
364 unofficial organizations in 115 countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 821 pairs of sister-city relationships have been
established between Chinese provinces or cities and their foreign
counterparts.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Wednesday promised that he will update his security
cabinet with the latest developments of his talks with the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the promise during the weekly cabinet meeting
after National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon protested
against his recent covered talks with U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Israel Radio, Netanyahu said he will
brief Sharon and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, both members
of security cabinet, on the latest developments of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The four-member security cabinet, or "kitchen cabinet," also
includes Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister pledged that if there was some progress in
the coming days, he would convene another cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sharon has accused Netanyahu of keeping the ministers in the
dark over his negotiations with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
He also charged that Netanyahu had agreed to yield more than 9
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in the second Israeli
troop redeployment, which he said would endanger the security
interests of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu wrapped up his five-day visit in the U.S. on Monday,
during which he held several rounds of talks with Albright and the
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross on the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has denied reports that he had accepted the 13
percent withdrawal proposed by the U.S., indicating that he had
presented some "new ideas" to the U.S. which he expected would
advance the stalled negotiations with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Enterprises' Role Stressed in Helping Laid-Off Workers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- To ease the growing pressure on
employment and social security, the Chinese government has
required state-owned enterprises to show greater concern and do
more things for their own laid-off workers, instead of leaving
them to the care of the government and society.
</P>
<P>
"Re-employment centers or similar bodies must be set up in
every enterprise that has laid off employees, to take due
responsibility for the laid-off workers," Premier Zhu Rongji said.
</P>
<P>
China currently has about 10 million laid-off workers, nearly
70 percent of whom are said to be ex-employees of loss-making
state enterprises. They lost their original jobs in the reform of
the state sector, which underlines raising efficiency through
shedding redundant workers, but they are still technically
employed by their original units.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the re-employment center in a state enterprise
should perform three major duties: pay allowances to workers laid
off by the enterprise to cover their basic living expenses; pay
pensions, unemployment subsidies, medicare and other social
insurance items; and train the laid-off workers for new employment
and help them to get new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts regard the first duty as the most important and
urgent one. "Only when their basic living standards are guaranteed
will the laid-off people feel safe and society as a whole remain
stable," one analyst said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that there are already over 1,700
re-employment centers in 111 cities that have taken the lead in
China's state enterprise reforms. Some of them were founded and
managed by enterprises, but others are run by an industrial sector
or by the local government.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that at present some 89 percent of
workers laid off from the state sector are not registered at any
re-employment center, and more than half of them have failed to
receive allowances for their basic living expenses.

<HEADLINE> More Cross-Straits News Exchanges Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A leading official with the
Information Bureau of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council today pledged that the Chinese mainland will, as always,
actively boost news exchanges across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, the official said the media organs
on both sides share the responsibility of increasing understanding
with each other, and news exchanges help to achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, over 3,000 Taiwan journalists had
come to the mainland to cover news, while more than 100 mainland
journalists had gone to the island province.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that the mainland has always adopted a
positive attitude and tried to offer convenience to Taiwan
journalists for their news coverage on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council issued a
regulation governing news coverage by Taiwan journalists on
the mainland on December 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The regulation, which went into effect January 1, 1997,
greatly simplified procedures and shortened the time for Taiwan
journalists to apply to cover news on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
In the first year after the implementation of the regulation,
the Taiwan affairs offices of 12 provinces and municipalities that
were authorized by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council
had given approval to 218 trips by Taiwan journalists in 54 groups
to cover news on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council also organized
14 Taiwan journalists from 10 press organizations on the island to
cover news in the Yangtze Delta last year.
</P>
<P>
The official releaved that the Information Bureau of the Taiwan
Affairs Office of the State Council plans to organize some Taiwan
journalists to cover news along the Nanning-Kunming Railway in
southwest China in June, and areas around the Bohai Sea and the
Silk Road this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 1998 cross-straits news exchange symposium to be
held on the mainland is under preparation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed the hope that the Taiwan authorities
would take practical steps to lift barriers and offer more
convenience for mainland journalists to cover news on the
island.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that most Taiwan journalists have reported news
on the mainland with an objective and fair attitude. A few Taiwan
journalists, however, have distorted facts in their reports and
even violated the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, the mainland will still offer good services and
convenience in the case of reasonable requests by Taiwan
journalists, and welcomes more Taiwan journalists to come to the
mainland, he said.

<P>
Labor experts point out that the central government decision to
order enterprises to set up re-employment centers will help ensure
that all workers laid off from the state sector will enjoy
guaranteed basic living standards.
</P>
<P>
It also reflects the fact that the relationship between the
laid-off workers and their employers is not severed, they add.
</P>
<P>
"We must ensure that all workers laid off from state
enterprises, who lost their jobs due to the poor management of
their employers and haven't found new jobs yet, obtain allowances
for their basic living expenses and have their social insurance
fees paid before the end of this year," the premier vowed.
</P>
<P>
A recent plan unveiled by the central government also requires
state enterprises to contribute one third of the funds for
guaranteeing the basic living standards of their own laid-off
workers.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts estimate that, according to this plan, the
money an enterprise must pay for each worker it has laid off will
be no more than half of the average local salary.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they say, this money should be affordable for most
state enterprises and will not hamper the deepening of the reform
of the state sector.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu also promised that enterprises suffering heavy
losses and finding it difficult to pay the money will get
assistance from both the central and local governments.
</P>
<P>
Local economists hold that sending laid-off workers to
re-employment centers is a transitional method adopted by the
government under the current situation of an incomplete social
security system and an immature labor market.
</P>
<P>
"The government is simply demanding that enterprises shoulder
their due responsibilities; it is not asking them to take care of
their workers for the rest of their lives," an economist explained.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the government would take various measures to
prompt the laid-off workers to find new jobs and cut their
relationship with their former employers as soon as possible, to
relieve the burden on both the enterprises and the state.

<HEADLINE> Blatter Woos African Vote in FIFA Chief Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Former FIFA secretary-general
Sepp Blatter on Tuesday asked African countries to support him in
his Presidency running of the world soccer ruling body.
</P>
<P>
At a farewell party Tuesday night for the South African
national soccer team who is to depart for the World Cup finals in
France, Blatter bluntly called on the Confederation of African
Football (CAF) not to back his rival, European Football
Association (EUFA) soccer boss Lennart Johansson.
</P>
<P>
Blatter, who stepped down as secretary-general of FIFA recently
to bid to succeed Brazilian octogenarian Joao Havelange, arrived
in Johannesburg on Tuesday to launch the African leg of his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said he had Africa's support for the FIFA hot-seat.
</P>
<P>
"All the top African countries have supported my campaign.
Havelange and myself have been striving to get unity in the family of
FIFA," Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
The CAF officially supports Johansson, who had helped Africa to
secure two extra places at the 1998 World Cup. But each African
national association will vote secretly in Paris on June 8 and it is
expected that many countries would back Blatter.
</P>
<P>
Blatter made it clear once elected he would back South Africa's bid
to host the World Cup in 2006.
</P>
<P>
"The game is not for the elite, but for everybody and that is one
reason why I am supporting South Africa's bid. It is time Africa
hosted the World Cup," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a school of thought among certain quarters in
FIFA that the 2006 World Cup be staged in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"But I want it to go to Africa. South Africa, Morocco and Nigeria
are countries who have the infrastructure to stage it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Johansson, however, was not enthusiastic about staging the finals
in Africa and wanted it to stay in Europe. "Do not elect a man who has
promised the world cup to Germany," Blatter advised his South Africa
hosts.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Britain are bidding to host the 2006 World Cup, while
Argentina and Brazil could also throw their hats into the ring.
</P>
<P>
South African Football Association (SAFA) Chief Executive Danny
Jordaan said they were pleased with Blatter's support.
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted that a senior member of FIFA has come out in
support of our bid. It is reassuring to get such a positive response
from him," Jordaan said, noting that Blatter is the only one who has
come out clearly in support of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
But Jordaan, who stopped short of making a commitment on the issue,
said CAF would make its position clear at its caucus meeting in Paris
on June 5. "It is too early to say," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blatter leaves for Nairobi on Wednesday on his next stop on his
campaign to lobby the Kenyan vote.

<HEADLINE> Germany Reports Strong First Quarter Export Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany's exports surged to a record
high of 235 billion marks (132 billion U.S. dollars) in the first
quarter of the year, up 15.9 percent from the same period in 1997,
the German federal statistics office in Wiesbaden said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics also claim Germany's first quarter
imports grew by 12.9 percent to 204 billion marks (115 billion
dollars), leading to an accumulated trade surplus of 31 billion
marks (17.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1997, the trade surplus was 22.1
billion marks (12.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The continued export boom also helped Germany trim its first
quarter current account deficit to 4.5 billion marks (2.5 billion
dollars), down from 9.9 billion marks (5.6 billion dollars) a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
In March, Germany's exports reached 83.9 billion marks (47
billion dollars), up 19 percent from the same month last year.
Imports also grew by 15.6 percent to 70.9 billion marks (39.8
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> NATO Considers Plan to Send Troops to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The NATO's military authorities
are considering a plan to send 7,000 to 20,000 troops to Albania
to guard its northern border.
</P>
<P>
It is one of many security options the Western military
alliance has been studying for the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The plans outline minimum, intermediary and maximum measures of
protection needed in Albania and Macedonia, both bordering
Yugoslavia's southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Other measures being considered include organizing maneuvers in
Albania, supplying the Albanian army with transportation and
communication, and transforming a Macedonian training ground into
a permanent camp for troops of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
A NATO source said that Italy and several Scandinavian
countries had indicated that they would be ready to take part in a
NATO-led peace force in northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
European countries last year sent about 5,000 troops to Albania
under the Italian command to stabilize the country that was on the
brink of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The goal of a NATO-led peace force, the source said, is to
provide Albania and Macedonia with some measures to fend off the
spill-over of unrest that could flare up in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers are scheduled to meet on May 28 and 29
in Luxembourg for their semi-annual official meeting. They plan to
discuss the new strategic concept for the 16-nation alliance.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Embassy Denies Intention to Sever Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine embassy in Tehran on
Wednesday denied the reports that Buenos Aires would break off its
ties with Tehran within a few days.
</P>
<P>
The French Press Agency (AFP) and Radio France reported on
Tuesday that Daniel Castruccio, secretary for coordination and
institutional relations of the Argentine Foreign Ministry, said
that Buenos Aires can no longer maintain its ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Castruccio was quoted as saying that "ties between Buenos
Aires and Tehran could be severed today, tomorrow, within a week
or 15 days."
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted diplomats
from the Argentine embassy here as saying that the report was
incorrect and Castruccio himself has rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Argentine Foreign Ministry issued a statement,
asking Iran to recall its diplomats to Buenos Aires with the
exception of the Iranian charge d'affaires in a protest to the
alleged involvement of some Iranian diplomats in the 1994 bomb
blast in the Argentine capital.
</P>
<P>
In a retaliation, Iran announced on Saturday to reduce the
level of its economic ties with Argentina. Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi said on Tuesday that Tehran would recall
its charge d'affaires to Buenos Aires for consultation and would
reconsider relations with Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stressed that diplomatic relations must be based on
preservation of dignity and prestige as well as mutual respect,
but adding that the attitude of Argentine officials and their
unfounded charges against Iran are inconsistent with diplomatic
norms.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian national has offered some evidence to the Argentine
authorities to prove that some Iranian diplomats were involved in
the bomb blast in 1994 in a Jewish center in Buenos Aires, killing
88 people and injuring 159 others.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran repeatedly rejected the accusation, claiming that
the Iranian citizen was a "fraud" and his evidence had no
judicial value.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review Bright Prospects for China's Iron, Steel Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China's iron and steel industry is
currently undergoing intensive technological upgrading, and expects to
serve as a better pillar for the national economy soon.
</P>
<P>
The technological upgrading program focuses on optimizing product
structure, improving quality and increasing the supply of goods in
high demand.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say that in spite of some decline in the iron
and steel sector, this industry is not in decline on the whole.
</P>
<P>
China is accelerating industrialization, said Liu Yongchang,
director of the China Metallurgical Economic Development Research
Center, and the sectors of transportation, metallurgical
processing and shipbuilding are increasingly demanding both
quality and quantity of iron and steel production, he said.
</P>
<P>
The global trend of economic growth shows that iron and steel
production is saturated, and the focus is on quality improvement.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the annual iron and steel production worldwide
has been maintained at between 720 million tons and 760 million
tons. Major concern is drawn to manufacturing, developing and
trading high value-added products.
</P>
<P>
Although China became the world's largest steel producer in
1996, when it turned out 100 million tons of steel, the industry
has a long way to go in terms of product structure, technology and
per capita consumption.
</P>
<P>
According to Jin Lin, a specialist at a metallurgical
information center in Beijing, on one hand, many steel
products in high demand, such as plates, are in short supply and
of low quality; on the other, the supply of most products and
other non-technology-intensive goods far exceeds demand.

<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics show that most Chinese-made technology-intensive and
high value-added steel products satisfy less than half of the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
For example, Chinese-made steel plates for automobiles only
meet half of the market demand, and are not yet on the assembly
line for medium-level to luxury automobiles. China currently is
unable to manufacture specialized flat cold-rolled plates. The
domestic market share of domestically made plates for household
electrical appliances is a mere 13 percent; and that for
containers is 26.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
While China's annual steel production is over 100 million
tons, Jin pointed out, the per capita consumption is only 80
kg, or half of the world's average.
</P>
<P>
He said China's per capita steel consumption will be 70 percent
of the world's average when the country turns out 150 million tons
by the year 2010. And the two figures will not be equivalent until
China doubles its steel output in the 2020s.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jin said, the Chinese government has planned to invest
750 billion US dollars in the rest of the century on
infrastructural construction.
</P>
<P>
The total length of its railways in operation will increase to
70,000 km by 2002 from the current 65,000 km.
</P>
<P>
The real estate and automobile industries have much room for
development, Jin said, and will strongly promote the growth of the
iron and steel industry, especially in the production of high
value-added steel products.
</P>
<P>
In order to accelerate the improvement of quality and the
economic returns of the industry, China will phase out
open-hearth furnaces by 2000.
</P>
<P>
It plans to raise the continuous casting ratio by 20 percentage
points to 80 percent by the end of the century, and lower the
energy consumption per ton to 1.286 tons of standard coal.
</P>
<P>
China should make a major strategic shift in regard to its iron
and steel production layout, Jin suggested.
</P>
<P>
"China should consider setting up one or two modern large iron
and steel groups in the coastal areas, aside from phasing out some
enterprises, upgrading some, and expanding existing large groups
located along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River,
such as the Baoshan Iron and Steel Group," he elaborated.

<HEADLINE> Asset Management Company to be Set up in Malaysia to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia announced Wednesday
to set up an asset management company (AMC) to take over the
non-performing loans (NPLs) and assets of the nation's banks to
clean up their balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
Making the announcement at a news conference here, Malaysian
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said
that the move would give banks a clean slate and restore them to
health so that they would be in a position to disburse
badly-needed loans to help generate business activities and speed
up economic recovery and restore confidence.
</P>
<P>
Under the mechanism, banks would be able to write down the NPLs
and sell them to the AMC at depreciated values, which would manage
and try to maximize the recovery of the assets and thereafter sell
off the assets at market prices.
</P>
<P>
He said Bank Negara (State Bank), together with international
consultants, would come up with details of the operational
framework of the AMC.
</P>
<P>
The AMC would be managed by the local private sector and
international companies, but Anwar declined to reveal the identity
of the foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that it could be established as a national asset
management company or as the subsidiary of a banking institution.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the AMC was the result of a study by the
government on the experience of several countries such as the
U.S., Sweden, Spain, Japan and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Anwar made it clear that the move was not a bailout and said
that Malaysian banks were resilient and sound.
</P>
<P>
He said the AMC would revive the assets and sell them later at
the highest price possible and it would operate without
intervention from the government.
</P>
<P>
"The Treasury and Bank Negara are not in the position to
dictate AMC's operation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The AMC would be spearheaded by the private sector and its
existence is temporary as the ultimate objective would be to end
its operations after it sells out all assets taken from the
banking institutions, Anwar said, adding "We would not
discriminate neither will we favor any company."
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the formation of AMC was to centralize the process
as the government recognizes that the problem faced by companies
now was not totally due to poor management.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis was beyond the projection of these
companies, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the government expects to firm up details of the AMC in
two weeks' time but no exact date has been fixed for the AMC to
start operations.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that although banks would now be able to focus on
loan disbursements after the setting up of the AMC, the credit
growth target of 15 percent this year would not be reviewed
upwards.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the Malaysian economy was forecast to receive the
full impact of the various measures and policies in the first half
of the year taken in view of the tough economic environment, which
included the austerity measures announced in the 1998 Budget last
October, the cutback in the expenditure in December and the
stabilization measures to consolidate the financial sector
announced in March this year.

<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign
trade and economic co-operation, called for optimization in both
the export and foreign investment structures at a national
conference held by the ministry here today.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that, to improve the structure of exports,
greater emphasis should be put on the quality of export
commodities.
</P>
<P>
The portion of high value-added and high-tech commodities as
well as of complete sets of equipment which are exported should be
increased, the quality of traditional export goods should be
upgraded and new brand names be fostered, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The scope of foreign investment should be expanded, and
guidance should be given to direct investment to those projects
encouraged by the government, especially in the central and
western parts of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's foreign trade volume amounted to
about 97.5 billion US dollars-worth in the first four months of
this year, up 7.9 percent over the corresponding period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The country has approved the setting up of 5,704 foreign-funded
enterprises this year, involving 13.6 billion US dollars in
foreign funds, of which 11.7 billion has been used.
</P>
<P>
Shi also called for exploration of both new markets and
traditional markets and proper use of foreign government loans.
</P>
<P>
Officials from both central and local government departments
attended today's meeting.

HONG KONG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of

David Lam, secretary for home affairs of the SAR, said that a
series of activities have been staged in the SAR to promote the

<HEADLINE> Iran's First Political Party Comes into Being </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly two decades after its Islamic
Revolution, there was born Iran's first political party, the
Constructive Executives of Iran (ECI), the Hamshahri daily
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a brief report, the paper said that the Interior Ministry's
Commission of Parties has given the permission to the formation of
the moderate ECI and its political activities. However, it did not
reveal when the permit was issued.
</P>
<P>
Another moderate daily Iran News on Wednesday hailed the birth
of the party, saying it would start its political activities "as a
full-fledged political party" with Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi as its secretary general.
</P>
<P>
This may indicate a breakthrough in Iran's politics because it
has been forbidden to form political parties. The ECI was evolved
from G-6, then a political group founded in 1996 by six moderate
technocrats including Karbaschi.
</P>
<P>
The other five are now Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance
Ataollah Mohajerani, Vice President for Executive Affairs Mohammad
Hashemi, Governor of the Central Bank of Iran Mohsen Nourbakhsh,
President of Iran's Physical Training Organization Mostafa Hashemi
Taba, and then Chairman of the Atomic Energy Organization Reza
Amrollahi.
</P>
<P>
Iran News said that three more important figures have joined
the group in order to form a political party.
</P>
<P>
The well-known G-6 played a significant role in the country's
fifth Majlis (parliament) elections in March 1996 and the
presidential election in May last year, and is still a strong
supporter of President Mohammad Khatami and former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Iran News said Rafsanjani, as a patron of the group, has had
"too much influence" on the technocrats although "he has always
been reluctant to identify himself with any particular political
group or line of thought."
</P>
<P>
However, Rafsanjani last month openly defended Karbaschi, who
was temporarily detained by the conservative judiciary on
embezzlement charges, signaling that he now wants to invest all
his political capital in a unified political party, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
With the formation of the ECI, Karbaschi, its secretary
general, will have more power to "deal with his detractors with
the full support of his party."
</P>
<P>
The new party is now "ready with a full hand to face the
serious challenge of the Karbaschi trial," the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Wu Yi Calls for More Exports, Better Use of Foreign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Wu Yi here today
urged the country to maintain a stable increase of exports and
better absorption of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
At a national conference held by the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation, Wu pointed out that to reach its
economic growth target of eight percent, China, apart from
expanding its domestic demand, should increase exports and use
more foreign investment, especially direct investment.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, she warned, the country's economic target, and even
the reform, opening-up and modernization construction, will suffer.
</P>
<P>
China's exports bear on the overall economic and social
development, the three-year reform target for state-owned
enterprises, the increase of job opportunities, social
stability and people's confidence in the trans-century
development plan, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
She called on local governments to pay special attention to
exports and try to create favorable conditions for their
development.
</P>
<P>
Wu affirmed the achievements made in the foreign economic and
trade sector in the first four months of this year, and urged
everyone involved in the economic and trade fields to take on
responsibilities and help realize the economic growth target.

<HEADLINE> S. African Soccer Team Can Match World's Best: Blatter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's soccer team
carries the African continent's hopes and has the ability to turn
the tables on the world's best sides in the World Cup, former FIFA
secretary-general Sepp Blatter said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of the game is to score goals and to do that you
must go forward," Blatter told a farewell function for the South
African national team, Bafana Bafana, in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
"Go, go, go for goals. The future is in your hands," said the Swiss
national, who arrived in South Africa Tuesday for a two-day trip to
lobby South African vote for his contest for FIFA presidency.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will face host nation France in Marseilles on June 12,
Denmark six days later at Toulouse, and Saudi Arabia on June 24 in
their group C matches.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa must aim to get to the second round, which is a
knockout round. If they reach that stage then anything can happen.
Everything is possible after that," Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
The top two countries in the eight groups in the 32-nation
tournament will advance to the last-16 knockout phase of the
competition, which kicks off on June 27.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Bafana's French coach, Blatter said: "Philippe
Troussier is a good coach and I believe South Africa has a good
chance of going through to the next round."
</P>
<P>
Blatter recently stood down as FIFA secretary-general to run
for the presidency of the world soccer controlling body and is
touring Africa to canvass for vote ahead of elections in Paris on
June 8.
</P>
<P>
European Football Association (EUFA) soccer boss Lennart
Johansson is opposing Blatter for outgoing President Joao
Havelange's post.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Bank to Adopt New Credit Management System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
(ABC), one of the country's top four banks, will soon adopt a
self-designed electronic credit management system, a move expected
to greatly improve the quality of the bank's credit assets.
</P>
<P>
The ABC will also unveil a set of guiding principles on loan
extension to help the bank's grass-root subsidiaries to make wiser
loaning decisions.
</P>
<P>
The guiding principles divide projects into three
types: projects to be supported with preferential loans; projects
to be supported with limited loans; and projects not to be
supported with loans.
</P>
<P>
"The guiding principles are intended to help improve the bank's
credit structure, and thereby benefit the country's economic
restructuring effort," a bank official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ABC has over the years established a
scientific management system for fixed-asset investment loans.
</P>
<P>
The ABC will increase its loans for fixed-asset investment by
15 billion yuan this year to contribute to the national objective
of an eight percent rise in the gross domestic product, which
makes it even more important to manage loans scientifically.
</P>
<P>
China phased out its decades-old credit quota system on January
1 this year, enabling the state-owned banks to make independent
loan decisions.

<HEADLINE> Construction Bank to Issue More Housing Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Construction Bank, one of the
country's big-four banks, will extend loans to the greatest extent
possible to house buyers this year, a bank spokesmen said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The bank's pledge has come in response to a recent decision of
the People's Bank of China, the central bank, to expand the
customer bases of bank housing loans.
</P>
<P>
China has selected residential housing as a sector to help
boost overall economic growth. The country's gross domestic
product (GDP) grew 7.2 percent year-on-year in the first three
months and the official GDP growth target for 1998 is eight
percent.
</P>
<P>
To meet the increasing demand for housing loans, the
Construction Bank will simplify the procedure for applying for
loans, and promote the use of credit cards and savings cards, a
bank official said.
</P>
<P>
"We will take measures to provide our customers with better and
faster services," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Construction Bank drastically increased loans for house
buyers last year, with the yearly value hitting 15.9 billion yuan,
almost equal to the total amount for all of the previous years.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the bank's outstanding housing
loans totalled 18.7 billion yuan by the end of last year, which
translated into a market share of more than 70 percent.

<HEADLINE> ZCCM out of Zambia's Foreign Exchange Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's major supplier of foreign
exchange, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), was out of the
market over the weekend ending May 18, leading to a continued
steady nose diving of the value of the local currency Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
This was due to reduced Kwacha commitments for their wage bill
and local suppliers towards the month end, according to the
treasury newsletter of Barclays Bank Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Counter rates of major commercial banks were in the range of=
1,800 to 1,820 Kwacha and 1,850 Kwacha to 1,870 Kwacha for buying
and selling respectively against the Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of Kwacha has been going down steadily since
the slight stability when ZCCM pumped in 26 million dollars into
the market the week ending April 30.
</P>
<P>
The appreciation was short lived as it only lasted for six
working days. The 26 million Dollars went into the importation
of oil and maize.
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, the real stabilization might only come
from export oriented production and inflow of donor money from
Paris.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign exchange market needs a steady supply which is
not happening and the on-off injections from ZCCM would not help
the situation much," said an analyst.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Finishes Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
virtually steady Wednesday after its sharp and erratic moves in
the past two days.
</P>
<P>
However, dealers warned the currency would remain on shaky
ground while flash points existed in Asia, particularly Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market was relieved that Indonesia's crisis
had abated somewhat since President Soeharto's statement late
Tuesday offering fresh elections and indicating he would step
down.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation remains a potential drain on the
Australian currency and one that could flare up at any time with
negative connotations, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was trading at 62.53 U.S. cents at the
close compared with 62.55 U.S. cents at Tuesday night's close.
</P>
<P>
After bouncing off its lows of 62.20 U.S. cents, the unit spent
the best part of the day trading around 62.40 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Le, foreign exchange dealer with Bank of America, said
he was confident the Australian dollar could rise to 63 U.S. cents
but it was difficult to see it driving higher while the spotlight
remained on Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Japanese yen has weakened against the U.S. dollar and
commodity prices remained unimpressive, further undermining the
Australian unit.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 85.17 Japanese yen from 84.87 yen
previously.
</P>
<P>
Against the German mark, the Australian currency was trading at
1.1117 marks from 1.1146 marks.

SINGAPORE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Share prices rose mostly on the
Singapore market, while the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index (STII) continued to fall, losing another 4.84 points to
close at 1273.78 points on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that early gains were eroded by
lower-than-expected domestic trade figures for April that showed
the Singapore economy was feeling the effects of the regional
currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased to 177.67 million units,
valued at 299.18 million Singapore dollars ( 182.43 million U.S.
dollars). Advances overwhelmed declines by 231 to 94, while 268
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Telecom was the most actively traded counter as it
registered a turnover of 10.84 million units. It was followed by
RHB Capital warrrant99 which had 10.26 million units traded. ST
(Singapore Technologies) Engineering was next with 9.58 million
shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Rothmans200 led the gainers of the day as it rose by 40 cents
to finish at 12.6 Singapore dollars. UOB (United Overseas Bank)
and MAA increased by 35 cents each to end at 6.8 and 2.7 Singapore
dollars respectively. OCBC (Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation)
Foreign was up by 30 cents to close at seven Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Elec&AMP;E was the biggest loser as it declined by
50 cents to end at 5.1 Singapore dollars. Creative 50 and SPH
(Singapore Press Holdings) fell by 40 cents each to close at 30.9
and 14 Singapore dollars respectively. Jurong Shipyard and SIA

<HEADLINE> Foreign Companies to Explore Oil in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Four foreign companies have
won rights to explore petroleum in Tanzania, a country whose
industries depend heavily on imports of oil.
</P>
<P>
Dublin International Petroleum (T) Ltd., Songo Songo
Development, Antrim Resources (T) and Canop (T) Ltd. will explore
oil in blocks covering a total area of 40,000 square kilometers,
with annual licence fee priced at four US dollars per square
kilometers, "Financial Times" reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC), on
behalf of the government, has signed contracts with the
companies, with the contract term lasting four years, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Yete Mwalyego, TPDC's Director of Exploration and Production,
told the paper that the company believes Tanzania has vast oil
potential to tap. He cited areas with potential oil deposits as
Rukwa Basin, Usangu Basin in the Mbeya Region, Ruvu Basin in the
Coast Region and the deep sea outlying the coastal plains.
</P>
<P>
Mwalyego said the government is trying to attract foreign
petroleum investors by removing custom duty, sales tax and
excising duty on working equipment imported.
</P>
<P>
Corporate income tax will be charged on the firms only if they
discover and start exploiting petroleum deposits in their given
areas.
</P>
<P>
In case any deposits are sighted, the company responsible will
have its contract extended by four to 25 years, during which it
will be liable to pay all the necessary taxes.
</P>
<P>
The official also said five other foreign companies have
tendered applications for exploring petroleum, where TPDC will
designate blocks for their operations if the requests are
granted.
</P>
<P>
He named the companies as Tornado Resources Ltd, Tullow Oil
Plc, Gulf Western Mining, Dublin East Kilwa and Mnazi Bay
Development.
</P>
<P>
Heavy imports of oil is a major reason for the stark poverty
of Tanzania, whose external debt stands at eight billion US
Dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong remains to be a
comparatively good place to raise funds, particularly for those
Chinese enterprises seeking for overseas investment, an economist
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the negative impact of the Asia financial crisis, Hong
Kong is still fundamentally sound compared with neighboring
economies," said Dr. Wang Chunxin, an economist of Bank of China,
Hongkong-Macao Regional Office.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Dr.
Wang pointed out that Hong Kong, as an international financial
center, had stood the test of the financial storm. Hong Kong still
sits on hefty foreign exchange and fiscal reserves, and its
financial system is healthy and running in an orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
The economic adjustment this time has significantly brought
down the sky-high property prices and rents in Hong Kong, and
therefore helps to reduce costs of doing business here and enhance
Hong Kong's competitiveness, according to the economist. Besides,
Hong Kong has a well-developed financial market, which offers a
fair and efficient environment for investors and public companies.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wang stressed that Hong Kong would continue to benefit
from the rapid economic growth on the Chinese inland areas.
Beijing now is enlarging investment to stimulate internal demand,
furthering open-up to the outside world, and stepping up reforms
of state-owned enterprises. All these factors are very important
to maintain investors' confidence in the Hong Kong market, he
added.

<HEADLINE> S. African Army Probes Major Arms Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South African Defense
Ministry intended to set up a commission of inquiry to
investigate the massive theft of weapons from a military base at
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
A defense spokesman said Tuesday that Defense Minister Joe
Modise did not view the matter lightly as it could undermine the
country's security, and the commission would be announced as soon
as possible, Business Day paper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way that this government can take this matter
lying down," he said.
</P>
<P>
South African army spokesman Merle Meyer said an investigation
was already taking place under the commander of the 44 parachute
battalion, in central South Africa's Bloemfontein, where the arms
were stolen.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry followed the confirmed theft of 118 pieces of
equipment, including rocket launchers, mortars, machine guns and
even an armored personnel carrier. The theft, which is the
largest in the past five years, was discovered Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meyer said the thieves used professional implements as well as
cutting torches to gain access to the weapons, stored in a
guarded room in a restricted area.
</P>
<P>
Strict measures to prevent a recurrence of the theft are
already in place, he said.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said earlier that no one had been arrested
in connection with the break-in, and they were still
investigating the matter.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Defense Ministry said large quantities of
weapons were going missing.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, police uncovered an arms syndicate which
allegedly sold stolen defense force weapons to taxi hit-squads
and criminals. The weapons-- 11 AK-47 rifles and 168 9mm pistols
-- were stolen from a Pretoria arms manufacturing company and a
military arms store.

CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian long distance swimmer
Susie Maroney leaves Sydney Thursday to swim across the Gulf of
Mexico water from Mexico to Cuba later this month
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Maroney will fly to the Mexican resort city of
Cancun to prepare for a 233-kilometre crossing of the Yucatan
Channel to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Maroney will have to spend about 50 hours in the water, twice
as long as she did when she made the 172km crossing from Cuba to
Florida last year.
</P>
<P>
Her longest swim so far is an estimated 178km effort from Cuba
to the United States territorial waters in 1996. After being
driven off course by tropical storms Maroney left the water short
of land.
</P>
<P>
She returned in 1997 for the Cuba to the United States "land to
land" attempt, covering the 172kms in 24 hours, 31 minutes to
become the only person to swim non-stop across the Straits of
Florida.
</P>

English Channel and holds the Guinness Book record for the longest
distance swum in 24 hours -- 93.6km in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Syria Supports Egyptian-French Call for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Syria's ruling party has announced
its support for the joint appeal by presidents of Egypt and France
to convene an international conference in an effort to save the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The "Al Baath" newspaper, organ of the ruling Baath party, said
in its editorial Wednesday the appeal underlines the fact that the
whole world is determined to spare no efforts to avert the
collapse of the process and to prevent Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu from setting the Middle East region on fire.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac and his Egyptian counterpart
Hosni Mubarak, who was on a visit to France, on Tuesday called for
the convocation of an international conference to revive the peace
process and for the establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The editorial called upon the international community to match
words with deeds, pointing out that it is no longer sufficient to
condemn Israel and denounce its intransigence.
</P>
<P>
"It has become imperative that effective means and formulas be
sought to compel Israel to abide by the U.N. Security Council
resolutions and the principles of international legitimacy," it
said.
</P>
<P>
It expressed confidence that the peace-loving forces all over
the world would relentlessly exert their efforts to save the peace
process and put it back on track.
</P>
<P>
The peace process on the Palestinian track has been deadlocked
for more than a year due to Israel's continuous settlement
activities in East Jerusalem and its overdue troop redeployments
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations between Israel and Syria and Lebanon, on the
other hand, have remained dormant since Israel's hardline
government of Netanyahu came to power some two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Company Spokesman Says Donation Was Just Falsehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China Aerospace Corp.(CASC) has
confirmed today that the recent American accusations of Liu
Chaoying's having made illegal donation to the Democratic Party in
1996 are based on sheer falsehood.
</P>
<P>
The statement came in responce to an article in the
U.S. newspaper Christian Science Monitor saying that a CASC
spokesman said that the campaign donation by Liu Chaoying was her
own act with her own money and not CASC funds.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that no CASC spokesman had ever discussed
the matter with the newspaper's reporters, and that the claim was
a fabrication and that he was indignant about this action which
clearly had other motives.
</P>
<P>
Liu is a vice-president of China Aerospace Int'l Holding Ltd.,
which has been claimed by some people in the United States and the
news media there to be affiliated with CASC. China Aerospace Int'l
Holdings is a holding company of CASC and is registered in
Hongkong and listed on the stock exchange there. It chiefly
manufactures and sells electronic products and communication
facilities.
</P>
<P>
An internal investigation found that none of CASC's members had
been involved in any way in political fund raising. Liu herself
stated clearly that the accusations are groundless and nothing but
rumor.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Tuesday, the spokesman also strongly condemned
these baseless reports by the U.S. news media for having damaged
the corporation's reputation.

<HEADLINE> China Warns Its Coastal Areas About Possible Ocean Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China's State Oceanography Bureau
has warned coastal areas of possibly frequent and severe disasters
this year.
</P>
<P>
Ye Renmiao, director of the Bureau's Ocean Monitoring
Department told a news conference in Beijing today that the bureau
has told coastal cities and provinces to keep a close eye on
forecasts and to take better precautions to prevent possible
losses from marine disasters.
</P>
<P>
Chinese oceanographers predict that the number of storms caused
by typhoons along the coast of China will increase in 1998,
compared with 1997, and that some big storms will hit southern
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
From June to October, areas along the East China Sea are
expected to have one or two storms and areas along the South China
Sea, two to three, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan will be the most heavily hit,
with Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai just behind.
</P>
<P>
Four storms hit the coast of China last year in August and
caused great damage in eastern China.
</P>
<P>
There are expected to be 230 days with waves at least 4 meters
high, which is less than usual. But the South China Sea will still
have more days with high waves caused by typhoons than it did in
1997, scientists predict.
</P>
<P>
There will be less ice in Bohai Bay and the northern Yellow Sea
from November of this year to March 1999 than in recent years,
scientists say.

<HEADLINE> China To Set up National AIDS Control Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China will set up an institute to
lead the fight against acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
this year.
</P>
<P>
The National Center for AIDS Prevention and Control will be in
charge of AIDS surveillance, epidemiological research, and
development of vaccines and drugs, according to the Chinese
Academy of Preventive Medicine, where it will be located.
</P>
<P>
The central government gave the greenlight to the idea in
February, when it decided to close down a number of state offices
and get rid of employees to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very positive gesture by the government, which
places great importance on controlling AIDS," says Wang Ke'an,
president of the academy.
</P>
<P>
The center has already been functioning in a limited way since
the Department of Epidemiology and the National AIDS Reference
Laboratory were established in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The epidemiology department is following the AIDS epidemic
while collecting and reporting national data, according to
Prof. Shao Yiming, director of the reference lab, who is involved
in establishing the center.
</P>
<P>
Shao's lab will continue to do tests on the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS virus, and research on
vaccines and drugs.
</P>
<P>
The center is a member of a global lab network of the Joint
United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Prof. Shao says.
</P>
<P>
Two new departments are designed for clinical research on HIV
drugs and health education, and reducing high-risk behavior like
prostitution and drug use, he says.
</P>
<P>
The center's 50 members will grow to 120 by the year 2000, if
the plan goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
There is an urgent need for such an institute because the AIDS
epidemic is on the verge of an outbreak in China, Shao says. The
Ministry of Health has announced that there were 9,970 documented
HIV/AIDS cases by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
But AIDS experts have estimated that the actual HIV/AIDS figure
in China may reach 200,000 or more.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Recall Charge D'affaires from Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has announced that Tehran would recall its charge
d'affaires to Argentina Abdulrahim Sadatifar for consultation.
</P>
<P>
Irans' official news agency IRNA Wednesday quoted Kharrazi as
saying that Tehran would reconsider its relations with the south
American country.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Buenos Aires recalled all its diplomats
except the charge d'affaires and asked Tehran to do the same. It
was reported that Iran's political secretary and three
administrative secretaries have left Buenos Aires on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
IRNA did not say when Sadatifar, the only diplomat who remained
behind, will leave Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, who is in Colombia for a ministerial meeting of the
Non-Aligned Movement, said that diplomatic relations must be based
on preservation of dignity and prestige as well as mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Argentina have deteriorated since
Argentine rehashed accusations that Iranian diplomats were behind
two blasts in Buenos Aires which killed 114 people.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has vehemently denied it was involved in the bombings in
1992 and 1994 which damaged the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires
and a Jewish center there respectively, calling the allegations
"baseless."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said the attitude of Argentine officials and their
unfounded charges against Iran were inconsistent with diplomatic
norms.
</P>
<P>
Iran said it has presented evidence to Argentina to prove the
witness that offered information incriminating four Iranian
diplomats was a fraud.
</P>
<P>
Iran decided last Saturday to reduce its economic ties with
Argentina in response to Argentina's withdrawal of diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Gold Demand to Recover Over Rest of 1998: WGC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Gold Council (WGC) is
expecting a recovery in gold demand for the remainder of 1998
after the precious metal was heavily sold by South Koreans and
Indonesians in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
George Milling-Stanley, the WGC's gold market analysis manager
in New York, unveiled the gold trends report for the first quarter
of 1998 in Melbourne Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The flood of dishoarding that marred the first quarter
performance has dried up and demand has turned positive once more,
even in countries that were hit hardest by the devastating
economic and currency crisis in Asia," he was quoted by the
Australian Associated Press as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The prospects are good for a strong recovery in gold demand
during the remainder of the year."
</P>
<P>
The WGC, a gold marketing and lobby group, releases a gold
demand trends report each quarter.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of 1998, the Asian crisis triggered
large-scale sales of gold back to the market.
</P>
<P>
It led to a 55-percent decline in consumption from the first
quarter of 1997 to 342.1 tons in the countries monitored by the
WGC, Milling-Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans sold 250 tons of gold to various collecting
agencies as part of the "Save the Nation" campaign in which people
were encouraged to donate gold to help the country pay off
International Monetary Fund debt.
</P>
<P>
The Korean gold collection finished on March 14 and the
dishoarding from Asia has dried up, Milling-Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Indonesian private citizens sold off gold to pay for
the necessities of life, he said.
</P>
<P>
The demand picture in the first quarter was distorted by a
"supply-side phenomenon."
</P>
<P>
"Early reports from the region on developments in the second
quarter indicate that demand is turning strongly positive once
again ... there has been good demand in recent weeks as people
have begun to buy back the gold they sold," he said.
</P>
<P>
Milling-Stanley also said Wednesday that the gold market may be
"pleasantly surprised" by the amount of gold that the European
Central Bank (ECB) chose to retain as a percentage of its
reserves.
</P>
<P>
The 11 member states of the European Monetary Union held around
30 percent of their reserves in gold, around 14,000 tons, and the
market had been predicting that the ECB would only hold 15-20
percent of its reserves in gold.
</P>
<P>
The ECB is due to meet for the first time in June and
Milling-Stanley said he thought it would be three to six months
before it reveals what percentage of reserves it would be held in
gold.
</P>
<P>
The gold bullion price fell to 297.6 U.S. dollars per ounce at
the close of trade in Sydney Wednesday, compared to Tuesday's
close of 298.5 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese Province Reinforcing Qiantang River Dyke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A five-year project on a Qiantang
River dyke started on Tuesday in China's Zhejiang province to
reinforce it at a cost of 560 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
It will mean the dyke will be able to withstand the types of
floods that occur every one hundred years or a force-12 wind.
</P>
<P>
The 336-km dyke was first built during the Tang Dynasty
(618-907) and over the past thousand years has collapsed 227
times, nearly allowing the river to overflow once every five years.
</P>
<P>
The dyke is important for protecting Hangjia Lake and the
Xiaoshao Plain along the lower reaches of the river from
flooding. The GDP of the area that it helps protect accounts for
40 percent of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
And, having suffered so many assaults for hundreds of years,
the dyke is now getting precarious in many places, and some
sections could not handle the battering they get even every 20
years.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Praises China's Nuclear Stance, Condemns India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad on Wednesday described China's stance on the
nuclear issue as "mature and highly responsible."
</P>
<P>
He said it was "in sharp contrast to the irresponsible stance
of India."
</P>
<P>
"As you know, China is the only nuclear weapon state which has
repeatedly and authoritatively stated that it will never under any
circumstances be the first to use nuclear weapons," Shamshad told
reporters upon his arrival at the Islamabad airport after
concluding a two-day visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"This mature and highly responsible approach to issues of
international peace and security by China stands in sharp contrast
to the irresponsible statements emanating from the Indian
leadership, threatening the use of nuclear weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China, as a permanent member of the United Nations
Security Council, a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
and signatory to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has
always advocated international peace and security and nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
"There was a complete identity of views between Pakistan and
China on the gravity of the situation which had resulted from
India's reckless actions and fictitious threat from China,
invented by India as a pretext to promote its own hegemonic
designs and aggressive agenda in South Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has already condemned in the strongest
terms the outrageous actions of the Indian government to introduce
nuclear weapons in South Asia which has destabilized the strategic
balance in our region."
</P>
<P>
"Our consultations with China are indeed an important facet of
our wider consultations with all major powers as well as friendly
countries to seek ways and means to effectively defuse tension and
reduce the factors that have threatened peace and stability in our
region," he said.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Said to Sneak Into Colombo for Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Two squads of Tamil rebels have
sneaked into the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo to carry out
suicidal bomb explosions in the city, police sources here said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the information was gathered by police
intelligence based in Trincomalee while listening to a radio
transmission from a camp of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) to a Sea Tiger base in Trincomalee in the country's Eastern
Province.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have arrived at two places code-named Palea and
Maligawain in the capital city. Police intelligence believes that
these two places could be two important buildings in the city, the
sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Security in the capital has been tightened amid fears of LTTE
bomb attacks. There was at least one bomb attack every month in
and around the capital and other key towns since the LTTE blasted
the business center of Colombo in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting against the government for a
separate state in the north and east since 1983. More than 55,000
people have been reportedly killed in fighting in the past 15
years.

<HEADLINE> Cook: EU to Give Financial Aid to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said that most European Union (EU) members have decided to
carry out their promises to provide financial aid to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cook, representing the EU, made the remark at a press
conference Tuesday night following talks with Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem. Britain is currently holding EU's rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
The EU aid, about 400 million U.S. dollars in sum, is supposed
to help Turkish products become more competitive on the European
market and compensate Turkey's losses stemming from a 1996 customs
agreement with the EU which removed most customs tariffs.
</P>
<P>
However, the aid was vetoed by EU member Greece, a longtime
rival of Turkey. The two neighbors have been at odds over Aegean
islets, territorial waters and airspace as well as the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the EU and Turkey became tense after the EU
decided last December to include Cyprus in, but exclude Turkey
from, its immediate enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
This came as bolt from the blue to Turkey, which has in the
past three decades dreamed, and made every effort, to be part of
Europe politically and economically. The EU, however, was
especially critical of Ankara's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that his short visit is aimed at mending the EU's
fences with Turkey, adding that the EU wants improved relations
not only in the economic field, but also in the political sphere.
</P>
<P>
He said "it's very clear that the Turkish government today
wants to use the funds promised by the 14 EU member states" and
Turkey is a "key partner" of the EU.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting between Cook and Cem, the two sides issued a
joint statement declaring they have agreed on the importance of
laying "a sound and sustainable foundation for a European strategy
to prepare Turkey for accession."
</P>
<P>
Cook had said he wanted to prepare ground for a meeting of the
EU-Turkey Association Council next Monday in Brussels to boost the
relationship between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that he told Cook that the EU should abandon its
discrimination policy against Turkey if it wants to mend the
fences with Ankara and resume talks.
</P>
<P>
Cook has ended his one-day visit and left here Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Welcomes Soeharto's Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said on Wednesday that he welcomes Indonesian President Soeharto's
decision to step down through a constitutional process.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome President Soeharto's announcement outlining what
appears to be his graceful exit from power through a
constitutional process," Ramos said in a statement issued by the
Presidential Press Desk.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the Philippines hailed the calling off of planned
massive demonstrations in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta
earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos appealed to all sectors of Indonesian society,
"particularly the military, the studentry and the opposition
groups, to exercise maximum restraint and to resolve differences."
</P>
<P>
"Resumption of violence can only make recovery more difficult,
and would certainly have serious effects on the economies of ASEAN
(the Association of Southeast Asian Nations), including the
Philippines," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also expressed appreciation to Indonesian authorities for
facilitating the departure of Filipinos, as well as to the
Philippine Airlines for providing additional flights and using
larger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, more than 1,100 Filipinos have returned to
Manila from Indonesia and many more are scheduled to arrive in the
next few days, according to Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is currently holding the rotating chairmanship
of the ASEAN which also groups Vietnam, Burma, Thailand, Laos,
Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Rises 52.6 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus in
April increased by 52.6 percent from a year earlier to 1,232
billion yen (about 9.4 billion U.S. dollars), the Japanese Finance
Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Japan's global exports in April marked the first decline in 33
months, reflecting the economic turmoil in Asian countries, but
the overall merchandise trade surplus continued rising, backed by
favorable economies in the United States and Europe, the ministry
said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The exports edged down by 1.7 percent to 4,351.6 billion yen
(about 33.2 billion dollars), while imports declined by 13.8
percent to 3,119.6 billion yen (about 23.8 billion dollars), said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The average foreign exchange rate used for the April report was
131.17 yen to one dollar, compared with 124.35 yen a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In trade with financially troubled Asian countries, Japan's
surplus totaled 377.5 billion yen (about 2.8 billion dollars),
down 27.7 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the region decreased by 18.1 percent to 1,552.4
billion yen (about 11.8 billion dollars) while imports from the
region also fell by 14.5 percent, to 1,174.9 billion yen (about
8.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus with the United States and the European
Union increased by 29.2 percent and 66.7 percent respectively from
a year earlier, to 586.0 billion yen (about 4.5 billion dollars)
and 380.6 billion yen (about 2.9 billion dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the overall trade data, a Japanese economist in
the private sector said exports to Asia would continue decreasing
for the time being as demands in the region are expected to remain
stagnant. But the trade surplus with the United States and Europe
would stay at high levels, mainly because of favorable auto
sales.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Share Prices Rise for Third Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices surged for the third
straight trading day in Tokyo Wednesday as players were convinced
the market had entered a short-term rebounding phase.
</P>
<P>
The key Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the
First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange added 101.30 points or
0.65 percent from Tuesday's close at finish of 15,652.95.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, gained 5.76 points or 0.47 percent, going to
1,225.62.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the major section went up to an estimated 430 million
shares from Tuesday's 330 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index began rising Tuesday, after Indonesian
President Suharto said he would not stand for the presidency after
parliamentary elections soon.
</P>
<P>
Traders said they began expecting the yen to gain against the
U.S. dollar in the near term, after the dollar hit a high of
136.80 yen overnight in New York trading.
</P>
<P>
Such expectations boosted the Nikkei index by more than 230
points in the morning, but the gain was later eroded by selling to
take profits, they said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,331 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
outnumbered losers 792 to 343, with 116 issues remaining
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Get French Loans on Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is expected to
get the lion's share of the 248 million Rand (49 million U.S.
Dollars) worth of new loans set aside by the French Development
Agency for countries of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The Agence Francaise de Developpement and Proparco, its
subsidiary, said Tuesday that 135 million Rand (26.7 million
Dollars) of its funds will be extended to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
A 125 million (28 million U.S.Dollars) credit line, the third
by the agency, will be given to the Development Bank of Southern
Africa, the Johannesburg-based bank.
</P>
<P>
The facility will be used for "partial funding of basic
infrastructure projects" in response to South Africa's needs,
Business Day paper Wednesday quoted the agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
A further 10 million Rand (2 million Dollars) will be used to
fund ecological projects in the Cape Peninsula park and aid small
South African companies.
</P>
<P>
Nampower, Namibia's electricity company, will receive 30
million Rand (5.9 million Dollars) in partial funding of the 400
kilovolt inter-connection line between South Africa and Windhoek,
which is expected to meet Namibia's power demand.
</P>

Zambia will get a 15 million Rand (3 million Dollars) credit
line as funding for the promotion of small and medium-sized

<HEADLINE> China Now Getting Model Workers From The Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Fan Riguang never thought he would
have the honor of being named a "model worker" because he employs
more than 300 people and is classified as a "private entrepreneur."
</P>
<P>
But, in fact he did get the honor along with 7 other private
entrepreneurs in east China's Shandong Province as the first group
from the private sector to do so since new China was founded in
1949.
</P>
<P>
In the past, only employees of state-owned or
collectively-owned enterprises and farmers were entitled to the
honor, but the 15th Party Congress last year changed all that to
encourage the development of the private economy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Shandong Provincial Federation of Trade
Unions agreed that private entrepreneurs who make an outstanding
contributions to the country and society have the right to be
chosen as "model workers".
</P>
<P>
Fan, 40, who has a kitchen utensil factory in Shandong, proudly
states, "I'm the one who has paid the most taxes in the
town. People say that I've made a big contribution to the country,
so they recommended me as a model worker." In fact, he has paid
more than four million yuan in taxes since 1991.
</P>
<P>
All this is encouraging, he says, because he used to hesitate
and be not bold enough in his business, but now, things are
different. Now he is dealing with Taiwanese businessmen and plans
to put 8 million yuan into his production line.
</P>
<P>
"The private economy has become an important part of the
society's productive forces and the rural economy, and a major
source of employment, so, private businessmen should enjoy the
same social status as state-owned enterprise employees," says Wang
Xinghai, director of the Shandong Trade Union Federation's
production and protection department.
</P>
<P>
The private sector now has more than a tenth of the total
number of people working in Shandong, according to official
figures.

<HEADLINE> Expert Sees Cancer Deaths Cut By Half in 30 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Deaths from cancer could be
halved during the next 30 years while a cure for the disease is
still just a dream, a leading United States cancer expert
predicted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason over time why we can't reduce cancer mortality
by half over a two or three decade time horizon," Dr. Allen
Lichter, newly elected president of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO), told reporters before the end of the
four-day ASCO annual conference here.
</P>
<P>
About 18,000 cancer specialists from around the world attended
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Cancer is second only to heart disease as a cause of death in
the United States. About 1.2 million Americans are diagnosed with
cancer each year and 50 percent of them die of it.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the National Cancer Institute reported a 2.5
percent drop in cancer mortality between 1990 and 1995 following
years of steadily increasing deaths from the disease.
</P>
<P>
An important factor behind the drop, Lichter said, is that
drugs used to combat the disease have been greatly improved in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
But, he said: "The concept of eradicating cancer, that is
taking the death rate from this disease to zero, is not easily
within our grasp."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said he had seen promising new drugs and
treatments for all types of cancer.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Inflation on Rise in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's annual inflation figure
has risen to 22.8 percent in April from the 18.8 percent at the
end of March, according to the latest fortnightly statistics
issued by Bank of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The Post newspaper Wednesday quoted the bank as saying that
the monthly inflation was 2.3 percent while the annual inflation
stood at 22.8 percent in April this year.
</P>
<P>
This, however, shows a rise in inflation despite the target to
reduce inflation by the close of the year to 16.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The situation is difficult to improve with the steady
depreciation of Zambian Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
The Kwacha has continued at a steady rate resulting from low
inflows of foreign exchange onto the market with no release from
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the major supplier, said
the latest weekly treasury newsletter of Barclays Bank Zambia
Limited.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian currency has depreciated by more than 40 percent
from 1330 Kwacha against one U.S. Dollar last December to an
average of 1850 Kwacha against the Dollar currently.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Manufacturing Output Continues to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The production of the Philippines'
manufacturing sector continued to slow down in February 1998 due
to the lingering adverse effects of the regional financial crisis,
the National Statistics Office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On a yearly basis, the value of production increased by a mere
4.1 percent while the volume of production declined by 7.7 percent
compared with the same month last year, according to an interim
monthly survey of selected industries issued by the office.
</P>
<P>
In January 1998, the indices for both the value and volume of
production dropped slightly from the year-ago levels.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the statistics office in cooperation
with the Department of Trade and Industry, is designed to provide
flash indicators on the performance of industrial enterprises such
as production, sales and employment.
</P>
<P>
The interim survey only covers the value and volume of
production and sales in the manufacturing sector while a formal
survey questionnaire is still being finalized.
</P>
<P>
But due to the depreciation of the Philippine peso, the value
of sales of the manufacturing sector in February increased by 35.7
percent and the volume of sales by 21 percent over the same month
last year.
</P>
<P>
The continued slowdown in February production was attributed to
shutdowns of some textile mills and production slowdowns in
transport equipment and other sub-sectors due to low demand and
increasing costs of imported production inputs.
</P>
<P>
But the survey also showed some significant developments in the
month, which include increases in domestic and export demand for
wood products, clothes, beverages, electronics and furniture.

<HEADLINE> China Looking For Eight Percent Growth In Chemical Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China's State Bureau of Petroleum
and chemical Industry expects a chemical industry output for the
first half of the year of 145.5 billion yuan, or 48.5 percent of
the year's target.
</P>
<P>
The bureau is predicting higher growth in the chemical industry
for the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
So, its proposed the target of 8 percent growth for the year is
attainable, according to Li Yongwu, the Bureau's director.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of the year, total production of the
industry was 96.8 billion yuan, up 1.8 percent from the same
period last year. Growth in the first six months is estimated at 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade in chemicals in the first quarter was worth 8.5
billion U.S. dollars, up 12.9 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
China has taken some macro-economic measures since the
beginning of the year, Li says, like stimulating domestic demand,
fixed assets investment, and exports to ensure 8 percent growth in
the nation's economy and it should be more vibrant in the second
and the third quarters, and the chemical industry will improve.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to government efforts to increase demand, rural
consumer spending is expected to be 50 billion yuan in 1998, with
demand for fertilizer increasing in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Increased investment in real estate and faster housing
construction will expand production of chemicals such as soda ash,
coating materials, and chemicals used for construction, Li says.
</P>
<P>
He says the Bank of China recently announced that it will extend
10 billion yuan in loans to support foreign trade, especially
efforts to change the export structure and develop new exports.
</P>
<P>
According to an official in charge of the Bureau's production
coordination, conditions are better for the industry now, with
improved transportation of phosphate, sulphate and potassium
products, and better supplies for fertilizer production.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Sets up Training Center for Street Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A 320,000-U.S.-Dollar training
center for street kids has been opened here in the Zambian
capital to provide training in farming for income generation,
special education and recreation for children.
</P>
<P>
Farming will also help sustain the center and provide
employment for street kids, Times of Zambia reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the inauguration Tuesday of the Bauleni Street Kids
Agricultural Training Center, Agriculture Minister Amusaa
Mwanamwambwa said that street kids have enormous potential and
called for better care and protection of children's rights.
</P>
<P>
"Government recognizes that the existence of street kids
reflects the extent of our care and protection of our children
and represents human and financial gain or loss, it represents
enormous potential if their needs are addressed but a sad waste
if ignored," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the population of street children in
the country may reach 56,000 by the 2000.
</P>
<P>
The center was constructed by the French government on a piece
of land donated by the Roman Catholic Church of Bauleni.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is among the least developed
countries to be affected by the Asian economic crisis, said an
official from the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Wednesday quoted WTO Counselor Michael
Finger as saying in Geneva that the crisis is causing price fall
of copper, which is the main foreign exchange earner of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Finger said various countries will experience the problems
resulting from the crisis and Zambia will undoubtedly be affected
by the financial crisis, considering its heavy dependence on one
major export commodity -- copper.

LAGOS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Following are the major news items
in leading Nigerian newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
New Nigeria:
</P>
<P>
-- The Nigerian government has approved an extra-budgetary
allocations to the National Electricity Power Authority in order
to improve the nation's electricity supply.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:

<P>
-- Prolonged military rule is a major impediment to stability

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Turmoil Slightly Affects Philippine Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bankers Association of the
Philippines (BAP) said Wednesday that the local financial market
will be slightly affected by the prevailing political turmoil in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
BAP President Deogracias Vistan said the local currency and
stock markets will not be much disturbed because the Indonesian
turmoil is seen to be temporary in nature.
</P>
<P>
Vistan was reacting to speculations that the Philippine peso
will slide further owing to the jittery situation in Indonesia
where many houses and businesses were looted last week during
massive riots.
</P>
<P>
According to Vistan, the thing that worries the bankers of the
country currently is that the recently-concluded elections could
result in chaos.
</P>
<P>
What is happening in Indonesia right now is largely political
so that its direct effect on the peso is minimal considering that
it only tends to freeze the strength of the peso into appreciating
further against the U.S. dollar, Vistan said.
</P>
<P>
But he warned the public that if the political problem in
Indonesia worsens further, it is likely that the exchange rate
could be pushed to 41 pesos a dollar.
</P>
<P>
If the situation gets worse, Vistan said, the Central Bank of
the Philippines has put in place an effective monetary strategy
that will immediately arrest the effects of this contagion like
what it did when the currency turmoil hit the country last July.
</P>
<P>
One of these strategies is for the central bank to tap the
agreements it recently signed with international banks which
agreed to support the country in time of another crisis, he added.

More than 17,000 medical workers in the city have registered to
do so.

<HEADLINE> 5,000 Zambians to Starve as Elephants Destroy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- About 5000 Zambians in Itezhi
Tezhi district in Central Province may soon starve because all
their harvested maize crop has been eaten up and destroyed by
rampaging elephants.
</P>
<P>
This is disclosed Tuesday by a parliament member Bettis
Namuyamba in Choma, about 300 kilometers south of Lusaka, after
winding up a tour of his constituency, Times of Zambia reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Namuyamba said the huge population of elephants has wreaked
havoc on the harvested maize, leaving the villagers near the
Kafue National Park, Zambia's largest wildlife park, with no
food.
</P>
<P>
The MP called on the Zambian government to immediately send in
enough stocks of relief food to avert imminent deaths from
hunger.
</P>
<P>
He lamented that appeals from villagers over the past years to
the country's Department of Wildlife and National Parks to crop
the beasts have gone unheeded, resulting in their population
tremendously increasing.
</P>
<P>
Namuyamba suggested that the Kafue National Park be fenced off
to protect human life which is now in danger especially when the
elephants could frequently terrorize defenseless villagers.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Raps Asylum Seekers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
dismissed as "cheap propaganda" the claims of persecution by
Zambians seeking political asylum abroad.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Wednesday quoted Home Affairs Minister Peter
Machungwa as saying that those people are tarnishing Zambia's
human rights record by seeking asylum.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in reaction to reports that Catherine
Mwanza, daughter of former president Kenneth Kaunda, and
opposition politician Azwell Banda were seeking asylum in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The two were not being persecuted by the state as all those
suspected to have committed offences were taken to court as was
the case in all democracies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister claimed that he had no knowledge of the state
persecuting Mwanza or anybody else on political grounds, adding
those running away had their own reasons.
</P>
<P>
"The freedom of Zambians goes as far as going to protest for
an aid squeeze at the Paris Club and returning home without
anybody harming or trailing you. I think some people are just
out to malign this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mwanza is reported to be seeking political asylum in South
Africa following the expiry of her contract which has not been
renewed at the Zambian Embassy in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Former Zambian Democratic Congress (ZDC) general secretary
Banda is already in South Africa where he is said to be staying
with a member of the South African Communist Party after he
sought political asylum.

URUMQI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Heavy snow descended on Urumqi,
capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, on
Tuesday, pushing down temperature to near zero C.
</P>
<P>
The snow began later in the afternoon and did not stop till
early Wednesday morning. By the evening time on Tuesday some areas
in Urumqi and Mount Tianshan had an accumulation of three to four
centimeters of snow.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the snowfall, strong winds hit northern Xinjiang,
accompanied by a heavy rain of 47.4 mm, or more than one-fourth
of last year's total precipitation in the city.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists say snow is rare at this time of the year in
Urumqi. Local records only had three cases of snowfall, namely,
on May 31, 1961, on May 13, 1985 and on May 9, 1993.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the heavy rain and snow to the active strong
cold currents lingering over the area and said the weather will
clear up with temperatures gradually rising in a couple of
days.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Film officials Looking Forward to New Period of prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A number of Chinese film officials
say they believe that Chinese films will soon enter a new period
of prosperity, according to today's Wenhui Daily, because in 1997,
a number of outstanding movies withstood the threat of imported
movies and began to win back audiences.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 of the 88 movies made last year are expected to be
strong contenders for the Chinese government's Hua Biao Award. One
of them is a documentary on late Premier Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
"Though their numbers are down, the quality of Chinese films
has improved and film-makers have tried different styles to
reflect ordinary people's lives," according to Liu Jianzhong, head
of the Chinese Ministry of Culture's Film Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The film "Opium War" was shown nearly 50,000 times nationwide
in 1997 and had box office receipts of at least 72 million yuan,
more than any of the foreign films that have been shown in China.
</P>
<P>
Governments at various levels have been concerned about film
production and given their support. Shanghai, which is China's
industrial and commercial center, recently spent more than 10
million yuan on two love stories.
</P>
<P>
The large number of scripts chosen during two national writing
contests will help China's film industry in the next two years,
Liu says.
</P>
<P>
Chinese films had two previous periods of prosperity, in the
1950s, and the late 1980s.

"Poor posture when using the mouse tightens the shoulder
muscles and decreases nerve and blood flow to the shoulder, arm
and hand," Stacey said in Adelaide, a port city in the state of
South Australia, Australia.
</P>
<P>
The findings of another Australian researcher, Dr. Barbara
Polus, confirm that if a muscle or joint is not regularly put
through its full range of motion, then these structures are at
risk of early arthritic change.
</P>
<P>
Stacey said most patients who received chiropractic treatment
were not aware that a computer mouse was causing their health
problems.
</P>
<P>
"Patients should be made aware that pain will recur in most
cases unless precautionary and preventative measures are taken,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Stacey said employers concerned about workers' injury
compensation should also take steps to minimize the exposure of
workers.
</P>
<P>
Those measures should include ergonomically-designed
workstations and stretch breaks every 30 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Roman Sarcophagus Unearthed in Eastern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A second Roman sarcophagus with gold
and jewels inside it has been unearthed on a sewage works
construction site in Lebanon's eastern ancient city of Baalbek,
the Daily Star newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sarcophagus, dating back to the late Roman period, was
found half-filled with water and containing a female skeleton, a
gold mask, gold teeth and jewellery.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Rifai, a Culture Ministry director for antiquities who
was present at the opening of the sarcophagus, said the artifacts
were in good condition, despite the foul smell, and would be taken
to Beirut's central laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The first sarcophagus was found last Saturday with its lid
open and most of its contents missing, prompting the directorate
to order the sewage works closed while an inquest was conducted
into the theft, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
One of the workers has confessed to stealing objects from the
first sarcophagus. Eight of the stolen items had already been
recovered, said the director.
</P>
<P>
Baalbek, 89 kilometer east from the capital of Beirut, is
famous for its historical sites. A huge Roman religious site
built by Phoenicians 2000 B.C. was uncovered in the city.

<HEADLINE> Singapore External Trade Up by 4.5 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade was up
 by 4.5 percent in April on a three-month moving average basis,
with exports expanding by 10.2 percent and imports dropping by 0.8
percent, the Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) announced on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said non-oil domestic exports and non-oil re-exports
increased by 10.3 and 13.8 percent respectively while oil domestic
exports declined by 6.8 percent. It also said the drop in imports
was due mainly to an 18.8-percent fall in oil imports.
</P>
<P>
However, the TDB said that on a monthly basis, non-oil domestic
exports fell by 1.6 percent, following a 9.6-percent expansion in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The drop reflected a moderation in growth of domestic exports
of integrated circuits and printed circuit boards assembled as
well as a decline in domestic exports of disk drives as a result
of global oversupply and related problems, the TDB explained.
</P>
<P>
These three products together account for 45 percent of the
country's non-oil domestic exports, it added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, non-oil imports, a short-term leading indicator of the
manufacturing sector, went down by 11.1 percent after a marginal
decline of 1.1 percent in March 1998. This suggests possible
moderation in export growth in the months ahead, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
In April, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports soared by 10.3
percent to reach 7.6 billion Singapore dollars (about 4.61 billion
U.S. dollars), with exports to U.S. and European Union markets
remaining strong.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports to the two markets increased by 17.4
and 14.1 percent respectively, in line with healthy economic
growth in these economies. Nevertheless, non-oil domestic exports
to Malaysia declined by 5 percent, due to both structural and
cyclical factors. Non-oil domestic exports to Japan weakened,
falling by 1.4 percent, due mainly to worsened domestic
conditions, it said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the overall decline in imports, non-oil imports
increased by 1 percent in April to reach 12.8 billion Singapore
dollars (about 7.76 billion U.S. dollars). Increases were mainly
recorded in imports of integrated circuits, capacitors and printed
circuits, parts of construction machinery and other products.

<HEADLINE> EU Urged to Lift Ban on Fish Exports from E. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is set to lift
an embargo on fish exports from east Africa, Kenyan Health
Minister Jackson Kalweo has revealed.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Tuesday on arrival from a week-long visit
to Geneva where he attended the 50th anniversary celebrations of
World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
The matter was discussed at length between the two sides and
EU has agreed to lift the ban on the strength of the WHO
recommendations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, WHO Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima has issued a
protest letter against the EU ban on fish exports from east
Africa, said Kalweo.
</P>
<P>
Kalweo added that research findings from WHO have showed that
fish cannot transmit cholera to human beings.
</P>
<P>
Kenya alone earned 80 million U.S. Dollars from the sale of
fish in the EU market. EU used to buy more than 56 percent of
fish products from Kenya.
</P>
<P>
EU imposed the ban due to the poor sanitary and hygienic
conditions along the Lake Victoria beaches, especially after the
outbreak of cholera in parts of the region late last year.
</P>
<P>
Following a series of meetings two months ago, the EU gave
Kenya until June 30 to clean its act for a review of the ban,
which covers capture, killing, handling and packaging.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, the Kenyan government has stepped up its efforts
to improve hygienic conditions in fishing processing firms and
the beaches. Fishermen involved have also agreed to build enough
latrines at the beaches to meet one of the EU conditions.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan health officials said other conditions like having
piped water at the beaches and required temperature in processing
plants are being addressed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. High-Tech Employs 4.5 Million Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 19 (Xinhua) -- High-tech industry companies in
the United States now employ 4.5 million workers, an increase of
490,000 since 1990, says a study the American Electronics
Association released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech industry lost jobs from 1990 to 1994, but has
gained jobs since, adding more than 200,000 in 1997 alone, said
the study.
</P>
<P>
California, home state of Silicon Valley, still employs the
largest number of high-tech workers. But the association said
growth in U.S. high-tech is not confined to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
In fact, 47 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia added
new high-tech jobs to their economies between 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
High-tech employment in Washington State, in the Northwest,
with a population of 5.4 million, is growing far more rapidly than
California. Now 88,000 people are employed at 3,158 high
technology companies in Washington state, with an annual payroll
of 5.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The study also pointed out that employees working in high-tech
companies earn on average 73 percent more than general private
sector employees.
</P>
<P>
Their wages were also growing much faster than general private
sector wages, said the study.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Spends $3 Million on Bank Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Uganda spends an average of 3
billion Shillings (3 million U.S. Dollars) in printing the
currency notes per year, an official with the Bank of Uganda has
said.
</P>
<P>
Sam Katwere, the Deputy Director of Public Relations of the
bank, was quoted by Wednesday's New Vision newspaper as saying
that from 1992 to 1995, a total of 13.96 billion Shillings (13.96
million Dollars) was spent on bank notes and it has not changed
much ever since.
</P>
<P>
It is due to such a high cost that the bank recently decided
to reintroduce coins into circulation, he added.
</P>
<P>
He called upon Ugandans to handle the notes properly by not
touching it with wet fingers or putting it under charcoal and
food-stuffs.
</P>
<P>
Money should only be folded twice and big sums of money should
not be kept in houses except for immediate use, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Poor handling of money results in high bank rates as the bank
recovers the costs of printing by charging customers.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Fall To Nine Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices Tuesday fell to
their lowest level since November 1988, say reports coming from
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The price of light, sweet crude oil for June delivery fell 1.11
U.S. dollars, or nine percent, to 12.96 dollars a barrel. The
price earlier fell to 12.50 dollar a barrel, the lowest in the
past nine-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
Prices of oil products also fell, although only modestly. June
heating oil fell 0.04 cent to 40.95 cents a gallon, while June
unleaded gasoline fell 0.02 cent to 50.03 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted crude oil futures kept falling despite news that
a Nigerian refinery outage is likely to hold 375,000 barrels of
crude oil off the market over the next three days.
</P>
<P>
Market participants also ignored comments made Monday by Saudi
Arabia's oil minister that about 500,000 more barrels a day should
be cut from daily production. Few observers believe oil producers
will take any action before the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) meets next month to discuss the prices.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say economic troubles in Southeast Asia, which have
reduced demand of crude oil to that region, has led to a battle
among oil producers to find other markets, leading to more
U.S. imports at favorable prices.
</P>
<P>
Although OPEC and other large oil producers made a decision to
cut 1.72 million barrels daily from production, oil prices kept
falling because U.S. crude oil inventories stood at their highest
level since December 1993, said the American Petroleum Institute.

<HEADLINE> Ostrich Becoming New Dish For China's 21st Century Tables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Zheng Xinjiu, an animal husbandry
specialist who is general manager of the Northern Ostrich Group
(NOG) in Liaoning Province, says that, in the 21st century, people
will be able to dine on ostrich meat often.
</P>
<P>
The meat is an ideal food for keeping fit, he explains, with
its good taste, high protein and low fat, cholesterol, and calorie
content.
</P>
<P>
However, the price of ostrich meat now is quite high in the
international market, owing to ostrich breeding being a developing
industry, according to zheng.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, American people first declared successful breeding of
a new variety of ostriches, which origin in the African desert
area. Four years later, China began to promote its ostrich raising
sector.
</P>
<P>
NOG now has several farms in northeast China provinces for
ostrich feeding, including the Jinsui Ostrich Breeding
Base being built, the largest of its kind in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Located in the suburbs of Fushun, Liaoning, the 80 ha. base is
constructed at a cost of 140 million yuan and expected to produce
nearly 30,000 ostriches each year for consumption use.
</P>
<P>
"All eggs here will enjoy fully automatic services, including
sunlight, feeding, cleaning until fledglings burst open the
eggshell." said Zheng, who stood in front of a 13,600 sq m hall
well equipped with incubators.
</P>
<P>
The leather, feather of ostriches are also quite valuable in
shoes, handbags and clothes making, he said, and the group has
started cooperation with producers in US, Australia to jointly
develop enriched fodder, set up a feather-processing plant and
slaughterhouses.

his just-concluded visit to China.
</P>
<P>
"There was a complete identity of views between Pakistan and
China on the gravity of the situation which had resulted from
India's reckless actions and fictitious threat from China invented
by India as a pretext to promote its own hegemonic designs and
aggressive agenda in South Asia," Shamshad told reporters
Wednesday morning upon his arrival at the Islamabad airport from
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Beijing, Shamshad said, he exchanged views
with the Chinese leadership and government on all issues of mutual
interest and concern, adding, "I have every reason to be fully
satisfied with the outcome of my visit."
</P>
<P>
Besides bilateral matters, the two sides held an in-depth
exchange of views on the "severe impact on global
non-proliferation efforts and the dangers posed (by the Indian
nuclear tests) to global and regional peace and security," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides examined and analyzed at length the international
reaction to the Indian nuclear tests, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our consultations with China are indeed an important facet of
our wider consultations with all major powers as well as friendly
countries to seek ways and means to effectively defuse tension and
reduce the factors that have threatened peace and stability in our
region," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of satisfaction that the Chinese leadership has
once again affirmed that China-Pakistan friendship is an
all-weather one which has stood the test of time and history and
is above any political expediencies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our visit was essentially to share with our Chinese friends
our assessment and perception of the perilous situation that has
arisen as a result of the Indian nuclear weaponization," he said.
</P>
<P>
To a question about the time frame of Pakistan's nuclear tests,
he said, "It is a premature question. We are still engaged in
carrying out a thorough, measured review of not only the threat
posed to our security, but also the response and reaction of the
international community."
</P>
<P>
"When I say the threat posed to our security, we are closely
examining the immediacy and magnitude of the threat to our
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These things cannot be measured in hours, days or weeks, one
has to take as much time as it is necessary to arrive at the right
decision," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions to Impact India's Economy: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The sanctions imposed on India
after it conducted five successive nuclear tests last week will
impact its economy, equity markets and infrastructure projects,
said a study available here Wednesday, which was conducted by the
Crisil Research &AMP; Information Services.
</P>
<P>
In the infrastructure sector, the power sector will be the
worst hit. Currently, independent power projects with a total
capacity of about 15,000 MW have finalized power purchase
agreements but not reached financial closure. These projects would
either be abandoned or delayed in finding developers, financiers
and contractors, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The expected escalation in cost of funds will result in an
upward revision in project cost and tariff, which will again have
to be cleared by the Central Electricity Authority and the
respective state electricity boards, thus furthering delays, said
the study.
</P>
<P>
Urban infrastructure development in the country is bound to be
affected. The suspension of aid from Japan would again impact
projects in power, roads, ports and irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will also impact the economy as a whole. There
will be an increase in interest rates in the short term and a
negative effect on the spot and forward rates, the study further
said.
</P>
<P>
Among the industries likely to be affected are automobiles,
ancillaries, cement, consumer durables, commercial vehicles,
fertilizers, paints, paper, power and telecom cables and sugar.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Undertakes Forestry Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
undertaken different forestry programs with the financial
assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and made
encouraging achievement in this regard, an English daily reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Environment and Forest Minister Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury said
this while addressing a two-day seminar on a forestry sector
project with a cost of four billion taka (about 87 million U.S.
dollars) here Tuesday, The Daily Star said.
</P>
<P>
The government had so far engaged over 260,000 families in
different forestry programs as beneficiaries, and besides, about
100,000 persons had been imparted training in social-forestry
which resulted in setting up 5,000 nurseries at private level, she
stated.
</P>
<P>
The forestry programs included projects such as community
forestry, forest extension and development, sub-district
afforestation and nursery development, and these projects had
already produced forest resources of about 50 billion taka (about
108.7 million dollars), she elaborated.
</P>
<P>
These projects had also generated employment opportunities for
the rural poor, she added.
</P>
<P>
The ADB-financed forestry project was the first step towards
implementation of the forestry master plan to bring 20 percent of
the total land under forest cover by the year 2015, she said.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that creation and development of forest
resources through active participation of people, sustainable
forest management and conservation of forest and bio-diversity
were the main objectives of the project.
</P>
<P>
All barren land, marginal lands of roads, embankments, railways
and other kinds of land should be brought under afforestation
programs, she stressed.

<HEADLINE> MGM Asks Court to Stop Sony Developing 007 Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. on
Tuesday filed a motion in U.S. District Court, asking the court to
order rival Sony Corporation to halt development of its own 007
film.
</P>
<P>
MGM, seeking exclusive rights to the lucrative James Bond movie
franchise, sued Sony last November when Sony announced its
intention to develop a Bond film. MGM is now asking for a
preliminary verdict for the plaintiff because it believes Sony
actually has begun making the film.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that Sony may be commencing their process a
little faster than we thought," said MGM attorney David
Johnson. "We do not want them in the process of making movies
while the suit is in litigation."
</P>
<P>
MGM also accused John Calley, a former MGM executive who is now
president of Sony Pictures, of taking MGM trade secrets when he
left the company. The suit alleges that Sony is using the
information in its development of its Bond film.
</P>
<P>
Since MGM launched the series of 007 in 1962 with "Dr No", its
18 Bond films have earned more than 2.5 billion U.S. dollar in box
office receipts worldwide.
</P>
<P>
MGM is currently developing the 19th Bond picture. A script is
being written for the film, which will star Pierce Brosnan, and
the director will be named soon, said MGM spokesman Craig
Parsons.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Muslim Leader Calls Off Mass Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of Indonesia's second
largest Muslim organization Muhammadiyah, Dr. Amien Rais, has
called off a mass rally to mark the so-called "Reform Day", which
was scheduled to be held at the National Monument (Mona) square
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In order to prevent any casualties both from the community as
well as the authority sides, I appealed to the cancellation of
today's rally," said Amien Rais here at dawn Wednesday, official
Antara News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In place of the long march, which was expected to be
participated in by around one million people, Amien urged the
people to hold prayers in their respective neighborhoods or
venues.
</P>
<P>
The Monas, which is located at the heart of the capital city
and across the presidential as well as vice presidential palaces,
and its surrounding areas are being blocked by security officers
using among other things armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Indonesians commemorate the National Awakening Day every May 20
to mark a nationalist movement against the Dutch colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
However, in line with the increasing demand for reforms,
pro-reform activities suggested that the Day should be renamed the
Reform Day.
</P>
<P>
Since early Wednesday morning, armed troops supported by tanks
and armored cars have blocked the main roads and big shopping
centers in the city. No buses or cars were seen in the streets
except a few military trucks.
</P>
<P>
A number of university students at the parliament building
commented that the decision of Amien Rais to call off the rally
was wise.
</P>
<P>
"Amien is a wise man, I think he is worried that if we go ahead
with the long march, some casualties might fall," said a student
who stayed overnight at the House of Representatives (DPR)
building.
</P>
<P>
Students have been staging demonstrations for reform at the DPR
since Monday.

<HEADLINE> Greece Says No to U.S. Cyprus Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Tuesday rejected a United
States proposal that the Cyprus impasse should be settled as part
of a broader agreement to solve Turkish-Greek differences.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos told a news
conference that the U.S. proposal was not understandable, and his
country's stance on the matter would never change.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton said in London on Monday
that the Cyprus issue could not be settled "in isolation" from
other Greek-Turkish differences and "the role of Turkey in
Europe's future."
</P>
<P>
Pangalos noted that these issues were independent and should be
resolved through different means.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said the Cyprus issue was an international issue of
"aggression and occupation" and had already aroused wide concerns.
</P>
<P>
Since the Greek Cypriots had made enough concessions, they
would not make further concessions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said his country had made no demands against the
current situation or international norms. What caused tensions
between the two countries were Ankara's baseless demands, he said.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, Turkey was likely to become an EU member
eventually.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north Since Turkey landed its troops and
took over the northern third of the Mediterranean island in
1974. The breakaway Turkish Cypriot State in the north is only
recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The world community has been making efforts to help Cyprus
reunify under a bizonal and bicommunal formula sponsored by the
United Nations. But so far, no tangible results have been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Radiation Likely to Hit Nepal: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Radiation from the nuclear test
explosions conducted by India in its desert state of Rajasthan
last week is likely to hit Nepal, The Kathmandu Post Wednesday
quoted experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If one were to conduct a radiation test at Pokharan now (the
site of Indian nuclear tests), the atmosphere will show traces of
radiation," the daily quoted Devi Dutta Poudyal, a physicist at
the Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology, as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, it will take at least one or two weeks for the
radiation to reach Nepal through atmospheric movement.
</P>
<P>
"Currently the wind is blowing from west to east and once the
effects of Pokharan arrive here in Nepal through atmospheric
circulation, the rain water is likely to bear traces of
radiation," said Tulsi Pathak, a nuclear chemist.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology said Nepal does not
have the technological know-how to study the level of atmospheric
radiation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the claims by Indian scientists that they had not
detected any radiation leakage, Indian newspapers have reported
that some villagers near the test site have complained of nose
bleeding, eye irritation and itching which doctors linked to
either radiation fallout or extreme summer heat, The Kathmandu
Post said.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Sets Thai Farm Product Export Target At Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports of agricultural
products are likely to fall below government targets later this
year due to a decline in production caused by the El Nino weather
phenomenon, the Bangkok Post Wednesday quoted the Agricultural and
Cooperatives Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry Tuesday told the Economic Ministry Policy
Committee that although farm export earnings for the first quarter
of the year had been on target, severe drought might cause exports
to decline later.
</P>
<P>
The government had set an export target of 8.279 billion U.S.
dollars for farm goods, and 5.35 billion dollars for agricultural
industry products.
</P>
<P>
To protect farm incomes, the committee agreed that state
agencies should make the domestic market more efficient and
monitor the supply-demand pattern for farm goods to prevent an
oversupply which would force prices down.
</P>
<P>
The value of Thailand's agricultural products in the 1997-98
season is forecast at 650 billion baht (16.67 billion dollars), or
11 percent of gross domestic product, a 21.3 percent rise from the
previous season.

BANGKOK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A Thai hotel venture is planning to
build the country's first underwater hotel off an island in the
southern province of Phuket, the Bangkok Post said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Investors from Singapore and Brunei had asked about taking
shares in the 500 million baht (12.8 million U.S. dollar) project,
said Pravit Laovisetkul, general manager of the Thai venture,

</P>
<P>
The hotel is planned to have 200 rooms under the sea, with
foreign tourists as the main market.
</P>
<P>
Pravit said the location of the hotel is attractive since
Phuket is famous for its sea and beaches.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the depreciation of the baht is another factor to lure
more foreigners, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pravit stressed that construction would not harm the beach.
</P>
<P>
The design of the hotel is likely to be ready by the end of
this year with construction completed two years later, he said.

57 townships and 15 mountain ranges in three divisions.
</P>
<P>
The three divisions of Mandalay, Sagaing and Magway constitute
the arid zone of the country where residents experienced an acute
shortage of water even for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities are also advocating that people use wood
substitute fuel such as briquettes and fuel-efficient stoves, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Myanmar has also been building irrigation
facilities in the arid zone for agriculture and human consumption,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the greening projects are being extended to 13
districts from nine in the arid regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan province is
determined to control pollution and plans to use a Japanese
loan worth 142 million US dollars to deal with the serious
pollution problem in the province's largest river, the Xiangjiang.
</P>
<P>
The river waters 40 percent of the province's land and serves
about 60 percent of its people, but, because of large amounts of
industrial and household waste dumped into it daily, combined with
gas emissions and the resulting acid rain, people's lives have
been threatened.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the provincial government has spent
over 1.6 billion yuan on the river pollution problem and a number
of small plants with serious pollution problems have been
closed. As a result, the heavy metal and arsenic content of the
river has dropped.
</P>
<P>
To clean the river more and improve the local air, 25 pollution
control projects are underway in the Xiangjiang River Valley to
treat urban waste water and control industrial pollution, a local
official says.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Government Strives to Lower Illiteracy Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government is to
increase education funding this year in an effort to lower the
country's illiteracy rate.
</P>
<P>
Education investment will rise to 7.2 percent of the gross
domestic product from 5.5 percent to teach another 600,000 people
to read and write by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The government made the decision after the Second Summit of the
Americas held in Chile in April, when 34 American presidents
promised: "Everyone will have the chance to be educated."
</P>
<P>
Brazil launched a Solidarity Literacy Program in 1997 with more
than 40 million dollars of donations from government agencies,
universities and private companies.
</P>
<P>
The program, paying for all the participants, requires every
student participating in the literacy course to undergo intensive
training.
</P>
<P>
The program taught 40,000 unlettered people to read and write
last year, decreasing the illiteracy rate to 15.6 percent from
20.1 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
New figures released by the Brazilian Institute of Geography
and Statistics show that the nation currently has 20 million
illiterates, 1.3 million of whom are aged 15 to 17, or 12.4
percent of the Brazilian youths.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 2.7 million school-age children do not
go to school due to various reasons.
</P>
<P>
Most of the illiterate young live in the poor countryside in
the northeast of Brazil where the rate is as high as 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Ministry of Education indicate that there are
more than 40 million semi-literate people, half of whom are young
women living in southeastern Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The government has pledged to change the situation by making
10,000 women literate in the southeastern state of Rio de Janeiro
by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
The government expects the Solidarity Literacy Program to
provide a solid foundation for the country's economic development
by raising the educational level of all Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
With the help of educational reforms, Brasilia hopes to
increase the percentage of university-educated people from the
current 11 percent to 30 percent in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The government also vows, within the Solidarity Literacy
Program, to provide a four-year basic education for the country's
20 million illiterates within ten years, and enroll one third of
preschool-age kids in child care centers for receiving preschool
education.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Albania to Strengthen Many-sided Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Albanian Foreign Affairs
Minister Paskal Milo said Albania and Romania should further
cooperation in the political, economic, cultural, scientific
fields.
</P>
<P>
Milo made these remarks when meeting Romanian Prime Minister
Radu Vasile Tuesday here.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides believed that Albania-Romania
economic cooperation was far below the level it should reach, with
trade volume last year standing at just 3.18 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
They also exchanged views on the current situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Milo said Albania hoped the crisis in Kosovo, a province of
Yugoslavia, could be solved through peaceful dialogue and never
through extreme actions.
</P>
<P>
He said Albania stood for the founding of a Kosovo Republic
within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Echoing this, the Romanian side expressed its willingness to
play a positive role in the matter.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it said it was willing to make contributions to
Albania's economic reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Milo arrived here Monday for a two-day visit and held meetings
with Romanian President Emil Constantinescu, Premier Vasile and
Foreign Affairs Minister Andrei Plesu.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Star forward Gabriel Batistuta
gave Argentina another victory in soccer friendly with a goal in
the second half against Chile at Mendoza, Argentina, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Batistuta scored the only goal of the match in the 47th minute
as he got a pass from Lopez and headed the ball into the goal.
</P>
<P>
Chile mounted their attack from the start and dominated the
midfield through Nelson Parraguez and Fabian Estay while strikers
Ivan Zamorano and Marcelo Salas constantly threatened the
Argentine goal.
</P>
<P>
But after 20 minutes, the Argentine team took over the midfield
domination thanks to Diego Simeone and Javier Zanetti.
</P>
<P>
The host team almost scored in the 23rd minute when Batistuta's
powerful shot was well caught by goal-keeper Nelson Tapia.
</P>
<P>
Afgentina dominated the second half, but the Chileans still had
the chances of scoring.
</P>
<P>
At the 90th minute, Paraguayan referee gave Chile a penalty
kick but Zamorano sent the ball over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Argentina improved their warm-up matches
record to 4-1. They will play South Africa in Buenos Aires on May
25.

<HEADLINE> Russia Calls for Lifting of Sanctions on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday called for the
lifting of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia, saying the
Yugoslav federal authorities have opened negotiations with ethnic
Albanians in the Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Rakhmanin, a spokesman for Russian Foreign Ministry,
said Tuesday the fact that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
had sat at the negotiating table with Kosovo Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova justified the end of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The talks held in Belgrade last Friday were in line with the
international community's demand that the Yugoslav government
should settle the Kosovo crisis through political means, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In late April, the six-nation Contact Group steering peace
efforts in former Yugoslavia decided to freeze Yugoslav assets
abroad and to block any kind of investment in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Russia was the only member of the group to oppose the
new sanctions. The other five are Britain, France, Germany, Italy
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The whole experience drawn from the international influence
exerted on Yugoslavia only made Russia doubt whether the diplomacy
of sanctions was feasible, Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
Only through concerted efforts, could the international
community help the Yugoslav authorities and Kosovo Albanians
change their attitude in the seeking solution to the Kosovo
crisis, the spokesman added.

countries until eliminating or at least regulating the use of the
veto and strengthening the decision making power of the general
assembly.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Import and Export Bank of
China, a policy-oriented bank, has agreed to loan two billion yuan
to the Shanghai Electrical (Group) Co. in three years for
machinery export increases.
</P>
<P>
The borrower is one of China's 57 key group companies and is
active in power station equipment, production, design, sales, and
engineering projects and earned 780 million U.S. dollars from
exports last year.
</P>
<P>
Exim plans to give priority this year to exports of ships,
complete sets of equipment, telecommunications facilities,
electronics, and electrical machinery, according to said Gu
Mingchao, the bank's vice-governor. It plans to extend 24.3
billion yuan in credits this year, a 60-percent increase over 1997.
</P>
<P>
Machinery is at the top of China's export mix, but exports have
been seriously hit by the financial crisis in Southeast Asia
this year, where most of China's exports have gone for years.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, Gu says, the bank is prepared to
diversify its credit and change export commodities.

<HEADLINE> Hepatitis B Vaccination Campaign Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide publicity campaign
was launched yesterday to promote children's hepatitis B
vaccination in rural areas, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The health promotion campaign includes disseminating knowledge
among rural people, donating vaccines to some poverty-stricken
areas, and training rural health workers in hepatitis B
prevention and treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health launched the campaign in Beijing, with
the aim of raising the hepatitis B vaccination rate in rural
areas to above 60 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
At present, only 40 percent of rural children have been
vaccinated against hepatitis B, compared with 90 percent of urban
children.
</P>
<P>
Cao Huilin, an expert with the National Expert Group for
Hepatitis Control predicted that if vaccination campaigns begin
now, hepatitis B could be eradicated in China within 50 years.
</P>
<P>
China started to conduct research into hepatitis B vaccine in
the early 1970s. Hepatitis B vaccination was first promoted in
urban areas in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Follow-up surveillance of two million people in five provinces
showed that more than 90 percent of babies have been vaccinated
against hepatitis B in the past 12 years. The incidence rate of
hepatitis B infection has declined from around 10 percent in 1986
to the current one to two percent.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Holds Comfortable Lead in Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President Joseph
Estrada has solidified his lead in the May 11 presidential polls,
garnering 37.6 percent of the 21.3 million votes counted,
according to the latest unofficial and partial results issued here
late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition candidate received 8.01 million votes,
further widening his lead over his closest rival, Speaker of the
House of Representatives Jose de Venecia, to nearly 5 million
votes, the results showed.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia of the ruling Lakas-NUCD (National Union of
Christian Democrats) Party mustered 3.16 million votes, or 14.8
percent of the votes counted.
</P>
<P>
The results were released by the National Citizens' Movement
for Free Elections (Namfrel), the sole non-governmental
organization accredited by the country's Commission on Elections
(Comelec) to do an unofficial quick count of votes in last week's
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Namfrel has so far counted votes in 133,120 precincts, or
77.08 percent of the country's more than 170,000 precincts.
According to an earlier estimate of the Comelec, about 80 percent
of the 34 million registered Filipino voters cast votes on May 11.
</P>
<P>
Realizing Estrada's lead is insurmountable, five of his nine
rivals, including Senator Raul Roco and former presidential
economic adviser Emilio Osmena, have already conceded defeat to
the possible runaway winner.
</P>
<P>
But De Venecia insisted that he will not concede until the
official results come out.
</P>
<P>
The final official results are not expected to be known within
the next two weeks as the bicameral Congress is scheduled to start
the canvassing of votes for the president and the vice president
on May 25.

<HEADLINE> Halting Practice of Illegal Charges for Investors in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Government departments in east
China's province of Fujian are making a new effort to protect
overseas investors from the illegal levying of various charges by
printing up a brochure.
</P>
<P>
All charges for foreign funded firms, except for government
taxes which are legal, are listed in the booklet, which should be
available by the end of May, says Chen Dejin of the provincial
pricing bureau.
</P>
<P>
The government is doing this to put a stop to the practice and
to protect overseas-funded companies' interests, Chen says.
</P>
<P>
The province has been working harder since August 1995 to lower
charges for these companies and has managed to cut more than a
billion yuan of excessive levies on these firm.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has approved 23,325 foreign-funded projects, with a
contractual foreign investment of 50.65 billion US dollars and an
actual foreign investment of 22.9 billion US dollars, according to
official figures.

250 kg has been caught in Meizhou Bay, off east China's Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
A local fisherman in Putian County found the 1.5-m-by-1.5-m
female turtle last week, the largest ever recorded in Fujian, and
sent it to the aquarium in this capital of the province.
</P>
<P>
Green turtles live in tropical and subtropical oceans, eating
fish, shells and seaweed.

Pingtan County, also in Fujian, last November.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the appearance of such creatures indicates
that the sea water quality in the area is improving.

<HEADLINE> More Blast at Japanese Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- More Japanese newspapers and
organizations on Tuesday blasted the Japanese film "Pride -- the
Fatal Moment" for whitewashing Japan's aggression against
neighboring countries during World War II.
</P>
<P>
"Pride -- the Fatal Moment" is a movie which whitewashes
Japan's aggression and distorts historical facts, Asahi Shimbun, a
leading Japanese newspaper, said in an article.
</P>
<P>
The movie preaches that the Asia-Pacific War Japan launched in
early 1940s as a war for self-defense, the article said. It is
totally unconvincing as Japan had already sent millions of troops
to its neighboring countries, killing an unaccountable number of
civilians of those countries before the war, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The film deals with the trial and last days of General Tojo
Hideki, Japan's wartime prime minister, who was executed as an
A-Class war criminal by the International Military Tribunal for
the Far East in November 1948.
</P>
<P>
Akahata Shimbun said the movie has an apparent political
intention by distorting history, denying Nanjing Massacre and
slandering the trials of Japanese war criminals by the
International Military Tribunal for the Far East.
</P>
<P>
Japan-China Friendship Association, meanwhile, said in a
statement that the film is unacceptable as it denies Japan's
aggression against China and tramples on the spirit of the
Japan-China Joint Statement and Japan-China Peace and Friendship
Treaty.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Refuses to Buckle Under U.S. Pressure on Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's Minister of the
Treasury Jose Angel Gurria Tuesday denied that his country is
acting under U.S. pressure but stated that Mexico will cooperate
in clarifying money laundering activities.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local press, Gurria said that the
Mexican government will do everything in its power to castigate
those guilty of money laundering.
</P>
<P>
It will not, however, act under any kind of pressure, including
U.S. political pressure, the minister said. "We are the victims of
these people involved in money laundering," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gurria also announced that the U.S. accusation against 22
Mexican bank officers for allegedly participating in money
laundering will not affect the package of reforms to the Mexican
banking system, which President Zedillo presented to congress in
March.
</P>
<P>
In the "Casablanca" operation, 22 bank officers and employees
from 12 Mexican banks were arrested in the U.S. for money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
The news of the arrest of the bankers led to a 2.92 percent
drop in the price index and Mexican stock market.
</P>
<P>
Several opposition parties in the Mexican congress called for
the resignation of the governor of Banco de Mexico, the central
bank, Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, and the president of the National
Banking and Securities Commission, Eduardo Fernandez.

<HEADLINE> Cuban President Castro Appeals for Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro
appealed to developing nations Tuesday to convert the World Trade
Organization (WTO) into a tool for creating a better and fairer
world.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony in Geneva for the WTO's 50th anniversary, Castro
stated that the United States and other wealthy nations were
introducing new topics into the organization's agenda.
</P>
<P>
These new topics threatened to restrict the potential of third
world countries to develop and compete in conditions that were
already difficult and inequitable, warned the Cuban leader.
</P>
<P>
The United States was obstructing the entry of China and Russia
into the WTO. He said that no nation, whether large or small,
should be "excluded from this important institution, nor should
its entry be subject to humiliating conditions."
</P>
<P>
Developing countries could not allow themselves to be divided.
"Unity is the only wealth we possess and the only guarantee to
defend our legitimate aspirations," Castro said.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban president cautioned that those countries which were
still suffering "the consequences of backwardness, poverty and
underdevelopment, were the majority in this organization."
</P>
<P>
"Each country has a single vote, no one has the right to a
veto. We must convert this organization into a tool of struggle
for a better and fairer world," added the Cuban president.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Witnesses 30 Percent Inflation Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's inflation could reach
30 percent despite anti-inflationary efforts of President Rafael
Caldera's government, Minister of Coordination and Planning
Teodoro Petkoff said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Realistically speaking, inflation will range from 26 percent
to 30 percent," Petkoff said in an interview with Radio Caracas.
</P>
<P>
He explained that despite the tax adjustment measures the
government announced last week to increase revenues and compensate
for the drop in oil prices, no way out is now evident that would
allow the government to meet its initial inflationary goals.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices soared 10.7 percent in the first quarter of
this year, which smashed official forecasts. Independent
economists cautioned that the official goal of a 25 percent
inflation rate would be tough to meet.
</P>
<P>
The world market drop in oil prices has decelerated the
Venezuelan economy and forced the government to revise its
economic growth objectives for this year downwards to just under
2.5 percent from the 4.5 percent predicted early in the year.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Proposes Joint Patrols with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's new Public Security
Minister, Juan Rafael Lizano, announced today that he was going to
submit a proposal to conduct joint patrols with U.S. forces to
combat drug trafficking in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Drug trafficking here has reached an incredible level," said
the minister who took office on May 8 upon a change of government
administration.
</P>
<P>
The drugs, allegedly coming from Colombia, enter Costa Rica by
land over the Panama border but also from the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts on speedboats run by drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities had proposed to the previous government
carrying out joint patrols on Caribbean and Pacific waters to
combat the transport of drugs from Colombia and Panama.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's attorney general considered that this action was
unconstitutional since it involved the presence of foreign
warships in territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Despite various efforts to grant control over these operations
to Costa Rican authorities, it was impossible to reach an
agreement that did not violate the provisions of the Central
American nation's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Lizano announced that he has a counterproposal to the U.S.
government, to be presented to the attorney general and President
Miguel Angel Rodriguez but declined to reveal any details on its
content.
</P>
<P>
He did say, however, that it deals with such matters as the
steering of these vessels, "so that the national sovereignty of
Costa Rica would not be violated."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Concerned about Situation in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here on Tuesday that the only way to restore peace and
stability in Afghanistan is through negotiation instead of military
action.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks through his spokesman regarding the Afghan
Taliban's recent decision to abandon a forum for intra-Afghan
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General has received a report on that from the
U.N. Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA) which was informed of
the Taliban decision on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Taliban leaders said the Northern Alliance had refused to
cooperate and thus they decided to abandon the so-called Ulems
forum.
</P>
<P>
Annan was deeply concerned at the decision not to continue
face-to-face talks with the Alliance especially in the light of
intensified fighting in Northern Afghanistan, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Taliban movement to reconsider their position and
called on both sides to honor their previous commitments to
refrain from new military offensives.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Creates Online Photo Album </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Eastman Kodak Co., the world's
leader in photography industry, will almost strike a deal with
America Online, the largest Internet service provider, to store
digital pictures for 12 million potential customers.
</P>
<P>
Under a three-year alliance announced Tuesday, America Online's
subscribers will be able to take conventional film to retailers on
the street and have digitized copies delivered to their computer
for an extra 5.00 U.S. dollars to 7.00 U.S. dollars a roll. More
than 30,000 Kodak photo-finishing stores around the country are
expected to offer this new service.
</P>
<P>
The service, called "You've Got Pictures!" will allow AOL
customers, having surpassed 12 million, to store photos in a
private, online photo album. They will be able to personalize the
albums by adding captions and backgrounds and cropping or
enlarging the pictures. The photos could either be downloaded or
transmitted online to friends or family.
</P>
<P>
While Kodak and other photo-finishing companies have been
offering electronic delivery, the deal with America Online makes
the technology readily accessible.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Kodak turned to computer-chip maker Intel Corp.
for help in developing and marketing a variety of
digital-imaging products, notably a new line of leaner and
cheaper cameras and CDs used to store images.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Need Positive Trade Agenda: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Building a positive trade agenda is
a prerequisite for developing countries if they are to participate
in future negotiations on a more equal footing, said a senior
United Nations official here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The building of developing countries' capacity to defend their
interests effectively in trade negotiations, and to establish the
universality of the WTO, is an essential task," said
Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) Rubens Ricupero.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking on behalf of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
at the second ministerial conference of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), marking the 50th anniversary of the WTO's
predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
</P>
<P>
After replacing the GATT, Ricupero said, the WTO intensified
multilateral trading disciplines and extended them into new areas.
</P>
<P>
While providing the improved, and more secure, access to
markets that is prerequisite for successful export-oriented
development strategies, he noted, the WTO imposed stricter
constraints on the scope of policy options open to developing
countries in pursuing their development strategies.
</P>
<P>
"Priority should be given to trade barriers targeting the
exports of developing countries in both goods and services"
although the trade liberalization process must maintain its
momentum, Ricupero stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The concept of special and differential treatment in favor of
developing countries should be adapted so as to aim at improving
their ability to compete in a globalized world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero is in favor of gradual opening-up of the markets of
the developing countries, saying that "sub-regional integration
among developing countries is providing them with a training
ground for competing in the global market, thus facilitating their
participation in trade negotiations".

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Futures Hit New Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil futures prices tumbled
here today to the lowest level in nine years and a half, as U.S.
inventories stood at their highest level in five years despite
output cuts by some world producers.
</P>
<P>
Light, sweet crude for June delivery, which expired Tuesday,
fell 1.11 U.S. dollars, or 9 percent, to 12.96 U.S. dollars a
barrel. Prices earlier fell to 12.50 a barrel, the lowest since
early November 1988. The now-active July contract fell 10 cents to
15.01 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Despite a decision by members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and other large oil producers to cut some 1.72
million barrels daily from production, American crude inventory
levels last week rose to their highest since December 1993,
according to the report of the American Petroleum Institute.
</P>
<P>
Oil products also fell, although only modestly.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Must Withdraw Troops Unconditionally: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 19 (xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin said Tuesday that Eritrea must withdraw its troops
unconditionally from the Ethiopian territory.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read out to diplomatic corps accredited to
Ethiopia, the foreign minister said that Eritrea side "invaded
Ethiopian territory by deploying three brigades assisted by
tanks" on May 12.
</P>
<P>
Referring to peaceful resolution of this crisis provided by
some friendly countries on the past few days, Seyoum reaffirmed
that "Ethiopia has made it clear that negotiation on this latest
development between Eritrea and Ethiopia and on the surrounding
events and issues can take place only following the unconditional
withdrawal of Eritrean troops from Ethiopian territory."
</P>
<P>
"The thrust of our message being that Eritrean troops would
have to withdraw from the Ethiopian territory unconditionally for
negotiations to commence between the two countries on whatever
disputes there might be between them," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The locality of Badme and part of Sheraro, which are now
under the occupation of Eritrean troops, have never been part of
Eritrea, neither during Italian colonial time, nor during the
periods of different regimes in Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
However, Seyoum told diplomats that Ethiopia and Eritrea "have
acknowledged the existence of disputes between them regarding
various localities along their common borders, agreed to solve
these disputes through bilateral negotiations and also agreed
that in the event of failure to resolve the issue in bilateral
negotiations, to resort to third party involvement, including
eventually to arbitration, should that be necessary."

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Sees Possible Delay in Approving Iraq's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Tuesday the approval of Iraq's new plan to
distribute humanitarian goods would likely be delayed.
</P>
<P>
The current oil-for-food program ends on June 3. Iraq presented
the U.N. secretary-General last week with its new plan on which
goods would be bought and how they will be distributed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Annan said, "We are cutting it very
short because there are still some differences between us that we
need to work out."
</P>
<P>
"I will not exclude it but I do not put my hand to the fire
that we will meet the deadline," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program reached between Iraq and the
United Nations in 1986, Iraq can sell 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil in every six months to buy humanitarian goods for its
people.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council of the United Nations in February voted to
raise the amount of oil Iraq could sell to 5 billion dollars over
six months in an effort to ease the effect of U.N. sanctions on
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Airbus Sees Super Jumbo Debut by Mid-2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The European plane maker Airbus
Industrie said Tuesday that the planned Airbus super passenger
jet, dubbed the A3XX, would be able to make its market debut by
mid-2004.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the international air show in Berlin, Airbus
vice-president John Leahy also disclosed that the A3XX could have
three different versions at its start, with 480, 555 and 656 seats
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The super jumbo project has been contemplated by Airbus as a
challenger to the Boeing 747 which was introduced by the U.S.
Boeing Co. nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
It has been promised that the A3XX will be faster, quieter,
more cost-efficient and able to fly farther than the Boeing 747.
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, say that the new jet, which will cost a
minimum of 10 billion U.S. dollars to produce, will have a
formidable price tag. Moreover, there is also uncertainty about
whether the world will really need a passenger jet even larger
than the 420-seater Boeing 747.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Rules out Regional Peace Force for D.R. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki Tuesday ruled out the possibility of
forming a regional peacekeeping force to maintain stability in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R. Congo), South Africa Press
Association said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no consideration of a kind of SADC (Southern African
Development Community) peacekeeping force for Congo," he was
quoted as telling reporters during the southern African economic
summit in Windhoek, Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that there was no proper government in the last
eight-and-a-half years of Mobutu Sese Seko's rule, Mbeki said he
would have been very surprised if there were no fighting in the
country. "We must expect there to be problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki reiterated his view that the situation in the Democratic
Congo has to be stabilized, and the first step is for the
political militia in the country to be disarmed.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki also voiced his concern that the Congolese government is
a bit hasty in its transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who this week celebrated one year in power, told Mbeki
on Friday that a constitutional committee had been set up to
draft a constitution for the country, a referendum would be held
on it by the end of the year and elections were planned for next
June.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki warned that there could be "a grave difficulty" if the
country went ahead with the schedule and the new constitution
were rejected due to improper preparation.

<HEADLINE> Moi Calls for "Homegrown Solutions" to African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi called in Kampala Tuesday for "homegrown
solutions" to African problems.
</P>
<P>
"We in Africa are duty bound to find our own homegrown
solutions to the problems facing our people," the Kenya News
Agency quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a state banquet given in his honor by his Ugandan
counterpart Yoweri Museveni, Moi stressed that "we cannot rely on
outsiders to solve our problems."
</P>
<P>
President Moi, who left here Tuesday for a three-day official
visit to Uganda, stated that "it is our resolve and determination
that will decide the future of our countries."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the important role of regional cooperation in
promoting development, saying that east African cooperation is
the key to the future development of the region.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve faster economic growth, he said, three
east African countries of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania must
continue to strengthen the role of their regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
President Moi Tuesday held discussions with President Museveni
of Uganda on issues of trade, immigration, transport,
communication, security, energy and industry.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the conditions of the Mombasa-Nairobi road, the
Kenyan head of state noted that his government is currently
engaged in the rehabilitation of the road.
</P>
<P>
The road, which is a vital route for Ugandan import and
export, and was badly damaged by the El Nino-charged heavy rains
during the past several months, is of equal concern to Kenya, the
president pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that the problems resulting in clearance and
security of Ugandan goods at the port of Mombasa were being
addressed and would be streamlined.
</P>
<P>
He observed that African countries needed to work much more
closely as they have by and large similar problems, especially
the debt burden.

<HEADLINE> Pangalos Says No Package Solution to Greek-Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos stressed here Tuesday that there could be no issue of a
package solution to the differences between Greece and neighboring
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Pangalos said that the
statements by U.S. President Bill Clinton linking the Cyprus
issue, Greek-Turkish disputes in the Aegean Sea and Turkey's
European vocation contained "certain contradictions."
</P>
<P>
While urging both Greece and Turkey to make difficult decisions
to settle their problems, Clinton said in London Monday that he
did not think they could solve one problem in isolation from the
others. He thought they had to move forward on all these problems,
Cyprus, the Aegean jurisdictional disputes and the role of Turkey
in Europe's future.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said that they were different issues which must be
dealt with through different procedures.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue was an international problem of "invasion and
occupation" which concerns the international community, he said,
adding that it is not a Greek-Turkish issue.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that here was no more margin for concessions in
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
As for relations between Greece and Turkey, the minister said
that Greece was demanding nothing from Turkey which was contrary
to the present status quo and the rules of international law.
</P>
<P>
It was Turkey's "legally unfounded, groundless and inadequately
defined" claims against Greece created a climate of tension, he
said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Turkey's bid to join the European Union (EU),
Pangalos said that Turkey had the prospect of taking part in the
European conference, later becoming a candidate for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas rejected Clinton's proposal for talks on the Cyprus issue,
Greek-Turkish relations and EU-Turkish relations as a package.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Greece's position would not change on the
three issues which were entirely different ones.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have been at odds for decades over their
disputes in the Aegean Sea and the protracted Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> London Becomes World's Largest Equity Investment Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- London has replaced Tokyo as the
largest equity investment center in the world, with the funds
under management rising 48 percent to 1.808 billion US dollars
last year, the Financial Times newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report by Technimetrics, a US-owned research and
database company, the newspaper said that Tokyo, once the fund
management capital in the world, has dropped to fourth place, with
the value of equity funds managed by institutional investors there
plunging 32 percent last year to only 1,104 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the funds under management in New York and
Boston also increased to make the two cities to take the second
and third places respectively in the world ranking.
</P>
<P>
The company blamed Tokyo's decline partly on Japan's falling
currency, which Monday touched a 6.5-year low of Y135.5 against
the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Japanese stock market weakness last year, the
decline in other Asian stock markets and the growing tendency for
Japanese investors to conduct trades overseas to avoid expensive
red tape all contributed to undermine Tokyo's position.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that London's rise in the world ranking
benefitted partly from the fact that US investors were
increasingly diversifying into European stocks.

<HEADLINE> Africa Cannot Be Cut From Rest of World: Chiluba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said Tuesday that Africa cannot be cut off from the rest of the
world as it is part of the globalization process and it needs
time to catch up with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president made the remarks in Windhoek, capital of
Namibia, according to Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Africa cannot enhance in a short spell of time what Europe or
America enhanced, said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot develop in 50 years what America achieved in 200
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Give us an opportunity to walk and run, but do not make us
tumble and fall," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba was one member of a panel that is discussing the "rule
of global cooperation in southern Africa."
</P>
<P>
The southern African region appreciated investment with
transfer of technology to where they are investing, Chiluba said,
adding that investors will be interested in making profits which
they could repatriate.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiluba said, African governments will not allow
investors to introduce regulations in their industries.
</P>
<P>
New investments to Africa should appreciate the rule of law as
codified in national constitutions, said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
He added that unless there is the rule of law, there could be
no strong economies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that it is wrong to compare Africa to Europe or
America and expect the continent to democratize at fast pace.
</P>
<P>
Africa needs to be given enough time for the democratization
process, said the Zambian president.

<HEADLINE> Violence in Israeli-Occupied Territories Deplored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
issued a statement on Tuesday deploring a recent outbreak of
violence in Gaza and the West Bank where a number of Palestinians
were killed and many injured by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
The statement read by Council President Njuguna Mahugu of Kenya
said that the Council extends its condolences to the families of
the victims and reiterates the spirit of Security Council
resolutions while calling for maximum restraint to avoid any
further escalation in the situation.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place last Thursday when Palestinians
demonstrated marking the 50th anniversary of their struggle against
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Council also expresses its support for the peace process in
the Middle East, Mahugu said.
</P>
<P>
The Council met this morning to hear U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's briefing on his recent trip to Africa and consult on
other matters.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the Council consultations, Annan told reporters
that the peace process in the Middle East requires compromises and
flexibility on all sides and he hoped that the efforts being made
by the U.S., Palestinians and Israelis "will yield some results".

<HEADLINE> Mandela: WTO Ought to Take into Account Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
should take into account the concerns of its members from the
developing world, said South African President Nelson Mandela here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The developing countries were not able to ensure that the WTO
rules accommodated their realities," Mandela said, because it was
"mainly the pre-occupations and problems of the advanced
industrial economies that shaped the agreement".
</P>
<P>
"The sections dealing with the developing countries and the
least developed countries were not adequately thought through,"
said the South African president at Tuesday's plenary of the
second WTO ministerial conference, marking the 50th anniversary of
the WTO's predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT).
</P>
<P>
While reaffirming that the multilateral trading system is
fundamentally correct, Mandela called on powerful economies to
"stop applying unilateral measures".
</P>
<P>
For the developing countries's part, he said, they must
negotiate their specific needs within framework, adding that the
developing countries should now give leadership to the development
of a positive agenda that fully addresses their needs.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit its highest
level against the yen since August 1991 on Tuesday as investors
cautiously watched the development in Indonesia's situation.

<P>
The U.S. currency also slipped against the mark in a quiet,
nervous day of trading.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 136.44 yen,
up from 136.25 late Monday, to mark its highest point since August
30, 1991.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also was changing hands at 1.7834 marks, down from
1.7850.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve's decision to hold rates steady today was
widely expected and had little effect on trading after its
announcement.

1.4801 Swiss francs, down from 1.4867; 5.9800 French francs, down
