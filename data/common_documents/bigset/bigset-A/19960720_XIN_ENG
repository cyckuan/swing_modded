<HEADLINE> India's Economic Growth Depends on Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram said today that slow pace of reforms in the key
government-dominated infrastructure can undermine accelerating
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
When tabling the 1995-96 updated economic survey in the
parliament,
he said that indications of a slow pace of economic reforms in
infrastructure sectors could affect the recent pattern of
accelerating growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the rail and road transport system and
port capacity are also under strain and these are the areas where
economic reforms have been slow to take off.
</P>
<P>
The growth of agriculture and allied sectors which was on the
low side at 2.4 percent in 1995-96 is projected again at 2.3
percent by the Central Statistical Organization for 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Sustained acceleration in overall GDP growth requires an
increase in agricultural growth to around 4 percent, the survey
said.
</P>
<P>
The central challenge facing the government was how to contain
the net borrowing requirements of the central government, the
survey added.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Streamline Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said Friday the new cabinet would be streamlined and
it would not be a "coalition government."
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the Russian Regions parliamentary group,
Chernomyrdin said the new government would have fewer staff, with
seven deputy prime ministers, including three first deputy prime
ministers in charge of the economic, social and industrial affairs.
</P>
<P>
The current Russian cabinet has 10 deputy prime ministers
including three first deputy prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin also planned to reduce the number of ministries
and institutions from the present 100 to 50-60.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "a coalition government is not for today's
Russia," and the government would rule out any possibility for
other parties joining the government.
</P>
<P>
However, he said President Boris Yeltsin, who was said to have
full right to appoint all government members, would invite some
parliamentary members to take part in government work.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin declared earlier that Chernomyrdin would remain at his
present post.

<P>
HARARE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Two thirds of Zimbabwean
ministries are corresponding to a United Nations sponsored
project to improve efficiency in the civil service.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Moscow Stresses Dudayev Is Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A Russian official stated today
that he was sure the Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev
was dead.
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely sure that Dzhokhar Dudayev is not alive," said
Sergei Stepashin, secretary of Russia's State Committee for the
Settlement of the Chechen Crisis.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a statement made by Dudayev's second
son-in-law, Salman Raduyev, a rebel field commander, that Dudayev
was not dead.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin stressed that this claim could not be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
The statement, made by Raduyev to Western reporters in
Gudermes, the second largest city in Chechnya, was aired on
Grozny Television, the regional capital's television, Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency said today that what made the
situation ever more complicated was that Raduyev himself had been
believed dead. Local media reported earlier that he was presumably
killed in a quarrel with another Chechen field commander earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
In the video broadcast by Grozny Television, the person meeting
western reporters was in camouflage uniform and wore dark
glasses. He was sitting against the background of a flag of the
self-styled "Republic of Ichkeria," as the Chechens call their
land.
</P>
<P>
The resurrected Raduyev, or the person claiming to be him, said
in the interview that he had been away in Germany for treatment
where he underwent plastic surgery. People who knew him well said
his words about undergoing plastic surgery seemed rather
convincing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Stepashin said he was sure it was Raduyev who had
spoken to the reporters. "Raduyev was gravely wounded. His face
has somewhat changed because he underwent plastic surgery,"
Stepashin said. He said he did not know from which source the
media had received information about Raduyev's death.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier local reports, Raduyev died in a hospital
in Urus Martan, 15 kilometers south of Grozny, in March from
serious wounds in the chest and the head.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin pointed out that Raduyev's statement was triggered by
a "desire to draw attention to himself and call on paramilitary
groups to fight on against giaours."
</P>
<P>
Raduyev won prominence by masterminding a bold attack on the
town of Kizlyar in neighbouring Daghestan, taking hundreds of
patients hostage.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin doubted whether separatist leader Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev, or his chief of staff, Aslan Maskhadov, kept the mood
of the Chechen rebels under control. Moscow had asked Yandarbiyev
how much was under his influence, but there was no response,
Stepashin noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials in the Kremlin believe Raduyev's
statement was a mere propaganda trick aimed at boosting morale
among rebel fighters. There remain some 15,000 armed rebels in
Chechnya, observers here believe.

<HEADLINE> Greece Dismisses Linkage With Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Civil Aviation Authority
today angrily dismissed press speculation attempting to implicate
Athens airport security in explosion of a TWA airliner Wednesday
after take-off from New York.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot understand this organized attack on Athens airport,"
Dionysis Kalofonos, director of administration at Greece's Civil
Administration Service, said. "This foreign press speculation is
an attempt to mislead public opinion".
</P>
<P>
"We have always worked with U.S. agencies to protect U.S.
citizens abroad," he added.
</P>
<P>
TWA has an agreement with Athens airport to conduct its own
security checks on passengers and luggage, on all flights to the
U.S., he said.
</P>
<P>
"Security measures at Athens airport are the best in the world
because we did not only go through a three-fold check, it went
through a five-fold check with TWA," he added.
</P>
<P>
Apart from stringent Greek checks, TWA's own equipment scans
passengers and their luggage at the check-in counter. An
additional TWA check on passengers and hand luggage is conducted
before the aircraft is boarded.
</P>
<P>
TWA aircraft are parked at a site chosen by TWA's security and
guarded by Greek anti-terrorist police, a regular police patrol
and TWA security, who are the only ones permitted aboard the plane
while it is on the tarmac and have responsibility for supervising
cleaning and other tarmac services.
</P>
<P>
He said the Greek authorities were satisfied that security on
the flight was in accordance with the regulations and that there
was no reason to conduct any further inquiry at this end.
</P>
<P>
The plane came down, he added, after the Athens-New York flight
had terminated.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we, and international law, are concerned, our duty
ends when a flight leaves Athens," he said. The moment the plane
was assigned to a new flight, the responsibility for it rested
with Kennedy airport, he added.
</P>
<P>
All 229 passengers and crew of the Boeing 747 died in the
crash, the cause of which is as yet unknown.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Fijian Foreign Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUVA, Fiji, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that there are
favorable factors for the further development of friendly
cooperation between China and Fiji.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived here Thursday for a two-day visit to Fiji,
told his Fijian counterpart Filipe Bole that the two countries
have much in common although they differ enormously in terms of
area and population.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Fiji belong to the developing world and both are
preoccupied with boosting their economies and raising the living
standard of their peoples, Qian said, according to Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang, who briefed reporters about the
talks between the two foreign ministers here today.
</P>
<P>
Fiji is a full member of the South Pacific Forum (SPF) while
China a full dialogue partner of the forum, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
In a broader sense, it can be said that both China and Fiji,
which lies at the heart of the Southwest Pacific, are situated in
the Asia-Pacific, a region which enjoys a relatively stable
political situation and the fastest growing economy in the world,
he said.
</P>
<P>
There are the sound basis and favorable conditions for the
further development of friendly cooperation between the two
countries, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have seen a big rise in trade between the two
countries and Fiji is now among China's biggest trading partners
in the South Pacific region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said bilateral economic cooperation is expanding, including
that in culture, education and aviation. There are greater
potentials for cooperation in trade and economy, Qian added.
</P>
<P>
Bole agreed that potentials remain to be tapped in trade,
adding that greater strides could be made in cooperation in
ship-building, aviation, construction and some other areas.
</P>
<P>
The Fijians are beginning to benefit from some projects of
economic assistance provided by China, Bole said.
</P>
<P>
Bole stressed that there will be no change whatever in the
Fijian government's one China policy and that Taiwan is an
inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed appreciation for the Fijian government's
position on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, the two ministers signed an exchange of
notes on China providing assistance to Fiji.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Chinese foreign minister also met with
Ieremia Tabai, secretary general of the South Pacific Forum.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction with the relationship between the SPF
members and China, Tabai said there has been very good dialogue
between them.
</P>
<P>
The idea of setting up a SPF trade office in Beijing has
received a positive response from China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of such an office in China will help promote
trade and cooperation between the two sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the SPF is playing a great role in enhancing regional
cooperation, promoting peace and stability in the South Pacific
and developing regional economy.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that there will be increased mutually
beneficial cooperation between China and the SPF.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes the establishment of a SPF trade office in
China, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Qian and Tabai signed an exchange of notes
on China providing assistance to the SPF secretariat.

<HEADLINE> Sub-regional Interpol Office Opens in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A southern African regional office
of the International Policing Organization, Interpol, was opened
here today, just months before the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) free movement protocol agreement is effected.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa said the
establishment of an Interpol sub-regional office will help member
states cope with cross-border crime.
</P>
<P>
"Free movement of people in the region will be a big challenge
for the sub-regional office as we await the ratification of the
protocol by the end of the year," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"As our countries continue to strengthen their economies, we
must at the same time underscore the point that without security,
stability and prosperity within the region, there can be no
socio-economic development," added Dabengwa.
</P>
<P>
Interpol has 176 members and the Harare office is the second
in Africa after Abidjan, Cote D'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The organization, the second largest after the United Nations,
uses its information network to trace and apprehend international
criminals.

Bosnian Serb leadership announcing the immediate and permanent
withdrawal of Radovan Karadzic from all political activities.
</P>
<P>
Since Karadzic had resigned as president of the Bosnian Serbs'
"Sprska Republic" and head of the ruling Serb Democratic Party, "an
important obstacle has been removed for the holding of free and
fair elections on 14 September".
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief's statement demanded that Karadzic be handed
over to the International War Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. It
said NATO would remain cautious and vigilant that the Bosnian Serb
leadership implement its statement in earnest.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Resume Land Aid to Zimbabwe: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Lands and Water
Resources Minister Kumbirai Kangai said today the British
government has agreed to fund the land resettlement program in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Kangai told a news conference that he, together with Minister
of Local Government, Rural and Urban Development John Nkomo, met
British Overseas Development Minister Baroness Lynda Chalker
early this month and she reaffirmed her government's commitment
to the program.
</P>
<P>
"Our mission to London was successful because we wanted the
British government to recommit their earlier commitment in 1979
at the Lancaster House conference on facilitating the
resettlement program," said Kangai.
</P>
<P>
The British government is going to send a review mission to
look at how the land reform program could be carried out,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
As he was addressing the news conference, British High
Commissioner Martin Williams told the Zimbabwe News Agency that
his government will not provide new aid for the land
redistribution program unless the Zimbabwe government acquires
land on the principle of willing seller-willing buyer.
</P>
<P>
"We have confirmed our own willingness to provide assistance
to the land issue provided under the context of a satisfactory
policy framework. We have proposed the idea of a roundtable
conference to enable interested parties to join and some donors
to contribute to the cost of the program," said Williams.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government needs about 100 million US Dollars to
resettle over 80,000 families, 20 percent of whom have to be war
veterans.

PHNOM PENH, July 18 (Xinhua) -- All nationalities in Cambodia
are equal and should unite to build the country, says Cambodian
King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the delegates to a national minority conference on

The King called on them to unite, help, support and respect
each other and build the country into a prosperous, progressive,
civilized and peaceful nation.

"Khmerized."
</P>
<P>
All nationalities had the right to choose their own beliefs
under the constitution, and the Khmer would never force other
nationalities to believe in Buddhism, the King said.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Ruling Council Strapped in Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's six-member ruling council
could no long sustain itself because of lack of funds, according
to senior Liberian official.
</P>
<P>
The interim government has no alternative but to count on the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for funds to
support the forthcoming election in the war-torn country,
Liberian Information, Culture and Tourism Minister Victoria
Raffell said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister who arrived in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, last
week to seek assistance said that the only way out for the ruling
council and the ECOWAS member nations is to disarm the warring
factions in Liberia and organize a free election.
</P>
<P>
Situation is extremely serious in Liberia, where 95 percent of
the country's rural populace have no security since both the
police and the ECOWAS peacekeeping force are mainly deployed in
the capital city of Monrovia, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Monrovia remains unsafe although there is fragile peace
following the suspension of hostilities among warring factions
recently, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Euro-Asia Meeting to Tackle Trade and Investment Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Top officials from Europe and
Asia will meet in Brussels next week to discuss ways of improving
the investment climate worldwide and to prepare the ground for
solid measures to increase trade and investment between the two
regions.
</P>
<P>
Taking their cue from the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit in
Bangkok last March, senior officials from 25 European and Asian
countries will join the European Commission (EC) and the Irish
Presidency for two days of intensive discussions on July 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC, the main focus of the meeting will be to
meld European and Asian views on how to liberalize investment at
world levels.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also initiate preparations for a strategy to
reduce regulatory barriers hindering European exports to Asia,
which currently run at around 80,000 million U.S. dollars a year,
and vice-versa, while preparing an investment promotion action
plan.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM Summit called for an informal senior officials'
meeting on how to promote economic cooperation between the two
regions, and in particular the liberalization and facilitation of
trade and investment, with an initial emphasis on WTO issues.
</P>
<P>
The growing importance of economic relations between Europe and
Asia is hard to exaggerate. Asia itself will account for a massive
slice of world trade in the next century, generating half the
growth in global trade from now until the year 2000, according to
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The European Union now trades more with Asia than it does with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to EC statistics, its trade with all countries of
Asia was worth 312.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1994, while trade
with the US for the same year was 235 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The EU said it was well placed to take advantage of these new
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
With its advanced technological base, Europe could meet the
region's rising demand for sophisticated consumer goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
Demand would soar, too, in other sectors where EU companies had
a comparative advantage such as banking, energy, environmental
technologies and transport equipment.
</P>
<P>
However, it was clear from the statistics that European
companies could do further trade exporting and investing more in
Asia, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today celebrated his 78th birthday in Kwazulu/Natal Province with
more than 2,000 disabled children from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his birthday address at Hilton College outside
Pietermaritzburg, Mandela said: "Today we acknowledge that for
disabled children much, much more must be done, more to meet
their needs, more to ensure that they are fully integrated in
society, and more to make them feel that they belong to the
communities in which they live."
</P>
<P>
The disadvantaged children attending the party were just some
of those who had not been receiving the care and assistance from
society which they deserved, said the president.
</P>
<P>
A cheerful looking Mandela, who turned 78 on Thursday, arrived
at his birthday party in an air force helicopter from his
Johannesburg's home earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela also highlighted the need for
government to play an active role in assisting the disabled.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is working towards a comprehensive
policy framework and effective anti-discriminatory legislation to
equalize opportunities for the disabled as integral members of
the society.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sponsors used the occasion to donate wheelchairs
and other health equipment to many of the children.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lends 21.4 Bln Dlrs for Fiscal 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today said its
new lending commitments to developing countries totaled 21.4
billion U.S. dollars in fiscal year 1996, which ended on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The figure, which consists of both the market-rate loans made
by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD) and the concessional credits made to the world's poorest
countries through the International Development Association (IDA),
is a slight drop from 22.5 billion dollars in fiscal 1995, but
little higher than 20.8 billion dollars in fiscal 1994.
</P>
<P>
The IBRD loan commitments in fiscal 1996 amounted to 14.5
billion dollars for 129 projects and 6.9 billion dollars in IDA
credits were approved to support 127 projects.
</P>
<P>
The combined IBRD and IDA gross disbursements at the end of
fiscal 1996 were 19.3 billion dollars, up from 18.5 billion
dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
New lending commitments to Africa in the year totaled 2.7
billion dollars, and all of this financing, supporting 53
projects, was in the form of IDA credits as compared with the
combined and totaled lending of 2.3 billion dollars in fiscal
1995. The four single sectors receiving most of the support in the
year were public sector management, transportation, agriculture
and the social sector.
</P>
<P>
The East Asia and Pacific region received over 5.4 billion
dollars in new lending commitments, 4.25 billion dollars for the
IBRD and 1.16 billion dollars for the IDA as against the combined
6 billion dollars in fiscal 1995.
</P>
<P>
In South Asia, 3 billion dollars in new commitments were
approved in fiscal 1996, of this 1.2 billion dollars was from the
IBRD and 1.8 billion dollars was from the IDA. The figure is
virtually unchanged from the fiscal 1995 combined lending to the
region.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank commitments to Latin America and the Caribbean
in fiscal 1996 totaled 4.4 billion dollars. One-fourth of the
total lending to the region, roughly 1.1 billion dollars, went to
back efforts in population, health, and nutrition. Loans to the
region in fiscal 1995 were over 6 billion dollars, largely due to
loans to soften the efforts of the economic crisis in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The countries of Europe and Central Asia saw 61 projects
totaling 4.2 billion dollars approved in fiscal 1996 as against
the combined total lending of 4.5 billion dollars for 58 projects
in fiscal 1995.
</P>
<P>
New commitments to the countries of the Middle East and North
Africa in fiscal 1996 amounted to 1.6 billion dollars, up from 979
million dollars in the previous year, which represents 61 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
Among the top 10 borrowers in the year include China with 2.97
billion dollars, India 2.077 billion dollars, Russia 1.816 billion
dollars and Indonesia 1.509 billion dollars. For the first time,
Vietnam is one of the World Bank's top 10 borrowers for the fiscal
year, with support totaling 502 million dollars. But India was the
largest recipient of IDA credits in fiscal 1996, with 1.3 billion
dollars for nine projects.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Cautioned Against Promiscuity Induced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan National AIDS Committee
has cautioned Kenyans against promiscuity to avoid contracting
the killer disease of AIDS which is reportedly on the increase in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Vice Chairman of the committee Sobbie Mulindi said the spread
of AIDS in Kenya is far from being controlled and the country now
ranks the third in the number of AIDS cases reported globally.
</P>
<P>
So far, around 80,000 AIDS cases have been reported in the
country, and estimated one million people are carrying HIV virus
which causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the workshop on information education and
communication at Naivasha Country Club today, Mulindi said the
spread of AIDS should be an issue of great concern to all Kenyans
especially the policy makers to find a solution to control the
killer disease.
</P>
<P>
Mulindi reminded Kenyans that so far a cure for AIDS has not
been found and that the trial drugs on the disease should not
make them complacent and indulge in loose moral activities that
expose them to the disease.

<HEADLINE> All IOC Member Delegations Accreditated for Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Juan Antonio Samaranch, president
of the International Olympic Committee, confirmed here Friday that
all the 197 IOC members will take part in the Centennial Olympic
Games to be opened later.
</P>
<P>
It will become the first record of the Games when members of
all the 197 delegations march in the Olympic Stadium in the heat
of this southern American city.
</P>
<P>
While all the delegations have showed up at the accreditation
center, "athletes of three more countries will arrive in Atlanta
after the opening ceremony", said Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
At his first press conference for the Games, Samaranch said,
"We are very much excited and looking forward to the ceremony, and
the success in Atlanta will be the success of the Olympic
movement."
</P>
<P>
As Atlanta marks the debut in the Olympics of softball, beach
volleyball and mountain biking, Samaranch said that the more
important thing is the number of athletes, not the number of
sports, in the Games which boasts a record of 10,000-plus athletes
from all over the wolrd.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 40 percent are women with many delegations having
more women participants than their men compatriots, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
On the participation of professionals in the Olympic Games,
Samaranch said, "Our IOC policy on participation remains the same
with the best athletes in the world," and Barcelona was the first
time only for NBA players in the Olympics, but not for the
professionals in other sports.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the question whether commercialization violates
the Olympic spirits, the president said, "We are the only sport
organization without billboards in the stadium, and that's a
tradition that has been kept at present and will continue in the
future."
</P>
<P>
On the prospect of his run for another term of the presidency,
Samaranch said he will make the decision either by the end of the
year or at the beginning of next year, and it will depend on his
health and advice from the IOC members.

<HEADLINE> Japan Confident to Win Olympic Swimming Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan, the Asian swimming
powerhouse, is going to launch a huge Olympic medal haul in the
pool at the forthcoming Centennial Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Tsutomu Hayashi, leader of the Japanese swimming squad, said
that this time would be their "best shot at the Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
"We would give everything that we have." he said.
</P>
<P>
All members of the Japanese swimming team are living in the
Olympic Villiage and began their training here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Head coach Toshiaki Nomoto said, "Some of my athletes seem a
little bit neverous while most of the teammembers are quiet
relaxed."
</P>
<P>
He added that the swimmers were metally ready for the big
clash. "And there are no injury and disease problems in our team."
</P>
<P>
"Under normal circumstances, we would score good results in the
Olympics." the head coach said. "The training times for most of
the swimmers are pretty good, faster than the training time in
Japan."
</P>
<P>
Japan burst onto the international scene in the pool, specially
in the women's butterfly events.
</P>
<P>
Ayari Aoyama, 14, a raw junior high school student, clocked
58.83 second, the year's best time, in the women's 100m butterfly
at the Japanese Olympic trials in May.
</P>
<P>
However, her coach Koichi Fujino said that she still didn't
find her form and only put up a mediocre performance in recent
training.
</P>
<P>
"But I do not give her too much advice. I just let her relaxed
and make her control the situation by herself."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, her teammate Hitomi Kashima also clocked the year's
best of 2:08.09 in the 200m butterfly, boosting Japan's Olympic
gold medal hope.
</P>
<P>
Japan also has advantage in some other events. Defending
champion in the 200m breaststroke Kyoko Iwasaki is favored to add
one more medal to her credit.
</P>
<P>
"She is in her form now," said her coach Ryuichiro Mizuno. "The
pool here is nice and her stroke and kick is quite good, and I
think she will be better and better."
</P>
<P>
"She is metally stable and her experience at the last Olympics
will be of much help to her this time," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iwasaki, a "dark horse" in the pool at Barcelona, collected
Japan's only gold in the pool four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Suzu Chiba, the Pan Pacific gold medalist here last year, is
also expected to take another crown for her country, in the
women's 200m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
"She has successfully passed the trials and other international
competitions. So I think she also could deal with the pressure
though this time it is the Olympics," said her coach Matsuda.
</P>
<P>
Backstroke Miki Nakao, second-ranked in the 200m behind
Krisztina Egerszegi of Hungary, is also a Japanese hopeful for an
Olympic medal in the pool.
</P>
<P>
Yoshinobu Miyazaki, one of Japan's male swimmers, said: "I'm a
secret weapon of the Japanese team." In fact, the Japanese squad
has too many "underdogs" to make an impact at the Georgia Tech
University Acuatic Center in coming days.
</P>
<P>
The head coach said that women's butterfly is the most hopeful
Olympic medal event for them while he tipped the Chinese as their
most serious rivals.

<HEADLINE> Asia Improves A Lot at Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The level of the Asian sports has
improved a lot in the recent years and become more and more
important to the Olympic family, Deputy Chef de Misson of the
Thailand Olympic delegation said.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted with the development of the Asian sports," said
the Deputy Chef de Mission Santiparb Tejavanija on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Asian sports were in the low position in the past, and most of
medals were taken by Europeans and Americans in both the Olympic
Games and world championships. But now we are getting better and
are among the bests in some events," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, which won a boxing bronze medal at the last Olympics
in Barcelona, sent 39 athletes to participate in nine sports
including athletics, swimming, boxing, Judo, shooting, badminton,
yachting, table tennis and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
To take a boxing gold medal is the goal of the Thai
delegation. "We are hopefully to win more than one gold in some
small classes of boxing. As in the men's 200-meter breaststroke
swimming and badminton, we are also capable of winning medals."

<HEADLINE> WTO Becomes Popular Arena to Settle Trade Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Only 18 months after coming into
being, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has become an
increasingly popular arena for both developed and developing
countries, large and small, to settle their trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest WTO statistics released today,
altogether 50 disputes have been brought to the Geneva-based world
trade watchdog since its creation in January 1995 -- about the
same number that its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT), saw in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Of the 50 disputes, the U.S. is a complainant in 17 and a
defendant in nine. The European Union is a complainant in six and
a defendant in 11. Japan is a complainant in one and a defendant
in eight.
</P>
<P>
In comparison to the old GATT rules, the new WTO dispute
settlement procedure is more rapid, more automatic and more
enforceable.
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, countries can no longer block an adverse
ruling by an independent WTO panel. Instead, they have the right
to appeal. But if it is denied by the WTO appellate body,
countries concerned must comply, or they will be subject to
authorized trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The WTO's ability to enforce trade judgements has also prompted
developing countries to make more use of its dispute procedure.
They launched 20 complaints to the WTO so far, including six
against the U.S. and seven against the EU.
</P>
<P>
The only case that has gone through the full WTO dispute
settlement procedure so far is a complaint by Venezuela and Brazil
about U.S. environmental standards for gasoline imports. After the
failure of an appeal, the U.S. said in June that it would comply
with the WTO ruling.

<HEADLINE> Cambodians: "We Are Back" to Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- After 24 years of absence,
Cambodia is finally able to send five athletes to compete in the
Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Runyi Prum, chief of the Cambodian delegation, said he does not
expect any medals from his five athletes, who will compete in
men's marathon, wrestling, women's sprint and both men's and
women's swimming.
</P>
<P>
"We have three objectives," Prum said. He said their first
objective for coming to Atlanta is to "rejoin the international
Olympic family". He said his country last participated in the
Olympic Games in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia also participated in the Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964
and the Melbourne Olympic Games in 1956. This is the country's
fourth time in the Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
Prum said before they came, they printed a large number of
T-shirts with the slogan: "We Are Back." They intended to pass
them around here, but the box containing the T-shirts got lost on
their way here.
</P>
<P>
Prum said their second objective is to raise their national
flag and the third, to make friends with athletes from all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
"Participation will let our athletes, especially the young,
learn from the world's best sportsmen and gain experience in
international competition," Prum said.
</P>
<P>
He said his country will send a much larger team to the next
Asian Games, with a soccer team, a basketball team and a
volleyball team.

<HEADLINE> Albanian, Italian Foreign Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini and his Albanian counterpart Tritan Shehu today exchanged
views in a "cordial atmosphere" on bilateral relations, Albania's
entry into the European Union (EU) and cooperation in judicial
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Shehu noted that in the process of economic privatization,
Albania has provided good opportunities of investment and trade
for Italian businessmen. He asked Italian businessmen to make good
use of these opportunities, the Foreign Ministry said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it's Albania's wish and choice to become a
member of the EU and that Albania has made positive efforts to
attain this goal.
</P>
<P>
Shehu underlined the importance of enhancing bilateral
cooperation in economy, trade, judicial affairs and crackdown on
illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Dini said Italy understood and supported
Albania's wish of joining the EU.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy had made efforts to help Albania on this issue
when it was acting as the rotating president of the EU in the
first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the transition towards market economy, Dini said,
Albania should speed up the democratization process, including
political dialogue between the government and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
This is very important to the forthcoming October elections in
Albania, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shehu will also meet leaders of the Italian National Alliance
and Partito Popopare (the People's Party).

<HEADLINE> Israel, Lebanon to Swap Bodies of Soldiers, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese minister announced here
this afternoon that negotiations currently mediated by Germans
between Lebanon and Israel on swapping remains of Israeli soldiers
and guerrillas as well as war prisoners would achieve results in
48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Michel al-Murr said that the swap deal, in
which the Israeli army and the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, are due to exchange the remains, would be conducted
before the very eyes of the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Murr, who is also the Lebanese deputy prime minister, told a
press conference that he had a meeting earlier today with Berand
Schmidbauer, German minister of state for security affairs and his
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in the presence of Ramond Roufayel,
director general of the Public Security of Lebanon's Interior
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Schmidbauer arrived in Beirut this morning from Damascus for
a brief visit to this country.
</P>
<P>
The visit came as part of Schmidbauer's mission to map out the
terms for Hezbollah and Israel to exchange the remains of two
Israeli soldiers in Hezbollah's hand and of the militiamen of the
Israel's client South Lebanon Army seized by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange will be completed with Lebanese government's
knowledge and under its supervision and by the goodwill
efforts of the German government which sent Minister Schmidbauer
to make contact with all the parties," said the Lebanese interior
minister.
</P>
<P>
He expected that "positive results and success" would emerge
from the contacts in 48 hours and "a final result will be achieved
by next Sunday."
</P>
<P>
After talks with the Lebanese interior minister and before its
departure back to Damascus, the German delegation held a meeting
with Hezbollah officers inside the Beirut International Airport
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz announced earlier that
the exchange would be carried out by two steps, the first
step for swapping the bodies and the second for exchanging
the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time for Hezbollah and the Jewish
state to exchange the bodies of those killed in clashes in
south Lebanon and the prisoners the two sides captured from
each other in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
But Israel insists that before knowing the fate of a
missing Israeli airforce pilot, Ron Arad, it will not release
Hezbollah leaders Sheikh Abdel Kalim Abeid and Mostafa Dirani,
who were abducted from their homes by Israeli commandos
in 1989 and 1991 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah denies that it has any informations on the
Israeli navigator, whom Israel believed to be the only one
alive among six Israeli soldiers missing in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Arad went missing after his plane was shot down in
south Lebanon on October 16, 1986.
</P>
<P>
The remains of the Israeli soldiers held by Hezbollah are
those of Yossi Fink and Rahamim Alsheikh, who, Israel said,
were killed after being captured by Hezbollah in an ambush
in south Lebanon in 1986.

<HEADLINE> South Korea, Japan to Talk on Marine Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Japan will hold
talks in Seoul in mid-August to set the boundaries of the
200-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) under the
U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Foreign Ministry Spokesman Suh Dae-won said that
Director General of the Asia-Pacific Affairs Bureau of the
Ministry, Kim Ha-joong, and his Japanese counterpart, Ryojo Kato,
would lead their respective delegations to the talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides would exchange views on how to set the boundaries
and how to proceed with the talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks will be held under the agreement reached by South
Korean President Kim Young-sam and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto in their meeting in Cheju, South Korea's southern resort
island, last month.
</P>
<P>
The Convention on the Law of the Sea guarantees each state
rights to marine and seabed resources in seas extending up to 200
nautical miles from the coastline.
</P>
<P>
However, no part of the sea between South Korea and Japan is
wider than 400 nautical miles, making it necessary for the two
sides to negotiate the boundaries.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- For the eight athletes from tiny
European country Andora, the participation is the most important
thing at the Centennial Olympic Games which opens here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are not expected to grab an Olympic medal at the coming
Games," said Gerand Barcia, 33, who will compete in shooting. "for
us, to take part in the Olympics is just enough."
</P>
<P>
The veteran shooter, who had competed in several World Cup and
European shooting tournaments, said that it was his first Olympic
appearance.

<P>
"For most of the members, this is the first time to compete in
the Olympics. The three yatching competitors will participate for
the second time in the Olympics," he said.
</P>
<P>
The tiny country, with a population of 6,000, will compete in
the events of shooting, swimming, track and field, judo and
yachting.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stresses Need for U.S. Military Cut in Okinawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Defense Agency published an
annual report today emphasizing the need for a cut in the
U.S. military presence in the southwestern island prefecture of
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention details of an ongoing
dispute over an Okinawa landowner's request for the return of his
land in the U.S. Sobe communications facility, in the village of
Yomitan.
</P>
<P>
The Okinawa landowner, Shoichi Chibana, 47, will file a lawsuit
next week against the Japanese government, demanding the return of
a 236-square-meter plot within the Sobe facility, reports say.
</P>
<P>
Although the lease of the land expired at the end of March, the
Japanese government allowed the U.S. forces to continue with the
use of it without any clear legal basis.
</P>
<P>
After Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota refused to sign documents
needed for continued renting of the land, the central government
filed a suit against him and the first hearing was scheduled for
July 29.
</P>
<P>
The local people in Okinawa have been outraged by the long-term
presence of the U.S. military which occupies about 75 percent of
the island land. The resentment against the U.S. forces has grown
since the rape of a local schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen last
September.
</P>
<P>
In April, the United States agreed to return some 20 percent of
the land it occupies in Okinawa Prefecture to the local landowners.
</P>
<P>
The annual report also warned that "opaque and uncertain
factors" remained in the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Not Opposed To Constitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
indicated today he has not ruled out the constitutional
amendments.
</P>
<P>
President Moi said that the constitution is an important
document which touches on the lives of all Kenyans and could not
be changed haphazardly.
</P>
<P>
The constitution could not be amended for the purposes of
serving the interests of only a few people, the president said,
adding that it could be amended only if the interests of all
Kenyans are taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
President Moi said this at his Kabarak home in Nakuru when he
received a goodwill delegation of both primary and secondary
school teachers from Nyeri District.
</P>
<P>
The president, however, does not specify on the date for the
constitution amendments.
</P>
<P>
Under the appeal of opposition parties, President Moi
announced his idea on constitution reform in his new year message
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Facing the pressure from the opposition parties on the
constitution reform, Kenyan Attorney General Amos Wako recently
ruled out constitution amendments before the next general
election dur for next year.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Assad Review Results of Netanyahu's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today made a phone call with his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad
for a review of the results of a visit to Egypt by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also exchanged views on the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to an official announcement here today, Egypt's
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will visit Syria soon to convey a
message from Mubarak to Assad on the detailed results of
Netanyahu's visit, which is viewed as a step in coordinating
stances among the Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will also hold talks with Syrian officials on means of
bolstering the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, President of Palestinian National
Authority Yasser Arafat will arrive here Saturday for talks with
Mubarak on the outcome of Netanyahu's visit to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who on many occasions vowed to take a tough line on
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, seemed to have somewhat softened
his previous stance after his two-hour meeting with Mubarak during
his brief working visit.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks with Mubarak, Netanyahu said that Israel
would honor its agreements signed with the Arabs including the
Palestinians. "We will stick to the terms of reference of the
Madrid peace conference," he said. "The terms of reference of
Madrid are what can united us around a common frame of reference."
</P>
<P>
But he said that there are "different interpretations" on the
land-for-peace principle and the way to apply it, indicating that
he still refuses to fully accept the principle, the basis for the
Middle East peace process since its inception in Madrid five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also reiterated his stance that Jerusalem will never
be divided again, though he said that the rights of Christians,
Moslems and Jews will be fully protected in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want Arab east Jerusalem as the capital of
their future independent state, while Netanyahu has said that
Jerusalem will remain Israel's eternal and undivisible capital.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, however, expressed his satisfaction with his talks
with Netanyahu, saying that there are great hopes that the peace
process will continue.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first Arab country to make peace with Israel in
1979, and has been playing a role as a mediator between the Jewish
state and other Arab countries ever since.

<HEADLINE> Pop Star Jackson to Perform in South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The American pop superstar
Michael Jackson will thrill South African fans in mid-January
next year when he performs in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg
in September this year.
</P>
<P>
Jackson made the surprising announcement at a press conference
at Sun City today. The pop king is scheduled to kick off "a world
history tour" in Prague, Czech Republic on September 7.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, arriving in South Africa for a three-day visit,
yesterday paid a courtesy visit to President Nelson Mandela
shortly after his arrival and sang happy birthday to the
president who turned 78 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the conference, Jackson said: "I'm
really excited about bringing the history tour to South Africa.
We are in negotiations right now with promoters."
</P>
<P>
"The people here have been so kind, I want to thank President
Mandela and the wonderful people of South Africa for this
gracious, really gracious, welcome to your wonderful country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Jackson's promoter Marcell Avram said although the
pop king did not take any questions at the conference, his
appearance was very rare.
</P>
<P>
Avram said: "I'm surprised and amazed by Michael for giving a
media conference for the first time."
</P>
<P>
He also said the history tour will be the star's biggest and
longest, running in three phases over a year.
</P>
<P>
From Prague, the show will run through eastern European
capitals including Budapest, Bucharest, Moscow and Warsaw before
heading to north Africa for concerts in Casablanca, Cairo and
Dubai.
</P>
<P>
The tour then goes on to the Far East, Australia and New
Zealand, followed by South Africa, southeast Asia, South
America, Europe, and ends in London.

UNITED NATIONS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Radovan Karadzic, former
Bosnian Serb leader, must be brought to justice as soon as
possible, a U.N. spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Fawzi, deputy spokesman for the United Nations

entire United Nations system and the international community when
I say this man must be brought to justice as soon as possible," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic resigned from all public offices Friday to clear the
way for post-war elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The NATO secretary-general soon expressed warm welcome to the
statement of the Bosnian Serb leadership announcing the immediate
and permanent withdrawal of Radovan Karadzic from all political
activities.

<P>
TUNIS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The volume of Tunisia's foreign
trade registered a one percent increase during the first half of
this year, compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing here today, Tunisian Minister of Trade
Monder al-Zanaydi said that Tunisia's exports in the six-month
period hit 2578.6 million Tunisian dinars (approximately the same

dinars.
</P>
<P>
The minister expected a readjustment of the Tunisian trade
beginning this month with a launching of 132 export-oriented
projects in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The total investments of the projects are estimated at 37
million dinars, which will significantly boost the Tunisian
exports, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is a slight increase in the trade with the
European Union and the Arab Maghreb Union, the two main trade
partners of Tunisia.

JOHANNESBURG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- South African Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel today called for cooperation among
southern African countries to halt the activities of
international crime syndicates.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the second African development conference on
economic crime in Midrand north of Johannesburg, Manuel said
southern Africa has been identified by syndicates as a potential
area for criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
Unless there is cooperation among the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) countries, crime syndicates would
flourish in the region, he said.
</P>

In his speech, Manuel also identified money laundering as one
of the serious cross-border crimes in the region, and called for
uniform legislation in the region to fight against the crime.

<HEADLINE> Chen Li to Meet Seles in First Round at Olympic Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Olympic debutent Chen Li
will meet world joint number one Monica Seles of the United States
in the women's singles first round at the tennis tournament in the
Centennial Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
According to the draw which was held here Friday morning,
Seles, who returned to tennis court last August after being
sidelined by a stab in Hamburg, Germany in 1993, will meet the
winner between Patricia Hy-Boulais of Canada and Rita Grande of
Italy.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Seles, who did not win a major tournament in the
past months, is figured out as the top favourite for the tennis
crown after her German rival Steffi Graf pulled out of the
Olympics with knee injury.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes on its way, Seles will meet third seed
Spaniard Vacario Sanchez in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, who had three Grand Slam singles titles in hands --
1989, 1994 French Open and 1994 U.S. Open, will have no difficulty
to beat Dominique Van Roost of the Netherlands in the first round.
</P>
<P>
While in the lower part of the draw, another Spaniard Conchita
Martinez, seeded second, will take on Patty Schnyder of
Switzerland in her opening match. If she passes through, she would
meet Anke Huber of Germany in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
In the men's draw, American player Andre Agassi, seeded first,
meets Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden in his first round match.
</P>
<P>
With the withdraw of Pete Sampras from the Olympics, Agassi,
sounded as the most hopeful for the men's title, will meet Goran
Ivanesivic of Croatia in the final.
</P>
<P>
Agassi has noted that the Olympic title is his priority this
year, and "I will do my best game after game," he said.
</P>
<P>
Without any major achievements in the past year, Agassi needs
to have something to prove himself on tennis court.

MAPUTO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has produced about
60,000 tons of cashew nuts in the 1995/96 agricultural year, a

</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism Abilio Bichinho

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today made a phone call to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to
discuss with him the results of a visit to Egypt Thursday by
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged views on prospects of resuming the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks following Netanyahu's visit to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu seemed to have somewhat softened his previous
hardline stance after his two-hour meeting with Mubarak Thursday.

<P>
"We will stick to the terms of reference of the Madrid peace
conference," he said. "The terms of reference of Madrid are what

But he said that there are "different interpretations" on the

Arafat is scheduled to arrive here Saturday for further talks

<P>
The Palestinian leader has voiced optimism about the completion
of the peace process on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian "Sawt el-Arab" or Voice of
Arabs radio today, Arafat said the summit meeting between Mubarak
and Netanyahu highlighted the importance of resuming the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also stressed the need of Israel's commitment to

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM to Visit Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan will go to northern Cyprus Saturday to attend the
celebration of the 22nd anniversary of the 1974 Turkish
intervention in the island.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan will be the second Turkish premier ever to visit
the island while in office, and the first prime minister
to attend the anniversary celebrations of the Turkish
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Late Turkish President Turgut Ozal paid an official visit to
northern Cyprus in his office as prime minister on July 2-3, 1986.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan served as deputy prime minister of Turkey's coalition
government which ordered the Turkish troops to intervene in the
island on July 20, 1974.
</P>
<P>
"Cyprus is the most important issue of Turkey, ... Peace and
order on the island is of great concern to us," Erbakan said after
his meeting with the Turkish president. "Therefore, going to the
island on the anniversary of the Turkish Peace Operation
(intervention) is an obligation for us."
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate on why he suddenly decided to pay a
one-day visit to the northern Cyprus, at a time when U.S. pressure
is mounting for a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the Turkish prime minister was announced only
three hours before Erbakan's scheduled meeting with a visiting
U.S. delegation headed by Madeleine Albright, U.S. envoy to the
United Nations.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Condemns Attacks on Sudanese Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali was deeply saddened to learn of the death of
107 Sudanese refugees in separate attacks on July 12-14, 1996 on
the Acholi-pii refugee camp near the town of Ktgum in Northern
Uganda, U.N. Deputy Spokesman Ahamad Fawzi said today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Fawzi said that the victims of "these
deplorable attacks" were mostly women and children. In addition,
he said, the attackers looted and burned the refugees' huts and
trucks belonging to the World Food Program and to an Italian
non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general condemns these wanton acts of murder
and destruction, and calls upon the government of Uganda to
reinforce measures to ensure the safety and protection of
Sudanese refugees in the area," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"He hopes that all impediments to the humanitarian relief
work in southern Sudan will be removed urgently so that the
Sudanese population affected by the ongoing civil war is not
forced to leave the country," the statement added.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief's Message to Stamp Launch for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has sent a message to the
launch of the U.N. sport and environment stamps for the 26th
Olympiad, which is scheduled to open in Atlanta this evening.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali said, "We celebrate human endeavor, the coming
together of nations, and the triumph of the Olympic spirit. These
games provide more than an opportunity for individual athletes to
take part, to compete, and to excel. They serve to remind the
world of the enduring relevance and appeal of the Olympic ideal."
</P>
<P>
The launch of the U.N. stamps takes as its theme the positive
impact that sport can have on the environment. The International
Olympic Committee (IOC) has worked hard to ensure that
environmental concerns remain at the top of the international
agenda, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the IOC has widened its concern for
environmental issues, and increased environmental awareness among
the worldwide Olympic community, he said in the message dated
July 18 but available today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. stamps provide a timely and appropriate celebration of
the Olympic spirit. They will be seen around the world, and will
be appreciated by countless thousands, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed gratitude to Leroy Neiman for his design of
the stamps, to Annabelle Wiener, deputy secretary-general of the
World Federation of United Nations Associations for her philatelic
program and to Nina Kung Wang for her design of the WFUNA first
day covers.

JOHANNESBURG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Allegemeine Zeitung,
Namibia's oldest newspaper and the only German daily in Africa,
celebrated its 80th anniversary on Thursday, the South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The German daily published its first issue in Windhoek on July
22, 1916. It was printed by the John Meinert Printing and
Publishing company in Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a function in Windhoek, Information and
Broadcasting Minister Ben Amathila said during both world wars
the newspaper was prohibited from publishing anything except
material supplied by Sapa and Reuters news agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Allegemeine Zeitung has a circulation of between 5,000 and
5,500 and regularly publishes 8,000 copies of a tourism
supplement which is very popular overseas, said the report.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tunisian Prime Minister Meets ABD Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian Prime Minister
Hamed Al-Karawi met here today with visiting President of
the African Bank for Development (ABD) Omar AL-Kabaj on
the Tunisian-ABD cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Kabaj told the Tunisia Africa News Agency (TANA) that he
briefed al-Karawi on the efforts of the ABD to expand its
activities in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Praising the economic reforms of Tunisia, the ABD president
said that the Tunisian reforms yielded significant results as they
helped raise the economic growth rate, control the inflation rate
and provide more jobs for youths.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the readiness of the ABD to promote cooperation
with Tunisia, saying that his talks with the Tunisian leader
helped in specifying the sectors which the ABD will finance during
the ninth five-year economic plan in Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
The bank is also ready to help the private sector in Tunisia
though offering loans to the small and medium enterprises, the ABD
chief added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Tunisia has all the conditions necessary for a
successful cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ABD offered loans for some 60 enterprises in Tunisia with
investments amounting to two billion dinars (approximately the
same amount in US dollars), thereby making Tunisia the major
partner of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Al-Kabaj arrived here Thursday on his first visit to the
country since his election as president of the ABD in August 1995.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Civil Leaders Call For Sanctions Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Liberian civil leaders and
traditional rulers are urging strong international sanctions
against faction leaders in the six-year civil war to make them
comply with the agreements they signed to restore peace in the
country.
</P>
<P>
During separate consultations with a Ghana-led delegation of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on
Wednesday, they suggested setting up an international war
crimes tribunal where the factional leaders will have to clear
themselves of any human rights abuses before being eligible to
stand for democratic elections, a report reaching here today
said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by ECOWAS Chairman President Jerry
Rawlings of Ghana, is on an assessment tour of Liberia to collect
views of various segments of the population on how to put the
peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, both groups stressed that the west
African peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, should be empowered
and provided with the logistics to enforce peace throughout
Liberia and disarm combatants as a pre-condition to free and fair
elections.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops are mostly deployed for operations in Monrovia,
capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"On no account should there be elections without first
complete disarmament, encampment and integration of combatants
into the society," said Frederick Cherue, chairman of the Liberia
Bar Association, at a meeting of the civil leaders and the ECOWAS
team.
</P>
<P>
The group of civil leaders is mainly made up of
representatives from the clergy, political parties, students,
women's organizations, human rights groups and voluntary
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Liberian NGO Offers School Fees for Disarmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A Liberian non-governmental
organization (NGO) today offered to pay one semester school fees
for 20,000 fighters who will disarm to the west African
peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, by July 25.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, Chairman Togba-nah
Tipoteh of the NGO, Susuku, the offer is mainly directed to
faction leaders Charles Taylor of the National Patriotic Front of
Liberia (NPFL) and Alhaji Kromah of the Mandingo wing of the
United Liberation Movement (Ulimo-K).
</P>
<P>
The offer is Susuku's "modest hand of assistance to encourage
heads of factions to commend their fighters to disarm to ECOMOG,"
the chairman added.
</P>
<P>
Under the offer, Susuku will pay a semester school fees to the
appropriate government principals for 10,000 NPFL fighters and
10,000 Ulimo-K fighters who hand over to ECOMOG at least one
functioning gun and ammunition by July 25.

<HEADLINE> Le Easily Books Final Berth in Women's 100m Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- World champion and world record
holder of the event Le Jingyi of China showed her superb form by
moving into the 100-meter freestyle final with a convincing first
place finish at 54.90 in the Georgia University Tech Aquatic
Center on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Le, 21, from China's biggest city Shanghai, who chalked up the
world crown at the Rome World Championships in 1994 with a world
record time of 54.01 seconds, swam in the fifth heats in which
there were no any serious threats to her, touched home first ahead
of second-finisher of the heat Karin Brienesse of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Le was just 0.89 seconds off her own world record.
</P>
<P>
However, there were also bad news for the Chinese team. China's
another medal hope Shan Ying, the Asian Games gold medalist and
the world top-ranked swimmer this year in the event, seemed
somewhat nervous competing together with two other top-category
swimmers Angel Martino of the United States and Franziska Van
Almsick of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Shan Ying finished a modest fourth in the sixth heat, crashing
out of the final.
</P>
<P>
But Shan still keeps her medal hope alive as she will also
participate in the 50m and 200m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Martino, who came out of the shadow of the drug
scandal suffered during the national Olympic trails before the
1988 Seoul Games, finished first in her heat and second in the
events' preliminaries at 55.44 seconds, just behind Le.
</P>
<P>
Fred Deburghgraeve from Belgium, who came from nowhere, made a
big splash on the first day swimming competitions by setting the
men's 100 meters breaststroke world mark of 1:00.60, beating the
previous record of 1:00.95 set by Karoly Guttler of Hungary in
Sheffield, Britain on August 3, 1993.

<HEADLINE> US Trying to Open Caribbean Waters for Drug Combat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States has been
negotiating agreements with nine Caribbean nations for opening
their territorial waters to U.S. Coast Guard vessels, U.S.
officials have said.
</P>
<P>
The basic hot-pursuit accord permits the U.S. Coast Guard to
follow suspect vessels into the other country's waters and to
board and detain any suspicious vessels in those waters, according
to a report on the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, discussions are under way with half a dozen other
countries to allow the United States to enter their waters to
intercept shipments of cocaine and marijuana bound for American
territory.
</P>
<P>
Washington's effort to increase its authority to intercept drug
shipments outside U.S. territory follows recent indications of
tension between Colombian and Mexican cocaine trafficking cartels.
Partly as a result of that rift, Caribbean routs are apparently
becoming more attractive to Colombian smugglers as alternatives to
overland routes in Central America and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 18 months, the United States has signed the
hot-pursuit accords with Antigua, Belize, Dominica, the Dominican
republic, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia and St. Vincent
and the Grenadines.
</P>
<P>
But several other nations which American officials view as
essential to a coordinated effort in the region have either
expressed reservations about such agreements or are openly
opposed. They include Jamaica, Haiti and Barbados.
</P>
<P>
Jamaican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson declared at a conference
of 14 Caribbean leaders last month that no foreign security force
"would have a legal jurisdiction to exercise any powers within our
jurisdiction."
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter that has to be dealt with by Jamaican
security forces," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Water Level Of Yangtze Tributaries Still High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The water level of the Yuanshui, a tributary of the Yangtze,
was 46.42 meters, a drop of 0.48 meter from the peak of the flood.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Dongting Lake, China's biggest fresh
water lake in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, was 35.01
meters, 0.46 meter higher than the guarantee mark, and is still
rising.
</P>
<P>
Water levels on middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze are
still rising, as Hankou, in Hubei Province, saw the level go over
the danger level by 2.05 meters this morning, and Hukou, in
Jiangxi Province, saw a rise of 1.94 meters above the danger level.
</P>
<P>
The flood peak on the Liujiang in southwest China passed
through Liuzhou city yesterday, where the water level reached
92.42 meters, the highest ever since the beginning of the
century. But the water level dropped to 91.57 meters early this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The peak also hit Wangjiaba on the Huaihe River in east China's
Anhui Province, at 29.24 meters early this morning, accompanied by
a water flow of 5,130 cubic meter per second.
</P>
<P>
Millions of people in the flood-stricken areas have been called
up to contribute to flood-relief efforts. So far projects meant to
provide protection against the flooding have not been threatened.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Private Funds for Comfort Women Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean association
involved in the comfort women issue has lodged a protest against
the decision by a non-governmental Japanese institution to provide
supporting money to former comfort women.
</P>
<P>
The association believes compensation for their forced
servitude in Japanese army brothels in World War Two should come
from the Japanese Government.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent today to the "Asian Peace Fund for Women" of
Japan, which made its decision Friday, the South Korean
organization criticized the Japanese government for trying to give
non-governmental funds to the women, saying the move constituted
indifference and an insult to the women.
</P>
<P>
The letter said the Japanese government should acknowledge the
sex slavery of the comfort women for Japanese troops as an
inhumane war crime and provide official compensation.
</P>
<P>
Historians say as many as 200,000 Asian women, mostly Koreans,
were recruited as "comfort women" -- a euphemism for sex slaves --
for the Japanese imperial army as it swept through East and
Southeast Asia in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 until
Japan's World War Two defeat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Japan has admitted that it forced Asian women into sex slavery
for its troops during the war, but has decided to finance
compensation through non-governmental funds.

<HEADLINE> Greater Role For Chinese Army In Fighting Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The General Political Department
of China's People's Liberation Army called on PLA officers
and men in flood-stricken areas to become fully involved in rescue
and disaster relief work in a circular issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The circular called on them to follow the Party's instructions
and regard the fight against floods as an urgent political task.
</P>
<P>
Personnel stationed near major rivers and lakes must be on full
alert, standing by in a state of combat readiness. Those who have
already been involved in rescue work should not drop their guard
and abandon the fight, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
It urged the officers and men to hold to the army's doctrine of
attachment to the people and of contributing to their well-being,
and to bear any hardship.
</P>
<P>
Officers should lead their men in the charge, it said, and that
Party members must regard the action as a chance for them to train
their resolve.
</P>
<P>
"They must dash to the most dangerous places, and appear where
they are most needed," the circular stressed, adding that to
successfully combat the flooding, what is needed is unity and
coordination between the Party, administrative departments, and
the troops. The troops that take part in the action must be placed
under the leadership of local Party committees.
</P>
<P>
Many regions in the country are facing serious flooding, with
the situations especially dangerous on tributaries of the Yangtze
River, the Yellow River, the Zhujiang River, the Huaihe River, the
Haihe River, the Songhua River, and the Liaohe River. Hundreds of
lives have been claimed by floods and heavy rainstorms in central
and eastern provinces since earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
In addition to sending personnel to disaster-stricken areas,
the PLA has started dropping materials from the air from military
aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Israel Confirms MIA-Prisoner Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel has confirmed that an
agreement had been reached with Hezbollah for the return of the
remains of two Israeli soldiers missing since 1986, Israel Radio
reported this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Israeli army told the radio that the
bodies of Yosef Find and Rahamim Alsheikh abducted in a south
Lebanon ambush a decade ago are expected to be returned to rest
at the beginning of next Week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Beirut, capital of Lebanon, Hezbollah
secretary-general Hassan Nasser Allah said that the deal would go
through on Sunday, and that Israel would release a limited number
of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Israel would also return the remains of all the Hezbollah and
other fighters killed in clashes with the Israeli army and the
South Lebanon Army along the Israeli-Lebanese border.
</P>
<P>
The deal was finalized through mediations from German
officials led by Security Chief Bernd Schimidbauer, and the swap
is to be carried out under the supervision of the International
Red-Cross.
</P>
<P>
The swap appeared imminent earlier this week after German
security officials examined two remains to verify their
identities, but last minute snags and revelations of the deal to
the media postponed it.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported that the army helped military chaplains
on Wednesday to remove the bodies of at least 14 Hezbollah gunmen
killed in clashes in south Lebanon and buried in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Using tractors, the army exhumed the bodies from numbered
graves at a special cemetery, near Kibbutz Galot along the banks
of the Jordan River, and loaded them onto trucks and then
apparently moved to the Lebanese border for the impending swap.
</P>
<P>
The deal reportedly also calls for Israel to hand over 200
prisoners in Khiam detention center in the Israeli-self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon and two other Shi'ite leaders.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres confirmed to reporters on
Wednesday that negotiations, mediated by Germany, have been under
way since the end of Operation Grape of Wrath, an Israeli
military operation against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon conducted
in last April.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl (on this issue) during my
trip to Germany," Peres told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, Lebanese government sources said a six-man German
delegation, with Israeli army's dental charts and other records
on Fink and Alsheikh, arrived in Beirut on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that Israel has tried to bring back
the two bodies, but it is the first time it has removed the link
between the two MIAs and Ron Arad, a missing navigator of the
Israeli Air Force whose Phantom was shot down on October 17, 1986
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hezbollah deputy secretary-general Naim Qassem said
that previous attempts to arrange swap had failed, because Israel
insisted it obtain firm word on the fate of Arad.

<HEADLINE>   Chinese FM Holds Talks with Western Samoan PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
APIA, WESTERN SAMOA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that China is ready to
join Western Samoa's efforts in bringing relations between the
two countries onto a higher plane.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is here on a two-day official visit to the tiny South
Pacific island country, told Western Samoan Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Tofilau Eti Alesana that China is satisfied with
the smooth development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Describing Tofilau as an "old friend of the Chinese people,"
Qian praised him for his contributions to the long-term, stable
and friendly relations between China and Western Samoa, according
to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang, who briefed
reporters about the talks between the two men.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Western Samoa are developing countries and they
share similar historical experiences, Qian said. "Our hearts beat
in harmony," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is ready to make joints efforts with the
Western Samoan government to bring bilateral relations to a new
level, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the opening of direct shipping links between China
and Fiji has offered good opportunities for trade cooperation
between China and South Pacific countries, including Western
Samoa.
</P>
<P>
The household electrical appliances, textiles and other
products imported from China are quite popular with the local
people, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said efforts should also be made to explore new ways and
areas of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Tofilau, who has visited China three times, said Western Samoa
values its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
The government of Western Samoa adheres to the one China policy
and this position is unequivocal, he said.
</P>
<P>
The South Pacific Forum, of which Western Samoa is a member,
will likewise not have any official links with Taiwan, he said,
adding that all South Pacific countries must realize that this is
a serious matter.
</P>
<P>
Tofilau also spoke highly of the Chinese government's policy on
the question of Hong Kong, saying he is convinced that the
territory will continue to be prosperous and stable after 1997.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Qian and Tofilau signed four documents -- the
agreement on the retention of Western Samoa's consulate general in
the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, the agreement on
mutual exemption of visas, and two exchanges of notes on China
providing assistance to Western Samoa.
</P>
<P>
Noting the importance of the four documents for boosting
bilateral relations, Tofilau said the Western Samoan government
will, as always, strive to maintain friendly ties of cooperation
with China.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Qian called on Malietoa Tanumafili II, the
head of state of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister also met with Tuilaepa Sailele,
deputy prime minister and finance minister of Western Samoa, and
Toleafua Faafisi, speaker of the Legislative Assembly.

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>

evoked powerful reminders of the Games' grand 100-year history.
</P>
<P>
-- The investigation of ill-fated TWA Flight 800 concentrated
on possible acts of sabotage Friday, especially still-inconclusive
evidence suggesting that a bomb might have been aboard the plane.
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate defeated two Democratic amendments that would
have softened the impact of welfare legislation on children and

ISLAMABAD, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Sensitive Price Indicator

of 0.46 percent over the index of preceding week.

</P>
<P>
The index was higher by 9.77 percent as compared to the index

The SPI is released by Pakistan's Federal Bureau of Statistics

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Refugees Kicked out from Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- About 1,300 Rwandan refugees have
been kicked out from Kibezi camp in northwestern Burundi, a
report from Kigali said today.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi authorities started the operation late on Friday
to close the camp, which has 15,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees, and
they crossed into Rwanda in trucks in the evening, a source of
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The Burundi government decided to close the camp but our
understanding in closing down the camp was that we would agree
where to take the people... to another camp or repatriate those
wishing to do so," said the source.
</P>
<P>
He complained that UNHCR officials were not allowed to enter
the camp after the operation began.
</P>
<P>
There are 75,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees in Burundi and the
Burundi government has time and again asked the UNHCR to shut
down the camps and transfer all the refugees into one big camp.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.7 million Rwandans fled to neighboring countries in
fear of revenge after the 1994 slaughter when Hutu hardliners
killed up to a million ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the
central African country.
</P>
<P>
Ferocious guerrilla war has been on in northern Burundi
between Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu Rebels. The war
has killed over 150,000 people in the past three years and some
fear Burundi could become the same as Rwanda one day.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A total of 142 soldiers were
killed and 168 others injured in the Tamil rebels' attack on a
strategic army base in the northeastern coast of Sri Lanka,
according to a military spokesman here this evening.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) lost large numbers of fighters in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE admitted that 181 of their cadres were killed during
the initial assault on the Mullaitivu army base, 280 km from
Colombo, the spokesman said, adding that so far, 124 names of the
rebels killed have been released by the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
The government troops confirmed having seen a minimum of
approximately 200 LTTE rebel dead bodies strewn over the area, the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also denied the LTTE's claim that they had taken
complete control of the Mullaitivu army base, saying that the
government troops were still at the base to defend themselves.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Accuses Japan of Intervening in Four-Nation Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) Saturday accused Japan of interfering with the
four-nation talks. It claimed Japan was intervening in the
country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
In April, U.S. President Bill Clinton proposed that the DPRK,
South Korea, China and the United States hold peace talks aimed at
securing a peace agreement to replace the truce accord which ended
the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
A commentary carried in the DPRK official newspaper "Rodong
Sinmun" said that Japan was not on any side of the four
nations. Whether to accept the proposal for the talks would depend
on the DPRK's own decision instead of anybody's interference or
pressure.
</P>
<P>
It said that Japan intended to create a condition for striving
for permanent membership of the UN Security Council by showing
off its ability in helping bring about peace on the Korean
Peninsular as well as its concern over the peninsular issue.
</P>
<P>
The commentary added that Japan was trying in vain to do this.
Instead it should "do what it should do" to clear its war crimes
so as to gain the world's trust.
</P>
<P>
A DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said on May 7 that his
country would have the right of self-decision in choosing whether
to accept the proposal to attend the talks.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the United States and Korea for an explanation of
the real intention of the proposal so that the DPRK could make a
choice.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The government is negotiating with
the European Union (EU), in a bid to buy three ships to supervise
the territorial waters of the country, the Mozambican News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is aimed at controlling fish output as some foreign
fishery companies based in Mozambique sell the fish they catch on
the high seas to escape paying taxes, Minister of Agriculture and
Fishery Carlos Agostinho Do Rosario was quoted as saying in
Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique exports about 4,000 tons of prawns annually, but
due to lack of supervision, prawn exports have been on the
decline.
</P>
<P>
Carlos said to control illegal sales of fishes on the high
seas, Mozambique will ban selling fishes there as of January,
1977.

<HEADLINE> 100,000 Projects for China's "Sparkle Plan" in Next Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- According to a symposium, which
opened today in Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi Province,
China intends to have a total of 100,000 projects in its "sparkle
plan"', as well as 100 science- and technology-intensive zones and
300 pillar industrial undertakings, during the country's Ninth
Five-year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The symposium aims to discuss strategic developments of the
"sparkle plan", which was first suggested by the Chinese
government a decade ago. It was the country's first attempt at
science and technology development in rural parts of China.
</P>
<P>
By early 1996, those working under the plan had established 127
state-level science- and technology-intensive zone and 217
regional pillar industrial undertakings, carried out 66,700
programs, provided more than 500 types of technology for rural
economic development, and trained over 36 million rural people,
providing them with various kinds of skills.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Mubarak-Netanyahu Meeting "Very Important" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said today that the meeting between Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday was
"very important" for the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with Mubarak in the Egyptian Mediterranean
port city of Alexandria, Arafat praised Mubarak's efforts for
pushing forward the peace process, the Egyptian Middle East News
Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
MENA earlier reported that the meeting took place in Cairo, but
later clarified that it was in Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The talks came just two days after Netanyahu's visit to Egypt,
during which he met with Mubarak to exchange views on the stalled
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's top aide, Osama el-Baz, was quoted by MENA as saying
that Mubarak and Arafat focused on the peace process, particularly
on the Palestinian track, and the outcome of Netanyahu's brief
visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egypt is looking forward to the upcoming meeting
between Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, has
been playing a role as a mediator between the Jewish state and the
Arabs, particularly the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has frequently visited Cairo for consultations with
Mubarak on the development of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat came to meet with Mubarak to coordinate their stances
last Sunday prior to Netanyahu's Cairo visit, the first to an Arab
state since he won the Israeli elections on May 29.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mubarak made a phone call to Arafat to discuss with
him the results of Netanyahu's visit.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged views on prospects of resuming the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu seemed to have somewhat softened his previous
hardline stance after his two-hour meeting with Mubarak Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a joint press conference with Mubarak,
Netanyahu said that Israel would honor its agreements signed with
the Arabs including the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Israel would adhere to the framework of the
1991 Madrid peace conference as the basis of the Mideast peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
"We will stick to the terms of reference of the Madrid peace
conference," he said, "The terms of reference of Madrid are what
can unite us around a common frame of reference."
</P>
<P>
But he said that there are "different interpretations" on the
land-for-peace principle and the way to apply it, a vague
indication that could hardly placate the angered Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs have regarded the "land-for-peace" formula as the
basis for the Middle East peace process since its inception five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Both Mubarak and Arafat have voiced optimism about the
resumption of the peace process following Netanyahu's visit to
Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Iran Eyes Five Medals at Atlanta Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Republic of Iran hopes
its strong team of wrestlers will win four or five medals at the
Atlanta Olympic Games opened here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Seyed Nasrollah Sadjadi, head of the Iranian delegation, said
Thursday that Iranian wrestlers have the potential to capture
medals in 52 kilogram, 68 kilogram, 82 kilogram, 90 kilogram and
100 kilogram weight classes of freestyle wrestling.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to get medals, but that's not the main reason for
our participation in the Olympic Games here," Sadjadi said. "We
are here for friendship, the world's progress and peace."
</P>
<P>
Sadjady said 18 Iranian athletes, including 10 wrestlers, will
compete in wrestling, boxing, shooting, judo, swimming and track
and field.
</P>
<P>
Iran, a wrestling powerhouse, won one silver medal and two
bronze medals, all in wrestling events, at the Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
"Wrestling is a traditional sport in Iran," Sadjady said. "We
have 40,000 people practising wrestling in our country."
</P>
<P>
Since its first participation in the Olympic Games in 1948,
Iran has collected a total of 24 medals including three gold
medals in 10 Olympic Games. Ghalam Reza Takhti, with three
wrestling medals to his name, is one of the nation's most
successful Olympians.
</P>
<P>
Iran is also strong in weightlifting. Its strongmen captured a
total of nine medals in the past several Olympic Games. But it
has not won Olympic medals in any other sports.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN's Economic Integration to Create Huge Market: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Secretary of Foreign
Affairs H. E. Domingo L. Siazon said here today the growing
integration of ASEAN's economies and the eventual inclusion of
Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar in ASEAN and in ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA), will result in a dynamic market of almost half a billion
people.
</P>
<P>
speaking at the opening session of the 29th ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting (AMM), the foreign secretary said "We can expect that the
benefits that our peoples now enjoy from ASEAN economic
cooperation will correspondingly multiply -- provided that the
appropriate adjustments are made."
</P>
<P>
These adjustments have to do not only with the liberalization
and opening of the economies, which are taking place at a rapid
pace. They also have to do with strengthening the rule of law,
enhancing political stability, ensuring transparency and the free
flow of economic and business information, and certain allowances
for the weaker economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has always been open to the world, and a growing ASEAN is
reaching out further afield, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We will be welcoming China, India and Russia to our dialogue
partnership, bringing to ten the number of our dialogue partners,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He held that ASEAN and its dialogue partners are now engaged in
a genuine partnership, a collaboration of equals in global and
regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
The progressive consolidation of ASEAN's political solidarity
is also mirrored in and reinforced by the deepening integration of
ASEAN's economies, he added.

JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali

Southeast Nations (ASEAN) to make a nuclear-free zone of the
region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting, Alatas said this goal, set by ten ASEAN government heads

On conflicting claims over territory in the South China Sea,
the minister pressed for all parties to resolve their dispute
under international law in general and the 1982 United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea in particular.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Middle East, he said he believed the only way
to carry on the peace process was for Israel to adhere
consistently to the principles agreed on at the Madrid conference
and stick to the land-for-peace policy.
</P>
<P>
The minister also praised the signing of the general framework
agreement for peace in Bosnia by Yugoslavia and other parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Two new finger piers were opened
today at the Terminal 2 of the Changi International Airport of
Singapore to provide more efficient service to the 50 thousand
passengers who pass through everyday.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Communication Mah Bow Tan officiated at
the opening, which also saw 17 new aero-bridges added.
</P>
<P>
Mah said that the additions, which cost some 330 million
Singapore dollars (about 235.7 million US dollars), were timely
because having aero-bridges was the minimum requirement of a
modern airport.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Changi Airport must constantly improve
its infrastructure, and provide capacity ahead of demand.
Passenger volume of the airport is expected to reach 25 million
this year.
</P>
<P>
On future plans, the minister said construction work has
already begun to add 14 more aero-bridges to Terminal 1, and a new
Terminal 3 will also come on line early next century.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that in the longer term, a third runway and a
new terminal building may be needed.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets Arafat for Talks on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat here today for talks on the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The talks came just two days after Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Egypt Thursday, when he met with
Mubarak to exchange views on the stalled Arab-Israeli peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to have made peace with Israel,
has been playing a role as a mediator between the Jewish state and
the Arabs, particularly the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has frequently visited Cairo for consultations with
Mubarak on the development of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat came to meet with Mubarak to coordinate their stances
last Sunday prior to Netanyahu's Cairo visit, the first to an Arab
state since he won the Israeli elections on May 29.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mubarak made a phone call to Arafat to discuss with
him the results of Netanyahu's visit.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged views on prospects of resuming the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu seemed to have somewhat softened his previous
hardline stance after his two-hour meeting with Mubarak Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a joint press conference with Mubarak,
Netanyahu said that Israel would honor its agreements signed with
the Arabs including the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Israel would adhere to the framework of the
1991 Madrid peace conference as the basis of the Mideast peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
"We will stick to the terms of reference of the Madrid peace
conference," he said. "The terms of reference of Madrid are what
can unite us around a common frame of reference."
</P>
<P>
But he said that there are "different interpretations" on the
land-for-peace principle and the way to apply it, indicating that
he still refuses to fully accept the principle, which the Arabs
have regarded as the basis for the Middle East peace process since
its inception five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Both Mubarak and Arafat have voiced optimism about the
resumption of the peace process following Netanyahu's visit to
Egypt.

BANGKOK, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has changed
the Thai name for amphetamines into yaa baa, or "madness drug", in
a bid to discourage rural people from using it.
</P>
<P>
The new name for the drug will be called by the government from
now on to replace the old name of yaa maa, or "horse drug", which
was popular in the country before.
</P>
<P>
A Thai government spokesman earlier said that a large number of
rural poor people used to take the drug because its Thai name gave
them the impression that yaa maa would enable them to work
tirelessly like a horse.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman hoped that the new name which gives a more
accurate description of the drug's harmful effects will help
lessen abuses of it.

Khalifa bin Suleiman al-Khalifa arrived here today for a two-day
official visit to Kuwait at the invitation of Kuwaiti Crown
Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Khalifa was greeted by the Kuwaiti crown prince at the
Kuwait International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Sheikh Khalifa, who is accompanied by his
foreign, transport, labor and finance ministers, said he was
eager to exchange views with Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah over issues of mutual interests in the framework of
bilateral cooperation and coordination.
</P>
<P>
He said he would meet the Kuwaiti amir later today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the visit of Sheikh Khalifa, the Kuwaiti media
today said that it was in line with exchange of views between Gulf
leaders who share one destiny, and expressed hope that such
exchange of visits will continue.
</P>
<P>
The local Arabic daily Al-Watan (motherland) said that "we have
to support Bahrain in face of expansionist schemes threatening its
sovereignty," apparently referring to the aborted coup aimed at
subverting the existing regime in Bahrain last month. Bahrain
insisted that the coup attempt was backed by Iran, but Tehran
denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
Another local daily Al-Anba said Sheikh Khalifa's visit, at
this specific time, gains great importance amid the current
circumstances in the Arab world in general, and in the Gulf region
in particular.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Khalifa's visit to Kuwait came almost two weeks after
similar visits Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
paid to both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, during which he reiterated
his country's full support to the security measures taken by both
the Gulf states to maintain stability in the wake of terrorist
acts.
</P>

Bahrain and Kuwait are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council,
GCC, a regional political, economic and military organization
which also groups Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar

<HEADLINE> Singapore External Trade Growth Moderates in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade
moderated in June, with the total trade in the month rose by 6.2
percent at the current price on a three month moving average
basis, the Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
The moderation of total trade growth resulted mainly from
slower growth in both non-oil domestic exports and re-exports, it
said, noting that non-oil domestic exports increased by 5.2
percent and re-exports grew by 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The slower growth of non-oil domestic exports was the result of
softening of global demand for electronic and related products as
well as the drop in prices due to keen competition, it said,
adding that growth of re-exports moderated because of slower
growth in Singapore's key markets in the region.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, the TDB said that total trade increased by
0.4 percent, with non-oil domestic exports declining by 6.1
percent in the month. The decline was partly statistical as June
1995's exports were above trend levels, it said.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports grew by 5.2 percent to reach 4.93
billion US dollars in June, with exports to the United States and
the European Union markets moderating to 9 percent and 1.2 percent
respectively from the first quarter's double-digit growth.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports to Malaysia and Hong Kong markets
remained weak, while that to Japan still maintained its strong
growth momentum in the month of June, expanding by 21.9 percent,
it TDB said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, domestic exports of oil continued to grow
strongly by 22.5 percent to reach about 1 billion US dollars in
the month. This was attributed to strong growth in oil exports to
Hong Kong for subsequent re-exports to China.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports increased by 4.9 percent to about 4.14 billion US
dollars in June, with the increase coming from computer parts and
peripherals, disk drives, transistors, parts of diodes, and other
products, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
During the month, imports rose by 5.9 percent to about 10.86
billion US dollars. The growth was largely in disk drives, parts
of diodes, photocells and transistors, blank computer tapes and
discs, and other products, it said.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A 24-hour telephone hotline
which provides pre-recorded comprehensive information on sex was
opened in Hong Kong today.
</P>
<P>
Dr Sex Hotline, organized by the Hong Kong Sex Education
Association, will provide free expert advice on sex-related
issues to the public, in particular young people.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the association said that through the
implementation of the Dr Sex Hotline, the young generation could
acquire positive understanding and develop proper concepts about
sex-related issues.
</P>
<P>
"Since the hotline is not manned by counselors, it would help
ease the embarrassing feeling of the young people and encourage
them to use the hotline," he said.
</P>
<P>
The hotline provides information on six main areas relating to
sex, such as myths about sex, sexually transmitted diseases, love
and marriage and pregnancy and contraception.

</P>
<P>
President Soeharto said in his opening speech at the 29th ASEAN

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan will launch a set of measures
in April 1998 to supervise banks to improve management according
to the capital they hold, Finance Ministry officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The measures are in line with financial laws which were put
into effect recently in order to improve the management of
financial institutions, the Kyodo News Service quoted the
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
An official at the ministry said the measures are "based on
objective criteria and will make administrative measures to banks
clearer".
</P>
<P>
The criteria relate to the capital-adequacy ratio at each bank,
or the ratio of capital including capital reserves over total
assets such as outstanding loans.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will rank the banks in six groups based on their
capital-adequacy ratios, and the worst ranking banks will be told
to halt their operations.
</P>
<P>
Stricter inspections and supervision will be made of banks
falling in the third to sixth groups.
</P>
<P>
For banks which have overseas operations, the standard ratio
will be set at 8 percent as required by the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS), while for those which operate only in Japan,
the ratio will be set at 4 percent.

NEW DELHI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- India's gold prices shot up
sharply crossing the 5200-mark rupees (155.22 US dollars) level
while silver declined in a mixed bullion market in Mumbai (Bombay)
today.
</P>
<P>
The yellow metal flared up and crossed the 5200-mark rupees
level due to acute shortage of stocks in the wake of stringent
arrivals as against heavy local buying interest. Bullish upcountry
advises aided the uptrend.
</P>
<P>
Silver dropped sharply on account of poor industrial demand
coupled with weak overseas advises.
</P>

Standard gold flared up to 5203 from 5170 rupees ( 155.31 to

<HEADLINE> South Korea Approves Nuclear Power Plant Plan for DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korean has approved a plan of
an electric power corporation to build a nuclear power plant in
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) as the prime
contractor of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization
(KEDO), the National Unification Board (NUB) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the (South) Korea Electric Power Corporation
(KEPCO) will build a nuclear power plant equipped with two
1,000-megawatt light-water reactors in Sinpo, South Hamgyong
Province of the DPRK, on a turn-key basis.
</P>
<P>
The scale of the project, including costs, will be set after
negotiations with the KEDO to conclude the prime contractor
agreement, a NUB official said.
</P>
<P>
With the South Korean government's approval, the KEPCO is
legally allowed to dispatch its officials and supply equipment and
materials to the DPRK in connection with the nuclear power plant
project, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The KEDO, a multinational consortium led by the United States,
South Korea and Japan, is responsible for supplying two reactors
to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Under the Washington-Pyongyang framework agreement signed in
Geneva in October 1994, two 1,000-megawatt light-water nuclear
reactors will be provided to the DPRK in return for freezing its
nuclear program. The KEDO has selected South Korea as the prime
supplier of the light-water reactors.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan is expected
to pay a visit to Syria before the end of this month in an effort
to cement Jordanian-Syrian reconciliation, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The king is also expected to brief Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad on the outcome of the talks which Jordanian officials are
planning to hold with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
during his expected visit to Amman later this month.
</P>
<P>
Today's English-language daily Jordan Time quoted an official
source as saying that the king plans to meet with Netanyahu on
July 25 in order to give momentum to Arab-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's visit to the kingdom was scheduled for July 25, but
his office announced Friday that the Israeli prime minister had
postponed his visit because of Jewish holiday. No date has been
set for Netanyahu's first visit to Jordan since his May 29
election victory, his office said.
</P>
<P>
The king will discuss with the Syrian president the bilateral
relations and security issues as well as the unified Arab stance
in Arab-Israeli peace talks during his visit to Damascus. This
will be the first visit by the king since Jordan and Israel signed
a historic peace treaty in 1994 which was accused by Syria of
breaking the Arab rank and has worsened Jordan-Syria relations.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein met with President al-Assad and discussed
arrangements for his forthcoming visit to Damascus at a side
meeting during the Cairo Arab summit last month.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti, who met in Cairo
Tuesday with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara, said the
king's visit to Damascus will take place soon, but did not name a
date or go into details.

plane will render ASEAN cooperation more balanced and diversified,
supplementing efforts to further the growing political and

deepened cooperation among ASEAN countries and between ASEAN
countries and their dialogue partners," Nguyen added.

history. It has been one hundred years between Francois Turrnoi
running 100 meters with white gauntlet and anatomic flying suits

indicated that the Boeing 747 which exploded above Long Island
Thursday was destroyed by a bomb.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Atlanta Olympics opened "American way", as the most
commercialized and most heavily covered by the media in the
history of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the prudence put on by U.S. officials over the cause
of the Boeing 747 explosion on Thursday, the inquiry leans towards
the proposition of a terrorist act. A bomb could have been placed
on board the plane when it left Athens previously, or been placed
during the plane's stay at the Kennedy airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
-- The American public opinion is hit by the "Oklahoma City
syndrome". In Arizona, a militia group called "Viper" is rapidly
collecting followers to resist the federal government, the United

<HEADLINE> Chances of Resuming Peace Talks Increase: Egyptian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
top aide, Osama el-Baz, has said that the chances of resuming the
Arab-Israeli peace talks have increased following Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Cairo Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian newspaper Akhbar El Yom,
el-Baz said that Israel will meet its commitments to peace, noting
that there are no hurdles hindering the start of the final-stage
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians and the
Israeli-Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister showed willingness to resume the
peace talks, Baz told the newspaper, the Saturday edition of the
leading Arabic-language newspaper Al-Akhbar.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu somewhat softened his tough stance on the peace
process after his talks with Mubarak during his brief visit to
Egypt, the first since he won the Israeli elections in late May.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with Mubarak following their
two-hour meeting, Netanyahu said he would honor the agreements
signed with the Arabs, including the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Israel is ready to resume talks with Syria
and will stick to the framework of the 1991 Madrid peace
conference, which kicked off the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu still refused to openly accept the land-for-peace
principle, which the Arabs have regarded as the basis for the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz said that it is difficult to set a date for the
resumption of the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming meeting between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy will be "a step down the
road of peace," he said in the interview published today.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sailor in Japan Nabbed for Alleged Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Police arrested a
U.S. sailor today on suspicion of robbery and attempted murder of
a woman in Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture in southwestern Japan.
</P>
<P>
The arrest came one day after the U.S. government agreed to
turn over to Japanese authorities Terrence Michael Swanson, 20, a
crew member of the U.S. guided missile frigate McClusky.
</P>
<P>
Swanson, suspected of slashing Kaori Tanigawa's throat and
stealing more than 10,000 yen (100 U.S. dollars) from her handbag
Tuesday in a parking lot in the port city, admitted the charges,
police officials said.
</P>
<P>
The twenty-year-old woman was on her way home when she was
attacked from behind.
</P>
<P>
The handover of Swanson is the first since the U.S. agreed last
October to turn over its military personnel suspected in heinous
criminal cases even before they are indicted.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1960 Status of Forces Agreement between Tokyo and
Washington, U.S. military personnel suspected of committing crimes
in Japan could not be turned over to Japanese authorities before
being formally indicted by Japanese prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. agreement to change the practice followed the
abduction and rape of a 13-year-old schoolgirl in Okinawa by three
U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
The rape case triggered a nationwide protest and resentment
against the U.S. military presence in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government stated that it deeply regretted the
incident, reaffirmed that it would take all necessary measures to
prevent such incidents, and pledged to continue efforts to be good
neighbor," said a statement prepared by the two governments after
a Japan-U.S. Joint Committee meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tanigawa, who was seriously injured, is in hospital and still
cannot speak, the officials said. She is said to have told the
police in writing that her handbag was stolen and the culprit
looked like a foreigner.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Notices Change in Netanyahu's Rhetoric </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Palestine
Liberlation Organization (PLO) has noticed a difference between
the language Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used in
Cairo Thursday and that he used in Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that Netanyahu's language (in Cairo) differed
to a certain extent from that he used in Washington," Mahmoud
Abbas (Abu Mazen), member of PLO's Executive Committee, said in
an interview with the Saudi Arabia-owned Al-Hayat daily which
was issued here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic paper said that the interview was held after Abu
Mazen arrived in Moscow, heading a Palestinian delegation to
attend the meetings of the Joint Palestinian-Russian Committee.
</P>
<P>
While in Washington, Netanyahu told U.S. Congressmen that his
government would never allow the redivision of Jerusalem, a city
claimed by both Israel and the Palestinians as their capital.
</P>
<P>
After his visit to the United States, Netanyahu paid a visit to
Cairo, capital of Egypt Thursday, the first to an Arab state since
he took office in June, and held a meeting there with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Although Netanyahu failed to give a word on the principle of
land-for-peace in Cairo, a "positive indication" emerged when the
Israeli leader did point to a meeting with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, Abu Mazen said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we have noticed that Netanyahu failed to point to
the land-for-peace principle, but he at the same time pointed to
a meeting which will bring him and President Yasser Arafat
together," he told the London-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"This is a positive indication for starting relations between
the (Palestinian) National Authority and Israel," the PLO
official added.
</P>
<P>
He praised Egypt's "important role in setting the things
right,"
</P>
<P>
On the preconditions put forward by the Israeli leader for
reactivation of the peace process, Abu Mazen said that it would
take "some time" for Netanyahu to retreat from the positions he
took during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Before the elections, Netanyahu had raised radical views and
slogans and announced a lot of noes, but he has realized that if
he wanted the peace process to be continued he should retreat
and this needs some time," the PLO official noted.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu set up his government only two weeks ago and we know
the problems the Israeli government is facing," Abu Mazen
said. "We know that he has not read the files and still regards
himself as in the opposition rank."
</P>
<P>
"We need peace and Israel needs peace more than us," he
added. "It should know that the price for peace is to return the
rights to the Palestinians and all the Arabs."
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the Palestinians were determined to wait
and see in order to give Netanyahu a chance and to "judge the
things not by its beginning but by its results."

<HEADLINE> China's Rural Enterprises Urged to Apply Labor Contract System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China's township and village
enterprises have been called for greater use of the labor contract
system.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent circular issued by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Ministry of Labor, major enterprises in the
countryside should apply such system by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
China has 22 million township enterprises, employing 128
million people. Of these 1.6 million are collectively-owned,
employing 60 million.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of the year, the labor contract system will
mainly apply to the six million people.
</P>
<P>
The circular says that workers and township enteprieses must
sign labor contracts on the basis of equality and freedom of
choice. It also calls for better handling of labor contracts.
</P>
<P>
It specifies the contents of contracts, the wage scale, working
hours, work safety, labor conditions, social insurance, and other
areas.
</P>
<P>
Since China implemented the Labor Law in January 1 this year,
the great progress has been made in its labor contract system.
</P>
<P>
So far, the system has been applied to some 95 million workers
in urban enterprises, accounting for 88 percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on CPO, Tin, Rubber in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The crude palm oil (CPO)
physicals market, rubber market and tin market in Malaysia ended
the week mixed with tin price lower while rubber and CPO prices
higher.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) ended the week lower in
tandem with the bearish sentiment on the London Metal Exchange
(LME). Tin price closed the week 15 sen lower at 15.25 Malaysian
Ringgit (about 6.1 US dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, tin price fell by 11 sen to 15.29 Ringgit (about
6.11 dollars) following the sharp fall of three-month tin on the
LME. The downtrend on KLTM continued until Thursday, and rebounded
on Friday and closed at 15.25 Ringgit per kg.
</P>
<P>
Ready turnover for the whole week rose to 568 tons from 526
tons last week, and the premium between the KLTM and that of the
LME was 50 dollars per ton from 60 dollars per ton previously.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market ended the week higher due to some
buying interests from China. The August RSS One rose three sen to
333.5 sen (about 1.33 dollars) per kg while the SMR 20 gained two
sen to 304.5 sen (about 1.22 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Dealers here said the improved market sentiment came due to
some buying interest from China for SMR 20 coupled with the fact
that sellers did not have much stocks at hand following the rainy
season.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, crude palm oil physicals ended the week slightly
steadier and the July South closed five Ringgit higher at 1,075
Ringgit (about 430 dollars) per ton compared with last week's
closing.
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment was generally weak due to the absence of fresh
tenders and poor market performance as well as higher stock
figures.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia said that June palm oil stocks rose by 8.4 percent to
773,917 tons from 715,249 tons in May. However, some buying
interest from China helped to stabilize the prices.

<P>
LAGOS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) is to spend 82 million U.S. Dollars on its next program
of assistance on Nigeria, beginning from 1997 to the year 2001,
the fund announced here.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF regional director Torild Skard, who ended a one-week
visit to the country on friday, said it is hopeful that the
amount would be approved by the executive board of UNICEF at its
next meeting in September.
</P>

UNICEF spent 65 million Dollars on its last program from 1990
to 1995 and has approved about 15 million Dollars for this year
before the start of the next program of assistance.
</P>
<P>
The program will focus on children, especially infant
mortality rate, according to Skard, who is in charge of 23
countries.
</P>
<P>
She said the low school enrolment figure for girls in the
north and boys dropping out of schools in the east of the country
were of great concern and would be accorded priority in the
proposed program.
</P>
<P>
The regional director called for the invigoration of
immunization against childhood diseases and urged the media to
assist in the child survival campaign.
</P>
<P>
A satisfactory primary health care program must be put in
place at the community level to make health accessible and
affordable, she said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Reduces Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA)
has now been reduced to 43,000, just 3,000 shy of the 40,000
target the government has set out to reach in line with
western-backed economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Moven Mahachi said on Friday the reduction of
the army was intended to cut public expenditure which is one of
the critical requirements set by the international financiers of
the economic structural adjustment program.
</P>
<P>
The government completed the first phase of the economic
reforms last year after gruelling five years and the second phase
would be embarked upon when the government concludes
consultations with the private sectors and financiers.
</P>
<P>
''The Zimbabwe National Army have reduced their establishment
to just over 43,000 men and women... the program is about to be
completed,'' Mahachi said at an opening parade of the joint
exchange program between the United States and Zimbabwean army
special forces.
</P>
<P>
The program entails an exchange of skills and training
exercise to last over a month.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of the army is being done on a natural waste
system while at the same time mechanisms of establishing a
reserve force as a means of preserving the potency of the army in
times of crisis are being worked out.
</P>
<P>
The army is being reduced from 55,000 people to a manageable
force of 40,000 as relative peace and calm prevail in sub-Saharan
Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A female test-tube baby is
reported to be in good health since her birth nine days ago in
east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The newborn girl represents the first successful case of In
Vitro Fertilization-Embryo Transfer (IVF-ET) performed solely by
Chinese experts, who were from the Obstetrics and Gynecology
Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang Medical University.
</P>
<P>
Previous cases involved joint efforts between Chinese doctors
and foreign medical experts.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese doctors extracted eggs from the baby's mother last
October and fertilized them in a test tube. Two days later, they
transferred three four-celled embryos back into the mother's
uterus and successfully impregnated her.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old mother has been pregnant for seven times, but
miscarried during each pregnancy. She also had two ectopic
pregnancies, and later had her Fallopian tubes removed.
</P>
<P>
The doctors said the baby is currently in good health.
</P>
<P>
The doctors also successfully adopted the method of Gemmate
Intro Fallopian Transfer (GIFT) to impregnate another woman, who
gave birth last November to a female baby, who is referred to by
doctors as a GIFT baby.
</P>
<P>
During this procedure, they transferred semen into the mother's
Fallopian tube to fertilize her egg.
</P>
<P>
So far, hospitals in Beijing, Guangzhou and Hangzhou have the
capabilities to perform assisted reproductive technology that can
cultivate both test-tube and GIFT babies.
</P>
<P>
Ten more test-tube babies are expected to be born at the
hospital in Hangzhou, according to the doctors.

<HEADLINE> Rags To Riches: Shanghai's Clothing Industry's Firm Foothold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's clothing industry has
been growing rapidly to win a firm foothold in the city's urban
areas, while many other industries are being moved to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Free of pollution and being labor-intensive, the clothing
industry together with printing, packaging and food sectors, have
been given green light to develop in a 106-sq-km area within the
inner-ring road of the city.
</P>
<P>
One of the city's major steps was to classify the garments
industry as a so-called "urban industry", and to establish the
Shanghai Garments (Group) Company in March of 1995, which
re-organized industry assets on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
The company has set aside 130 million yuan (about 15.7 million
US dollars) to set up a garment research center and develop a
technology-intensive industry, aimed at upgrading Western-style
clothes, latest fashions, blue jeans and children's wear.
</P>
<P>
The company crowned the country's clothing industry with gross
sales totaling 3.33 billion yuan last year, and was the second
largest profit contributor.
</P>
<P>
Its export value topped 128 million US dollars last year,
ranking first in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto said
today that ASEAN countries need to consolidate their common
position against taking up the non-trade issues proposed by the
developed countries for discussion at the forthcoming ministerial
meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to be held in
Singapore this December.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 29th Ministerial Meeting of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) here this morning, the president
emphasized that considering the broad range of genuine and urgent
trade concerns that the WTO must address, issues for deliberation
at the WTO meeting must be confined to and must not deviate from
the agenda agreed upon at the Marrakech meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We should do all we can to ensure that the issue of strict
compliance by all members should be squarely and effectively
addressed," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said the establishment of WTO, as the embodiment of
the results of the Uruguay Round, has brought the hopes that the
international community would at last be able to rely on a
multilateral instrument that can regulate the global trading
system in a more comprehensive, transparent, equitable and
balanced way.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- India's seafood production has
not been showing an upward trend due to unsuccessful prawn farming
results of the immediate previous year, according to a trade
journal.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country's seafood industry is not going for value
added products due to dearth of raw materials for processing and
export of market established products and markets.
</P>
<P>
No seafood exporter can venture in a big way for processing of
value added fish products because of the price factor and the
infrastructure constraints, the journal said.
</P>
<P>
"The demand for fish products in India as well as in foreign
markets is not encouraging," it said.
</P>
<P>
Of the present level of 36 billion rupees (1,074 million US
dollars) export earning on Indian marine product exports, value
added products constitute less than 10 percent. The latest
statistics indicated that of the total Indian fish production of
4.572 million tons a year, shrimp consists of only 350,000 tons.

JAKARTA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto said
here today that ASEAN has become a major force for peace and
stability as well as for economic cooperation not only in
Southeast Asia, but also in the larger Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at the 29th ministerial meeting of the
Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Soeharto said
that in pursuit of stability, ASEAN countries from the very start
focused on building national and regional resilience as a basis
for regional economic growth while they endeavored to establish a
code of conduct for regional cooperation involving both the
countries in the region and external powers as well.
</P>
<P>
He said that through dialogue and consultation on political and
security matters, strategic change in the region could be managed
in such a way that a stable relationship among the major powers
and regional powers could evolve peacefully over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that by promoting the habits of
consultation and cooperation in a spirit of greater transparency
and mutual trust, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) will prove to be
an effective instrument for preventive diplomacy and for
addressing issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
On ASEAN's economic cooperation, Soeharto said that ASEAN
countries have intensified their role as catalyst for economic
cooperation by accelerating ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA),
supporting subregional arraignments for special growth areas.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the ASEAN foreign ministers to intensify the
implementation of ASEAN's functional cooperation to match the pace
of political and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Follow-up action should be taken to consolidate plans of action
in the various fields of functional cooperation, he said, adding
that the scope of functional cooperation should be enlarged.

modern Olympic Games, Baron Pierre de Coubertin."
</P>
<P>
"Sports brings the world together, as it is here today in
Atlanta." said the IOC president.
</P>
<P>
American President Bill Clinton declared the 17-day Games open
before a packed crowd of 80,000 in the Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
On hand were presidents, prime ministers and distinguished
guests from Argentina, Canada, Dominica, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Britain, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Monaco, Namibia, Poland, San
Marino, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain and
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In the three-hour opening ceremony, a showcasing of the south
American culture outweighed the celebration of the Centennial
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The ancient Games were re-enacted like a shadow play, with
discus throwers and archers silhouetted against a backlit screen.
Oddly, a convoy of pickup trucks, topped by bright lights, raced
across the field, prompting the suspision that the organizers were
losing no time in doing advertisement for one of their sponsors.
</P>
<P>
A musical opening segment "Atlanta's Welcome to the World" was
played with step-dancing, clogging and hip-hop; a Martin Luther
King Jr. tribute featured images of Atlantans flashed on the
stadium screen to his "I have a Dream" speech; the U.S. Air Force
aerial demonstration team did a flyover; the U.S. Army Ranger team
specializing in rappelling and lifeline slides dropped in.
</P>
<P>
Much of the opening was pomp and circumstance specified in the
Olympic Charter. Marching athletes and officials from 197
countries and regions into the field, Atlanta's parade became the
longest in the Games' history, lasting one hour and 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Besides the size, the Atlanta Olympics also set records in
security, temperature and commercialism.
</P>
<P>
To shake off the unsafe-city image, panhandling was banned,
homeless rounded up, and heavy security presence called in.
</P>
<P>
"Hotlanta" is not a misnomer as the Atlanta Games are going
down in history as the hottest Olympics with the temperature
hovering at 38 degrees centigrade, much hotter than Los Angeles,
Seoul and Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
As competition proper begins Saturday, athletes from all over
the world will vie for top honors in 271 events. Quite a few world
records are expected to fall in the track and field and swimming.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica to Tighten Tax Collection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Finance Minister
Francisco de Paula Gutierrez announced a plan today to improve tax
collection procedures.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 percent of government revenue is used for public debt
servicing, export promotion, salary payments, educational
subsidies and pension payments, said Gutierrez who became finance
minister a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal revenue has been affected by the economic opening
policy, which caused a reduction of 2 billion colons (some 9.5
million U.S. dollars) in tariff collection.
</P>
<P>
The minister announced an austerity budget for 1997, and all
the ministries have to revise their priorities.
</P>
<P>
Together with spending control, the plan foresees a more
efficient tax collection. For this purpose a Spanish delegation
will come to join a similar mission from the Interamerican
Development Bank to render help.
</P>
<P>
A tax law was approved last year, stipulating more severe
punishments for tax evaders.

<HEADLINE> 30,000 Mindanao Residents Protest Against Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Mindanao residents
cvvvkkvvvvvvvkvkkkkkvkxkvvv
staged a silent protest Friday against a peace deal between the
Philippine government and the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF), a Muslim rebel group that has been fighting for an
autonomous region in Mindanao for the past 24 years, the Malaya
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 establishments, including banks, schools, private
offices and public transportation in Dipolog city, Mindanao, shut
down Friday as 30,000 residents staged their one-day protest
against the peace agreement reached between the government and the
MNLF last month, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement, the MNLF will head a Southern
Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD), an interim
mechanism leading to the establishment of an autonomous government
in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that there were no street rallies, but the
protesters displayed anti-SPCPD posters outside their homes, and
shops put up streamers that read "no to Misuari (head of the
MNLF)" and "we don't want the SPCPD in Dipolog."
</P>
<P>
At least 50 buses from transportation companies and some 400
motorized tricycles stopped operation the whole day and resumed
operation only at about 18:00, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the peace deal was reached, the proposed MNLF-led
council has aroused growing opposition in the Philippines, and
Mindanao in particular. Politicians in the southern Philippines
challenged the legality of the transitory body, saying that the
council will diminish the powers of the local government.
</P>
<P>
Christians in the region also expressed their fear that the
establishment of the council would put them under the Muslim
control.

<HEADLINE> French FM Insists on Visiting PLO Office in East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette said here today that he reserves the right to visit the
office of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in East
Jerusalem during his coming visit to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Charette's decision runs against an Israeli government decree
aimed at keeping high-ranking foreign officials from visiting the
PLO office in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Charette is the first foreign minister from the European Union
nations to visit Israel after Benjamin Netanyahu became prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that his country
will not submit to pressure from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Charette will reiterate the Palestinians' right to live in East
Jerusalem and the PLO's right to receive visitors in its office
there, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Charette's Middle East tour, starting on July 22, is aimed at
resuming the peace process in the region and it will take him to
Syria, Lebanon, Israel, the Gaza area, Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has been in a stalemate since the
establishment of the Netanyahu government, which has adopted the
hard stance of putting security above everything else.
</P>
<P>
France disagreed with the Netanyahu government, repeatedly
pressing Israel to push forward the peace process and reiterating
the principle of "land for peace."
</P>
<P>
Israel passed a decree in 1994 to keep the PLO from engaging in
political activities in the Israeli territories, especially in
East Jerusalem. This drew common criticism from the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government hardened its attitude on this issue
after Netanyahu became prime minister. It claimed that it would
adopt all necessary measures to keep other countries' foreign
ministers and high officials from visiting the PLO office in East
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Record for Import Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's economic center,
collected 10.77 billion yuan in customs duties on imports during
the first half of the year, a record increase of 51.1 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise, customs sources say, is the result of increased
imports, which grew when China reduced tariffs in April.
</P>
<P>
Imports were mostly chemicals, metals, machinery and electronic
products, which are in short supply on the domestic market and
needed by key state projects.
</P>
<P>
The increased revenues show the initial success of the central
government's efforts to stop the giving of unauthorized tax breaks
by localities.
</P>
<P>
Custom statistics show that the total amount of tax cuts and
exemptions dropped by 16 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
"China's adjustment of foreign-goods taxation is conducive to a
sound environment for open and fair competition and has also
encouraged more overseas investment," said a local customs
official.
</P>
<P>
From January to June this year, Shanghai approved another 991
foreign-funded firms with the contracted overseas capital reaching
5.5 billion US dollars, up 43.1 percent.

"These 747-400s will contribute to Air China's growth and

States, Europe and Asia, according to the Boeing company. The
airline currently operates 18 Boeing 737s, 16 Boeing 747s and 10
Boeing 767s. This order brings to 47 the number of Boeing
airplanes operated by Air China.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has provided support in virtually every area of China's
aviation industry for many years, including air traffic control
and regulatory development, flight and crew training, a spares
center at the Beijing Capital Airport and on-the-job training for
China's airline personnel.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Macedonian Foreign Ministry
today protested to Greece over the detention of a Macedonian
passenger plane on the Greek island of Corfu (Keikira), reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it was shocked by the detention, which it
described as a violation of related agreements between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
It warned that the country will take strong actions against the
detention.
</P>
<P>
The Tu-154 plane of Palair Macedonian (Macedonian Airline) was
detained Wednesday in Corfu after Greek authorities found it
marked with the words "Palair Macedonian."
</P>
<P>
The Greeks had not allowed the plane to leave until the words
were painted over and the Macedonian office in Greece made
representations.
</P>
<P>
It was the first dispute over the name since the two countries
signed a temporary agreement in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Greece was plunged into a nationalist rage when Macedonia
declared independence from Yugoslavia under the name in
1991. Athens charged that this was an attempt to claim to whole
Macedonia region, much of which is in Greece.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Friday warned Christians in Mindanao against forming a vigilante
group to check alleged Muslim atrocities, saying it could trigger
a religious war.
</P>
<P>
he said in the presidential palace that there is no reason for
Christians in South Cotabato, Mindanao to do so because the
proposed Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development to
be headed by Moro National Liberation Front Chair Nur Misuari will
have no police power.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper report said some Christians in South Cotabato have
decided to form the Southern Philippines Unified Christian
Command, a militia group that would reportedly check Muslim
"atrocities" if the council is created.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said a religious war will lead to loss of innocent lives
and that fears about the council are brought by "misinformation
spread by so-called responsible leaders in the southern
Philippines."
</P>
<P>
In the face of rising opposition to the planned council, Ramos
took the offensive the same day by lambasting critics for raising
"anxieties and fears."

ATLANTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The 26th Olympic Games raised
curtains Friday night in a flashy ceremony, which mixed the
southern American culture with the celebration of the Centennial
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
This Summer Olympics drew 10,000-plus competitors from a record
197 countries and regions whereas only 300 athletes from 14
nations attended the first Olympic Games in 1896.
</P>
<P>
International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio
Samaranch and American President Bill Clinton joined more than
80,000 people in the eye-catching function held in the Olympic
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The ancient Games were re-enacted like a shadow play, with
discus throwers and archers silhouetted against a backlit screen.
Oddly, a convoy of pickup trucks, topped by bright lights, raced
across the field, prompting the suspision that the organizers were
losing no time in doing advertisement for one of their sponsors.
</P>
<P>
A musical opening segment "Atlanta's Welcome to the World" was
played with step-dancing, clogging and hip-hop; the U.S. Air Force
aerial demonstration team did a flyover; the U.S. Army Ranger team
specializing in rappelling and lifeline slides dropped in.
</P>
<P>
The colorful party is to be followed by a parade of the
participating teams. The march-in with a record number of athletes
is expected to take at least one hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
Besides the size, the Atlanta Olympics also set records in
security, temperature and commercialism.
</P>
<P>
As competition proper begins Saturday, athletes from all over
the world will vie for top honors in 271 events.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Agrees on New Tax Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives and the Senate have agreed in principle on a
scheme that would tax millions of wage-earners based on their
gross income instead of net earnings.
</P>
<P>
Rene Diaz, senior vice chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said on Friday that a consensus was reached after a
series of meetings among members of the Ways and Means panels of
the two chambers and officials of the Finance Department.
</P>
<P>
According to the new scheme, each salaried worker will be
granted a personal tax exemption of 60,000 pesos (2290 US
dollars). The yearly income beyond that amount should be slapped a
15 percent tax.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a simpler system and a major attraction to foreign
investment," Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
The wage-earners contribute more than 90 percent of the
Philippine government's yearly revenue of 50 billion pesos (1.9
billion dollars).

BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- There are more than 800 auction
firms now in China, not only in cosmopolitan areas but also in
small and medium-sized cities, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The new Auction Law will put China's auction market on a
legal basis and help usher in a new era for the infant industry.
</P>
<P>
Since China resumed auction transactions 10 years ago, the
trade has developed quickly. Objects up for bid include
confiscated goods as well as fixed and intangible assests.
</P>
<P>
The new law which goes into effects at the beginning of 1997
makes clear that State Council departments in charge of auctions
are to supervise the trade-wide.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates conditions for new auction firms, trade
organizations, sets standards for auctioneers, determines goods
for bidding and establishes auction procedures.
</P>
<P>
Concerned departments are now sorting out auction markets in
the country. Firms that fail to meet legal standards will be
written off, China Daily said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China's posts and
telecommunications industry reported stable growth in the first
six months of 1996, generating 60.88 billion yuan-worth of
business volume.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the
industry registered business incomes totaling 58.22 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that in the January-June period, the western
provinces realized more rigorous growth than those in the eastern
and central areas, and are likely to make a breakthrough in the
industry in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Another option for accelerating the industry's evolution lies
in telecom services in the countryside, an area that has narrowed
the gap between urban businesses since the beginning of this year,
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
But the progress of a number of state-level telecom projects
still lags behind the schedule issued by the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
During a recent national conference on telecom firms, the
ministry urged local bureaus to speed up investment in these major
projects during the remaining five months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also encouraged domestic companies to increase
their input in the development of cellular telephone technology,
in order to ease the bottleneck in the country's mobile telecom
system.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Rumor Causes Jams at Olympic Broadcasting Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Four hours prior to the opening
ceremony of the Olympic Games, a bomb farce resulted in jams and
two-hour block at the International Broadcasting Center, Atlanta
today.
</P>
<P>
A "suspicious device" was notified by an employee within the
building and security measures had to be taken which resulted in a
two-hour delay for the TV members inside the building, said Bill
Wells, spokesman of the State Olympic Law Enforcement Department.
</P>
<P>
The Center, site of the Georgia World Congress Center, was just
opposite to the CNN building, only a few steps away from the
Centennial Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
"It will be too foolish for people to plant a bomb at the
time when the Games is to be opened hours away," said Marcio
Guedes, a crew member for the Brazilian OTI-TV who was prevented
from entering his office inside for two hours.
</P>
<P>
"Although it might be a kind of joke, I am still a little bit
of scare to enter the building," Guedes quoted his Canadian peer
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The suspicious device was reportedly found on the third
floor, but the spokesman refused to give details to the extent
even not to identify the name of the device.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Slip at the Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 19 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks gave up some
ground Friday as long term interest rates rose and the latest
computer-industry earnings weakened investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.36 to 5,426.82, a loss
of just 83 points for a week which started with an landsliding of
nearly 330 points, or 6 percent, before a stunning rebound Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures also slipped Friday, with the tattered Nasdaq
market showing the worst losses after two strong sessions, but it
was the third straight day of welcome calm.
</P>
<P>
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 12.14 to
1,097.68, but finished the week with a loss of just 6 points.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed much of Friday's weakness to the bond
market, where long-term interest rates edged higher to 6.98
percent.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 402.25 million
shares, down from 469.65 million in the previous session, but
enough to make it the busiest week in NYSE history, with almost
2.5 billion shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Other major stock indexes also declined in the day.
</P>
<P>
Several leading technology issues slid sharply in the aftermath
of their profit reports, released after the markets closed
Thursday.

ATLANTA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) asked Friday the Atlanta Olympic Games Organzing
Committee (ACOG) to improve the serious transportation problems at
Atlanta, according to IOC sources.
</P>
<P>
At a joint meeting attended by the officials of the IOC and the
Association of Sports Federations for the Summer Olympic Games
here Friday afternoon, sports officials critisized the poor
transportation here in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
They said if the problems could not be solved timely, it will
turn out to be a disaster to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch asked the ACOG to adopt
measures to solve the problems immediately.
</P>
<P>
When the Centennial Games opens late today, an estimated two
million people have jamed into the southern American city for the
17-day world biggest sports festival.
</P>
<P>
As some of the drivers are from outside Georgia and don't have
the knack of driving in the city, it caused some delay to athletes
training and other fixed scheduls.

<HEADLINE> Democrats, Republicans Get Big "Soft Money" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Corporations, unions and
wealthy patrons are donating unprecedented amounts of money to the
national party committees with unprecedented amounts of money this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans and Democrats each reported taking in more than
44 million dollars in the last three months alone.
</P>
<P>
Both parties relied heavily on so-called "soft money."
Republicans reported receiving 21 million dollars in soft money
over the quarter ended June 30, while Democrats got 25 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Soft money is supposed to be used only for "party-building
activities," such as get-out-the-vote drives, and is not supposed
to be used to influence federal elections. The political parties
have learned to use soft money for TV ads and other activities
aimed at winning votes.
</P>
<P>
But this year both parties have spent millions of dollars of
soft money on national advertising campaigns designed to sway
votes in November.
</P>
<P>
Each party has received about 35 million dollars in soft money
this year, or seven times the amount the Democrats received in
1992 -- the last presidential year. The figure is more than three
times the 9 million dollars the Republicans received in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Those numbers don't include the amount received by other
fund-raising bodies of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
"There's been dramatic, explosive growth in soft money," said
Donald Simon, executive vice president of Common Cause, a citizen
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
Corporations and unions are prohibited by law from making
political contributions. And individuals are limited to giving
20,000 dollars to national political parties.
</P>
<P>
The political parties have learned to use soft money for TV ads
and other activities aimed at winning votes.

<HEADLINE> Canada Lowers Interest Rates to Boost Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada cut its bank
rate today by a quarter of a percentage point in a bid to boost
the sluggish Canadian economy.
</P>
<P>
The bank's move should bring an identical drop in the prime
rate at major lenders early next week, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the bank rate to 4.75 followed today's release of
lower than expected inflation rate, which dipped to 1.4 percent in
June from an already chilly 1.5 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The rate cut was the fifth by the bank this year. Its last
previous cut was on April 18.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the rate cut, the Bank of Canada said that sluggish
consumer spending is keeping downward pressure on inflation.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the bank had intended to lower rates
two weeks ago when Statistics Canada reported a double-digit
unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
But there was a fear that U.S. rates were going to rise, which
would put pressure on Canadian rates to do the same.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's announcement by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan he had no plans to hike the interests rates in the near
term finally got the pressure off the Bank of Canada.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves $582 Million Stand-By credit for Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today approved a 20-month stand-by credit for Bulgaria
equivalent to about 582 million U.S. dollars in support of the
Government's 1996-97 economic and financial program.
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to achieve read GDP growth of 2.5
percent in 1997, after an expected stagnation this year. Besides,
it also intends to sharply reduce inflation from 20 percent per
month to monthly 2.5 percent by the end of 1996 and to 1.5 percent
by the end of 1997, and achieve an external current account
surplus of 3.1 percent of GDP in 1996 and 2 percent of GDP in
1997. Other objectives of the program also include to increase
official international reserves by 50 percent by the end of this
year to a level that will cover over 2 and a half months of
imports of goods and non-factor services, and to 3 and a half
months in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria joined the IMF in September 1990. Its quota is about
676 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF credit
currently totals about 559 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> (urgent)Karadzic States to Give up All Political Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 19 (Xinhua)-- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic yielded Friday to international pressure to give up all
political power.
</P>
<P>
After 10 hours of haggling overnight in Belgrade, U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke, who brokered last year's Bosnian peace accord,
distributed a statement signed by Karadzic, senior Bosnian Serbs,
Milosevic and his foreign minister announcing that Karadzic was
out.
</P>
<P>
In the document, Karadzic "states that he shall withdraw
immediately and permanently from all political activities."
</P>
<P>
He "will not appear in public, or on radio or television or
other media or means of communication, or participate in any way
in the elections," it said.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic's functions as president of the Bosnian Serbs'
republic will pass temporarily to his aide, Biljana Plavsic.
Another aide, Aleksa Buha, will take the powers and
responsibilities associated with heading the ruling Serbian
Democratic Party, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question the signatures are correct," Holbrooke
said. "This is an important statement. If it's implemented
strictly, it increases significantly chances of successful
elections."
</P>
<P>
Robert Frowick, the American heading the international mission
that will organize Bosnia's elections, cautiously termed
Karadzic's removal "a potentially major step forward."
</P>
<P>
Frowick delayed the start of election campaigning from Monday
to Friday to get Karadzic out. Bosnia's Muslims had threatened to
boycott the elections if Karadzic remained head of the Serbs'
ruling party, while the Serbs threatened a boycott if Frowick
banned the party from elections.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Friday, the Serbian Democratic Party accused the
international community of trying to weaken the party.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
and his visiting Italian counterpart Romano Prodi today decided
upon joint action in the Balkans and the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
"The problems of the Mediterranean are of vital importance to
world peace, and we, the peoples of the region, must solve them.
We have decided on a common aim to act in the Balkans and the
Eastern Mediterranean for the reconstruction of these areas,"
Prodi said after a two-hour meeting this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Simitis laid particular emphasis on their "common ideological
and political positions" on social justice, peace and European
cooperation, noting their decision to renew contacts in order to
discuss specific program for joint action in the Balkans and the
broader region.
</P>
<P>
Prodi highlighted the efforts of the Italian EU presidency in
the first half of the year concerning Greek-Turkish relations and
especially during the Imia crisis in late January.
</P>
<P>
"The solution finally arrived at would not have been found, had
there not been the intense diplomatic and political activity of
the Italian presidency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi arrived earlier today for a one-day visit to Greece.

OTTAWA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The consumer price index (CPI) in
Canada fell by 0.1 percent to 1.4 percent in June, Statistics

</P>

That means Canadian customers paid 1.4 percent more last month
for the goods and services which make up the CPI than in June
1995.
</P>
<P>
Since June last year, items making the largest contribution to
inflation were new vehicles, gasoline, meat, telephone services,
residential rents and restaurant meals.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, consumers paid less than they did last June
for mortgage interest charges, new houses, fresh vegetables, beef
and clothing, the federal fact-gathering agency said.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Put Forward EU Fish Reform Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
has indicated that Britain will launch a diplomatic initiative
next week to protect the country's hard-pressed fishing fleet from
what it calls as unfair competition from other European Union (EU)
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the western England town St Ives earlier today,
Major told the BBC television that the British government would
table proposals for several amendments to EU's founding Treaty of
Rome at the Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, all the member states'
fishing fleets are given a specified catching quota for EU waters,
according to a report.
</P>
<P>
But the British government accused other EU countries, notably
Spanish trawlermen, of obtaining British fishing quotas by forming
British companies to buy up fishing licenses.
</P>
<P>
This action, known as "quota-hopping", has greatly infuriated
both the British fishingmen and many right-wing Conservatives
members of parliament, who pointed out that Britain has ceded too
much power to Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said, "the Common Fisheries Policy is
emphatically not working as it was originally intended to work.
The national quotas were intended to be for the national good."
</P>
<P>
Britain has repeatedly made it clear that it will not consider
EU Commission's proposals for a 40-percent cut in British fishing
fleet until the problem of "quota-hopping" is properly resolved.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pleased with Karadzic's Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
welcomed an agreement reached earlier in the day for the total
removal of all political responsibilities of Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic, saying the move is a significant step in fully
implementing the Bosnian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The deal was produced following 12 hours of "tough"
negotiations in Belgrade between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Karadzic and other top
Bosnian Serb leaders reportedly signed the one-page accord in
which Karadzic agreed to give up power of his SDS party and not
try to influence the September elections by appearing publicly in
any official capacity.
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant step forward in our effort, our
continuing effort to implement successfully the Dayton Accords,"
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a press
briefing here.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important commitment made by the Bosnian Serbs
and we will be watching to see that the Bosnian Serbs undertake
these commitments," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
However, Burns said that Washington "is not fully satisfied
with this agreement" unless Karadzic would be compelled to leave
the country and extradited to the international war crimes
tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
"We remain committed to see Karadzic, an indicted war criminal,
end up in The Hague and on trial," he said. "This is the
fundamental American position and commitment that we have given
the parties and that we made very seriously at Dayton when we
negotiated the peace there."

success of American diplomatic maneuver in liaison with France in
forcing the resignation of the Serb leader.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Christopher and he agreed upon the point that
Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, who were accused of crimes against
humanity and genocide by the International Tribunal on War Crimes
in Former Yugoslavia, should be brought to the tribunal for trial.
</P>
<P>
On whether French troops stationed in Bosnia should participate
in arresting the two men, de Charette said that the most important
thing for Bosnia now is to pave the way for the elections to be
held on September 14.
</P>
<P>
"But I persist in saying that the place for Mr. Karadzic and
Mladic is at the International Tribunal," he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Holds "Sports against Drugs" Exhibit in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is now
holding a photo exhibit "Sports against Drugs" at the main
recreational area for the athletes in the Olympic Village during
the entire games from today through August 4 in Atlanta, according
to U.N. sources.
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, which was also shown in Vienna and New York, is
part of a global campaign on "Sports against Drugs." It was
launched by the Vienna-based United Nations International Drug
Control Program and the International Olympic Committee last year
in Rome.
</P>
<P>
One element of this campaign is an effort to mobilize an ever
increasing number of athletes who, as role models for the young,
can encourage them to make the right choices.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, governments, sports federations and national
Olympic committees are called upon to develop programs and
projects, and to disseminate messages which promote healthy life
styles and alternative coping skills, especially for high-risk
urban youth.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee has informed the
delegations of national Olympic committees about the "Sports
against Drugs" Declaration and encourage their support for the
collection of signatures of renowned athletes participating in the
Olympic Games in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Official: Criminal Act Possible in TWA Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Top U.S. officials
investigating the explosion of the TWA plane today offered
Congress members no conclusion on the cause of the crash, but
another senior aviation safety official said it might be "a
criminal act."
</P>
<P>
James Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director
Louis Freeh briefed members of Congress and told them they did not
know how long it might take to find out the cause of the crash
that killed 230 people.
</P>
<P>
However, NTSB vice chairman Robert Francis told CNN this
morning "the possibility of a criminal act is a distinct one."
</P>
<P>
But at the same time he urged people not to assume that it was
a terrorist work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. officials are trying to prevent people from
threatened by terrorism at a time when the Summer Olympic Games is
going on the American land.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, President Bill Clinton, while expressing his
condolences for the 230 people killed on the plane, warned
Americans not to assume it was a terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the apparently incorrect early speculation that
the April 19, 1995, bombing of a federal office building in
Oklahoma City might have been the work of foreign terrorists.
</P>
<P>
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, after being briefed by
Clinton, said today that the president wanted to dampen
speculation.
</P>
<P>
"We've got the Olympics going on," he said, paraphrasing
Clinton. "People have been worrying about terrorism at the
Olympics. The last thing we need to do is to frighten people
wrongly about terrorism if it doesn't exist."
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials today discounted reports that radar had
detected an object approaching the plane seconds before the
explosion, an Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials also were checking out claims of
responsibility that were being made.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the underground Movement for Islamic
Change had sent a fax to an Arab newspaper in London a day before
the explosion, threatening to hit an American target.
</P>
<P>
But White House spokesman Mike McCurry said there had been "a
variety of calls" claiming responsibility for the crash, but that
their credibility was doubtful.
</P>
<P>
Investigators put hopes on the search of the black boxes,
which might provide clues to what caused the plane to explode.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Canoeist Banned from Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 19 (Xinhua) - Peter Ribe of Norway who won the
bronze medal at the World Canoeing Championships, was circled out
of its Olympic delegation for drugs, Norwegian officials said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ribe was tested positive for ephedrine in Germany last month,
and was banned for three months.
</P>
<P>
However, the convicted who won the bronze medal in the doubles
kayak, claimed that he had taken no drugs but only some tonic food
which contained the stimulant out of his knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Arne Myhrvold, head of the Norwegian Olympic team, said Ribe
would return to Oslo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Ribe becomes the second athlete to be kicked out of the
Centennial Olympic Games after European champion strongman Yuri
Mychkovets was dropped from the Russian Olympic delegation on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian lifter, an entry in the 83-kilogram category,
failed the test in Moscow before leaving for the Atlanta Games.
