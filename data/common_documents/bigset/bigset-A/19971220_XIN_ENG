<HEADLINE> Iraq Invites Reporters to Visit Presidential Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today invited a big
group of Arab and other foreign reporters to visit a number of
Iraqi presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz took more than 60 foreign
correspondents to about a dozen of President Saddam Hussein's
palaces in and outside Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Aziz told reporters that Iraq's guests and
friends are welcome to the state and people's palaces in
accordance with the initiative made by Iraq last month.
</P>
<P>
Iraq last month extended an invitation to experts or diplomats
from member states of the U.N. Special Commission on dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (UNSCOM) and Security Council
member states to be hosted for one week or more at the
presidential sites "to see facts as they are."
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspection work should have been completed within
one year, Aziz said, adding that instead, the work has been
extended to about seven years. He accused the United States of
using weapons inspection as a pretext for keeping the
U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq in place.
</P>
<P>
On U.N. chief inspector Richard Butler's request of a list or
map of the presidential sites, Aziz said, "I told him if you bring
me a letter from the president of the Security Council saying with
pledges on behalf of all the members of the council that those
sites will not be attacked, we will provide you with necessary
list or map."
</P>
<P>
Iraq utterly refused to receive U.N. arms inspectors at the
presidential sites, said Aziz, adding that "it is a matter of
principle regarding the sovereignty and dignity of the nation,
not because we are hiding anything there."
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the reporters on stages of reconstructing some
of the palaces after they were bombed and destroyed during the
Gulf War in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Road Deaths Down to 5-Year Low in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Road Deaths recorded so
far this year in Cyprus are at their lowest since 1991,
according to a police report released here today.
</P>
<P>
There were 97 fatal accidents this year resulting in 111
deaths, compared with 108 fatal accidents and 125 deaths for the
whole of 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Police believe that greater road traffic awareness and
increased road checks and patrols have been the main reasons
for keeping down the death toll.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the Cypriot government has
launched a massive road safety campaign to cut down road deaths.
</P>
<P>
Traffic policemen have been sent to Britain and Sweden to
learn about new techniques in road accident prevention.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been the second worst country in Europe in terms of
accident fatality rate, with only Portugal scoring more deaths
per head of population.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, a total of 626 people have died on the
roads and a further 22,957 have suffered injuries in this
island nation with a population of only 650,000 (in the
southern government-controlled areas).

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading US Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- In South Korea, Kim Dae Jung, a legendary pro-democracy
campaigner, was elected president. Voters repudiated the ruling
party that has presided over an economic crisis. The outcome was
all the more surprising because this is the first time in Korean
history that an opposition candidate was elected to lead the
nation.
</P>
<P>
-- Abandoning his June deadline for withdrawing American
forces from Bosnia, President clinton called for an open-ended
commitment of troops in the peacekeeping mission. Mr. Clinton
denied Republican accusations that he and his aides had misled
Congress by saying they would meet the June exit deadline, saying
that he had simply been wrong.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Two studies of U.S. Census Bureau data show that New York
city's middle class, especially the black middle class, is
shrinking. At the same time, the studies found a rapidly widening
gap between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
-- Faced with new evidence of Iraqi defiance, the Security
Council Thursday began a new round of debate over how to gain
unrestricted access for U.N. inspectors into suspected Iraqi
weapons sites. But it quickly became apparent that the 15-nation
council is sharply divided about how to persuade President Saddam
Hussein to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. trade deficit shrank 13.7 percent in October
because of record exports. But economists said it's only a matter
of time before the Asian financial crisis causes the deficit to
balloon. In a survey of 20 chief executives, 78 percent said the
Asian crisis would cut their exports.
</P>
<P>
-- Netanyahu and Arafat met separately with Secretary of State
Albright, but little progress was made on breaking the stalemate
in peace talks. Arafat said he approved a U.S. document on
security issues. The Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed to
meet separately with Clinton next month.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) today appealed to international donors to provide 12.8
million U.S. Dollars in emergency food aid to displaced people in
northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In a news release issued here today, the WFP said the food
would be supplied to 257,600 people in the districts of Gulu and
Kitgum who were displaced by civil strife.
</P>
<P>
The food recipients include 65,000 school age children and
more than 4,000 orphans and former rebels in vocational training
centers, it added.
</P>
<P>
In the relief operation, the WFP will provide 21,044 tons of
maize meal, pulses, oil, corn-soya blend, salt and sugar to cover
the needs of the displaced people during the six-month period
before the next harvest.
</P>
<P>
The operation will also facilitate the return and assimilation
of former rebels and abducted children by offering food
incentives and vocational training, and provide food as payment
to workers in projects to improve agricultural production, water
supply and sanitation.
</P>
<P>
During the earlier operation, landmines destroyed several of
the trucks transporting 9,766 tons of relief food to 110,000
displaced people in the region, added the release.

<P>
NICOSIA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
Investment Bank has provided Cyprus with a loan of about 30
million ECU (34 million U.S. dollars) for the construction of a
new sewage collection and treatment system and drainage network.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Luxembourg earlier this week and
the loan will cover 40 percent of the total cost of the first
phase of the project in the western coastal town of Paphos,
Cyprus News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Work on the project is expected to start at the beginning of
1998 and is due to be completed by the year 2000. The Paphos
Municipality is trying to secure another 34 million dollars loan
from the Council of Europe Social Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to protect the island's scarce
groundwater resources and further improve the quality of bathing
water in Paphos.
</P>
<P>
Paphos has a population of only 35,000, but is one of the
island's main tourist resorts.

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans Aboard Crashed Plane- Authorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Civil Aviation Authority
of Singapore (CAAS) said Friday night that there were 40
Singaporeans aboard a SilkAir plane that went down near Palembang
in Sumatra, Indonesia in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It said that out of the 97 passengers on board, there were also
23 Indonesians, 10 Malaysians, five Americans and two Japanese
along with one each from India and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there were 14 European passengers and one Australian.
The seven crew members consisted of a Singapore pilot and a New
Zealand co-pilot and five Singaporean cabin attendants.
</P>
<P>
The 10-month-old Boeing 737-300 aircraft was en route from
Jakarta to Singapore. It departed from Jakarta airport at 3:23
p.m. local time and was scheduled to land in Singapore at about 6
p.m.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Air Traffic Control Authority reported that the
last radio contact with the aircraft was near Palembang at about
5:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
A Fokker 50 which was sent to the last site of the SilkAir
airplane before it lost contact with the Indonesian Air Traffic
Control had sighted the crashed SilkAir aircraft on the ground 35
miles north of Palembang.
</P>
<P>
A CAAS spokesman said a search and rescue team comprising one
Charlie 130 and two Super Pumas reached the location just before
10 p.m. The cause of the crash was still too early to be
determined, he said.
</P>
<P>
SilkAir, a subsidiary of the Singapore Airlines, is specialized
in regional flights.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's TRC Lays Charges Against Botha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) today formally laid criminal
charges against former state president P W Botha after he failed
to turn up at a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
Botha was served with a subpoena on December 5 to appear
before the TRC at 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) today for the hearing on the
activities of the former State Security Council (SSC).
</P>
<P>
Western Cape Attorney-General Frank Kahn has asked police to
investigate the charges against Botha after TRC Chairman Desmond
Tutu lodged the case with him, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
He also gave Botha's lawyers time up to January 2 to explain
why the former president should not be prosecuted for failing to
obey the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
"The legal adviser of Mr. Botha has approached me and asked
for an opportunity to make written representations in respect of
facts unknown to me. Time being of the essence, I have given them
until January 2, 1998, after which time, I will make my decision
on all the facts and the law."
</P>
<P>
Should he decide to prosecute Botha, he would not arrest him,
but issue a summon requiring him to appear in a magistrate's
court within 14 days.
</P>
<P>
Tutu was saddened by Botha's repeated refusal to testify
before his commission.
</P>
<P>
"We have been very conciliatory and accommodating. We were
aware that he is a former state president and not as young as he
used to be."
</P>
<P>
Botha has defied three TRC subpoenas. Under the founding bill
of the TRC, he might face a fine and/or up to two years in jail
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Tutu failed to lay charges against Botha on December 5 owing
to a defection of the second subpoena. The subpoena told Botha
the date and venue of the hearing but did not specify the hour.
</P>
<P>
The TRC issued a third subpoena on the same day, ordering him
to appear at 9 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
Botha, 81, has repeatedly said that he would rather be
prosecuted than appear before the TRC, which he described as a
"circus."
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Ernst Penzhorn, sent a fax this week to TRC deputy
chairman, Alex Boraine, spelling out why the former National
Party leader refused to obey the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
The fax, which was made known today, said Botha questioned the
motivation for the subpoena, believing that the reason for the
hearing was not to get information but to "humiliate and abuse"
him.
</P>
<P>
Tutu rejected the allegations, saying: "We are a forum that
does not seek to ridicule anybody."
</P>
<P>
Botha, who was president between 1984 and 1989, chaired the
SSC, a powerful "inner cabinet", at the peak of apartheid
conflict.

of local farmers, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 23.5 million dollars are for the multi-model
transit and trade facilitation project. Under the project, inland
container depots will be constructed in Birgunj in central Nepal
for providing container transportation services through railway,
and in Bhairahawa of western Nepal and Biratnagar in eastern Nepal
for the services by trucks, the RSS said.

<HEADLINE> Car Output In Britain Expected To Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) - Car sales and production in
Britain are set to fall next year as the economy weakens and
consumer confidence slips, according to motor industry forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The latest production figures released by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders showed output last month dropped 1.7
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Output earmarked for the home market rose 3.6 percent to 65,780
but the strength of sterling was largely blamed for a 5.3 percent
drop to 88,500 in shipments for the export market.
</P>
<P>
Production this year is expected to mark time at 1.68 million
and slip by 10,000 next year while sales are expected to be the
second or third best on record at 2.17 million.
</P>
<P>
Next year industry economists expect sales to fall by around
70,000. However they believe production will bounce back in 1999
as new models and capacity come on stream.
</P>
<P>
"We could see spectacular progress then," said Roger King, head
of communications at the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders.

JOHANNESBURG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Delegates of South
Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) cast their votes
today to elect 60 new members to the party's leadership body, the
National Executive Committee (NEC), ANC officials said.
</P>
<P>
Results are expected on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The ANC delegates are gathering at North West University in
Mafikeng, North West Province to hold the 50th ANC National
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Among those who arrived at the conference venue to vote by
secret ballot were Transport Minister Mac Maharaj, Housing
Minister Sankie Mthembi-Mahanyele, Justice Minister Dullah Omar
and Public Works Minister Jeff Radebe.
</P>
<P>
They are among 132 nominees for the 60 directly elected NEC
posts.
</P>
<P>
Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, ex-wife of President Nelson
Mandela, participated in the vote.
</P>
<P>
Winnie, also ANC Women's League president, withdrew from the
race for ANC deputy presidency on Wednesday after failing to
muster sufficient support from the floor, but secured a
nomination for the NEC from several provinces.
</P>

Mandela, who stepped down as ANC president earlier this week
and refused nomination for the NEC on Thursday, cast his vote as

<HEADLINE> South Africa's ANC to Give Its Leadership Longer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
party, the African National Congress (ANC), will hold a national
conference in every five years instead of the present three
years, the ANC national conference voted today.
</P>
<P>
The new rules, passed one day before the five-day conference
ends on Saturday, actually stretched the tenure of senior ANC
officials from three years to five years.
</P>
<P>
ANC's top leaders and members of the policy-making National
Executive Committee (NEC) are elected only by a national
conference.
</P>
<P>
Voting for an amendment of the party's constitution, the
delegates also agreed to create a new body, the National Council,
to function on behalf of the full conference during the interval
between conferences.
</P>
<P>
The council is entitled to decide or review ANC policies, or
fill vacancies in the 60-member NEC, ANC's policy-making body.
</P>
<P>
The NEC was entrusted with setting up the council after
consultation with provinces. Chairman of the ANC's constitutional
commission, Kader Asmal, indicated that the council should not
comprise more than 500 people.
</P>
<P>
Under the changed constitution, a national conference will be
convened "at least every five years" and the NEC may convene a
national council "from time to time", but at least call one
within 31 months of a national conference.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the need for the change, Asmal said national
conferences cost a huge amount of money and energy, and that
decision-making on policy issues tended to get shouldered aside
by politicking around elections to leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
However, some delegates opposing the change said that the
three year period should be kept as the ANC was going through a
period of transformation and transition, and it was absolutely
vital to "get together regularly".
</P>
<P>
The proposed national council would not address these key
issues as the full conference does, they argued.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 voting delegates and a large number of non-voting
participants are gathering at the 50th ANC national conference in
Mafikeng in North-West Province.

<HEADLINE> Unionist party Threatens to Drop out N.Irish Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A Northern Ireland Protestant
party is threatening to quit the multi-party peace talks after
nine IRA prisoners were released from jail early.
</P>
<P>
The Progressive Unionist Party, the political arm of the
outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force guerrilla group, said it might not
go back to the peace talks in January after the Irish government
released nine Irish Republican Army prisoners before their terms
were due.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks adjourned in Belfast on Tuesday without
agreement on a list of key issues to be discussed when they resume
on January 12.
</P>
<P>
"We are affirmed in our belief that there is a process
operating outside the negotiations, and that is unacceptable, It
is absolutely unreasonable, and totally unfair," the Unionist
party's spokesman David Irvine told Irish national broadcaster
RTE.
</P>
<P>
The release of the prisoners was seen as a gesture to boost
delicately poised talks between the pro-British unionists and
republicans who want to break away from British rule and unite
with the Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish premier Bertie
Ahern have voiced optimism that the current talks could end nearly
30 years of sectarian violence which has killed some 3,200 people
in the disputed province.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) agreed today to help Greece
search for a missing Ukrainian plane with 73 people on board that
vanished shortly before landing at the northern Greek airport of
Macedonia on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
A fully-equipped U.S. aircraft would soon fly to the presumed
crash site after a request for U.S. assistance in the search
operation was extended by Greek Alternate Foreign minister George
Papandreou during a meeting with U.S. ambassador to Athens
Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
Since Wednesday night, Greece has launched a land, sea and air
search joined by 6500 troops, police, firemen and farmers, but has
failed to locate the Russian-built Yakovlev 42, which was on route
from Kiev to Thessaloniki, a port city in northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Greece asked a Brussels-based center specializing
in locating downed aircraft for assistance in pinpointing the
position of the Ukrainian plane which disappeared from radar
screens at 9:13 p.m. local time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A team of Ukrainian aviation experts also arrived in
Thessaloniki Thursday night to join the fruitless search.
</P>
<P>
Among the 62 passengers, 20 are foreigners and 42 Greeks. Most
of the Greeks are businessmen or construction workers coming home
for Christmas and new year holidays.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Not Transit for Weapons or Drugs: Chiluba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba pledged today that Zambia will not allow its territory to
be used as a transit for any weapons, drugs or allow its defense
forces to engage in activities aimed at destabilizing other
countries, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a graduation ceremony of the second command and
staff course at the Defense Services Command and Staff College in
the capital, Chiluba reiterated that his government is committed
to the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of
other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Our defense force is purely for defense purposes. Our
territory will never be used for criminal activities by any
organization against other countries," noted the president.
</P>
<P>
Zambia will always cooperate with neighbouring countries, he
said, adding that any harmful weapons intended for destabilizing
other counties will not be allowed to pass through its territory.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the ceremony were several senior officials
including Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa, Zambia Army Commander
Major General Solomon Mombi and visiting Rwandan Vice-President
Paul Kagame.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is allegedly involved in airlifting weapons for
Angola's former rebel movement UNITA (the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola), which has increased
misunderstanding and deteriorated bilateral relations between the
two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba's remarks are also targeted at the growing
drug-related crimes occurring in the Christian country. In the
past months, Zambia's Drug Enforcement Commission has arrested
several hundred suspects who turned Zambia into a transit route
for illegal drugs in southern Africa.

<HEADLINE> Ghana to Start Electricity Rationing in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Due to deficiency in power
supply, Ghana will start a nationwide electricity rationing from
January next year, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Non-essential industries and private electricity consumers
across the country will go without power for 12 hours three times
a week, according to a statement released by the Volta River
Authority, which runs the west African country's two generating
plants and the Electricity Company of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Volta Aluminum Company, mining plants and other
high-consumption industries are expected to be affected by the
load shedding exercise from January 1, and other users 10 days
later.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals and other essential consumers will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
The statement disclosed that Ghana faces an electricity supply
deficiency equivalent to about a third of expected demand for
1998.
</P>
<P>
It said water levels in reservoirs feeding the country's two
hydro-electric dams are so low that any increase in output would
be unsafe.
</P>
<P>
An oil-burning power station at Takoradi, 180 kilometers west
of Accra, should be operational in the first quarter of 1998, the
statement said, adding that it will make the electricity system
less susceptible to the vagaries of the weather.
</P>
<P>
Excess demand is currently met by electricity imports from
neighbouring Togo and Cote d'Ivoire, but are sold in Ghana at
less than the cost.
</P>
<P>
The statement said price hikes are expected soon to reflect
these costs and those projected by the Takoradi Plant.

<HEADLINE> SADC Economy Improves Steadily: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The macro-economic
climate in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) had
improved significantly, South African Press Association quoted a
SADC secretariat year-end report as saying today.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a steady rise in average growth in gross
domestic product (GDP) from three percent in 1994 to 3.7 percent
in 1995 to 4.1 percent in 1996," Executive Secretary Kaire
Mbuende said in the report.
</P>
<P>
"With this trend, it is expected that the growth rate will
have been six percent in 1997."
</P>
<P>
All SADC member states had registered positive growth rates in
1996, ranging from two percent to 13.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Southern Africa remained the most economically active region
in Africa and accounted for 60 percent of the sub-Saharan African
GDP of 300 billion U.S. dollars. Regional GDP per capita, at 990
dollars, had doubled the average of sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
"A measure of success in the economic policies being followed
by SADC member states is the control over inflation," Mbuende
said.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas double digit inflation rates were previously the
norm, in 1996, seven countries had inflation rates of between six
and 12 percent."
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania and Zimbabwe, inflation in 1996 had also been
lowered to between 21 and 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal deficits had been reduced to six percent of GDP in most
SADC countries and it was expected that for 1996-97, they could
be lower.
</P>
<P>
The 14 SADC member states are Angola, Botswana, Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.

SINGAPORE, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Civil Aviation Authority
of Singapore (CAAS) said Friday night that there were 40
Singaporeans aboard a SilkAir plane that crashed near Palembang in
Sumatra, Indonesia in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It said that out of the 97 passengers on board, there were also
23 Indonesians, 14 Europeans, 10 Malaysians, five Americans and
two Japanese along with one each from India, Australia and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The seven crew members consisted of a Singapore pilot and a New
Zealand co-pilot and five Singaporean cabin attendants.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing at the airport here, Singapore Minister for
Communications Mah Bow Tan said that among the 97 passengers on
board the SilkAir flight MI185, there were four boys and three
girls under the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
The crash was "a matter of great regret for us, for Singapore,"
Mah said. "We are concentrating on what is to be done."
</P>
<P>
The crash is said to be the first for Singapore Airlines and
SilkAir.
</P>
<P>
SilkAir, a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, is specialized in
regional flights.
</P>
<P>
The 10-month-old Boeing 737-300 aircraft was en route from
Jakarta to Singapore. It departed from Jakarta airport at 3:23
p.m. local time and was scheduled to land in Singapore at about 6
p.m.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Air Traffic Control Authority reported that the
last radio contact with the aircraft was near Palembang at about
5:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
A Fokker 50 which was sent to the last site of the SilkAir
airplane before it lost contact with the Indonesian Air Traffic
Control had sighted the crashed SilkAir aircraft on the ground 35
miles north of Palembang, Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
A CAAS spokesman said a search and rescue team comprising one
Charlie 130 and two Super Pumas reached the location just before
10 p.m. The cause of the crash was still too early to be
determined, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- About 27 million people
in southern Africa are likely to be affected by drought resulting
from the El Nino weather phenomenon, Southern African Development
Community (SADC) said today.
</P>
<P>
In a year-end report, the SADC urged southern African
countries to be better prepared for adverse weather and epidemic
cattle disease, South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The region, which has been put on alert, is in need of an
extra 600,000 tons of emergency food aid, worth about 200 million
U.S. dollars, the organization's executive secretary, Kaire
Mbuende, said in the report.
</P>
<P>
This is much less than the 1.6 million tons emergency food aid
needed during the 1992/93 drought, as a SADC drought policy
seminar held last month has raised the region's strategic food
reserves level significantly, Mbuende said.
</P>
<P>
The SADC, which comprises 14 central and southern African
countries, also called on its members to work to control and
eradicate the contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, or cattle lung
disease, which has broken out in Angola, Namibia, Tanzania and
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
About 25 million cattle in Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, South
Africa and Zimbabwe are at risk, said the report released at the
SADC headquarters in Gaborone, capital of Botswana.
</P>
<P>
The organization has launched an emergency international
appeal for 7.42 million dollars to tackle the disease, including
the fund for the harmonization of cross-border movements of
cattle, border surveillance, joint research and systematical
vaccination of cattle.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Govt Gives Orders to Fight Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government today have given orders to combat the ravaging floods
which have paralyzed the country's transport system and rendered
hundreds of families homeless.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye has directed people in
flood-prone areas, especially those living on the slopes of
mountains with signs of landslide, to move away.
</P>
<P>
In a government statement issued here today, the prime
minister ordered immediate closure of all impassable roads to
prevent possible road accidents and advised people to refrain
from making unnecessary trips.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered regional and district road engineers to assess
the magnitude of damages on major roads affected by the rains
before taking any temporary measures.
</P>
<P>
The engineers have been required to build temporary bridges
and culverts along roads which were washed away by floods caused
by weeks of continuous rains.
</P>
<P>
The government further directed regional and district
authorities to provide assistance to flood victims who have lost
their houses and properties, especially to women and children.
</P>
<P>
The more-than-average seasonal rains, affected by the El Nino
weather phenomenon, have already led to suspension of several
trains stranding 19,000 passengers, and paralysed more than 600
kilometers of roads across the east African country.
</P>
<P>
About 200 families in Buboka rural district have been rendered
homeless. Following the rains, prices of essential food stuff
have risen. A survey at the Bukoba market in the northwest
revealed that a kilogram of rice which was selling between 400
and 450 Shillings (about 60 US cents) is now priced at 500 to 600
Shillings (nearly one US dollar).
</P>
<P>
The government also advised people to engage in farming
activities to avert possible famine.

program of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) designed for
helping the country go out of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In two messages separately addressed to the president-elect Kim
Dae Jung and out-going president Kim Young Sam, the French
president called on South Korea to undertake "necessary reforms
that the Korean economy needs."
</P>
<P>
Chirac also ensured the two presidents about the understanding
of France for South Korea during "the grave economic and financial
crisis" which the country is experiencing.
</P>
<P>
"France joins other European members of the G-7 (Group of Seven
industrialized countries) in the financing planned within the
framework of the program which you have adopted with the
International Monetary Fund, with a donation of 5 billion U.S.
dollars, which should be the same as that of the United States,"
said the president.

PARIS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- France today welcomed the
maintenance by the United States government of American troops in
Bosnia as "a positive decision which we await."
</P>
<P>
"France has always stressed the need for a joint presence of
Europeans and Americans and insisted on the need for a balanced
sharing of tasks and risks," said French Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.

But she said that it is too early to predict the duration for
the mandate of a new NATO peace-keeping force in Bosnia.

<P>
"The question is pre-mature while the council of NATO examines
the options proposed for this force," said the spokeswoman.

<P>
BEIRUT, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi,
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri met
separately with visiting Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen here today.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, Qian stressed the importance of the
land-for-peace principle in the Mideast peace process, describing
it as the base of the resumption of the deadlocked peace talks.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Hariri, Qian said that the Middle East issue
should be addressed within the United Nations resolutions by means
of political negotiations, adding that the stalemate of the peace
process is very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the land-for-peace principle which was
formulated at the Madrid peace conference in 1991 is the base of
resumption of the Middle East peace talks. This important
principle shouldn't be changed, he added.
</P>
<P>
He called on Israel to withdraw its troops from its occupied
Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hariri elaborated his country's position on
the stalled Mideast peace process, saying Lebanon hopes to achieve a
lasting and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that China will play a larger role in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Qian arrived here Thursday night for a two-day official
visit to Lebanon, the first leg of his five-nation regional tour
aimed at pushing forward peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
After the visit here, Qian will go to Syria, Israel, the
Palestinian self-rule territories and Egypt for talks with
leaders of those countries on bilateral relations and regional
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Qian is the highest Chinese official to visit Lebanon since the
two countries established diplomatic relations in 1971.

<HEADLINE> Six More Kenyans Killed in Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Two police officers and four
civilians were killed today in Trans Mara District of southwest
Kenya, according to a Kenya Television Network (KTN) report
today.
</P>
<P>
Peter Alubaleh, Gucha District Commissioner, was quoted as
saying that "These were brutal killings of innocent government
officers who were on normal duties."
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi declared Thursday Gucha
and Trans Mara border areas as security zones where all political
parties should be kept off.
</P>
<P>
No reason for the killings was known yet, but analysts said
the tribal clashes which were ignited by the current election
led to the deaths of the officers.
</P>
<P>
Moi, who was campaigning in western Kenya's Kisii District
before the December 29 General Elections, barred both the ruling
and opposition politicians from outside the area from campaigning
along the common border areas.
</P>
<P>
The districts of Kisii, Trans Mara, Gucha and Migori have been
experiencing tribal clashes across their common borders which
have left about 35 people dead in the past one month.
</P>
<P>
Presidential candidate Charity Ngilu was today teargassed by
Kenyan police outside Kisii police station after she tried to
address a rally, according to Kisii District Commissioner Mohamed
Saleh.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Ngilu had earlier attempted to enter the
security zone where President Moi banned politicians from outside
against campaigning.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Operation Still on for Crashed Singapore Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Government is
making every effort in the rescue operation after a SilkAir
aircraft crashed near Palembang, Indonesia, this afternoon with 97
passengers and seven crew on board, Minister for Communications
Mah Bow Tan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the Singapore Changi Airport,
Mah said that the relevant authorities of Singapore and Indonesia
were sparing no effort in the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
SilkAir, a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, said that
confirmation was received at 8.30 p.m. local time from the
Indonesian authorities that the missing aircraft had crashed on
the ground 35 miles north of Palembang in Sumatra, which is
mid-way between Jakarta and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
There was little hope of any survivors from the crash, rescue
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), together with
the Republic of Singapore Air Force, has activated its emergency
rescue team, Mah said, adding that an experienced medical team
from the Asian Emergency Assistance has also been activated.
</P>
<P>
CAAS officials confirmed at the press conference that among the
97 passengers, there were four boys and three girls under the age
of 12.
</P>
<P>
"I think any accident of this nature is something to be
regretted. It is a matter of great regret for us, for Singapore.
At this moment, we must concentrate on what to be done," Mah said.
The crash is the first in the history of either Singapore Airlines
or SilkAir, which flies mostly regional routes.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft that went down was a 10-month-old Boeing 737-300
and was the newest aircraft in the fleet.
</P>
<P>
Mah said that arrangements had been made to take the relatives
of those aboard the ill-fated plane to Palembang tomorrow, and for
relatives outside Singapore, the Singapore authorities had
informed the embassies concerned of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Of the 97 passengers, 40 were Singaporeans, 23 Indonesians, 10
Malaysians, 14 Europeans, five Americans, two Japanese, and one
each from Australia, India and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The CAAS said there has been no indication of casualties yet,
but that everything possible is being done to reach the aircraft
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
Minister Mah said that a thorough investigation into the
accident will be conducted once the rescue operation is completed.

SINGAPORE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- SilkAir, the regional wing
of Singapore Airlines, said on Saturday that the fate of the 97
passengers and seven crew of the flight MI 185 that crashed in
Palembang, Indonesia, Friday afternoon, was still not known.
</P>
<P>
But local television quoted Indonesian sources as saying that
it was unlikely there would be any survivors from the crash which
took place 35 miles northeast of Palembang in Sumatra, mid-way
between Jakarta and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Among the 97 passengers on board, there were four boys and
three girls under the age of 12, SilkAir said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the 10-month old Boeing 737-300 aircraft, the
newest in SilkAir's fleet, was leased from General Electric
Capital Auto Financial Services Inc. (GECAS) on February 14, 1997.
</P>
<P>
As at 02:00 a.m. (Singapore time) Saturday, search and rescue
operations for the crashed plane were continuing, SilkAir said.
Flight MI 185 was en route from Jakarta to Singapore when it lost
radio contact Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of the plane was strewn over a marshy area after
the Boeing 737 went down, local television quoted rescue officials
as saying.
</P>
<P>
SilkAir said that the relatives of passengers on board flight
MI185 will be flown to Palembang by SilkAir later Saturday
morning.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll on S. African Roads Reaches 321 in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 321 people have
died in traffic accidents in South Africa since December 1, the
National Traffic Information Center said today.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six people were killed Wednesday when the bus they were
traveling in rushed into a deep valley near
Queenstown in Eastern Cape while a head-on collision between a truck
and a minibus taxi near Pietermaritzburg in Kwazulu-Natal claimed 10
lives.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents usually peak at the Christmas season when holiday
makers drive long distances to resorts.
</P>
<P>
The information center said the death toll is lower compared with
the same period last year, but it is still too early to be optimistic
as sharp traffic flow is expected on national routes in the
Christmas-New Year week.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people were killed during last year's Christmas
holiday period.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Leone Peace Process Suffers Setback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean peace process is
to face setback as the military junta is reluctant to hand over power
to ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah on April 22 next year as
agreed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with the British Broadcasting Corporation today, the junta
leader, Paul Koroma said this is because the disarmament process
which should have begun on December 1 is yet to start.
</P>
<P>
"The disarmament should have started on December 1, but up till
now, nothing has been done. So naturally, I think we cannot meet the
target set in the Conakry accord," Koroma said.
</P>
<P>
Koroma's spokesman, Samura Mohammed, blamed the delay in
distributing relief food and other goods, saying that it led to the
military leader to favor a delay in the handover date.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace accord signed on October 23 in Conakry, Guinea,
Koroma agreed to return power within six months to Kabbah, whom he
ousted in the coup last May.
</P>
<P>
The accord also provides that disarmament of all people with
weapons in Sierra Leone should be disarmed, demobilized and
reintegrated beginning December 1, while relief goods shall be brought
in.
</P>
<P>
But Koroma does not agree to the disarmament of his armed forces,
arguing that it is the national army. He is also opposed to the
dominance of nigerian troops in the west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is mandated to monitor the disarmament process and
police the country to enforce sanctions approved by the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The intransigent stance of the junta has led to failure of a number
of talks between it and ECOMOG on the implementation of the Conakry
accord.
</P>
<P>
Although the junta's reluctance to abide by the handover deadline
is sort of within the expectation of some observers, it has come under
fire from Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the ousted president today strongly condemned the
Koroma's statement, saying that "The junta wanted to delay the whole
process by putting obstacles from the beginning."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Koroma's intention to delay the handover is
something "we have predicted long ago", the spokesman said, "as of now,
we have not accepted anything beyond April 22. It's totally
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also gave some evidences to support his assertion
that the junta is not serious about the peace process, such as the
employment of foreign mercenaries, including those from Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman remained optimistic about the future of the
peace process in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"We think the peace process is still alive. But it is the junta
that wants to kill it," he said, adding that consultation is underway
between Kabbah and the international community to carry out the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Koroma's statement to delay the handover deadline followed
Wednesday's ECOWAS extraordinary summit in Lome, Togo, where leaders
of the sub-region agreed in principle to set up a permanent mechanism
for conflict prevention, management, resolution and peace keeping in
west Africa.
</P>
<P>
Out of the expectation of many observers, the summit did not touch
the crisis in Sierra Leone, which was deepened with recent clashes
between the junta forces and the pro-Kabbah Kamajor militias.
</P>
<P>
However, sources said, the ECOWAS committee of five will soon meet
in Abijan, Cote D'ivoire, in a bid to resolve the impasse in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising foreign ministers from Nigeria, Ghana,
Guinea, Cote D'ivoire and Liberia, is mandated by ECOWAS to deal with
the Sierra Leonean crisis in the wake of the may 25 Coup.

<HEADLINE> Belorussia Calls for Tightened Military Ties with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 19 (Xinhua) --Belorussian President Alexader
Lukashenko said today that efficient operation of his country's
army is possible only together with Russia, the Itar-Tass reported
on Friday from Minsk, Belorussia.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev,
Lukashenko said the two states should come to a new level of
military and technical cooperation and should "bring closer the
armed forces of Russia and Belorussia to protect the common
Homeland and borders of the Russia-Belorussia Union".
</P>
<P>
The president also noted that Russia should not create
additional forces in the western direction. "It should fully use
might which we created together in Belorussia in the past," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev, on his part, stressed that it is high time to
formulate legally conceptual provision of the treaty on the
Russia-Belorussia Union in the military sphere.
</P>
<P>
This will be done by signing nine documents at the interstate
level, including a treaty on cooperation between the two states in
the military sphere and an agreement on combined efforts of
regional security of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to lay down on Friday after the meeting a legal
basis which will help to implement the main provisions of
cooperation in the military sphere within the framework of the
Russia-Belorussia Union Treaty and Charter.
</P>
<P>
The Russia-Belorussia Union was established on April 2, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Turkey in EU Membership Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The German government today
rejected a Turkish accusation that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
has blocked Ankara's bid for European Union (EU) membership for
religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
Kohl reportedly said in a speech to a meeting of Christian
political parties on Thursday that the EU was based on Christian
principles and that there was no place in it for those states
which did not share that identity.
</P>
<P>
In response, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said in a
speech in Washington that Kohl's remarks were directed at Turkey.
What was behind the exclusion of Muslim Turkey from the EU was an
intention to turn Europe into "a Christian club", he added.
</P>
<P>
German government spokesman Peter Hausmann said today that the
Turkish accusation addressed at Bonn "is wrong and make no sense".
</P>
<P>
The good relations between the German and Turkish peoples over
the past decades and the religious freedom for the Muslim
community in Germany was evidence of the contrary, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has been angered by a decision of EU leaders last
weekend under which Turkey was excluded from among 11 countries
which were invited to join the negotiating process for EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz has warned that Turkey, which has been seeking to join
the EU for 34 years, would withdraw the membership bid entirely if
the EU did not include it in the list of candidates.
</P>
<P>
Washington reportedly is trying to mediate between the two
sides.

<HEADLINE> Security on Top of GCC Summit Agenda: Kuwaiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Information
Minister Sheikh Saud Al-Sabah said today that the summit of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to be opened here Saturday will
place the security issue on top of its agenda.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters who arrived here to cover the event
at a reception this evening that the summit would tackle several
issues such as the economic and political integration, but the
security issue "remains atop of priorities of peoples and leaders
of the GCC."
</P>
<P>
He said people in the GCC, which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, have strong
desire for more cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
However, on Kuwait's hesitation to sign a GCC security
agreement sought by other member states, Sheikh Saud said
"there is no opposition but there are some articles in the
agreement that violate the Kuwaiti constitution, and we cannot
violate the constitution." He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
On relations between the GCC and Iran, the minister said that
"they are good and we are keen to expand and strengthen them." He
noted that resolving disputes will help boost relations between
Iran and countries in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
While talking about Iraq, the minister stressed that there
should be a clear line separating the Iraqi people from their
regime, saying that Kuwait was among the first states to call for
the end of suffering of Iraqis through the implementation of
Security Council resolution 986 which aims to end this agony.
</P>
<P>
But he added that lifting the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq
for its invasion of kuwait in 1990 is within the authority of
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The GCC leaders are expected to arrive here Saturday to take
part in the three-day summit aimed at a long-sought economic and
military integration.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the summit, Kuwait has taken very intensive
security measures, including armored cars and armed troops,
around the Bayan Palace where the summit will be held and
hotels where the delegations will stay.
</P>
<P>
Police have been stopping cars around the capital to check
identity cards since Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Drops in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada's annual inflation rate
dropped to 0.9 percent in November from 1.5 percent in October,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
It's the lowest inflation rate since January 1995, when the
annual rate was measured at 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Canada's inflation rate has been going down since early this
year, when it was 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
November's rate drop was mainly the result of decreases in
transportation and cable television charges across the country,
the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the month, the auto insurance rate edged down 0.4 percent,
while auto and gasoline prices dropped 0.3 percent and 2.5 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The charges for cable television was off 3.6 percent, mainly
because some cable companies offered new channels free until next
year, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there were significant increases in air fares,
university tuition fees and local telephone services charges,
which contributed largely to the 0.9 percent annual advance in the
all-items price index.

<HEADLINE> Somali Factions Talks in Cairo End Fruitless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Somali factions failed to
reach agreement in Cairo, Egypt, on a number of key issues,
including the venue of the national reconciliation conference, a
spokesman from the Somali National Salvation Council (NSC) has
said.
</P>
<P>
NSC spokesman Ismail Warsame said Somali factions usually
reached decisions on consensus. However, he said, unfortunately
this has not been the case in the current Cairo talks save the
one item dealing with the system of the future Somali government,
according to a local press report.
</P>
<P>
Factions also failed to reach agreement on the fair
representation of clans in the reconciliation conference and the
withdrawal of Hussein Aideed's militia from certain occupied
districts.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the venue of the national reconciliation conference,
the spokesman said, Aideed's group seemed reluctant to go to
Bossasso, a venue which has been unanimously adopted and
reaffirmed by the NSC, adding that although Bayidawa has been
proposed as an alternative venue for the conference, it failed to
receive unanimity among the negotiating parties in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
As to the withdrawal of his forces from occupied areas around
Mogadishu, Aideed has a ''no'' position on the ground that there
is no central government in Somalia, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Warsame said that such position is unacceptable to the
NSC as it would be absurd to negotiate peace while military
forces forcefully occupy certain districts.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Aideed's stand on the manner of
representation, which is a fifty-fifty representation between his
group and NSC, is also unacceptable by the NSC.
</P>
<P>
''NSC believes that the Somali civil war is based on tribal
and clan conflict, and in order to reach peace, these clans must
be reconciled and every clan in Somalia must have a
representation and a voice in the national reconciliation
conference,'' Ismail Warsame said, adding that the NSC policy
towards the national reconciliation conference is that delegates
will be drawn from all clans and sub- clans proportionally and
fairly.
</P>
<P>
The NSC will convene soon its third ordinary session in Addis
Ababa to reassess the results of the Cairo meeting, to extend the
NSC mandate which expires in early January and to discuss on the
possibility of holding the envisaged national reconciliation
conference early next year, according the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> SADC Leaders to Meet on UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state from
Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries are to
meet early next year to discuss UN sanctions against Angola's
UNITA, South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of great concern to us that UNITA (the Union
for the total Independence of Angola) has yet to fully commit to
implementation of the Lusaka Protocol," SADC Executive Secretary
Kaire Mbuende said in a year-end report released today.
</P>
<P>
"SADC fully supports the UN sanctions on UNITA and the heads of
member states will soon meet to consider actions and strategies to
facilitate the more effective application of those sanctions."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed sanctions on UNITA after it failed
to comply with the Lusaka Peace Protocol, which provided for a
cease-fire between UNITA and government troops, the establishment
of a government of national unity and a reorganization of rebel
troops.
</P>
<P>
UN sanctions include travel ban on senior UNITA leaders and closure
of UNITA offices around the world.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende admitted that there were differences in opinion within the
SADC over the working of its organ on democracy, defense and security,
but denied that these were restricted to particular members.
</P>
<P>
"These is nothing unusual about this, as we in SADC have developed
a culture of engaging in serious and frank debates before taking
decisions by consensus." he said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Egypt for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat arrived here this evening from Luxembourg for a two-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will brief Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Saturday on
the result of the U.S. and European bid to reactivate the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency said that their talks will focus on
Arafat's latest talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the
European Union leaders in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Albright held separate meetings with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in Paris and Arafat in London Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Albright-Netanyahu meeting which last nearly three hours
failed to determine the time and percentage of further Israeli
redeployment from the West Bank as the Israeli leader took no
proposals with him to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Egypt has said that it is not ready
now to receive Netanyahu because he has nothing new to offer.
</P>
<P>
"We are not saying that we will not deal with the head of the
Israeli government ... but the target of his visit has to be the
reactivation of the peace process," Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
told the Arabic-language Al Hayat Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"If we talk over issues that were previously discussed and
promises that were not delivered, we will be only repeating
ourselves and doing more harm than good," he told the London-based
daily.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is fully aware of Israeli plans, but we cannot accept
anything short of a balanced peace. And we will not help Netanyahu
swallow up Palestine," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have broken down since March over
the Israeli settlement building in East Jerusalem and long overdue
troop pullout from the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has mediated between the Palestinian and Israeli leaders
several times in the past few months to no avail.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The ruling South African
party, African National Congress (ANC), called for regular
monitoring of the health of commercial sex workers, according to
a resolution tabled today at the ANC national conference.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged the Department of Labor and the
Department of Health to draw up a confidential register of all
commercial sex workers to ensure regular monitoring of their
health, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The criminalization of the sex industry was a deterrent to the
rigorous monitoring of the health of sex workers, the resolution
said.
</P>
<P>
The department of Health should also take appropriate measures
to ensure that sex workers had regular and confidential access to
the public health system as a means of curbing the spread of all
sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
The Gauteng province has proposed legalization of prostitution
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Another draft ANC resolution on discrimination on sexual
orientation calls for gay people to have the right to marry.
</P>
<P>
Recognition of same sex relations should aslo extend to work
benefits, including housing, medical aid and compassionate leave.
</P>
<P>
The far-reaching resolution calls for the inclusion of lesbian
and gay youths in all youth programs, policy and law and their
protection from discrimination at home, at school, on the streets
and in the media.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the 50th national congress of the ANC had to sit
late into the night to adopt more than 100 resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Discusses Presidential Hopefuls for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Speaker Newt Gingrich of
the U.S. House of Representatives said he will decide whether to
run for president in 2000 by Labor Day 1999, but his office said
that his comments were just hypothetical.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said in today's edition of the Marietta Daily Journal
that he includes himself among a handful of Republican hopefuls
who are viable presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
"If you put together a list of 20, I am on the list," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's spokeswoman, Christina Martin, said Gingrich was
speaking hypothetically in discussing a presidential run.
</P>
<P>
"The speaker has stated repeatedly and with absolute resolve
that he plans to be speaker until the year 2003," The Associated
Press quoted Martin as saying today. "The concept of a
presidential bid is nothing but a hypothetical (one) wrapped in a
prospect, wrapped in a possibility."
</P>
<P>
Gingrich told the newspaper his list of potential Republican
presidential nominees included 1996 vice presidential nominee Jack
Kemp, former Vice President Dan Quayle, Texas Governor George W.
Bush, Michigan Governor John Engler and Arizona Senator John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said it is too early to discuss whether he would
resign as speaker to run for president. He said his immediate goal
next year will be maintaining a majority in the House, which he
predicts Republicans will accomplish.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urged to Help Solve Iraq-UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's official newspaper
Al-Gomhuria today called on the permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council to help solve the standoff between Iraq and
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
It warned that the insistence on inspecting the Iraqi
presidential sites by UNSCOM would lead to more aggressive acts,
stressing that these can be avoided if the U.N. Security Council
members launch initiatives between Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM oversees the elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction and must certify Iraq's full compliance before the
Security Council can decide the lifting of economic sanctions
imposed since 1990 following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper appeal coincides with the ongoing discussions by
the Security Council of a resolution warning Iraq against
preventing UNSCOM arms inspectors from entering the presidential
sites.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has categorically rejected admitting the arms inspectors
into those sites, arguing the palaces stand for the Iraqi
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq last month extended invitation to international
observers to visit the palaces for a period ranging between one
week and one month at their convenience to "get first-hand
knowledge about the truth."
</P>
<P>
Each UNSCOM member state can send two experts and diplomats and
each U.N. Security Council member, five, it said. But this
overture barely met with any reaction.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Iraq invited a large number of Arab and foreign
reporters to has a glimpse of those imposing presidential palaces
in an attempt to negate the accusations that those sites were used
to cover Iraq's secretive biological and chemical weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
"This move showed Iraq's good will and its readiness to
cooperate with the U.N. and the Security Council permanent members
to reach a satisfactory solution to the Iraqi-UNSCOM row involving
the inspection sites," the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The paper toed the government line that the palaces were not
marked for inspection until 1996, therefore, they are out of the
agenda of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Registering the palaces on the inspection lists five years
after the start of inspections is a "provocative" move aiming to
invent a crisis with Iraq with a view to delaying the lifting of
the embargo against Iraq, it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, chief of UNSCOM Richard Butler accused Iraq of
hiding banned weapons inside the presidential palaces, asserting
he has proofs for his accusations.
</P>
<P>
The crippling U.N. economic sanctions barred the country from
exporting oil, its economic mainstay, except for humanitarian
purposes.

<HEADLINE> Development Given Top Priority by S. Africa's New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- New leader of South
Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC), Thabo Mbeki,
today listed economic growth and the fight against crime as the
priorities of his office.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to pursue the objectives of high and
sustained economic growth and development to achieve a visible
improvement in the standard of living of our people, with special
emphasis on the poor," Mbeki said in a closing speech at the
party's 50th national conference.
</P>
<P>
"We must engage all our structures directly in the fight
against crime, including the abuse of women and children, and
ensure that we mobilize the masses of the people to take up this
war as well as the war against corruption," he said in the
speech, which was made available here.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to transform the old state machinery "as
speedily as possible" to make it serve the interests of the
people.
</P>
<P>
The new ANC president taunted predictions that his party would
be torn apart by in-fighting at the conference in Mafikeng,
North-West Province.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, what we had convened in Mafikeng to do has happened," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"All this has happened, and in an atmosphere marked by a
strong spirit of comradeship, common purpose and frank, honest
and uninhibited discussion, without any suggestion whatsoever
that any of the delegates feared to express their views for fear
of victimization."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki chanted an eulogy to his predecessor, Nelson Mandela,
who chose to step down at the conference to allow Mbeki to step
into his shoes. He even declined nomination for the National
Executive Committee, ANC's top policy-making body.
</P>
<P>
"Once more, many thank, Madiba (Mandela's clan name), for who
you are, for what you are, for what you have done for us and for
our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said, "the happiness of your people will be your reward,
the loyalty of the members to the traditions of your movement,
your pride."
</P>
<P>
"We dare not and will not fail," he told Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference ended today with the election of a new
leadership and the adoption of important resolutions that will guide
the country into the next century.

<HEADLINE> Service Sector Becoming Dominant in Chinese Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The service sector is expected
to approach 54 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) this
year in the Chinese capital after a dozen of years of speedy
development, according to the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
With a GDP of 180 billion yuan (22 billion U.S. dollars),
Beijing does not occupy an eye-catching position in the country's
economic structure. However, the proportion of its service sector
is conspicuous among China's 31 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
"Since the 1980s, Beijing's tertiary industry has been
increasing at an annual speed of more than 10 percent, accounting
for approximately 68 percent of the annual growth of the city's
GDP," said Miao Li, an official with the municipal Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 57 percent of the city's employees now
work in the service sector.
</P>
<P>
"Only 10 years ago, to ordinary Beijing residents, the tertiary
industry was another name for small restaurants and groceries
which mushroomed overnight," said Miao. "However, commerce now
only accounts for one-fourth of the whole industry, with the
sector of finance, insurance, communications and tourism
increasing at a stunning speed."
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese capital continues its high growth rate, "the
tertiary industry in Beijing is bound to have a promising future
owing to its large population and its peculiar position as a
political and cultural center," Miao said.

<P>
TAIYUAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Data shows that more than 350
species of wild birds are living in Shanxi Province on north
China's loess plateau, with 50 of them under state protection.
</P>
<P>
Recently a winter habitat of black storks was discovered in
Lingqiu County. And about 500 white herons, believed to live only
in southern China, were found in Yongji County. About 1,800 white
swans were seen for the first time in Ruicheng County.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the province has built 11 nature reserves
covering an area of 108,000 hectares. In addition to planting
trees, the province took measures to control water and soil
pollution. And hunting wild birds has been prohibited.
</P>
<P>
After the environment of the wild birds was improved, the
habitats were enlarged. The province established three special
nature reserves for brown eared-pheasants, which are under
first-class state protection..
</P>
<P>
At least seven species of the rarest birds in the world were
found in the province, including relict gulls, which are on the
verge of extinction. Only about 3,000 pairs of relict gulls
survive now in China, Russia and Mongolia.

<P>
NANJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-eight local silk
producers and traders in east China's Jiangsu Province have
established the Jiangsu Province Silk Group.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu is one of the largest silk producers in China,
accounting for one-fourth of the country's total in terms of
output and export.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994 the province's silk production and exports have
declined because of local competition. In 1996, the provincial
government set up the group to stop the "civil war" in the local
silk industry.
</P>
<P>
The newly formed group boasts 3.14 billion yuan in total
assets, 4.46 billion yuan in yearly sales, and 350 million
U.S. dollars in annual imports and exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The search operation was
suspended at nightfall Saturday at the crash site of the SilkAir
flight MI185 with no survivors found, but body parts and personal
possessions of some of the 97 passengers on board, the SilkAir
said tonight.
</P>
<P>
It said that the body parts found have been taken to a hospital
in Palembang and will be kept in the mortuary there.
</P>
<P>
Besides, neither the flight data recorder nor the cockpit voice
recorder have been found yet. The search for these will continue,
starting at 06:00 on Sunday, SilkAir said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the current at the river mouth where the search
was taking place was very swift, and the Musi river was muddy and
the underwater visibility was poor. These conditions made it
dangerous for operations to continue at night, the SilkAir, the
regional wing of the Singapore Airlines, explained.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, rescuers found two big aircraft pieces, a
wing-tip part and a rudder part in a swampy area on the Musi
River, near Palembang.
</P>
<P>
On board the Boeing 737-300 that crashed Friday afternoon were
passengers from Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the United States,
Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Bosnia, Austria, Australia,
India, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Singapore television said in its report this evening that up to
this moment, it could be said that no one of the 104 aboard the
SilkAir flight MI185, including seven crew, survived the tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns Turkish Hostility, Urges Troops Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 20 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi Foreign Ministry
spokesman said today Baghdad condemns "Turkish practices of
hostility" and called on Turkey to pull out its troops from Iraqi
territory immediately.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency INA quoted the spokesman as saying
today that the latest Turkish invasion of northern Iraq, which
started on December 5, is not a step forward towards a
comprehensive pullout of the Turkish troops from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Chief-of-Staff Office on December 16 issued a
statement announcing the end of military operations in northern
Iraq. The spokesman said this ploy has been frequently used by
Turkey following any fresh invasion and since the 1991 Gulf War,
under the pretext of hunting down anti-Turkey rebel members.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has said the object of its cross-border operations is to
wipe out the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) militants that
seek shelter in northern Iraq and launched attacks on Turkish
targets from there. PKK is fighting a separatist war in eastern
and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Iraq considers such conduct as a means to
mislead the Turkish public opinion and attempt to contain the
international condemnation of the Turkish hostile policy," said
the spokesman.

FUZHOU, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Nanping Paper Mill, one of

<HEADLINE> Round-up: New Leadership to Lead S. Africa into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) has concluded its 50th national
conference, with its newly-elected leadership headed by Thabo
Mbeki vowing to lead the country into the 21st century while
adhering to its current policies.
</P>
<P>
The ANC top leaders are aiming to transform South Africa into
a united, non-racial, non-sexist and prosperous society,
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of senior South African political writers
and editors after his election at the conference in Mafikeng,
North West Province Wednesday night, Mbeki, also deputy president
of the state, identified three areas as his major focus as the
new party chief and the effective leader of government.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, he said the ANC will continue to ensure that state
machinery functions properly. This is no doubt the most important
task laid in front of Mbeki and his policy-making body -- the ANC
National Executive Committee.
</P>
<P>
To realize national reconciliation is one of the resounding
slogans put forward by the black dominated political party since
the first non-racial national elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Nelson Mandela, who stepped down of his own accord as the ANC
president after the latest party's national conference, is still
enjoying high prestige among the black, the white and other races
in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
His relief from the party chief does not mean from now on he
will separate himself from the party. In fact, his political
influence has penetrated everywhere in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that Mandela, who is still president
of the country, is a general architect of national reconciliation
in South Africa, and will remain his such influence in the party.
This has not only become a conscientious act of the party
members, but also a must for the whole party.
</P>
<P>
The reason for this is clear and natural -- nobody in the ANC
can compete with Mandela in terms of political influence.
</P>
<P>
The ANC attaches great importance to national reconciliation,
which, in the final analysis, is a reconciliation of the black
and the white.
</P>
<P>
Although South Africa's democratic system is now
three-and-half years old, there is little change of the phenomena
that the white people with beautiful houses and cars enjoy much
better life than the majority of the black people. The vestiges
of apartheid have prevented many of them showing confidence in
each other.
</P>
<P>
The ANC leadership has clearly realized that South Africa can
never make headway before the black and the white reach in real
political harmony.
</P>
<P>
How can the two reconcile? the ANC has its own way: unite the
rich white and leave their interests untouched within the
framework of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The ANC leadership expressed that direct dealing with the
white entrepreneurs and investors would ensure that there was a
commitment to improving the economic performance of various
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he saw dialogue with individual companies as the
only route to get results. He would be personally involved in
this campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring the Afrikaner, Mbeki said they would hold talks with
leaders of Afrikaners next year to provide a forum where fears
could be expressed and views shared about the future of all
groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a possibility that one of the public
holidays, such as September 24 (heritage Day), could be dedicated
to "celebrate Afrikaner culture to show that Afrikaner culture is
not under threat".
</P>
<P>
Of all social problems in South Africa, unemployment and
violent crimes have become the most glaring ones. The past
experience has proved that the fundamental way to solve these
problems is to develop economy and to promote employment.
</P>
<P>
GEAR -- growth, employment and redistribution --, and
affirmative action, both initiated by the ANC government last
year, will remain its basic guidelines to solve all social
problems.
</P>
<P>
The just concluded ANC national conference is also an
important process, in which Mbeki called on all party members to
make efforts to improve the party's leading images, and to weed
out corruption through a national campaign that involved all
people.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki pointed out that there would be no tolerance of
corruption within the party and the state machinery including
police and justice system and other areas.
</P>
<P>
For some time, many South Africans have kept complaining
corruptions among ANC officials, thus having greatly damaged
reputation of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Support for the ANC has fallen by 10 percent over the past
three years, an August survey by the Human Sciences Research
Council has found.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that a total of 53 percent of 2,917 voters
questioned in February expressed support for the ANC, compared
with 55 percent last year, 56 percent in 1995, and 63 percent in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Mandela warned at the ANC National Conference that the
majority of opposition political parties would seek to combine
their efforts to reduce the support his organization obtained in
the 1994 elections.
</P>
<P>
"They will seek their result in order to create the situation
in which not only are we weakened and themselves strengthened,
but also in which were unable to govern effectively without their
consent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Following the latest national conference, the ANC has adopted
a resolution to start campaigning immediately for the 1999
general elections, aiming to secure at least a two thirds
majority.
</P>
<P>
To attain this aim, the ANC will put its emphasis in the
campaign on provinces of the Western Cape and Kwazulu Natal where
the majority support have been shared by the white dominated
National Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the biggest
black opposition in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said last week that the ANC would welcome a merger
with the IFP in the interest of national unity. A merger between
the two black parties would be "a very progressive development"
as South Africans needed to speak with one voice, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mbeki, his party had been involved in peace talks
and cooperating with the IFP in the national and Kwazulu Natal
provincial government.
</P>
<P>
He said it was possible that IFP leader Mangosutho Buthelezi
could become deputy president of the country if cooperation
between the two parties developed in such a way as to warrant
this.
</P>
<P>
The party chief said the election of Jacob Zuma as deputy ANC
president did not mean he would become deputy president of the
country. "The two positions are not linked," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to continuing its domestic policies, the ANC also
pledged to promote its international relations. In its
resolutions, the ANC attached great importance to world
cooperation, vowing to build a strong, all-round South-South
relations, and further its relations with Asian, Latin American
and the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
The ANC also expects to strengthen its links with developed
countries and all important international economic partners with
regard to trade, investment and technology transfers.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, described by Mandela as a man of 'exceptional
qualities" and "diplomat", has expressed self-confidence in his
party presidency. He said he was aware that moving into Mandela's
position was a huge responsibility but did not expect difficulty
either outside and in the ANC.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Macao Residents Urged to Strive for Better Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Macao residents should make
concrete efforts in preparing for a better future, local
celebrities said.
</P>
<P>
As the two year countdown of Macao's return to China was
observed Saturday, local social group leaders, legislators and
newspapers are urging the residents to unite and make joint
efforts to strive for a better future for Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Macao residents should be united in the final and crucial
stage of the transition," said Tong Seng Chiu, president of the
Macao Federation of Workers' Unions, in a recent interview. "They
should strive with their own efforts and wisdom to remove the
obstacles in Macao's transition, and embrace the historical moment
with concrete actions."
</P>
<P>
Edmundo Hau-Hwa Ho, president of the Macao Bankers' Association
and vice-president of the Macao Legislative Assembly (LA), said in
a separate interview that he hoped Macao residents would take an
active part in Macao's transition.
</P>
<P>
While being confident of a smooth handover and normal operation
of the Macao SAR government, Ho said Macao residents' active
participation in transition and their wisdom are needed to create
a better future for Macao.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials in Macao also urged the residents to play an
active role.
</P>
<P>
Zong Guangyao, deputy-director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao
Branch, told reporters on Friday that he hoped Macao residents
would make joint efforts for a smooth handover.
</P>
<P>
"Macao's transition has entered the most important and crucial
period," he said. "But the tasks in the transitional period are
still arduous. We need good cooperation between Portugal and China
as well as joint efforts of Macao residents for the smooth
handover."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Susana Chou, a member of the Macao LA, said that an
earlier establishment of the preparatory committee of the Macao
SAR is preferable to a later one, adding that it will help resolve
many transitional issues and better prepare for the realization of
Macao people administering Macao.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's "Cheng Pou" newspaper said in a commentary that "We
should make good preparations for the future."

<P>
NANJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- East China's coastal province
of Jiangsu is making a new effort to develop eco-agriculture and
make all its counties environmentally friendly by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Top priority will be given to developing an eco-agricultural
pilot area along the Taihu Lake watershed, increasing
contributions of agro-sciences, and building up a sound mechanism
to promote the work, according to a recent provincial meeting.
</P>
<P>
All the industrial enterprises have been asked to meet targets
set for waste discharges by the end of the century. The province's
industry, especially township industry, plays a dominant role in
the country. However, industrial wastewater has contaminated the
environment.
</P>
<P>
More than a million hectares of farmland has been polluted, 20
percent of the province's total, and nearly 300,000 hectares of
water resources have been polluted. As a result, fish and shrimp
have disappeared from some rivers.
</P>
<P>
Misuse and abuse of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and
plastic sheeting have compacted agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
As part of the clean-up effort, the province will plant more
trees, make better use of chemical fertilizers and convert to
biological pesticides.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hashimoto's Reforms Beset With Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto has found himself beset with mountainous difficulties to
push through his ambitious reform program.
</P>
<P>
Unveiled in January, the reform program covers six areas --
national bureaucracy, fiscal and economic structures, monetary,
and social welfare and educational systems.
</P>
<P>
Its full implementation, if successful, was expected to bring
about a third rejuvenation to the country following the Meiji
Restoration and its post-war reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
However, obstruction from various circles, including
Hashimoto's own ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has weighed
down every of his reform endeavor ever since.
</P>
<P>
In September, reelected as LDP president for a second two-year
term, Hashimoto reiterated his resolve for the reforms,
particularly in administrative and fiscal areas.
</P>
<P>
"Without administrative reform, I don't think we can gain the
trust of the people," the prime minister said in a major policy
speech after launching his new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The administrative reform is to establish a simple, more
efficient and transparent system for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
To meet this end, Hashimoto must perform a major operation on
the country's decades-old, over-staffed and rigid bureaucracy,
which Hashimoto said has shown "serious limitations."
</P>
<P>
But the reform drive has met fierce resistance even at the
stage of mapping out a blueprint.
</P>
<P>
In its plan, the Hashimoto cabinet proposed to privatize the
Posts and Telecommunications Ministry's postal insurance services,
while maintaining its mail services as state-run and keeping its
postal savings services as state-run for the time being, with an
eye toward eventual privatization.
</P>
<P>
Upon releasing the plan, the proposals were strongly opposed by
"zoku-giin," or special interest lawmakers from the LDP and its
two non-cabinet allies, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the
New Party Sakigake, who have great concern with the interests of
the ministry and post offices nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of wrangling to defend various conflicting special
interest groups among bureaucrats and lawmakers, Hashimoto
eventually backed off on the reform of the Posts and
Telecommunications Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He was forced to yield to calls for a commitment that the three
postal services will never be privatized, thus winning the support
of the LDP and its two non-cabinet allies.
</P>
<P>
While abandoning the initial proposal to privatize some of the
postal services, Hashimoto offered to transfer from the ministry
the mail delivery, postal savings, and postal life insurance
services simultaneously to a new public corporation.
</P>
<P>
The new public corporation, proposed by the Administrative
Reform Council, would control its own profits and use a standard
corporate accounting system. Its employees would enjoy the status
of public servants.
</P>
<P>
With numerous compromises made under the pressures, the
Administrative Reform Council, after 12 months of public hearings,
debates and political horse-trading, managed to finalize a report
on December 3, proposing to streamline the current 22 government
ministries and agencies to 13 by 2001.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, skirted round the crucial reform of the
Finance Ministry under pressure from the ruling parties.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto was squeezed between coalition partners and Finance
Ministry officials in his attempt to separate the ministry's
fiscal and financial functions.
</P>
<P>
The LDP's two allies demanded that the LDP respect an agreement
reached last year on complete separation. But Finance Ministry
officials, in a bid to maintain their traditional turfs, have
insisted on the ministry's authority over both fiscal policies and
the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who lacks a solid factional base within his own
party and has to maintain the current tripartite coalition, had no
choice but to shelve the issue.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the prime minister was also compelled to give up
his ideas of dividing the functions of the Construction Ministry
due to strong resistance from party bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said whether Hashimoto is able to actually streamline
the bureaucracy remains uncertain because the reform panel has set
no specific measures on how to slash the functions and powers of
the government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
As the Nihon Keizai Shimbun commented, the administrative
reform will not go any far but result in the "overlapping" of the
central government organizations.
</P>
<P>
Sadatoshi Ozato, head of the Management and Coordination
Agency, told a press conference soon after the release of the
government's reform plan that gaining legislative approval will
pose a crucial test for Hashimoto's administrative reform.
</P>
<P>
What he hinted was that when the bill is submitted to the next
Diet, or parliament, to be convened next January for passage, it
will meet head-on with opposition from bureaucrats and "zoku-giin."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, by and large, Hashimoto's leadership on
administrative reform toward a more slender bureaucracy for the
21st century remains at stake.
</P>
<P>
As far as the fiscal reform is concerned, Japan's House of
Councillors passed on November 28 a bill aimed at rebuilding the
debt-ridden national coffers by the early 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The law calls for the government to stop issuing
deficit-covering government bonds by fiscal 2003, so as to restore
the country's financial health.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that the aggregate amount of central and
local government deficits should be reduced to less than 3 percent
of Japan's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
To achieve these targets, the government is required to slash 7
percent of its spending in fiscal 1998 and to limit the growth of
social welfare spending to less than 300 billion yen.
</P>
<P>
Efforts in this regard also face considerable difficulties. The
sluggish Japanese economy and successive business failures in the
financial sector have given rise to strong calls for a large tax
cut and the use of public funds to help financial institutions
pull out of the bad loan mess.
</P>
<P>
All these could threaten to soon cripple the budget-cutting
package, or at least part of it. If it happens, Hashimoto's grip
on power will be further loosened.
</P>
<P>
Given the status quo, analysts said the passage of fiscal
reform bill has presented Hashimoto a ticking political time
bomb.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Commission Warns Political Parties Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Electoral Commission
today said that it would take "more serious step" to deal with
the issue of violence perpetrated by political parties during the
electioneering period.
</P>
<P>
At a daily briefing, Commission Chairman Samuel Kivuitu said
that the commission was ready to take action to "reduce the
temperatures in the political arena for the benefit of the
country."
</P>
<P>
He urged local newspapers to play their role in eliminating
violence during the election campaign through reporting
"accurately and truthfully".
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued last night, the commission warned five
main political parties in the East African country that they
risked punitive action if they did not restrain their youths from
committing acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
The political parties are the ruling Kenya African National
Union and opposition parties including the Social Democratic
Party, the Democratic Party of Kenya, the National Development
Party and Ford-Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that "the Electoral Commission is from
this week on high alert on this issue and will not hesitate to
invoke the punitive provisions of the Electoral Code of Conduct
to enforce discipline."
</P>
<P>
The commission urged political parties in the country to
"earnestly take clear and determined measures to stem violence
once and for all, including dealing publicly against any
offending youth."
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the campaign for the December 29
General Election has been mostly peaceful so far but Kenyan
police reported last week that two people had been killed, 62
injured and 50 arrested over election-related violence since
November 15.
</P>
<P>
There were also reports by local newspapers that four people
including two police officers were killed yesterday following
serious ethnic violence in Gucha District of southwest Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kivuitu singled out the violence, intimidation and harassment
which took place in Kisumu, Machakos, Kitui, Karatina, Garissa
and Kangundo in the country.
</P>
<P>
The commission chairman this week expressed concern that his
commission lacked sufficient authority to deal effectively with
violence on its own.
</P>
<P>
The most the commission can do to an offending party is
suspension, disqualification, or barring a candidate through
court order from participating in the election.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the reforms in the future should give the
Electoral Commission more powers to enforce legal provisions
governing elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Kim Dae Jung, the newly elected president of South Korea,
said he may try to arrange a summit meeting with North Korea. With
an economic crisis ravaging the south and famine threatening the
north, diplomats said the time for building trust was auspicious.
</P>
<P>
-- For more than an hour in the Oval Office, President Clinton
prodded, teased, and thoroughly charmed critics of affirmative
action, trading life stories and hypothetical examples about race
and pressing for specific proposals to help poor minorities.
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations General Assembly agreed to create a
position of Deputy Secretary General. Officials described the job
as the "finishing touch"on a new managerial system introduced by
Secretary General Kofi Annan for the upper reaches of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- South Korea's newly elected president, Kim Dae Jung, fought
a losing battle today to bolster the confidence of financial
markets, which fell sharply amid fears that he will bend to labor
unions and other domestic political pressures rather than
instituting tough economic reform measures.
</P>
<P>
-- Gueorgui Makharadze, the Georgian Embassy official who
killed a teenage girl in a spectacular drunk-driving crash in
Washington last winter, was sentenced to seven to 21 years in
prison Friday, climaxing a long-running drama in which a grieving
mother's public campaign for justice prevailed over the legal
precept of diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
-- A Silk Air Boeing 737 crashed Friday on the Indonesian
island of Sumatra, killing at least 104 people and sending U.S.
investigators scrambling to the region in search of clues that
could help solve two mystery 737 crashes in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Manila Mayor Announces for Philippine President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim
formally announced here Saturday his decision to run for President
of the Philippines in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
The mayor announced his decision less than a week after he and
former defense secretary Renato de Villa agreed to form "a third
force" against "electoral fraud and corruption in the country."
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to speculations, the formation of a third force does
not mean that I and Secretary de Villa will run as a team, " Lim
said in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
"It does not take much political sense to realize that our
joint agreement expresses our concern for the state of affairs in
our country and the wrong kind of politics that is the source of
our people's suffering. It recognizes that the two groupings share
similar objectives and invites those equally concerned to join in
the crusade," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since de Villa announced the formation of "a third force" with
the mayor on December 15, there have been reports that the two
would run as a team with de Villa perhaps as a presidential
candidate and Lim vice-presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the former defense secretary would
continue his campaign after Lim decided to run independently for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos' ruling Lakas-NUCD (national union for
Christian Democrats) has picked up Speaker Jose de Venecia as the
party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
The presidential elections are scheduled for May 11, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Fiscal Revenues Achieve 87.9 Percent of Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- With only days left to enter
into a new year, the Vietnamese government appears to still have a
long way to go to meet its annual target for fiscal revenues.
</P>
<P>
By December 15, or 16 days before the end of the fiscal year,
according a Vietnam News Agency report on Saturday, the government
plan for annual revenues was 87.9 percent accomplished.
</P>
<P>
Of those already in the state coffers, tax revenues and other
domestic sources amounted to 44,639 billion Vietnamese dong (about
3.6 billion U.S. dollars), 92.8 percent of the yearly plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 21 of the the nation's 61 provinces and cities
completed 90 percent of their plans for revenues of the year and
only three provinces reported achieving their plans.
</P>
<P>
Hanoi fulfilled 88.3 percent of its plan and Ho Chi Minh City
82.5 percent, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Maps out New Policy to Encourage Re-employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- New enterprises in Beijing
will have to give hiring priority to laid-off workers who have
received special training sponsored by the government, according
to a new regulation.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of laid-off workers must be at least 30 percent
of the new enterprises' staff, according to the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Since April, several city government departments have jointly
experimented with sponsoring special training classes for laid-off
workers to prepare them for future employment.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 30 enterprises with redundant personnel
across the city are participating in the training involving a
total of 2,000 laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also grants laid-off workers who are willing to
be self-employed with certain privileges, in a bid to help them
make a living on their own.
</P>
<P>
For those laid-off workers who are ready to set up their own
businesses, the municipal department of labor has promised to
offer them supporting funds in a lump sum according to the
standard of relief for unemployed workers.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Countries to Buy Less from Outside Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and other ASEAN
countries will reduce their purchase of goods from outside the
region to lessen the impact of the drop in the value of their
currencies, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This is not economic nationalism, but an action that we are
forced to take because we don't have adequate foreign currency,"
he told a news conference after chairing the Supreme Council
meeting of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO).
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the move was in line with the decision made
by ASEAN leaders at their informal summit meeting here recently to
step up trade among ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN countries had also agreed that trade among
themselves be increased by using their own currencies and
conducting the trade on a "contra" basis.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will also carry out a campaign to encourage Malaysians
to buy locally made goods, and such goods will be tagged "Made in
Malaysia", or "Made in ASEAN" if they are exported to other ASEAN
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would also conduct an information
campaign, through radio, television, newspapers and specific
programs, to explain to the people the implication of the
ringgit's depreciation because many people still did not
understand currency trading and the effects of a drop in the value
of the currency.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government has announced various measures to deal
with the present economic problems, including a 18 percent cut in
the government expenditures next year.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Plans to Cut Bi-communal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash is planning to cut off all contacts with the
Greek Cypriot side, Greek Cypriot English daily Cyprus Mail
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures being proposed by the Turkish Cypriots in
retaliation for the European Union's (EU) decision last week is
the breaking off of bicommunal contacts, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
These contacts cover meetings of political party leaders,
sportsmen, trade unions, businessmen, students, journalists and
social groups from the two communities.
</P>
<P>
The EU last Saturday decided to begin accession talks with
Cyprus in March 1998, and rejected Turkey as a candidate for EU
membership. This move has angered Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said last Monday that the inter-communal talks of
Cyprus are "dead," and that he will no longer discuss the subject
with the United Nations and the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said that under the measures, foreign
ambassadors accredited to Cyprus will not be able to hold
"official" talks in the Turkish-occupied north unless they
recognize the Denktash regime.
</P>
<P>
The east Mediterranean island country has been divided since
1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern
third of the island following a failed pro-Athens coup in
Nicosia. Turkish Cypriots established a breakaway republic in
northern Cyprus which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The planned measures are expected to be put into force within
the next few days, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the intention of the Turkish Cypriot side
pulling out of the inter-communal talks had already been raised in
a letter from Denktash to the U.N. special Cyprus adviser Diego
Cordovez on December 10, three days before the EU decision.
</P>
<P>
However, U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel
was quoted as saying that he was not aware of any such measures.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to his meeting Thursday with Denktash and said
the Turkish Cypriot leader has been upset over the EU decision but
mentioned nothing of cutting off bicommunal contacts.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sponsored two rounds of direct talks between the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides in July and August, but the talks
failed to achieve any progress due to the EU's planned accession
talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and the international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island as a bizonal, bicommunal
federation through peace talks, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Invests More in Fixed Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has invested a
record 360 million yuan daily on fixed assets since the beginning
of the year, 3.4 percent more than last year, according to the
city's statistics bureau.
</P>
<P>
The total investment amounted to 122.276 billion yuan during
the January-November period.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's fixed assets investment in the agricultural sector
rose 0.2 percent on a yearly basis, but such investment rose 69
percent in the manufacturing sector and 30.8 percent in the
service sector.
</P>
<P>
The Pudong New Area continues to lead Shanghai in fixed assets
investment. The zone invested 32.7 billion yuan in fixed assets
during the 11-month period, up 28.8 percent over the same period
last year. The rate is 25.4 percent higher than the city's
national average.
</P>
<P>
Experts observe that the city's gross domestic production
growth rate registered a rise of 10 percent over the growth rate
of its fixed assets investment. This shows that Shanghai's economy
has finished its period of being pulled by investment, and now has
entered a new period.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Elderly Pin Hope for Remaining Years on Family (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 94 percent of
elderly urban Chinese still pin their hopes for later years on
their families, according to the latest survey conducted in
Tianjin, the largest port city in north China.
</P>
<P>
Some 32 percent of the respondents prefer to be looked after by
their spouses in their remaining years, while 36 percent and 25
percent of them are willing to be cared for by their married sons
and daughters, and only 7 percent of them hope to be attended to
by their daughters-in-law or their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
The survey, jointly conducted by four government departments,
involved 541 respondents, each over 65 years old, from Nankai
District.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 77.3 percent of the respondents claim
that they reveal their innermost feelings to their spouses, while
74.9 percent of them say that they will pour out their worries to
their children.
</P>
<P>
Some 76 percent of the respondents say that they do not feel
lonely as their children, whether living with the elderly or not,
frequently visit or inquire after their parents through phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that, among the respondents, 43 percent of
them live with their children and share household expenses, and
7.3 percent live together but do not share expenses.
</P>
<P>
The figures are consistent with the results of a survey
conducted in Tianjin in 1984, which covered 1,000 senior citizens,
and another survey sponsored in 1993, which involved 7,000 elderly
from nine cities across the country.

<P>
Statistics show that 28 percent of the respondents hope the
neighborhood committees and residents would offer help when needed.
</P>
<P>
Jia Dezhang, deputy chairman of the the Association of Civil
Affairs in Tianjin, said that it is a Chinese tradition to respect
and support the elderly and that those who mistreat the elderly
are disgraced and condemned by society.
</P>
<P>
To ordinary Chinese citizens, family support for the elderly is
a realistic and reasonable option since China is still in the
early stages of socialism and cannot fully afford the economic
burden of homes for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Jia added that the practice of supporting the elderly by family
members is sure to continue for the foreseeable future under
stipulations in both the Constitution and the Law on Protecting
the Rights of the Elderly.

TIANJIN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Feasibility studies of a new
double-way ship lock, a key part of navigation channel expansion
on the Haihe River, won approval of experts recently.
</P>
<P>
This will be the third ship lock on the river.
</P>
<P>
Though a major water way in north China in history, navigation
on the Haihe River, which runs through the sea port city of Tianjin,
declined with the fall of the river water and the rise of
ocean-going shipping. Navigation on the river resumed in 1984, but
only ships of less than 3,000 tonnage can be accommodated.
</P>
<P>
Under a new scheme, a 39.5-kilometer water way on the lower
reaches of the river, running to a ship-lock near the sea port of
Xingang, will be expanded, which will enable the water way to
accommodate ships of 5,000 tonnage in 2000, and ships of 10,000
tonnage in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the expansion is part of the city's
strategy to shift the focus of economic development to the eastern
part of the city with a new industrial area being built at the
banks of the Haihe River. The expanded water way will help
transport materials directly to factories in the new area.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Netanyahu's West Bank Announcement Most </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat today strongly denounced Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement that the West Bank is
part of the state of Israel, describing the remark as most
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following a meeting here with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak that lasted more than one hour, Arafat
said the West Bank is part of the Palestinian lands occupied by
Israel since 1967.
</P>
<P>
"What Netanyahu said is the most dangerous event since his
meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
Thursday," Arafat said, adding that Netanyahu's announcement is a
grave violation of the signed deals and relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, serving as basis
of the peace process, and the land-for-peace principle apply to
the West Bank, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu does not want to reach a settlement based on the
land-for-peace principle, but rather seeks to apply his
peace-for-security swap," he said.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the Palestinian people are adamant on
retrieving their occupied land and they will not accept
Judaization of Jerusalem or cede an inch of the holy city.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called upon the world community to adopt a decisive and
clear stand vis-a-vis Israeli attempts to violate international
legitimacy and signed deals.
</P>
<P>
On Israeli army redeployment in the West Bank, Arafat said the
Palestinians have received nothing on this score. "There is
nothing more than Israeli press reports and remarks made by some
Israeli officials," he added.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Arafat and Mubarak today with the attendance
of top officials from both sides focused on the outcome of
Arafat's recent meetings with Albright, British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and the president of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader arrived here Friday night from
Luxembourg and left here after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Albright held separate meetings with Netanyahu in Paris and
Arafat in London this week. The Albright-Netanyahu meeting failed
to determine the time and scope of further Israeli redeployment
from the West Bank.

SHANGHAI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philips Company of
Holland expects to earn 3.5 billion U.S. dollars this year in

<HEADLINE> Indian Politician on Country's Political Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 20 (Xinhua)-- Indian former finance
minister Manmohan Singh has said that the economy of the country
would pay a heavy price if there is yet another hung Parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the first-ever television debate on the Indian economic
crisis, Mr. Manmohan Singh also attacked the country's political
system and mindset which, he said, did not recognize the need to
reform. The debate will be telecast by Star TV on Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The just dissolved 11th Lower House of Parliament was a hung
Parliament and the I.K. Gujral government which resigned late last
month was a minority government. In its 18-month rule since June
1, 1996, the 14-party United Front Government has witnessed a lot
of ups and downs, affecting the country's economic growth. Few
politicians have foreseen another hung Parliament in the country
after the mid-term elections to be held from February next year.
</P>
<P>
"International ideas of what constitutes good policies are
totally at variance with what our politicians think," Manmohan
Singh said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the country faces an economic crisis next time,
"it will not be able to muster international support."
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate might not be more than 5.5 percent
this year and the fiscal deficit would be much higher than what
was budgeted for, Dr. Singh said. Four areas of the economy needed
immediate attention, he noted, these were fiscal management,
infrastructure, human resource development and welfare.

<HEADLINE> ANC Resolves to Stick to Macro-Economic Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) today confirmed its commitment to
a controversial economic program of the government.
</P>
<P>
A carefully-worded resolution was adopted at a plenary session
of the party's 50th national conference, giving the party's final
blessing to the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR)
macro-economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
"The conference acknowledges the need for the basic objectives
of macro-economic stability and that GEAR provides a basis for
that stability," South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted
the resolution as saying.
</P>
<P>
The original wording of the resolution was slightly changed,
which proposed that the conference "endorse the objectives of
GEAR".
</P>
<P>
"Like other policies it will be reviewed, monitored and
adjusted as required by analysis through the policy processes
adopted at this conference and in the alliance summit," the final
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
GEAR highlights a competitive fast-growing economy based on
export improvement, so that sufficient jobs would be created. It
also addresses a redistribution of income and opportunity in
favor of poor by financing low-income housing, national school
feeding program and free primary health services.
</P>
<P>
GEAR, adopted last year by the ANC-led government, has been
persistently criticized by many ANC members and the party's
alliance partners, the South African Communist Party and the
Congress of South African Trade Unions, which said it is
neo-liberal and contrary to the Reconstruction and Development
Program (RDP).
</P>
<P>
The RDP had served as the post-apartheid government's
socio-economic guideline for the country's transformation into a
democratic, non-racial society with a healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
Another resolution adopted reaffirms that its macroeconomic
policies must be directed to advancing the RDP.
</P>
<P>
"The strategy for GEAR is aimed at giving effect to the RDP
through the maintenance of macro balances and elaborates a set of
mutually reinforcing policy instruments. GEAR does not seek to
displace the RDP."
</P>
<P>
The ANC's top policy-making body, the National Executive
Committee, was mandated to appoint a committee to develop a
detailed economic transformation program, which would give
priority to job creation.
</P>
<P>
The party also committed itself and its allies in a fight
against waste and corruption in the management of public
resources.

<HEADLINE> Air Macao to Buy First Airliner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Air Macao is to buy its first
jetliner next year following its unexpectedly good profit two
years after its inauguration.
</P>
<P>
The air company signed a purchase agreement on Friday to buy
an Airbus A321 at 61 million US dollars next year, the Tai Chung
Pou newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Caihua, vice-chairman of the board of directors of Air
Macao, compared the purchase of a first plane to "a tenant farmer
beginning to cultivate his own land," thus marking a new beginning
in the air company's business expansion.
</P>
<P>
The air company has gained a total net profit of 80 million
patacas (about one million US dollars) this year, which is much
better than expected, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The air company's current fleet of six Airbus series all
operate on a leased base. Its air destinations cover Beijing,
Shanghai, Wuhan, Qingdao, Xiamen, Fuzhou and Kunming in China's
inland areas, and Kaohsiung and Taipei in Taiwan, Manila and
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the air company plans to open a new air route to
Nanjing, capital of East China's Jiangsu province, on December 29.
The air route to Chongqing in Southwest China will be added next
March.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Cholera claimed at least 77
people in Uganda so far, Health Ministry has confirmed here.
</P>
<P>
Sam Okware, the Commissioner for Health Services Responsible
for the Control of Communicable Disease (CCD), revealed to The
New Vision, a newspaper published here, that the hospitals of the
country had received 782 patients by Friday including the victims
since the outbreak of the disease last week.
</P>
<P>
Scattered reports about the disease started to reach here from
early this month from the east.
</P>
<P>
The death rate has fallen from 11.4 percent in the disease
climax to 3.4 percent yesterday, Okware said. The average
discharge period in hospitals is two days, he added.
</P>
<P>
The main hit areas of the disease is Kampala and its adjacent
areas where hospitals and various health institutions treated 401
patients.
</P>
<P>
About 102 and 246 cases of the disease registered separately
in eastern district of Iganga and Bugiri, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But The Monitor, another English daily of the country, said in
its report that 50 people have died and hundreds are infected
with the disease in Sigulu islands in Bugiri District alone.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, central district of Mpigi also
registered 120 diarrhoeal cases, The New Vision said.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor said the rapidly increasing cholera cases in
recent days has forced local authorities to order an immediate
closure of all markets operating with poor hygiene conditions.
But it failed to give the exact number of the cases.
</P>
<P>
The local health officials attributed the disease due to heavy
rains for devastating drainage systems in cities that caused
contamination of water sources and poor hygiene conditions.

PARIS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The city of Duchere in Lyon was under the shock of the death
of Fabrice Fernandez, 24, who was killed the day before in a
police station. In Dammarie-les-Lys in Seine-et-Marne south of
Paris, tension was high after an adolescent of 16 years old was
killed at a police road barrier.
</P>
<P>
-- Although the photo of Kim Dae-jung was banned from the
newspapers of South Korea for three decades, some hours after his
victory in the presidential election, his face was everywhere in
the Korean media. Ten minutes after the candidate of the ruling
party admitted defeat at four o'clock Friday, the three main
television channels presented the versions of biography of the
president-elect.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The properties of the French state railway company SNCF is
the target of vandalism everyday. The train cabins are full of
signals of signs and markings, the trains are constantly attacked
with stones thrown by hooligans, and objects are frequently
deposited on the rails. Since 1992, the SNCF has kept secret the
yearly number of attacks of vandalism, but the company is
preparing in silence a program to prevent the attacks which are
mainly aimed at school children and high school students.
</P>
<P>
-- As a sign of the new times in Tehran since the coming to
power of President Mohamad Khatami, Iran made known on Friday that
it was ready to resume discussions on the death penalty, or fatwa,
against the British writer Salman Rushdie.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ready for Dialog With Kuwait: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is ready to start a
dialog with Kuwait and open all files to iron out the differences
between the two neighbors, according to Iraqi official daily
"Al-Gomhuria."
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the opening of the summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) in Kuwait today, the daily said the
first step should be to end the contradictory attitudes of the GCC
member states towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-Kuwait relations were severed after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-Kuwaiti dispute is by no means greater than the
Arab-Israeli conflict, which some GCC members seek to settle
through dialog and negotiation, the paper argued.
</P>
<P>
The paper expressed the hope that the GCC summit will adopt a
position similar to those of Russia, France and China which call
for the lifting of the U.N. embargo on Iraq imposed after the
invasion.
</P>
<P>
Such a move will be in harmony with the reconciliatory attitude
that prevails over the Arab world and Islamic countries as shown
in the Islamic summit in Tehran earlier this month, the daily
added.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's refusal of reconciliation will lead only to more
crises with more threats to all the Gulf countries, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.

<HEADLINE> American Scientists Advance Antibody Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Scientists based in La
Jolla, California, have developed a catalytic antibody potential
of commercial applications in treating cancer and genetic defects.
</P>
<P>
The research, by a group of scientists led by Richard Lerner,
president of the Scripps Research Institute, was reported in the
latest issue of the American journal Science published on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Using a novel technique known as reactive immunization, the
group forced the antibody to take on the desired characteristics
-- ability to bond carbon to carbon fast enough to be practical.
</P>
<P>
"We have duplicated the mechanism of an enzyme that is
essential for life," Lerner said.
</P>
<P>
The engineered new catalytic antibody, capable of performing
300 different bonding reactions, mimics carbon bonding techniques
the human body uses in sugar metabolism.
</P>
<P>
Drug makers might find it useful as a catalyst in making drugs,
he said, noting that as the first of the kind to enter commercial
use, the technology had been licensed to a chemical supplier.
</P>
<P>
A research veteran for a decade, Lerner is known for his work
of converting antibodies into enzymes, permitting the catalysis of
chemical reactions impossible with classical procedures.
</P>
<P>
With the ability to bind to different cells and the enzyme's
tools, catalytic antibodies might become new agents for fighting
diseases such as cancer or for repairing damaged genetic materials.
</P>
<P>
Researchers will further their work to develop catalytic
antibodies for use as medical treatments, said Lerner, who was
named the 1996 California scientist of the year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Not to Curb Imports: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday Malaysia would not curb imports as
a move to overcome its economic problems but Malaysians should be
prudent in their spending and buy more local goods.
</P>
<P>
Sacrifices by the people in respect of their spending habit
would help revive the country's economy within a short period of
time, Mahathir said at an oath-taking ceremony for officers and
staff of the Information Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that in view of the escalating prices of imported
goods, people should not only change their spending habit and buy
local goods but also be wise enough to shop at places offering
fair prices.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the prices of local goods had also
increased due to higher prices of imports, it was not a big issue.
</P>
<P>
Reminding people to be more thrifty, Mahathir said that rash
actions would not help the country overcome the economic problems
caused by the depreciation of the ringgit and the stock market
crash.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the problems faced by the country could be
overcome only through a higher degree of discipline and loyalty,
not through foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government had drawn up a plan to overcome the
economic problems in the country but it was not a policy or
legislation and the success of its implementation depended on the
cooperation of every individual in the country.

<P>
SINGAPORE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- As the search and rescue
operation continued, the rescue team found aircraft debris and
bodies on land and in the river near Palembang, Indonesia, where
the SilkAir MI185 crashed Friday afternoon, but no survivors have
been found so far, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore

<HEADLINE> Rains May Jeopardize Tanzania Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Heavy seasonal short
rains in Tanzania's main coffee growing region could jeopardize
prospects for a crop recovery in the 1998/99 season, Daily News
said today.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania Coffee Board managing director Leslie Omari said
Friday that rains blamed on the El Nino weather phenomenon are
posing a grave threat to coffee flowering.
</P>
<P>
Even in the Kilimanjaro region the rains that are falling are
unprecedented, Omari said in the northern coffee capital of
Moshi.
</P>
<P>
"If they continue, the flowers will abort and form leaves.
Above average rain is a big problem up here in the north, " he
said, adding that the next two to three weeks will be critical.
</P>
<P>
"We're carefully watching the weather pattern. It's definitely
too wet. We need a period of sunshine -- two to three weeks
beginning next month. If that period continues with heavy rains
-- we're in trouble," the paper quoted Omari as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's annual coffee production for 1997/98 season is
likely to just reach 40,000 tons of clean coffee, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to just crack it (40,000 tons). If we are under it
will be 38,000 or 39,000," he said. "Quality had been good so far."
</P>
<P>
From a production peak averaging 55,160 tons between 1981-85,
the production for 1996/97 was about 43,000 tons, worth some 95
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Coffee grown in Kilimanjaro region is a mild washed arabica
variety which sells at a premium on the global market.
</P>
<P>
A severe drought last year and early this year caused a harsh
impact on production of mild washed arabica in Kilimanjaro region
with output for 1997/98 expected at around 9,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Omar said some farmers in the north have already reported
cases of coffee berry disease (CBD) and coffee leaf rust, caused
by excessive moisture.
</P>
<P>
"We already have instances of CBD and leaf rust which is going
to mean a lot of spraying, but its too early to gauge the
extent," Omar said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains in Kilimanjaro have resulted in dilution of
fertilizers causing additional financial hardships for flowers.
</P>
<P>
He said an ongoing scheme, where farmers exchange vouchers for
inputs, which was meant to encourage greater use of fertilizers
among farmers, had been running successfully.

<HEADLINE> A Year of Progress for Chinese Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- By launching an
Olympic-oriented sports campaign, the Chinese athletes have made
steady strides in the year of 1997 which was highlighted by the
Eighth National Games.
</P>
<P>
In October's National Games, a total of 179 athletes broke 41
world records in weightlifting, shooting, swimming and athletics,
with seven world records from Olympic events.
</P>
<P>
Chinese athletes also underlined caliber in their traditional
sports of table tennis, badminton, diving and women's
weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
In April, Chinese paddlers bagged home six gold medals from the
world table tennis championships in Manchester, England, leaving
the rest of the world to vie for only the men's singles title.
</P>
<P>
One month later, China fielded a reshuffled team to the world
badminton championships in Glasgow, England, winning the most
coveted Sudirman Cup for the mixed team top honor.
</P>
<P>
Chinese gymnasts captured the men's team title in the world
gymnastics championships in September. Zhang Jinjing, winner in
the parallel bars, emerged as the backbone of the Chinese men's
squad as Olympic champion Li Xiaoshuang was struggling with
injuries.
</P>
<P>
In December, Chinese strongmen and women made further feats by
breaking world records time and again at the world weightlifting
championships in Chiang Mai, Thailand, inscribing their names in
the history book as new categories will be introduced by the world
governing body -- the International Weightlifting Federation, from
1998.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable progress was made at the Shanghai National Games
when the Chinese women swimmers bettered two world records, nine
Asian and 12 national marks. They also created the year's best
times in 10 women's events.
</P>
<P>
Big splashes were made first in the pool as Chen Yan swept four
individual gold medals and created a world record.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old clocked four minutes and 34.79 seconds in the
women's 200 meters medley, bettering the old world mark which was
set by Petra Schneider of East Germany when Chen was only one year
old.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yanyan was another phenomenon in the two-week games as she
set the world record mark of 2:09.72 in the 200-meter medley after
12 years of hard training.
</P>
<P>
As Chinese swimmers were celebrating their successes, China's
top track coach Ma Junren retained world attention by guiding a
new batch of runners to a stunning 5,000 meters show.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Bo, 20, and Dong Yanmei, 17, clocked 14:28.09 and
14:29.82 respectively for a one-two finish. Their times were
inside of the world record.
</P>
<P>
However, the existing gender disparity still puzzles the
Chinese sports as most of the men's sports were kept from making
big strides. Many male athletes were adept in home competitions
but seldom pulled off encouraging performance in the world
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men spikers eventually recaptured the Asian title
for the first time in 18 years and savored victory over Olympic
champions the Netherlands in the Continental Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men's basketball squad, Asian champion for five
straight times, had their worst moments by losing Asia's No.1 spot
to South Korea and for the first time failing to qualify for the
world championships.
</P>
<P>
As the year of 1997 saw more than 100 teams vying for the
berths in the World Cup soccer finals, China was once again kept
away from the soccer summit in France.

<HEADLINE> 100,000 More Beijing Households Use Natural Gas This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Additional 100,000 Beijing
households have had access to natural gas for cooking this year as
the Chinese capital increased its gas supply in a bid to make its
skies cleaner and brighter.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Government has so far invested more than
three billion yuan (361 million US dollars) into infrastructure
facilities to pipe the gas into the urban households' kitchens,
according to today's "Beijing Daily".
</P>
<P>
Also, it has made a joint investment of 3.9 billion yuan (470
million US dollars) with the China National Petroleum Corporation
to build a 900-km-long pipeline between the municipality and
China's largest gasfield in northwest China's Shaanxi and Gansu
provinces.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, one million Beijing households will have
resorted to the use of natural gas for cooking, while the
remainder households will also turn to liquefied natural gas or
coal gas.
</P>
<P>
Environment experts attributed the worsening air pollution in
Beijing area to the coal burning as it causes enormous discharge
of sulfur dioxide and dust fall into the air.
</P>
<P>
They estimated that the amounts of sulfur dioxide and dust
fall in the air could be reduced by 27,000 tons and 21,000 tons
annually if Beijingers stop burning coal.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the municipal government will spend less money in
transporting and treating waste residue if the amount is reduced
by 566,000 tons annually, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Regain "Granary" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Angola is launching a plan to
plant more trees and develop animal husbandry in the central part
of the country, so as to regain its "granary" there.
</P>
<P>
Dario David Catata, Deputy Agriculture Minister said in
Huambo, a city in central Angola today that the experiences of
the forestry pioneering project in Huambo and Ble provinces would
be spread nationwide after it is proved a success.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to allocate 50,000 U.S. Dollars for
grass-root farming units for the program.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the program is said by the official as to protect
the environment in the central part of the country and help speed
up the agricultural development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Catata said that the government would also start a loan
program for farmers in January next year in Huambo, Hel,
Kuanza-Sul and Benguela provinces so that farmers there could use
the money to buy tools and animals as a starter for the
government-encouraged program.
</P>
<P>
The loan would be required to return to the government in
seven years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central Angola, which has long famed as "granary" of the
country, used to yield more than enough grains for the whole
country, but the civil war, which drove many farmers away left
most of the farmland deserted in the region.

<HEADLINE> "Seamless" Transportation Proposed for U.S. Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A proposed new
transportation system friendly to business development in the
U.S. Pacific Northwest has been in the discussion.
</P>
<P>
However, as dozens of business leaders and politicians gathered
this week in Seattle, the idea of "seamless transportation system"
seems unlikely to go any further, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
From discussions at the brainstorming session, a seamless
system in the Northwest would mean creating freight-only corridors
and linking airports and cities with high-speed rail.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Northwest is a region including the states of
Washington and Oregon, and bordering British Columbia, of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The region's landscape, of mountains and waters, continues to
attract newcomers, but at the same time raises obstacles for both
urban and regional transportation systems.
</P>
<P>
Seattle, of Washington, one of the major ports in the United
States and commercial and transportation hub in the region, is "at
a crossroads," said Boeing Chairman Phil Condit.
</P>
<P>
"We can either make these decisions now... or we can stand by
and watch business go somewhere else," Condit was quoted as saying
by a report of the Seattle Times available here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
When deciding whether to move or stay, explained the official
from the Seattle-based world's largest aircraft manufacturer,
businesses weigh heavily their ability to move goods and people.
</P>
<P>
What he called for is something similar in Europe and Japan,
where integrated networks allow people and freight to move in
separate corridors, with rails separated from highways.
</P>
<P>
The local system, as proposed, would link seaports and airports
from Eugene and Portland, cities both in Oregon, to Seattle and
then further north to Vancouver, a city in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
One of its proponents, Paul Schell, who is scheduled to become
Seattle's mayor next month, argued that Seattle, Vancouver and
Portland should "compete globally and cooperate regionally."
</P>
<P>
However, bridging the landscape obstacles will be costly and
without money, as agreed by officials from Washington, Oregon and
the federal government, the idea could only be shelved.
</P>
<P>
But a banker suggested to his audience at the Seattle session
that funds from private businesses and "user fees," such as fares
and tolls, could be an alternative.

NAIROBI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- At least 2, 687 people have
been killed by the cholera epidemic across eastern Africa and the
worse is yet to come, local press quoted a U.N. World Health
Organization (WHO) report as saying today.

percent cut of the number of incoming tour groups this year.
</P>
<P>
About 74 percent of Asian and Pacific travelers bound for
Hawaii adopted group tours in 1996, a local industry group said.
</P>
<P>
The main reason behind the decline, experts say, is the fact
that, with falling financial markets in Asia and a strong dollar,
travel to the United States has been increasingly expensive.
</P>
<P>
Those who do visit Hawaii are shopping less like tourists and
more like local residents looking for bargains.
</P>
<P>
To encourage more tourists to Hawaii, Japan Air is offering
discounts of 15 percent or more on certain executive and economy
class tickets to Honolulu, state capital of Hawaii.

<HEADLINE> Meeting Between Philippine Govt and Rebels Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the
Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
postponed their meeting scheduled for Sunday and Monday to give
way to Christmas celebrations, a senior MILF official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The postponement was requested by government chief negotiator
Orlando Soriano to give time to the people behind the negotiations
to enjoy Christmas with their respective families, said Ghadzali
Jaafar, MILF vice chairman, in Cotabato city, the Southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said that another reason for the temporary suspension of the
talks is the unavailability of Juvenal Lazaga, chairperson of the
government committee on agenda-setting, as the official is
presently abroad on an important mission.
</P>
<P>
The MILF rebel leader said there is no specific date yet when
the talks would resume but "definitely it would be in January next
year."
</P>
<P>
After the signing of the ground rules for the general cessation
of hostilities in Mindanao earlier this month, government and MILF
negotiators were supposed to meet Sunday and Monday in the
Southern city of Marawi to discuss procedures for the formal peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which is fighting for an independent Muslim state in
Mindanao, became a major threat to peace in the Southern
Philippines after the government and the rebel Moro National
Liberation Front signed a peace accord in September last year.

SEOUL, December 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam is expected to announce the amnesty for jailed former
presidents Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo later today.
</P>
<P>
A political source said early today that President Kim will
announce the pardon with President-Elect Kim Dae-jung's consent,
according to the Yonhap News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The former president Chon and Roh were imprisoned on mutiny and
bribery charges and are currently serving jail terms for life and
22 years respectively.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will meet Tuesday to formally resolve the pardon of
the two presidents. Chon and Roh are to be set free on Christmas
eve, December 24, an informed source said.
</P>
<P>
However, the fines imposed on the two are not subject to
amnesty. Chon was fined 220.5 billion won (137.8 million U.S.
dollars) and Roh 262.8 billion won (164.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
When the two former presidents are pardoned, their aides, who

NEW DELHI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of Indian
Chambers of Commerce &AMP; Industry (FICCI) will soon make
presentations before leaders of three main political parties in
the country to outline an economic agenda for the next government,
FICCI sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The three parties are the United Front, Bharatiya Janata Party
and the Congress.
</P>
<P>
The federation will also interact with people who are seen as
shaping economic policy and manifesto. Others before whom the
presentations will be made include opinion makers and bureaucrats
heading government departments.
</P>
<P>
The foremost issue that FICCI will deal with is arresting the
industrial slowdown. The chamber maintains that the next
government should raise expenditure on public works, housing and
infrastructure to stimulate demand for core sector products which
will have a multiplier effect on demand and employment.
</P>
<P>
The second issue is related to financial infrastructure. FICCI
will call for stimulating the capital market, intensifying banking
reforms, creation of an enabling environment for continuation of
production methods and improving efficiency and maintaining a
stable and pragmatic exchange rate.

and responsive to the current international situation."
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro also expressed his concern at the widening gap between
rich and poor nations, which he called a "problem for all
humanity" that all world leaders should work to remedy.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro then called for severe reforms to Italy's development
aid policy, which he said was "inefficient" and in need of "a
total re-examination."
</P>
<P>
He demanded cuts in organizational spending and red tape so
that aid destined for poorer countries would reach "its legitimate
targets."

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Get 300 Million Dollar Loan From ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will soon get a 300
million U.S. dollar loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to
improve its financial markets, local press reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The loan, expected to be issued to Thailand next Tuesday, is
aimed at helping improve the financial markets' regulatory and
supervisory mechanisms, and ensure the independence and autonomy
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the
Stock Exchange of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The loan is part of a 17.2 billion dollar economic assistance
package arranged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in
August.
</P>
<P>
The loan will support a comprehensive set of policy reforms in
the domestic markets that will lay foundations for future economic
growth within a sound and resilient financial system, Deputy
Finance Minister Pisit Leeahtam said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 300 million dollars, once received by the Finance Ministry,
will be sent to the Bank of Thailand for exchange into an
equivalent amount in baht, thus also supplementing the central
bank's foreign reserve position, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Govt Plans to Set Up Tourism Development Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 20 (Xinhua)-- The Indian government plans
to set up a tourism development fund to bridge critical
infrastructural gaps to facilitate greater flow of funds for
tourism infrastructure, a government official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Aware of the need for greater involvement of the private sector
in the development of the tourism industry in the country, the
government has identified certain areas like accommodation and
restaurants in tourist places where the private sector's help
would be sought.
</P>
<P>
The government has also drawn up a blueprint whereby
non-government organizations and local bodies would be involved to
create public awareness and ensure a wider spread of tourist
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The tourism development fund has been proposed in view of the
draft national tourism policy which is pending cabinet approval,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Since tourism has emerged as the largest export industry
globally, the private sector has to consider investment in tourism
from a long-term perspective and create facilities, shopping
complexes, restaurants and also entertainment facilities in
identified areas, the draft policy said.
</P>
<P>
Though India has achieved substantial growth in international
tourist arrivals since 1951, the country's share of world tourist
traffic still remains at less than 0.4 percent, the official
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- More Thai people have turned
to using pawnshops this year at a time of economic slump.
</P>
<P>
Electric home appliances, gold bracelets and necklaces, and
expensive wristwatches are the most popular items sent to
pawnshops for cash, in particular when schools are about to open,
when parents have to pay for their children's tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
About half of pawnshop operators said that most of their
customers have failed to come back for their valuables, forcing
them to sell off the items, a Suan Dusit poll, available Saturday,
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, visiting newly-opened "the former rich's weekend
flea markets" has become a popular pastime for middle-class
Bangkok residents.
</P>
<P>
At the flea markets, on sale are not only expensive second-hand
diamond rings and wristwatches, but also Mercedes-Bens of the
latest models, and even a six-sitter aircraft. At one place a
gold-wire dress is for auction, with a base price of one million
baht (22,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, there are more window-shoppers than buyers.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Says Government Aiming At National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The government's aim is to create
a truly unified country, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said
Friday during his year-end conference.
</P>
<P>
As for the architects of unification, the cabinet, Prodi said
he was satisfied with the work of his ministers and saw no need
for any reshuffling.
</P>
<P>
He said "the government is marching ahead as a team and I
intend to see that its unity becomes even more apparent."
</P>
<P>
He also outlined the ways in which this unification could be
achieved. He stressed the importance of qualifying for the
European Economic and Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
He said "according to market opinion, we're in Europe,"
adding that "we are falling in line with European rates, with
inflation below 2 percent and the deficit-to-GDP ratio at 3
percent."
</P>
<P>
The premier also defended the government's pension reform plans
which are a vital part of the 1998 budget and seen as crucial if
the country is to qualify for euro membership.
</P>
<P>
He referred to a planned introduction of a 35-hour work week,
saying it means "a reduced working week in the year 2001, taking
into account regional differences and negotiations with social
partners."
</P>
<P>
To round off economic issues, the premier predicted that the
economy would grow by more than 2 percent in 1998, and could have
reached 3 percent if not for the negative impact of the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that unemployment and education were at the top of the
agenda, and law and order was another prime concern, especially in
the south.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that having done so much for Italy's economic woes,
"phase two" of the government's plan to truly unify Italy could be
tackling the country's social ills.

<HEADLINE> Nike Stock Drops on Asian Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Nike Inc. said Friday that
it became the latest American company to feel the effects of the
Asian crisis when the price of its stock fell on the New York
Stock Exchange Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Nike stock, which peaked at about 76 U.S. dollars a share early
this year, tumbled to between 35-40 dollars a share after the
company reported a 20 percent drop in profits Thursday, due to
"economic weakness in Asia."
</P>
<P>
The Oregon-based sports marketing giant said it earned 141
million dollars, or 48 cents a share, in its fiscal second
quarter, which ended November 30, down from 176.9 million dollars,
or 60 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The earnings were well below the Wall Street consensus estimate
of 55 cents a share. Nike forecast earnings of two to 2.5 dollars
a share for the fiscal year ending May 31.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, American companies were reporting that the
"financial problems in Asia" are affecting their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Among those alleged to be hurting from Asia's problems were
Coca-Cola, Boeing, J.P. Morgan as well as software maker Oracle,
most of which are based in the West.

<HEADLINE> More Steps Proposed to Cut Thailand's Public Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan is considering to downsize Thai missions abroad and bring
all Thai official representative offices in one foreign capital
under one roof so as to save lodging and operational costs.
</P>
<P>
He cited the overseas missions of the Police Department, Board
of Investment, the military and various ministries, which are
located at different places in one foreign capital and are
independent of the supervision of the embassies, the Bangkok Post
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also stressed Friday that embassy staff
would have to adjust to new roles and work as salesmen to look for
new markets for Thai products and foreign investments for
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Army Commander-in-Chief Chettha Thanajaro also said
that the armed forces will reduce the number of overseas
representatives to one in each of the 17 foreign capitals.
</P>
<P>
He said all unnecessary personnel, such as deputies, staff
members and drivers, could be recalled immediately.
</P>
<P>
The government has been paying between 20 and 35 million baht
(445,000-778,000 U.S. dollars) a year to maintain these military
attaches overseas, according to Chettha.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai Friday admitted that revenue
collection would fall short of the target for this fiscal year
(from October 1997 to September 1998).
</P>
<P>
More steps, including cancellation of meeting allowances and
introduction of inheritance tax, will be considered, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Bank Grants More Loans in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The State Mortgage and
Investment Bank granted 8,184 loans in the past 11 months, 20
percent more than in the same period of last year, a bank official
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
G.M. Iddagoda, the bank's general manager, said a total of 1.27
billion rupees (21.2 million U.S. dollars) were borrowed by
customers of different income levels.
</P>
<P>
He said there has been an appreciable increase in borrowings
from both the middle income and higher income level customers.
Loans to those groups vary from 21,000 rupees (350 dollars) to 5
million rupees (83,330 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The manager attributed the increase to the lowering of loan
interest rate from 21 percent last year to 17 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the bank does not charge business turnover tax or
defense levy on their customers, making borrowing more attractive
to those who need loans to improve their financial situation.
</P>
<P>
Iddagoda said 60 percent of the loan applicants were from the
capital city of Colombo and two major cities of Western province,
Gampaha and Kalutara.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Increases in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade at
current prices grew by 10.4 percent in November on a three-month
moving average basis, with exports and imports increasing by 10.5
percent and 10.3 percent respectively, the Singapore Trade
Development Board (TDB) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It said that non-oil domestic exports expanded by 11.9 percent
while re-exports registered a growth of 13.2 percent. Oil domestic
exports growth declined by 10 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, it said, non-oil domestic exports grew by
10.7 percent. The high growth was partly statistical, because the
corresponding level of non-oil domestic exports a year ago was
below trend levels, the TDB explained.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of integrated circuits and printed circuit
boards assembled continued to expand strongly, it said, adding
that the increase in domestic exports of disk drives was more
moderate, at 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports grew by 11.8 percent on a monthly basis, due mainly
to higher shipments of electronics products to the European Union,
Hong Kong and the United States. In addition, non-oil imports
recorded a moderate increase of 5.9 percent in November, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the TDB statistics, non-oil domestic exports
reached 8.1 billion Singapore dollars (about 5.1 billion U.S.
dollars) in November, as non-oil domestic exports to the United
States, the European Union, and Hong Kong recorded double-digit
growth of 12.8 percent, 17.4 percent and 25 percent respectively.
Domestic exports to Malaysia increased by 5 percent, while those
to Japan declined by 5.9 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
Oil domestic exports declined by 10 percent due mainly to
slower shipments of oil to Hong Kong and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports recorded an increase of 13.2 percent to reach 6.8
billion Singapore dollars (about 4.3 billion U.S. dollars) in
November. The increase was due mainly to re-exports of integrated
circuits, computer parts and peripherals, disk drives, printers,
and other products.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Have Bright Future, Says Businessman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Macao will sparkle with a
brighter economy after 1999, said Ng Lap Seng, chairman and
president of Macao-based Sun Kian Ip Group.
</P>
<P>
According to "China Daily", Ng, a property giant in Macao,
based his confidence on Macao's economic and geographic position
as well as the Macao Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Ng said that after it returns to China, Macao is expected to
draw more investors, for it has an international free harbor
enjoying low taxes with relatively cheap labor and land prices.
</P>
<P>
He said that the transfer of the global economic center towards
East Asia and Macao's role as a bridge between the Chinese
mainland and the outside world can fuel its economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Basic Law guarantee Macao's entertainment
industry will not change after 1999 and thus tourism with gambling
at the core still has huge room for development.
</P>
<P>
The long-term prospect of Macao's property market is rosy
despite its current sluggishness, he said, adding that he plans to
transfer part of his investment in the Chinese mainland into Macao.
</P>
<P>
Sun Kian Ip Group is now engaged in the Rose Garden project,
Macao's biggest project involving an estimated investment of 2
billion U.S. dollars.

The project will be completed early next century and it will
create 45 hectares of land by filling earth into the sea.
</P>
<P>
The project is to accommodate houses, hotels, office buildings,
shopping centers, government branches, and man-made lakes and
highways.

<HEADLINE> China's Pharmaceutical Industry Welcomes Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- China will further open its
pharmaceutical sector for overseas investment and co-operation in
the coming years, according to a spokesman with the State
Pharmaceutical Administration (SPA).
</P>
<P>
Apart from setting up joint ventures, China will also welcome
foreign pharmaceutical enterprises and research institutes to
carry out processing, technical transfer and joint research and
new product development, said Bai Huiliang, director of the SPA
General Office.
</P>
<P>
"New medicines, such as compound antibiotics and those
effective on illnesses that are particularly dangerous for
children and elderly people, are specially welcome," Bai was
quoted by today's "China Daily" report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,500 pharmaceutical industry enterprises currently
operate in the country, producing 350,000 tons of chemical
materials in 1,400 varieties, as well as 3,500 specifications of
end products. However, they cannot meet the huge domestic health
and medical demand, Bai said.
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical industry is one of the first areas in China to
introduce overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
By last year, foreign invested enterprises in this field
reached more than 1,500, and the funds involved topped 1.5 billion
US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Samper to Leave Colombia for Medical Checkup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper will travel to Canada for a medical checkup on
January 14, said a presidential spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The "Espectador" newspaper Friday quoted the spokesman as
saying that Samper's request on December 9 to travel abroad for a
medical checkup from January 14 to 24 was approved immediately by
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Samper was wounded in the abdomen during an assassination
attempt in 1989. The surgeons, fearing it surgically impractical
and life threatening to remove all the bullets, left some in his
body, which have resulted in other health problems. Since the
incident, Samper has been operated on many times.
</P>
<P>
During his absence, Vice-President Carlos Lemos will serve in
his place. Lemos, who also serves as Colombian ambassador to the
United Kingdom, will return on January 10.

MOSCOW, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian police early today shot
dead an armed man who had kidnaped a Swedish trade representative
outside his embassy here on Friday night, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Security officials confirmed that the hostage-taker died in a
volley of gunfire when agents rushed to the Volvo car where the
kidnaper was sitting shortly after 1:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Swedish officials reported from Stockholm that the hostage,
Jan-Olof Nystrom, was rescued without injuries.
</P>
<P>
The kidnaper, armed with a grenade and a handgun, seized
Nystrom while he was driving a car into the embassy compound on
Mosfilmovskaya Street.
</P>
<P>
The kidnaper demanded three million U.S. dollars in ransom and
safe conduct out of the country. The Itar-Tass news agency quoted
police sources as saying the kidnaper appeared to be mentally
unbalanced.
</P>
<P>
A Federal Security Service (FSB) agent was also wounded in the
police operation.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said the shooting occurred after the swapping of the
Swede for a Russian security agent and that the kidnaper was shot
dead inside the car by snipers.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Progresses in Controlling Iodine Deficiency Disorders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Government of the Tibet
Autonomous Region has achieved remarkable progress in controlling
Iodine deficiency diseases over recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest survey conducted among the children aged
eight to 10 in the region, the proportion of thyroid enlargements
sufferers dropped from 50 percent in previous years to 24.2
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is one of the four major iodine-deficient areas in the
world. In Tibet 1.8 million residents, or some three quarters of
its population, are living in the areas with a serious iodine
shortage.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Tibet Autonomous Regional Government committed
itself to a program for eliminating Iodine Deficiency Disorders
(IDD) by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government has since set up special institutions and
trained professionals to control and treat IDD and other endemic
diseases and worked hard to enforce some regulations on the
management of iodized-salt industry and on the supervision over
marketing of salt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it adopted measures to popularize iodized salt and
offer iodized oil pills.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 15 percent of edible salt sold in Tibet
has been added with iodine. Over 60 percent of the local residents
in the region have taken in iodized oil pills, which resulted in a
drastic drop of IDD cases and a control of endemic cretinism.

LIMA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen people have died in a
downpour of rain reportedly caused by the El Nino phenomenon in
central and northern Peru in the past two days, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rain storms that continue to lash the central zone of
the country have destroyed more than 1,000 houses, 100,000
hectares of cultivated land, and almost all the roads.
</P>
<P>
About 35,000 residents in the Ancash area have lost contact and
communication with the outside world since the roads were damaged
and closed, and electric power and telephone lines were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Eight hundred head of cattle were also reportedly lost in the
central zone.
</P>
<P>
Nine people from two families were found dead among mud and
rocks in Perene in the Junin area.
</P>
<P>
The situation for the people in those areas is worsening
because efforts to provide relief is extremely difficult due to
the bad weather and the condition of the roads.
</P>
<P>
About 3.5 tons of food, clothing and medicines were sent to
Exapampa in the Pasco area, but the shipment bogged down in
Mazamari.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 19 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana and Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic met in Banja
Luka today to discuss the political situation in Bosnia and other
issues, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Plavsic told Solana that the newly-elected
parliament will have their first meeting next Saturday (December
27), and that the prime minister-designate will hand over a
cabinet list by January 20.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic also hoped the NATO-led Multinational Stabilization
Force (SFOR) would stay in Bosnia after next June, the SFOR's
deadline in the area, in order to maintain Bosnian peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Solana said that NATO supports
the Bosnian Serb Republic decision to hold the first parliamentary
meeting as scheduled. It is imperative for the Bosnian Serb
Republic to establish a new government as soon as possible to the
benefit of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The continued stay of SFOR in Bosnia will be a guarantee for
the future prosperity and development of all ethnic groups in
Bosnia, Solana said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of war crimes, Solana said that all those charged with
war crimes in Bosnia will have to be captured by SFOR if they did
not go to the Hague Court on their own initiative.
</P>
<P>
Solana came to Banja Luka, the largest town held by Serbs in
northern Bosnia on Friday, the day after Dutch commandos with SFOR
nabbed two Croat war crimes suspects.

SINGAPORE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- As search and rescue efforts
continue following the crash of SilkAir flight MI185 Friday
afternoon, SilkAir arranged two charter flights Saturday morning
to ferry relatives of some of the passengers and crew to
Palembang, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
SilkAir said that the two Boeing 737-300s carried a total of
232 passengers, including SilkAir staff who are accompanying the
relatives to offer comfort and support.
</P>
<P>
The first charter flight departed at 10:00 a.m. while the
second flight took off shortly after, SilkAir said, adding that
relatives of passengers from other countries will be arriving in
Singapore Saturday and will be transported directly to Palembang.
</P>
<P>
On arrival in Palembang, relatives will be transferred to
hotels where they will be kept informed of progress in the search
and rescue operations. But because the accident occurred in a
remote location, they will not be able to travel to the crash
site, SilkAir said.
</P>
<P>
All 104 people on board flight MI185, a ten-month-old Boeing
737-300 heading from Jakarta to Singapore Friday afternoon, were
feared dead after the aircraft crashed about 56 kilometers to the
northeast of Palembang in the southern part of Sumatra, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Of the 104 people on board, 97 were passengers including seven
children, and the other seven were crew members.
</P>
<P>
SilkAir is the regional wing of the Singapore Airlines and this
was the first mishap in the history of the Singapore Airlines and
SilkAir.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Communications Mah Bow Tan said at a
Changi Airport press conference early Saturday morning that it was
"very puzzling" that the crash took place.
</P>
<P>
"There were no distress signals. There were no adverse weather
conditions. There was no mountainous terrain. It's very puzzling,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. to Further Scientific Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States
are expected to join hands to meet global challenges in economic
and technological development in the next century, said an
official of the State Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
Hui Yongzheng, vice-minister of the commission, was quoted
by "China Daily" here today as saying that the scientific and
technological cooperation between the two sides has become an
important part of the bilateral friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
According to Hui, since 1979 the two countries have reached 32
agreements or memorandums of understanding in agriculture, energy,
environmental protection, and air, ocean and basic sciences,
conducting thousands of cooperative programs and exchanging more
than 10,000 researchers.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental cooperation between the two countries has also
progressed over the last 18 years, including technological
exchanges between cities, universities, research institutes,
laboratories and enterprises, Hui said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that scientific circles in China are actively
cooperating with their counterparts around the world, adding that
China has set forth strategies of sustainable development and
opted for rejuvenating the country through science and education
in its long-term plans.
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts from China and the US agreed on enhancing
scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries
at the Eighth China-U.S. Joint Commission Meeting on Science and
Technology Cooperation held in Beijing last month.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the words from John Gibbons, science adviser to
U.S. President Bill Clinton, that there should be broader
cooperation between China and the US based on global sustainable
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Other officials from the U.S. departments of agriculture,
energy and commerce have all expressed cooperative interests with
China in future.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have more potential cooperative fields, such
as mitigating natural disasters, water resources utilization and
research on the earth through using outer space, Hui said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there are some problems with bilateral
cooperation. Environmental technology cooperation was very
successful in the 1980s, but the cooperation has slowed down in
the 1990s, said Wang Yuqing, deputy director of the National
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
China has signed agreements and memorandums of understanding
for environmental technology cooperation with 20 countries and
regions, which has provided opportunities as well as challenges
fro China-US cooperation, Wang added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Stock Exchange to Contribute to State Firm Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Stock Exchange will
play a positive role in supporting restructuring of State-owned
enterprises, Tu Guangshao, president of the Shanghai Stock
Exchange, said Friday at a ceremony marking the exchange's
relocation and its seventh anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Established in late 1990, the Shanghai Stock Exchange moved to
the Pudong New Area of Shanghai earlier this month from the old
city center across the Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
China Daily reported today that the Shanghai Stock Exchange
has embraced most of the big State firms recently listed in
China's stock market since 1996.
</P>
<P>
China has decided to encourage its large and medium State-owned
enterprises to be listed on stock market.
</P>
<P>
About 400 companies have been listed on the Shanghai Stock
Exchange with market capitalization of the securities totaled 870
billion yuan (105 billion US dollars), which is equal to 13
percent of China's gross domestic product in 1996, said Gong
Haocheng, executive director of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
The exchange this year welcomed listed subsidiaries of some
heavyweight State firms as Chia Eastern Airlines, with 270 million
public shares, and Shanghai Automotive Co., also 270 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it is natural that these firms choose the
Shanghai exchange to choose the Shanghai exchange to list their
stocks considering the city's status as the biggest industrial hub
for China.
</P>
<P>
The development of the Shanghai Stock Exchange will also help
enhance Shanghai's role as an emerging international financial
center, officials of the exchange said.
</P>
<P>
The exchange is among the 10 specialized markets n Shanghai
which have or will be moved to Pudong in a bid to build a complete
market service system in the area. The others include exchanges
for futures, foreign exchange and real estate.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-Funded Firm Settles in China's Poorest Area  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The first foreign-funded
industrial firm in Xihaigu Prefecture, one of the poorest areas in
China, has begun operations.
</P>
<P>
The firm, with an annual processing capacity of 15,000 tons of
refined starch, was built by Kwok Man Yu, chairman of the
Sino-Singapore (Group) PIE Ltd., at a cost of 300 million yuan (36
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is located in the southern part of northwest China's Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region, where potatoes were sown on 54,000 hectares
of land with a combined annual output of 500 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The plant hired 200 workers from the township. Each earns a
monthly income of 400-to-800 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"My company spends 5 million U.S. dollars on importing 6,000
tons of starch from all parts of the world each year. The abundant
natural resources and cheap labor have drawn me here," Kwok said.
</P>
<P>
"I found that the investment environment in Ningxia was not as
backward as I expected," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Baoji-Zhongwei Railway and the Lianyungang-Lanzhou Railway
cross in the prefecture. All villages have access to the regional
highway network. A medium-size airport opened to traffic this year.
</P>
<P>
"I will set up a starch research institute and five companies
in Xihaigu and turn it into the largest starch production base in
Asia by," Kwok said.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of this century, the center is expected to process
400 million kg of potatoes and turn out 100 million kg of starch
in 600 varieties, yielding an estimated annual output value of 500
million yuan," he added.
</P>
<P>
Investors from other countries follow suit. The Samsung Group
in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and Richi Petroleum Corp. of Canada
will cooperate with the Ningxia Petroleum Corp. to pump out oil in
southern Ningxia. The project will cost an investment of 800
million yuan (96.4 million US dollars). So far, the prospecting
has been completed and large-scale extraction will begin in March
of 1998.

<P>
Xihaigu Prefecture occupies 30,456 square kilometers in the
southern part of Ningxia, which receives 200 millimeters of rain a
year, but evaporation runs to 300 mm. Moreover, the area suffers
from soil erosion, hail, frost, flood and windstorms.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 648,000 residents, or 38 percent of the region's
total population, live below the poverty line of 500 yuan annually
per person.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Central Government has adopted a series of
preferential policies to speed up development in the central and
western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the state will allocate 600-800
billion yuan (72 billion-96 billion US dollars) to build 200 key
projects in west China between 1995 and 2000, accounting for 43
percent of the country's total infrastructure projects in the
period. Nearly 60 percent of the projects will be built with funds
from abroad.
</P>
<P>
The total of foreign funds used in China dropped by 49 percent
in the first half of this year compared with last year's same
period. However, the amount of foreign investment flowing into
central China increased by 2.1 percent and the amount to west
China rose by 1.6 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia received 100 million U.S. dollars in direct foreign
investment so far this year, 3.5 times last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment has boosted economic development in this
barren, mountainous area. The per-capita net income of Xiji County
increased by 300 yuan this year, said Yu Jinxiao, a prefecture
official.
</P>
<P>
A total of 290,000 people in Xihaigu Prefecture cast the yoke
of poverty this year. Another 200,000 people who still live below
the poverty line will have their living standard improved by the
year 2000, Yu said.

years ago.

WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Jurors in the second
Oklahoma City bombing trial in Denver, Colorado, ended a fourth
day of deliberations without a verdict today.
</P>
<P>
The panel in the trial of Terry Nichols has so far deliberated
25 hours, surpassing the 23 hours it took for a jury to convict
Timothy McVeigh of identical murder and conspiracy charges,
according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
McVeigh was sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
Nichols, 42, could be sentenced to death if convicted in the
April 19, 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building
that killed 168 people, the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S.
soil.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Nichols and McVeigh acquired ingredients and
built the ammonium nitrate and fuel oil bomb, which McVeigh then
delivered to Oklahoma City while Nichols stayed at home with his
family in Herington, Kansas. Defense attorneys have denied
Nichols' involvement.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has congratulated South Korea's President-elect Kim Dae-jung for
his election victory, the White House said today.
</P>
<P>
"The president called President-elect Kim Dae-jung last night
and extended his personal congratulations on behalf of the
American people," White House spokesman Mike McCurry told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
And President Clinton "pledged to continue the very close
strategic partnership" between the United States and South Korea,
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the United States took note of Kim Dae-jung's
public endorsement of the IMF package as a way to salvage the
financial crisis in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"The president-elect... had made it clear that he will fully
implement the IMF package, which was welcome news to the United
States," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said the United States
"certainly congratulates Mr Kim Dae-jung on his victory" because he
is a supporter of strong relations between the United States and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly look forward to working with him in the future,
and we expect to have an excellent, productive working
relationship with him," he told reporters at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Foley said the United States has "no anxiety" about Kim
Dae-jung's statements that he is more interested in a direct
dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
than in four-party peace talks on the Korean Peninsula, which
involve the DPRK, South Korea, the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of his long-standing call for dialogue between the
North and South (Koreas) and the development of relations between
the two countries, we support that, and we think that it can only
help to reinforce prospects for success within the four-party
talks forum," he said.

reform measure of the high-level management of the UN Secretariat,
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin Huasun
said here today.

<HEADLINE> Cloned Lambs With Human Genes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- British scientists who
cloned Dolly announced here today that they have for the first
time in the world created two lambs with human genes.
</P>
<P>
Writing on Science published today, they said the two new
sheep, named Polly and Molly, were cloned from single cells taken
from sheep fetuses, rather than from an adult sheep cell as Dolly
was. With human genes, Polly and Molly could produce medicine in
their milk. The medicine is a blood-clotting protein called Factor
IX, which can be life-saving for hemophiliacs.
</P>
<P>
"Our major objective was getting a new method of adding or
taking away genes in animals," said Alan Colman from the Roslin
Research Institute of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The British scientists said Molly and Polly were produced with
the same technique as Dolly was, called nucleus transfer. In this
technique, scientists remove the nucleus from an egg and replace
it with the nucleus from another cell. The egg is then placed into
the uterus of a surrogate mother that gives birth to an offspring
that has only the genes of the original cell.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Retail Sales Up in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in Canada went up
0.3 percent to 19.8 billion dollars (13.8 billion US dollars) in
October, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
October was the fourth consecutive monthly increase in retail
sales, after a 0.5 percent increase in September.
</P>
<P>
Strong motor vehicle sales, which were up 1.9 percent, were
the driving force behind the October retail rise, the statistics
agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, general merchandise sales were up by 1.2
percent, and clothing store sales up by 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
But in food, drug and furniture stores, sales were down,
ranging from 0.6 percent to 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Canada's retail sales began to see strong gains in the last
quarter of 1996. For the first 10 months of this year, sales were
up 7.6 percent higher than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The strong gains at the end of last year occurred in an
environment of declining interest rates, and purchases were
concentrated in motor vehicle and furniture retailers.
</P>
<P>
Since the spring of this year, sales took off in department
stores and other durable goods stores.
</P>
<P>
Yet, other specialized stores have been slower in sharing the
increase in consumer spending, the agency noted.

<HEADLINE> Georgian Diplomat Gets 7 to 21 Years in Fatal Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Georgia's former diplomat
Gueorgui Makharadze was sentenced here today to seven to 21 years
in prison for killing a teen-ager last January in a car crash.
</P>
<P>
Washington D.C. Superior Court Judge Harold Cushenberrry said
Makharadze, 36, showed "outrageous disregard for the safety" of
others and was "criminally reckless" by drinking and speeding the
night of the five-car crash.
</P>
<P>
Makharadze could have drawn a sentence of up to 70 years after
pleading guilty in October to one count of involuntary
manslaughter and four courts of aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
U.S. prosecutors asked for up to 30 years in prison while
defense lawyers sought a lesser term of just a few years in jail.
</P>
<P>
In February, under the pressure from the U.S. administration,
the Georgian government decided to strip Makharadze of his
diplomatic immunity
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Makharadze had an alcohol level in his blood
almost twice the legal limit on January 3 when the car accident
occurred.

<HEADLINE> Commission to Study US Appeals Court System Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Members were appointed
today to a commission that will study changing the federal
appellate courts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist of the Supreme Court named
the five-member commission, established by Congress to study the
structure and alignment of the appellate court system,
particularly the sprawling 9th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
The country is divided into 12 geographic judicial circuits,
with the 9th Circuit being by far the largest -- encompassing nine
Western states and two U.S. territories.
</P>
<P>
The circuit involves 50 million people in Alaska, Arizona,
California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington,
Guam and Northern Marianna Islands.
</P>
<P>
For decades Congress has been considering splitting the 9th
Circuit, and the Senate this year voted to do just that. But the
House of Repreentatives voted only to appoint a commission to
determine whether such a split is really a good idea.
</P>
<P>
The commission is required to report its findings to President
Bill Clinton and Congress within 12 months.

UNITED NATIONS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council
decided today to set up a support group of civilian police
monitors in Croatia to succeed the United Nations Transitional
Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium
(UNTAES), which will end its mandate on January 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution, the Security Council said the support group,
which begins to operate on January 16, 1998, will be composed of
180 civilian police monitors and its mandate will be no more than
nine months.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reaffirmed its commitment to the
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
Republic of Croatia and emphasized that the territories of the
region are an integral part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The council reiterated the continuing obligation of the
government of the Republic of Croatia, under the Basic Agreement,
to respect the highest standards of human rights and fundamental
freedoms and to promote an atmosphere of confidence among local
residents regardless of ethnic origin, as well as its continuing
obligations under international conventions and other agreements
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council underlined that it is the government of
the Republic of Croatia and the Croatian police and judicial
authorities who bear full responsibility for the security and
safeguarding of the civil rights of all residents of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The council called on the government of the Republic of Croatia
to implement fully and promptly its obligations and commitments,
including those reached with the UNTAES.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Press Tours of Iraq's Palaces "Hypocrisy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Friday
called Iraq's arrangement of reporters' tour of its presidential
sites "rank hypocrisy" and said the door to unilateral military
action is left open if U.N. weapons inspectors are still barred
from entering those areas for monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on Friday took reporters and Western television crews to
some of the presidential sites in a bid to prove groundless U.N.
chief weapons inspector Richard Butler's suspicions that these
places hide weapons of mass destructions.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. State Department James Foley said that "it's a
demonstration of rank hypocrisy on Iraq's part."
</P>
<P>
"What's clear is that Iraq does not want UNSCOM (the U.N.
Special Commission) to go to those sites to do its work," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson said on
Friday that the United States will leave door open to unilateral
military action after exhaustion of diplomatic efforts to persuade
Iraq to open all its "off-limits" sites to U.N. weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"We're being wise. We're being steady. Our policy has worked:
diplomacy, negotiation first. And we haven't ruled out military
action. That's our policy ... We're going to continue that,"
Richardson said on the NBC "Today" program.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said if the inspectors were in fact denied entry to
what Iraq calls the "presidential sites", "I think that's going to
reach a very sensitive point." But he did not make clear precisely
what he meant by a very sensitive point.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said on the ABC
"Good Morning America" program that his inspectors could not do
their jobs unless given full access to those places which the
Iraqis claim are off-limits.
</P>
<P>
Butler presented a report on Thursday to the Security Council,
saying weapons inspectors were still barred from entering those
presidential sites and they were "frustrated."
</P>
<P>
Richardson said Iraq had "backed off" in the last standoff with
the United Nations, which began on Oct. 29 when Iraq ordered
expulsion of Americans from U.N. inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
He said the first step to force Iraq to abide by the U.N.
resolutions "has to be the United Nations Security Council making
it unmistakably clear that we demand full, unrestricted access to
all sites."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that with a strong Security Council statement, a
unified allied response by the 15 members of the Security
Council ... will go a long way, if that doesn't work then the
military option, as the President (Bill) Clinton has said, is
out there," he said.

WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Georgia's former diplomat

in prison for killing a teen-ager last January in a car crash.

Washington D.C. Superior Court Judge Harold Cushenberrry said
Makharadze, 36, showed "outrageous disregard for the safety" of
others and was "criminally reckless" by drinking and speeding
the night of the five-car crash.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, State Department spokesman
James Foley said that the trial is "fair." "The sentence seemed to
us to have been also a fair one that reflected the nature of the
crime involved."
</P>
<P>
"It was clearly a serious sentence that he received, and we
believe that justice has been done," Foley added.
</P>
<P>
The judge took into consideration the fact that the Georgian
government had voluntarily determined to waive the diplomatic
immunity, which is a very unusual circumstance, according to
Foley.
</P>
<P>
Makharadze could have drawn a sentence of up to 70 years after
pleading guilty in October to one count of involuntary
manslaughter and four courts of aggravated assault.
</P>

immunity.
</P>
<P>
When announcing the sentence, the judge praised the decision of
the Georgian government, saying it is "courageous."
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Makharadze had an alcohol level in his blood
almost twice the legal limit on January 3 when the car accident
occurred. He drove at a speed of 85 mph where the speed limit is
only 25 mph.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Discuss Race Relations with Conservatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Jack Kemp, former
Republican candidate for vice president, decided not to attend a
White House meeting on race Friday with President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Kemp made the decision because the meeting is not being held
openly where "the American people can watch it and judge," said
spokesman Christian Pinkston.
</P>
<P>
Pinkston said, "He wants to continue his involvement in this
issue, but he wants to have it in an open forum with all the
parties who are affected present."
</P>
<P>
Kemp notified the White House that he could not attend, but
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said despite Kemp's absence,
the president would get a representative sample of conservative
views on race.
</P>
<P>
By reaching out to conservatives for advice on his racial
dialogue, McCurry said Clinton hopes to address the semantics
problem that he says is at the crux of the furor over affirmative
action -- a formal effort to provide increased employment and
education opportunities for women and ethnic minorities to redress
past discrimination.
</P>
<P>
"The president believes that affirmative action, properly used
under circumstances allowed by law, is an effective remedy for
discrimination and injustice," McCurry said. "Some of the
participants in the conversation do not believe that. The
president wants to understand what common ground there is between
them."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Clinton said distinction should be made
between the terms "affirmative action" and "racial preferences"
and said the country should not focus on such labels.
</P>
<P>
Clinton held that foes of affirmative action foment opposition
by implying that affirmative action programs are racial
preferences designed to benefit people because of their race, not
their qualifications.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average plunged almost 270 points this morning but recouped about
two-thirds of its losses in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Dow fell below 7,600 at one point in a morning selling
spree that followed a 5 percent drop in Japan's main stock market
index.
</P>
<P>
It lost 90.21, or 1.2 percent, at 7,756.29 in one of the
busiest days ever on the New York Stock Exchange, where the volume
was set at 782.03 million shares as against 614.91 million in the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered losers by a 2-to-1 margin
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three of the 30 Dow industrial stocks were down.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 8.52 to 946.78, the
NYSE composite index fell 4.30 to 497.39 and the American Stock
Exchange composite index fell 4.19 to 660.68.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq Stock Market, at one point down 2.4 percent, was
headed for a slight gain of 1.42 to 1,524.61.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocks lost more than 5
percent before trading started on Wall Street, as did South
Korea's main index.
</P>
<P>
While the Dow hasn't been able to post a record close since
August 6 at 8,259.31, it is still up more than 20 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
As money moves out of stocks at home and abroad, U.S. Treasury
bonds have gained. Yields on 30-year Treasuries, which fall as

<HEADLINE> U.S., Turkish Leaders Meet in Washington (updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Turkish Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz and U.S. President Bill Clinton today had
their first meeting here, during which Clinton expects Turkey to
continue its talks to join the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore, who also attended the 40-minute
meeting, said the White House supports Turkey's continuation of
its talks with EU.
</P>
<P>
"We have promoted actively the integration of Turkey into
Europe and the discussions that they recently had with the
European Union ended inconclusively," Vice President Al Gore told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Turkey threatened to withdraw its application for EU membership
after the institution refused to put it into the list of potential
future members.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz has since criticized EU's decision and appears to have
pursued a deliberate policy of seeking to strengthen its ties with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton and I have had the most fruitful and
comprehensive discussion on issues of mutual interest," Yilmaz
told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The topics they discussed range from bilateral relations to all
the relevant international developments, according to Yilmaz.
However, he did not give any further details about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"At this meeting I have noted with great pleasure the existence
of a total convergence of views between our countries on the
topics that we have addressed during our conversation," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Turkey are two allies whose strategic
partnership over the last 50 yeas has gone through the test of
hard times with great success," said Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister stressed that his country, located
at crossroad between the Asian and European continents, shared
same values with the West.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish people have been sharing the same ideals and
values with the West over the past seven decades. We have always
strived to enhance our democratic system to the benefit of our
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the short statement, he also expressed his belief that the
Turkish-U.S. relations "will continue to grow in a diverse way at
a fast increasing pace."

<HEADLINE> One-Third People Still Racist in EU Countries: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A Eurobarometer survey found
that 33 percent of the interviewed in European Union countries
described themselves as quite racist or very racist.
</P>
<P>
The survey, published today by the European Commission, was
conducted as one of the activities of the European Year Against
Racism which officially closed today.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner Padraig Flynn, in charge of social
affairs, expressed his "extreme concern" at what he described as
"shocking statistics".
</P>
<P>
The Eurobarometer survey was conducted at the request of the
European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation union,
among over 16,000 people across the member states in March and
April this year.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 84 percent of the people interviewed
called for a continued and strengthened role for the European
institutions in the fight against racism.
</P>
<P>
Flynn spoke highly of the achievements of the European Year
Against Racism and the plans for future action against racism.
</P>
<P>
The European Year Against Racism marked the first time that the
European institutions and EU member states have joined forces to
take concrete action against racism.
</P>
<P>
European funding of a total of 3.2 million ECU (3.58 million
U.S. dollars) was spread out over 177 projects while thousands
more anti-racism activities took place within the framework at
local, regional, national and European level.
</P>
<P>
The commission today also hailed the European Year Against
Racism as having seen some major political achievement at a
European level. One example was the establishment of a European
monitoring center on racism and xenophobia that will shortly be
operational in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The center will feed the European Community and EU member
states with objective, reliable and comparable data on racism,
xenophobia and anti-semitism.

<HEADLINE> Car Output in Britain Expected to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) - Car sales and production in
Britain are set to fall next year as the economy weakens and
consumer confidence slips, according to motor industry forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The latest production figures released by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders showed output last month dropped 1.7
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Output earmarked for the home market rose 3.6 percent to 65,780
but the strength of sterling was largely blamed for a 5.3 percent
drop to 88,500 in shipments for the export market.
</P>
<P>
Production this year is expected to mark time at 1.68 million
and slip by 10,000 next year while sales are expected to be the
second or third best on record at 2.17 million.
</P>
<P>
Next year industry economists expect sales to fall by around
70,000. However they believe production will bounce back in 1999
as new models and capacity come on stream.
</P>
<P>
"We could see spectacular progress then," said Roger King, head
of communications at the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders.

</P>
<P>
The new officers announced today will serve 316 law enforcement
agencies in 43 states.
</P>
<P>
The grants will provide 75 percent funding of total salary and
benefits for each officer. The reminder is paid by state or local
jurisdictions.

<HEADLINE> Unionist Party Threatens to Drop out N.Irish Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A Northern Ireland Protestant
party is threatening to quit the multi-party peace talks after
nine IRA prisoners were released from jail early.
</P>
<P>
The Progressive Unionist Party, the political arm of the
outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force guerrilla group, said it might not
go back to the peace talks in January after the Irish government
released nine Irish Republican Army prisoners before their terms
were due.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks adjourned in Belfast on Tuesday without
agreement on a list of key issues to be discussed when they resume
on January 12.
</P>
<P>
"We are affirmed in our belief that there is a process
operating outside the negotiations, and that is unacceptable, It
is absolutely unreasonable, and totally unfair," the Unionist
party's spokesman David Irvine told Irish national broadcaster
RTE.
</P>
<P>
The release of the prisoners was seen as a gesture to boost
delicately poised talks between the pro-British unionists and
republicans who want to break away from British rule and unite
with the Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish premier Bertie
Ahern have voiced optimism that the current talks could end nearly

<HEADLINE> U.S., NATO to Help Greece Search for Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) agreed today to help Greece
search for a missing Ukrainian plane with 73 people on board that
vanished shortly before landing at the northern Greek airport of
Macedonia on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
A fully-equipped U.S. aircraft would soon fly to the presumed
crash site after a request for U.S. assistance in the search
operation was extended by Greek Alternate Foreign minister George
Papandreou during a meeting with U.S. ambassador to Athens
Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
Since Wednesday night, Greece has launched a land, sea and air
search joined by 6500 troops, police, firemen and farmers, but has
failed to locate the Russian-built Yakovlev 42, which was on route
from Kiev to Thessaloniki, a port city in northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Greece asked a Brussels-based center specializing
in locating downed aircraft for assistance in pinpointing the
position of the Ukrainian plane which disappeared from radar
screens at 9:13 p.m. local time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A team of Ukrainian aviation experts also arrived in
Thessaloniki Thursday night to join the fruitless search.
</P>
<P>
Among the 62 passengers, 20 are foreigners and 42 Greeks. Most
of the Greeks are businessmen or construction workers coming home
for Christmas and new year holidays.

<HEADLINE> Unilateral Military Action Not Ruled Out: Richardson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
leave the door open to unilateral military action after exhaustion
of diplomatic efforts to persuade Iraq to open all its
"off-limits" sites to U.N. weapons inspectors, said a U.S.
official today.
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said
on the NBC "Today" program, "We're being wise. We're being steady.
Our policy has worked: diplomacy, negotiation first. And we
haven't ruled out military action. That's our policy.... We're
going to continue that."
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that if the inspectors were in fact denied
entry to what Iraq calls the "presidential sites," "I think that's
going to reach a very sensitive point." But he did not make clear
precisely what he meant by a very sensitive point.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said on the ABC
"Good Morning America" program that his inspectors could not do
their jobs unless given full access to those places which the
Iraqis claim are off-limits.
</P>
<P>
Butler presented a report Thursday to the Security Council,
saying weapons inspectors were still barred from entering those
presidential sites and they were "frustrated."
</P>
<P>
Richardson said Iraq had "backed off" in the last standoff with
the United Nations, which began on October 29 when Iraq ordered
expulsion of Americans from U.N. inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
He said the first step to force Iraq to abide by the U.N.
resolutions "has to be the United Nations Security Council making
it unmistakably clear that we demand full, unrestricted access to
all sites."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that with a strong Security Council statement, a
unified allied response by the 15 members of the Security
Council... will go a long way. If that doesn't work, then the
military option, as President (Bill) Clinton has said, is out
there," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Masterpieces on Display in Ottawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of masterpieces
of the 20th century Chinese painting will open here Saturday as
the last event of Canada's Year of Asia Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"This unparalleled exhibit of modern Chinese masterpieces is a
fitting way to cap off a remarkable year," Canada's Foreign
Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said today in making the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition features 50 exquisite large-format scroll
paintings that, until this year, have never been displayed outside
of China.
</P>
<P>
The masterpieces will be on display at the Canadian Museum of
Civilization here for two months, starting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It is with great pleasure that the museum presents this
exciting overview of some of the most important Chinese artworks
of the century," said Dr. George F. MacDonald, president and CEO
of the museum.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa is the final destination of a three-city exhibition tour
in Canada, which included Toronto and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin attended the opening in Vancouver
where he was participating in the 5th informal APEC Leaders'
Meeting last month.
</P>
<P>
So far, the exhibition has attracted nearly 100,000 visitors
since it went on display in August 1997, said Dr. Nelly W. Ng,
voluntary chair of the Canadian Foundation for the Preservation of
Chinese Cultural and Historical Treasures, which organized the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
"The significance of this exhibition lies not only in its
artistic strengths, but also in that it promotes understanding
through cultural endeavor," she said at a ceremony here today to
launch the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed the hope that more people will contribute to
the preservation of Chinese cultural treasures, the common legacy
of mankind.

<HEADLINE> British Prime Minister Urged to Care for Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A former homeless man sent a
letter to British Prime Minister Tony Blair today to highlight the
plight of the homeless.
</P>
<P>
"Rats live and die with more dignity than the homeless. I hope
that Tony Blair will now take notice and actually do something by
building a shelter in every major town in England," said Stephen
Smith, 54, now a successful businessman living in Munich,
</P>
<P>
Smith went back onto the streets for 17 days in Leeds and
London to get publicity for people who are sleeping rough.
</P>
<P>
In the letter addressed "To Tony Blair from the gutter of
England, Scotland and Wales", he urged Blair to consider "how it
feels" to be an outcast, to have no money and to be urinated upon
by drunks at night.
</P>
<P>
He is opening a hostel for four to six people in north London
that he and other businessmen are financing. "We might call it the
'New Blair Night Shelter' to embarrass the Prime Minister into
supporting us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Smith was homeless and drug addict for quite some time before
he met by chance with a German tourist in the Kings Road in
London. They fell in love, married and now have two children in
Munich.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people experienced homelessness in 1995,
according to a major study of homelessness in Britain commissioned
by 10 leading youth and housing charities and published in
September 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Turkish Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz and U.S. President Bill Clinton today met
for the first time at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton and I have had the most fruitful and
comprehensive discussion on issues of mutual interest," Yilmaz
told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The topics they discussed range from bilateral relations to all
the relevant international developments, according to Yilmaz.
However, he did not give any further details about the meeting.

<P>
"At this meeting I have noted with great pleasure the existence
of a total convergence of views between our countries on the
topics that we have addressed during our conversation," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Turkey are two allies whose strategic
partnership over the last 50 yeas has gone through the test of
hard times with great success," said Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister stressed that his country, located
at the crossroads between the Asian and European continents,
shared the same values with the West.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish people have been sharing the same ideals and
values with the West over the past seven decades. We have always
strived to enhance our democratic system to the benefit of our
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the short statement, he also expressed his belief that the
Turkish-U.S. relations "will continue to grow in a diverse way at

<HEADLINE> U.S. Deficit Continues to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. deficit in
November was 17.3 billion U.S. dollars, bringing the total for the
first two months of fiscal 1998 to 53.3 billion dollars, down 31
percent from the corresponding period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
However, the Clinton administration still is predicting the
1998 budget shortfall will climb to some 58.3 billion dollars from
22 billion dollars in fiscal 1997, which ended September 30.
</P>
<P>
Steady economic growth in 1997 generated a tax windfall that
helped shrink the deficit to the smallest amount since 1974.
However, economists believe growth will moderate in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In November, revenue totaled 103.5 billion dollars and
expenditures, 120.8 billion dollars. The biggest spending
categories were Social Security, 30.7 billion dollars; interest on
the 5.36 trillion dollar national debt, 26.4 billion dollars;
Health and Human Services Department programs, 24.6 billion
dollars; and the military, 16.7 billion dollars.
