WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A freight train carrying
chemicals derailed in western U.S. today, spilling sulphuric acid
and killing two people.
</P>
<P>
The train jumped tracks in the Rocky Mountains north of
Leadville, Colorado, just before six a.m. near Tennessee Pass, a
major mountain pass at more than 10,400 feet above sea level.

"We have two confirmed fatalities," a Colorado State Patrol
spokesman said. But he could not confirm that the victims were
railroad employees.
</P>
<P>
Early news reports from Leadville said three crew members were
trapped in the wreckage and hydrochloric acid from the train's
broken containers was "spilling down the mountainside."

The highway crossing the pass was closed and crews specializing
in cleaning up hazardous materials were rushed to the scene.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UN Peace-keeping Costs to be Halfed in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Expenditures on the
United Nations peace-keeping operations are projected to be
1.4-1.5 billion dollars in 1996, compared to 3 billion dollars in
1995, a spokesman for the U.N. chief said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ahamad Fawzi, deputy spokesman for the secretary-general, said
at the noon news briefing that U.N. has annualized the
peace-keeping budget starting from this year.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, we did not have annual budget every year for
peace-keeping. It was on ad hoc basis -- every peace-keeping
operation had its separate budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
Now, U.N. has annualized the peace-keeping cost with the
budget cycle from July to June so that the General Assembly will
consider it without overlapping the regular budget, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations peace-keeping operations soared from 490
million dollars in 1991 to 3,342 million dollars in 1994 while
growing arrears of assessments resulted in financial crisis of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding contributions to U.N. so far amounted to 3.2
billion dollars, including 1.3 billion dollars for regular budget
and 1.9 billion dollars for peace-keeping operations.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has repeatedly appealed to
the member states to pay their assessments timely and in full.
Meanwhile, U.N. has decided to cut about 10 percent of its staff
and reduce cost in other fields.

<P>
BAGHDAD, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Minister of Culture and
Information Abdul Ghani Abdul Ghafour met here today with visiting
former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark.
</P>
<P>
Clark arrived here Tuesday on a several days' visit to hold
talks with Iraqi officials to discuss the adverse effects left by
the U.N. sanctions on the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Abdul Ghafour underlined the need to
implement para 22 of U.N. Security Council resolution 687 on
lifting the embargo imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
They reviewed the consequence of the embargo on all aspects of
everyday life of the Iraqi people including acute shortage in food
and medicine, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Clark said the embargo is a crime against humanity as well as a
violation of the international law since it directly targets
children, the elderly and those with chronic disease.
</P>
<P>
He said that after his return he will let the American public
opinion know the sufferings of the Iraqi people under the
continued blockade.
</P>
<P>
This is the second visit by Clark to Iraq within one year to
see for himself the extent of the plight of the Iraqi people under

<HEADLINE> U.S. Appeals Against WTO Ruling over A Gas Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
appealed to the appellate body of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) against an earlier panel ruling over its gasoline dispute
with Venezuela and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Washington refused to accept the January WTO ruling, which
deemed it in violation of free trade law in discriminating against
gasoline imports by setting different environmental standards for
domestic and foreign products, arguing its environmental
legislation can be allowed as exception case by the GATT accords
and is not biased.
</P>
<P>
The WTO panel ruling was made after Venezuela filed complaint
to WTO's dispute settlement body, accusing U.S. of exercising
protectionism in restricting gasoline imports through double
standard environmental legislation.
</P>
<P>
It complained that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
rules in 1993 requiring lower level of such components as sulfur,
olefins and benzene in gasoline sold in nine of its largest
metropolitan areas formed discrimination against its exports by
specifying cleaner gasoline than produced by many U.S. refiners.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is the largest gasoline exporter to the United
States. It first lodged the complaint with GATT in 1994 and then
withdrew it only to bring it to WTO, which has tougher rules. It
was joined later by Brazil in the complaint.
</P>
<P>
WTO set up a panel in last April on the case, which, after 9
months of investigation, said in a report that WTO member states
are free to set their own environmental goals, but the measures
they take should not infringe on the free trade law.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. appeal Wednesday is the ever first registered to WTO's
appellate body, which was built in last December. Under WTO rules,
would its appeal be overruled, the United States should bring its
legislation in line with free trade law or otherwise face
penalties.
</P>
<P>
The appellate body should take at the longest 90 days to bring
in a verdict, which is final and binding unless overturned by a
consensus.

LUSAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today criticized some businessmen for hiking prices of
staple food mealie meal (maize flour) to the level beyond the
reach of the ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here this evening, Chiluba said: "I have
carefully investigated the case of the high increases in mealie
meal. It is clear that the market forces have deliberately worked
against consumers."
</P>
<P>
It is not the role of the government to fix prices, but the
government would not allow the market forces to starve the
people, Chiluba stressed.
</P>
<P>
The market forces must interact in favor of consumers and his
warning must be observed and acted upon immediately by everyone
concerned, Chiluba added.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, the average price for the staple food
has soared by some 20 percent due to shortages of maize in the
country.

LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Parents of the suspect of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) Edward O'Brien said today that they
"unreservedly" condemned the bombing in London on Sunday night,
according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
In this explosion, a double-decker was ruined, eight people
were injured and the 21-year old suspect Edward was killed.
</P>
<P>
His father Miley O'Brien and his mother Margo said in a
statement from County Wexford in the Irish Republic that they were
shocked to learn of their son's involvement in the bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
Through their solicitor, the O'Brien family also expressed
"deep sorrow and sympathy" to those wounded in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that they wanted no paramilitary involvement at
their son's funeral.
</P>
<P>
Following the bomb blast, police picked up some remains of
letters on the wrecked bus, which provided Edward's address in
south London. They rushed to raid the house and found a cache of
explosives and bomb-making equipment there.
</P>
<P>
This proved that Edward was a member of the IRA, who had
carried out the bomb explosion.
</P>
<P>
And police believed that their discovery of the cache of
explosives would disrupt IRA plans for a series of attacks across
London.

<HEADLINE> Snow, High Winds Bring Chaos to Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- High winds, snow falls and
heavy drifting brought substantial disruption to roads, rail and
shipping in Britain Tuesday, with southeast England and East
Anglia worst affected.
</P>
<P>
Channel tunnel shuttle services were suspended for eight hours
after heavy snowfalls prevented staff from getting to work and
melting snow from trains passing through the tunnel disrupted the
signaling system.
</P>
<P>
Ferries were also disrupted. One vessel carrying 400 passengers
was stuck in the English Channel for 13 hours because rough seas
and high winds prevented docking.
</P>
<P>
More than 14,000 homes in Lincolnshire and Kent were left
without power for several hours. Conditions were less severe in
the north, but snow blocked roads on higher ground in northwest
England.
</P>
<P>
High winds also caused concern about flooding and homes were
evacuated in several coastal areas as the winds whipped up the sea
and flooded homes in Seasalter and Deal.
</P>
<P>
The London Weather Center said that winds had been gusting up
to 45 miles per hour and that snow showers and strong winds had
continued during the day. Forecast is a gradual improvement from
the west although the outlook is still wintry.

<HEADLINE> Hawala Scandal Claims Another Indian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The hawala case claimed yet
another victim today with Indian Urban and Employment Minister
R.K. Dhawan resigning from the government as the Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) plans to file more charge sheets tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), Dhawan, who has
been said to be resisting suggestions for his resignation in the
last two days, finally put in his papers today, a day before the
Supreme Court is to review the progress in the hawala case.
</P>
<P>
The resignation was accepted by the president on the advice of
Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the powerful Congress Working Committee of the
ruling Congress Party, Dhawan's name reportedly figured in the
infamous Jain diary which listed the names of politicians
receiving money from illegal foreign exchange dealers -- the Jain
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
Dhawan's ministerial tenure was the shortest among the seven
ministers who have quit over the hawala case as he became minister
only in September last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Delhi Chief Minister Madan Lal Khurana, whose name
also reportedly appeared in the Jain diary, today told PTI that he
has left the issue of his resignation to the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) leadership.
</P>
<P>
Later, BJP spokesperson Sushma Swaraj said that there was no
change in the party's stand that unless charged by the CBI,
Khurana need not resign.
</P>
<P>
There was also speculation today about the fate of Minister of
State for Civil Supplies Krishna Sahi, whose name is said to be
listed in the coded diary.

WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A USAir jetliner hit a
turbulence when approaching Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, Tuesday
afternoon and seven people aboard were injured, officials said.
</P>
<P>
USAir Flight 817, carrying 147 people, was jolted for six
seconds by a blast of turbulence at an altitude of 10,000 feet
when preparing for a landing at Pittsburg International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Six female flight attendants and a senior passenger were thrown
around in the plane, injured and taken to hospitals for treatment.
</P>
<P>
USAir spokesman David Castelveter said four of the injured
attendants were released after treatment and two were reported in
satisfactory condition at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
Police said the passenger, identified as Celia Pizzela, 70,
suffered a head injury. She was in the toilet when the plane
encountered the turbulence.
</P>
<P>
The flight, a Boeing 767, was heading for Pittsburgh from
Frankfurt, Germany, when it hit the turbulence. Aviation officials
were investigating the incident.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Shot down Hezbollah Hang-Glider in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Army Northern
Commander Amiram Levine said today the army spotted Hezbollah
hang-glider in south Lebanon Tuesday and brought it down as it was
about to enter Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Levine said that a
"Hezbollah terrorist" was apparently on his way to a suicide
attack in the "security zone" or northern Israel when the
motorized hang-glider he was piloting went off in the air.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite Moslem organization had recently been trying to
mount sophisticated operations, such as the abortive car bomb
attack three weeks ago in the Markabeh region of the "security
zone." The car blew up prematurely, killing only the driver.
</P>
<P>
The previous hang-glider attack took place in November 1987,
when two or three of them manned by members of Ahmed Jibril's
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command
tried to infiltrate into Israel.
</P>
<P>
One of them came down inside the zone and the pilot was
killed. Another succeeded in crossing the border and landed near
Kiryat Shmona.
</P>
<P>
The heavily-armed pilot managed to enter a nearby Nahal
army camp, where he killed six soldiers and wounded seven others
before being shot dead.
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's incident, a full alert was sounded along the
length of the northern border and helicopter gunships were sent up
in case of further attempts.

<HEADLINE> Eurotunnel Bank Talks Likely to Overrun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Talks between Eurotunnel, the
Anglo-French operator of the Channel tunnel, and its banks, which
are owed eight billion pounds (12 billion US dollars), will almost
certainly miss next month's deadline for an outline restructuring
plan.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times reported today that the company's four leading
banks, which are known as the agent banks and are running the
negotiations, have been forced to admit in a letter to other banks
in the syndicate that they are unlikely to present a plan by March
14.
</P>
<P>
The letter is the first indication from the agent banks of the
problems besetting the negotiations. The banks have so far refused
to make any public comment on the talks. Eurotunnel recently
stated that the talks were going slower than expected.
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel's bank negotiations have been hampered by a
disagreement among the leading banks on how hard a line to take
with the company, according to negotiators.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that the agent banks have produced proposals
which would involve the group paying significantly lower levels of
interest over the next 8-10 years.
</P>
<P>
The dispute centres on what would happen to unpaid interest,
with some banks arguing that the company should eventually repay
in full, while others are understood to be willing to write off
part of the amount.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, Eurotunnel entered a standstill
agreement with its banks which exempts it from paying interest on
eight billion pounds of debt for up to 18 months while
negotiations take place.
</P>
<P>
After March 14, the standstill period can be brought to an end
if 65 percent of the banks vote to do so, which would almost
certainly put the company into administration.

<HEADLINE> EC Adopts Proposal for Protection of Car Spare Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
adopted today an amended proposal for harmonizing member states'
legislation on the protection of designs and models of car spare
parts.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, EU Commissioner Mario Monti
said the 1993 EC regulation, under which every car spare part could
enjoy three years' property protection, is too simple.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EC regulation has to be "careful to respect
the balance of interests between car manufacturers on the one hand
and independent part manufacturers, car insurers and consumers on
the other."
</P>
<P>
Under the newly adopted proposal, every car spare part which
wants to enjoy the protection have to be new and have an
individual character. The duration of protection variesfrom five
to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The proposal stipulated that visible parts of a car, such as
doors and body panels, could be reproduced by independent
part manufacturers on condition that they paid a "fair and
reasonable" remuneration to the car manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
And since the invisible parts such as oil filters, fan belts
and other engine parts are not qualified for design protection
according to the new proposal, independent part manufacturers
could freely reproduce them as soon as a new car model appeared
on the market.
</P>
<P>
The amended proposal has been sent to EU's Council of Ministers
for adoption of a Common Position, which will then be sent to the
European Parliament.

<HEADLINE> EC to Improve Customs Transit Systems to Fight Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- With the adoption of a
communication today, the European Commission (EC) is set to
improve the customs transit systems and firmly to strengthen the
fight against fraud.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC, the fraud affecting the customs transit
procedures during the last five years caused a loss of at least
750 million ECUs (about 975 million U.S. dollars) to the national
budgets and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
These procedures allow the movement of goods in the EU without
duties, taxes and other measures which are normally applicable
when imported.
</P>
<P>
In the communication, the EC pointed out that the
computerization of the transit system was the up-and-coming
solution to fight effectively against fraud and to improve the
management of the transit system.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the necessity that member states make available the
required resources so that the computer system becomes fully
operational throughout the EU from 1998.
</P>
<P>
The EC also stressed the need to adopt important measures to
strengthen the fight against fraud with other partner countries
under the existing international conventions on transit.

<HEADLINE> First Rapist Sentenced in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A man convicted of rape was
sentenced to five years' imprisonment in Milan Tuesday in the
first rape trial since Italy passed a new law on sexual violence
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The man, a married 31-year-old Venetian, seduced an 11-year-old
girl on the phone and raped her afterward. The girl's parents
called the police immediately after they found out.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the new law, rape was considered only a moral offense
in Italy, which helped many rapists to escape punishment. With
sexual crimes on the rise, the government of former Prime
Minister Lamberto Dini proposed the bill last May to toughen
penalties for rape.
</P>
<P>
The court in Milan found the man guilty and passed the sentence
according to the new law which was approved by the Italian
parliament earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here said that the case drew tremendous attention
from all sectors of society and especially from women, who hailed
the imprisonment of the rapist as an important step in legal and
social reforms in Italy.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Stricken Supertanker to Gush More Oil off Welsh Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The oil tanker Sea Empress that
ran aground off Wales may cause one of the worst ecological
disasters in history if it breaks up and discharges its remaining
90,000 tons of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Eight tugs failed to pull the vessel off rocks on the south
Wales coast at high tide last night. Shipping Minister Lord
Goschen, who flew over the area today, said that the tanker would
break up.
</P>
<P>
"The only question is when," he said.
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the vessel's 17 cargo tanks were ruptured when it
broke free of tugs and ran aground on Monday during the highest
tide of the month.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the vessel has already leaked 50,000 tons
of oil, about one third of its cargo, as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A 12-kilometer oil slick is threatening the Dyfed coast and the
island wildlife sanctuaries of Skomer and Skokholm which lie about
nine kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
Three hundred workers have been deployed to clean the
beaches. They used boulders and shingles to block off the entrance
to Gann Flats, a site of special scientific interest and home to
wading birds including little egrets.
</P>
<P>
Dr Sian Pullen of the World Wide Fund For Nature said that the
oil could have short-term effects on bird populations and
longer-term effects on lobster fisheries, soft corals and sea fans
in the marine reserve.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst such accident in Britain since the supertanker
Braer broke up on rocks in the Shetland Isles off the northern tip
of Scotland in January 1993, spilling 80,000 tons of oil.

<HEADLINE> Around-The-Clock Nursing for Mental Patients in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Psychiatric patients in Britain
are to be given 24-hour nursing care in a network of residential
homes for the mentally ill, the Health Department announced on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move came as Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell admitted that
the policy of discharging the mentally ill into the community had
failed many patients.
</P>
<P>
Controversy arose after a series of killings and attacks on the
public by mentally ill patients discharged from hospitals.
</P>
<P>
There is widespread concern that such patients are being
released from overcrowded wards without proper supervision and
left to roam the streets.
</P>
<P>
A Health Department survey has found that one in three health
authorities was failing to provide proper care for psychiatric
patients discharged into the community.
</P>
<P>
The new homes for the mentally ill are seen as an attempt to
ensure proper care for the country's relatively small number of
mentally ill patients -- about 5,000 -- who pose a danger to
themselves and others.
</P>
<P>
The Health Secretary said that a modern mental health service
should represent a dramatic improvement in the quality of care
over the old asylum-based system.

<HEADLINE> 2,260 Candidates for Iranian Parliamentary Elections Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Over two fifths of candidates
for the upcoming parliamentary elections were rejected by the
powerful Guardians Council controlled by rightist hardliners.
</P>
<P>
Today's evening paper Kayhan reported that out of the 5,359
candidates, 2,260, including President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's
feminist daughter, were rejected by the Guardians Council which is
composed of high-ranking clergies.
</P>
<P>
The Guardians Council is the final authority that oversees
Iran's fifth parliamentary elections since Islamic Revolution of
1979.
</P>
<P>
Kayhan said the council will announce its decision on rejected
applications by February 28, some nine days before the election
day.
</P>
<P>
However, the Guardians Council and its supervisory boards have
come under fire by many grassroots organizations. The critics
allege that Guardians Council is not free from its own sectarian
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
A candidate who spoke on condition of anonymity to Xinhua said
that the reasons for the rejection of his application were not
mentioned on the rejection letter.
</P>
<P>
"How can I make any complaints to the Guardians Council if I
am not told on what charges my application has been rejected?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
A political analyst here told Xinhua that the council has yet
to purge itself of loyalty to the powerful faction that now
dominates the Parliament, the Society of the Combatant Clergy
(SCC).
</P>
<P>
Aside from SCC, there are three factions vying for the seats
in the Fifth Parliament: the leftists, G-6 and a newly formed
faction called ADVIR.
</P>
<P>
The leftist are represented by the Islamic Revolution Mojahedin
of Iran (IRMOI). At least two of IRMOI's candidates have been
rejected.
</P>
<P>
The group known as Group-6 is composed of six top aides of
President Rafsanjani. The group emerged in opposition to SCC in a
bid to end SCC's power monopoly in the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Association for Defending the Values of the Islamic Revolution
(ADVIR) appeared on the scene last week. The leader of this group
is Mohammad Mohammadi Rayshahri, a clergy with close ties with
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
A political commentator in the English daily Iran News wrote
that ADVIR was "left-leaning thinking in economic affairs and
follows a 'no tolerance' policy in cultural affairs."

<HEADLINE> Monkeys Are Better at Numbers Than Human Infants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have found that
monkeys are more difficult to fool with numbers than human
infants, The Daily Telegraph reported today.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Harvard University and Radcliffe College in
Massachusetts found that rhesus monkeys studied in Puerto Rico
appear to be able to perform basic arithmetic such as addition and
subtraction with skills exceeding those of babies under the age of
one.
</P>
<P>
Professor Marc Hauser and his colleagues used a test designed
to monitor whether infants have inherent mathematical abilities.
</P>
<P>
The researchers showed monkeys one or two eggplants before
hiding the vegetable behind a screen.
</P>
<P>
When the researchers tried to fool the monkeys by changing the
number of the hidden eggplants, the animals appeared to be aware
of the difference.
</P>
<P>
Hauser said that the test monkeys were surprised to see
anything other than the number of eggplants they were expecting.
</P>
<P>
The test monkeys also looked surprised if a single large
eggplant was revealed after two eggplants had been placed behind
the screen.
</P>
<P>
Unlike human infants, monkeys were still aware of a change in
numbers when different types of vegetables were used in the test.
</P>
<P>
The researchers repeated the tests with tamarind monkeys.
</P>
<P>
Hauser said: "The monkeys pass the tests that human infants
don't seem to pass until they have linguistic labels for the
objects. Although language facilitates mathematics, it
is not critical."
</P>
<P>
He described the tests as revolutionary in the field of animal
cognition because they demonstrate that basic arithmetic skills
exist in monkeys without the need for training.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we have the techniques that allow us to
compare cognitive abilities across species," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the next stage of the experiment, Hauser and his team will
assess how many objects monkeys can count.

greenhouses, bowling greens and artificial turf pitches.
</P>
<P>
A Council spokesman said today that there was a need to
safeguard the well being of the community and to prevent as far as
passive smoking.

<HEADLINE> HK Fireworks in New Year Chilly Drizzle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The chilly drizzle on the
second day of the Lunar New Year could not deter half a million
sky gazers from watching a fireworks spectacle in Hong Kong last
night.
</P>
<P>
Following the coldest New Year's Day in 45 years, when
temperature dropped to just 6.9 degrees on Monday, Hong Kong
embraced the chilliest second day of the Lunar New Year ever
recorded over the past 113 years, with the mercury standing at 5.9
degrees in the downtown district.
</P>
<P>
Shivering crowds, estimated at about 520,000 people, huddled
together along the waterfront surrounding the Victoria Harbor or
at the Peak, watched fireworks rocketing into the sky. The
display, at a cost of four million HK dollars ( 510,000 US
dollars), was put on for 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The temperature slid to zero on the hills. The cold weather
brought Hong Kong an unusual scene -- "silver trees" wearing a
cover of white frost on Tai Mo Shan, the highest peak in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
An intensive winter monsoon moved in last Saturday and cold
conditions swept across the territory throughout the new year
holidays.

<HEADLINE> HK Civil Servants learning Knowledge of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Nine expatriate Hong Kong
civil servants will receive courses in Guangzhou to prepare
themselves with knowledge of China for continued work after the
handover on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The expatriate officers will take part in a two-week intensive
course at Zhongshan University in Guangzhou, China, between March
4 and 15, which is a trial scheme launched by the Hong Kong
government. They are now undertaking a preliminary course on
Cantonese in the territory.
</P>
<P>
The group, including Registrar of Companies, four directorate
grade officers and four senior police officers, all expressed
their wishes to stay with the civil service beyond 1997. They
will study language, China's civil service, constitution, legal
system and economic reforms in the course.
</P>
<P>
If the scheme proved a success, it would be expanded and
adopted as part of a routine for recruits, Hong Kong Standard
quoted an official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 150,000 booklets on the Basic Law will be
distributed to civil servants in the next three months to enhance
their knowledge of the future Special Administrative Region (SAR).
Videos and booklets on the civil service and economic reforms in
China will be produced to educate local bureaucrats, said
government sources.

<HEADLINE> Low Turnout Voids Polish Referendum on Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Polish State Election
Commission today nullified a five-question referendumm on
privatization due to a low turnout.
</P>
<P>
Only 32.4 percent of the 28 million Poles eligible to vote took
part on Sunday in the country's first referendum since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The results of the referendum were not binding for the
government as the turnout was below the required 50-percent mark.
</P>
<P>
Former Polish President Lech Walesa, who proposed the
referendum during his election campaign last year, said on Monday
that he took the low turnout as a personal defeat.
</P>
<P>
But 94.5 percent of those who did vote overwhelmingly approved
distribution of assets that still remain in the hands of the
state, although 72.5 percent of voters were against an expansion
of Poland's mass privatization program.
</P>
<P>
Some 88 percent supported the proposal to replace the existing
ownership certificate scheme with a new voucher plan.
</P>
<P>
Poland started its privatization program in 1990 by selling off
small and medium-sized state enterprises. It began the sale of
444 large and medium-sized state enterprises last November.
</P>
<P>
All Poles are allowed to purchase ownership certificates that
will be exchanged later for shares of some 500 privatized
companies.
</P>
<P>
So far, seven million Poles, or 18 percent of the country's
population, have bought the certificates.

<HEADLINE> Three Iranian Diplomats Return Home After Detain in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Three Iranian diplomats who
were detained by NATO forces at a Bosnian government center
for 48 hours returned to Tehran this morning.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the three
diplomats, Mohammad Pour-Salem, Asghar Ali-Shahi and Ali
Jafarzadeh, were warmly welcomed upon their arrival at the
airport by their relatives, foreign ministry officials and a
large number of people.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian diplomats expressed surprise with their detention
at one of the Bosnian Interior Ministry premises despite the
fact that they had gone there at an official invitation from the
Bosnian authorities.
</P>
<P>
The action of the Peace Implementation Force (IFOR) betrayed
their pre-meditated plan to launch a new wave of propaganda
campaign against Iran and the oppressed people of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, they said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Ambassador to Sarajevo Mohammad-Ibrahim Taherian, who
accompanied the three diplomats to Iran, said the IFOR consisting
of American, British and French forces detained the Iranian
diplomats for 48 hours in an insulting and inhumane manner.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Interior Ministry and President Alija Izzetbegovic
reacted to the illegal move of the IFOR as soon as they learned
of the issue, Taherian said.
</P>
<P>
After the discovery of a military training camp about 10
kilometers south of Fojnica, Bosnia, the Iranian authorities kept
silent over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Both the Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry did not
explain about the weapons, ammunition and pictures of late
religious leader Ruhollah Mousavi Khomeini and present leader Ali
Khamenei found in the camp.
</P>
<P>
However, only the Iranian Embassy in Bosnia attacked the United
States over the arrest of three Iranians, terming the U.S.
attack on Bosnian police training camp as a planned move in
a bid to drive Moslem Iranians out of the region.
</P>
<P>
Iranian media made harsh criticism against the United States
for starting a smear campaign against Tehran in a bid to weaken
its ties with Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR forces arrested 11 people, including three Iranians,
in the vicinity of Sarajevo at a building which NATO claimed was
a training camp for terrorists.

<HEADLINE> 279 Bronze Seals Unearthed in Xi'an </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered 279 bronze imperial seals dating back 700 years in
the northwestern city of Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made toward the end of January in a downtown
part of the city. The relics are being put on display today.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists say that the seals were made during the Jin
Dynasty (1115-1234) and were used mainly by officials and officers
of the local government and by the military, which played an
important role in the city during that period.
</P>
<P>
It is unusual for archeologists to uncover so many seals at one
time, said Han Baojin of the local relics bureau.
</P>
<P>
The seals were buried in a deep well, and had probably been
hidden by Jin officials who were hiding from attacks by the
Mongolian army, Han noted.

<P>
FREETOWN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two farmers were on
Monday beheaded by Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels at a
village in Sierra Leone's southern Moyamba District, witnesses
said today.
</P>
<P>
Local journalists who just came back from the southern city of
Bo also confirmed that another five farmers had their hands
amputated and are now admitted in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
"About 60 rebels, most of them dressed in military fatigue,
arrived at the village and ordered all to assemble at the court,"
said Morrie Jacob, a villager who narrowly escaped the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
"While there, they ordered all of us to undress and told us
that while they were calling for peace before elections,
civilians were asking for election to be held," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We were then locked up in our respective houses and they took
us in turns to cut off our hands. We saw the corpses of the 22
beheaded farmers and saw the rebels raped some pregnant women
too," said the farmer.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said on Tuesday that heavily armed government
troops marched into the village after the event. But there was
still no report of further developments.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Julius Maada Bio's military government, which came
to power after a successful palace coup to oust Captain Valentine
Strasser, ordered that the general elections would go ahead as
scheduled on February 26.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bio had reached an agreement with RUF rebel leader
Foday Sankoh to begin their first-ever peace talks on February 28
in Cote d'Ivoire in an unprecedented effort to bring peace to the
west African state torn apart by almost five years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Opinions divided in the country as to whether to hold
elections first or to negotiate peace before elections.

MANILA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Chowking Food Corp., one of the
Philippines' food giants, will open two stores in San Diego,
California, by June this year as an initial step in its ambitious
overseas expansion, Chowking's President Robert Kuan said today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the company, which operates a Chinese fast-food
chain, plans to sell some of its shares in a public offering
sometime next year to raise funds for the expansion.
</P>
<P>
If the plans are pushed through, Chowking will be the second
fast-food company to be publicly listed in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Jollibee, another Philippine food giant, sold shares in a
public offering in 1992 to finance the opening of new stores in
Brunei, Hong Kong, Guam, the Middle East and the US.
</P>
<P>
Kuan said that Chowking's long-term plans also call for the
opening of stores in South America, the Middle East, Europe and
Asia-Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
The company's sales rose to one billion pesos (40 million US
dollars) in 1995 from 523 million pesos (20.9 million US dollars)
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Sales are targeted to increase at least 60 percent to reach 1.6
billion pesos (64 million US dollars) in 1996 and to hit four
billion pesos (160 million US dollars) by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The company, which has 92 stores in the Philippines, plans to
open 30 to 40 new stores across the country this year.

The road was the city's largest public utility project and was

NANJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province, an economic
powerhouse in east China, plans to put some 40 billion yuan
(almost 5 billion US dollars) into transportation in the next five
years, 70 percent of that in less-developed northern areas.
</P>
<P>
These include six super highways with a total length of 1,200
kilometers, five of which will be located in the northern part,
provincial authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as a strategy to help Subei (northern Jiangsu)
catch up with the economic development of Sunan (southern
Jiangsu), analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Located on the north bank of the Yangtze River, Subei has
unfavourable geographical conditions and was always less
developed. All 13 of the province's poor counties are in Subei.
</P>
<P>
Improving transportation is considered vital to the economic
improvement of Subei.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial plan, by the end of the century, all
major cities will be connected by super highways, and cities and
counties at the prefecture level will be linked by improved
roads.

"future promotion to five-star ranks will cease in peacetime,"
Soames said.

In future, officers with four-star ranks will perform the

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine News Agency
today reported that overloading was what caused the ferry accident
last Sunday off Cadiz city, 460 kilometers south of Manila, which
killed 59 people.
</P>
<P>
At least 12 people are still missing and 149 were rescued after
the ferry Gretchen 1 was hit by giant waves.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Philippine Maritime Industry Authority
(MARINA) admitted having failed to check the ferry before it left
Bantayan island, Cebu, for Cadiz.
</P>
<P>
MARINA Administrative Chief Maristel Letigio said that there
was no MARINA port inspector on the Bantayan island to check the
ferry for overloading.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was hard to check the vessels at all the
Philippine ports for lack of personnel and motor launch.
</P>
<P>
Both MARINA and the Philippine Coast Guard are responsible for
checking the capacity and number of passengers of a ship.
</P>
<P>
MARINA is also responsible for checking the boarding
formalities, seaworthiness, quantity and quality of life-saving
equipment and the capability of crew members to face emergency
situations.

<HEADLINE> NGO Formed In Tanzania To Curb Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of the
increasing cases of drug trafficking in Tanzania, a
non-governmental organization (NGO) has been formed to fight the
use of mandrax.
</P>
<P>
The NGO, Anti-drug War and Education (ANDWAE), was registered
officially here on Tuesday with the Registrar of Societies in the
Ministry of Home Affairs.
</P>
<P>
ANDWAE National Secretary General, Nsanya Nkya told reporters
here after his organization's registration that the NGO was
aimed at fighting the illicit drugs through public education
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
He said that the drugs affected the health of many of the
Tanzanian population especially the youth, just as it was the
case with tobacco and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
"It is upon this background that we have seen the need to form
the NGO to propagate against the consumption of the mandrax," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Nkya said his organization would work hand in hand with the
government through its state organs to fight the drug
trafficking before it grew roots.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the NGO was encouraged by measures being
taken by the government to net the drug traffickers through the
Ministry of Home Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Nkya, who is a retired civil servant, 60 years old, holer of
M.A. Degree, held various posts in the government during his 29
years of service. The last time he was consultant engineer in the
President's Office.

<HEADLINE> Iran Ready to Launch Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran is ready to launch a
satellite called Zohreh (Venus) for telecommunication purposes,
according to a monthly published here today.
</P>
<P>
"The satellite is ready. We are waiting for the permission
to be granted by the authorities," an official of
Telecommunication Corporation of Iran (TCI) said.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the satellite was on the new year agenda
of the Iranian authorities since President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani announced it in the new fiscal budget starting from
March 21 this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Persian magazine, Payam-e Emrouz, and other press
institutions did not reveal whether the satellite was imported or
made inside the country.
</P>
<P>
The report did not mention which foreign company would help
Iran launch the satellite because Iran has no capability of
satellite launching.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government did not unveil the plan for the
satellite communication program.
</P>
<P>
The magazine reported that the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU) had earlier given a deadline to Iran for launching its
satellite otherwise it would lose the right to use orbits.
</P>
<P>
It reported that Iran has been granted three orbits by the ITU
for its satellite.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Post, Telecommunication and Telephone Minister Mohammad
Gharazi told the press last summer that financial problem was
the main obstacle for launching the satellite.
</P>
<P>
As part of government efforts to modernize telecommunication in
the country, TCI recently started a massive drive to register
thousands of applicants for the mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that over one hundred thousand Iranians
signed up for the mobile phones. The drive has fetched TCI
over one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told Xinhua that TCI will use the
money borrowed from the people to launch its satellite.
</P>
<P>
"Zohreh will be launched this year with the same money
received from the people who signed up for the mobile
phones," the source said.
</P>
<P>
Tehran already has a mobile phone system. Present mobile
phones have a limited range because they are not supported
with satellite communication.
</P>
<P>
In addition to revolutionizing the telephone technology, the
satellite is said to be used by Iranian television in a
bid to fight what the Iranian authorities have called
an "cultural invasion" by the West.

<HEADLINE> Employment Centers Successful in Hanoi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 21 (xinhua) -- Twenty placement centers are
operating fruitfully in Hanoi, having found jobs for 4,130 out of
a total of 7,630 applicants and made 26 vocational training
courses accessible to 860 people last year, local news reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
Among those who have benefited from these centers are 3,100
returned workers, including 400 from former Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
Employment centers, first appearing in 1986, aim to offer job
opportunities, vocational training courses, and counsel service to
people of working age, especially the youths.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce the unemployment rate in the Vietnamese
capital, which stood at 7.3 percent in 1994, the Hanoi People's
Committee has decided to invest 360,000 U.S. dollars to build a
new employment center on an area of 1,415 square meters on the
outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the center will be able to provide vocational
training for 2,000 people and help find jobs for 10,000 others
every year.

<HEADLINE> Japan To Give Tanzania Non-Project Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan has promised
Tanzania a total of about 19.5 million US dollars for a
non-project grant aid and a project for supply equipment for
maintenance of trunk roads.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued on Tuesday by the Japanese Embassy in
Dar es Salaam said that about 14.4 million dollars of the fund
would be used for the non-project grant aid and the remaining for
procuring equipment for maintenance of trunk roads.
</P>
<P>
It said that the non-project grant aid was designed to provide
completely united grant to import goods urgently needed to
promote structural adjustment under the guidance of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and The World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"This assistance is expected to produce immediate effects to
help the international payments balance," it added.
</P>
<P>
Japan provided to Tanzania similar type of grant aid in 1987,
1991, 1992 and 1995.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM to Visit Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
Ehud Barak is going to pay a brief visit to Russia next month in
an effort to patch up its relations with Moscow, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Barak is expected to meet with his new counterpart, Yevgeny
Primakov, for a discussion of various topics in dispute between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel believes that the relationship with Russia has
deteriorated recently and Barak will apparently try to mend the
fences.
</P>
<P>
Barak's decision followed a meeting between him and the Russian
ambassador here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As Israel sees it, Primakov's appointment in January signaled
a new trend in Russian foreign policy toward the Middle
East, mainly because of his reputation as a devoted Arabist
and track record as one who fought to establish a Russian
foothold in the region.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is also seen as an activist who believes that
Russia must make an effort to reassert its role as a
superpower. One way he is expected to do so is by stressing
Russia's importance to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he recently met with U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher and Middle East peace coordinator Dennis
Ross. The meeting lasted seven hours and a half.
</P>
<P>
One of the things Primakov reportedly told Christopher is that
Russia will no longer be satisfied with its quiet, formal role in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel is also concerned over the position Russia and its
new foreign minister may adopt ahead of Russian general
elections in summer.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues Barak is to take up with Primakov is Russia's
refusal to abandon its construction of nuclear reactors in
Iran. An issue Primakov is expected to raise is what Russia
considers to be a contemptible treatment of its businessmen in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
There are also a number of legal issues to be resolved
concerning Russian rights to former Soviet Union in Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a recent incident which might prove Israel's concern,
Russia expelled an Israeli official with a diplomatic passport
who operated out of the Israeli Embassy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Russia insisted that the official be returned immediately,
which aroused speculation that Russia accused the person in
question of spying.

LUSAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Export Board of Zambia has
established a trade point with a view to encouraging small and
medium size enterprises to embark on international trade.
</P>

and simplify export procedures for local companies.
</P>
<P>
Customs, freight forwarders, transport firms, foreign trade
institutions, banks and relevant bodies are under one roof to
reduce procedural barriers and help new entrants into the foreign
trade arena.

<HEADLINE> Tranquillity Prevails in Qatar After Aborted Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Qatar is calm today after a
coup has been thwarted.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources in Qatar's capital Doha told Xinhua that
activities are normal as usual after an official announcement
Tuesday that the coup was foiled. Police patrols, however, have
been increased.
</P>
<P>
Qatar's Interior Ministry announced Tuesday that it foiled the
plot and arrested some perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, which was brief, did not say how many were
involved in the coup.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources, however, said that taking part in the
coup Saturday were seven officers as well as 40 soldiers and
policemen, all of whom were arrested except for two who fled to
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
"Qatar will seek an emergency Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
ministerial council meeting to inform them of the circumstances of
the aborted plot to undermine Qatar's security and stability,"
Qatar' foreign ministry said in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has arrested more than 100 people in connection with the
anti-government plot involving former bodyguards loyal to the
former Amir, a local press report said today.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the persons arrested are members of the personal
army raised by Sheikh Khalifa during his rule," the report
quoted a senior Qatari official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"These people have been trying to undermine the security and
stability of the country with the help of foreign forces and
disgruntled elements," it added. "The interrogation has revealed
that there was a deep conspiracy to destabilize the country in
which some foregin sides are involved."
</P>
<P>
The official Qatar News Agency (QNA) said the Qatari Foreign
Ministry Tuesday informed the ambassadors of the Britain, China,
France, Russia and the United States -- the five permanent
members of the UN Security Council -- of the foiled coup.
</P>
<P>
QNA said Qatar Amir Sheikh Hamad Tuesday received telephone
calls from the leaders of Jordan, Yemen and Kuwait, who expressed
their support to the Qatar's incumbent government.
</P>
<P>
Qatar, a GCC country along with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain,
Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), produces 400,000 barrels
per day of crude oil. It has the world's third largest gas
reserves, after Russia and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, 26, overthrew his father
last June and became Qatar's Amir.

<HEADLINE> Hanoi Urged to Support Horticulture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese press today urged
the government to assist the vegetable and fruit processing
industry in terms of investment, supply of facilities and opening
of overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has been constantly expanding its vegetable production
to meet the growing needs of its population and overseas markets,
but vegetable farmers have suffered heavy losses due to lop-sided
investment, slumping market prices, poor storage conditions and
inadequate processing capacity, the local news reports said.
</P>
<P>
The market cannot consume all at once what the farmers produce,
and the vegetables cannot stay fresh in the absence of proper
storage facilities, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that processing factories are located too
far from fields. The long haul causes high transportation costs
and compromises much of the quality of vegetables and fruits.
</P>
<P>
This in turn has resulted in low pay for the workers at the
processing units and subsequently a loss of skilled labor and the
products' poor competitiveness against imports from abroad, even
on the home market.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the industry needs a comprehensive solution
involving production down to marketing, including an overhaul of
the processing technology.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Willing To Discuss Wall Issue With Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said today Malaysia is willing to solve through diplomatic
channels the problems that have arisen with Thailand over
Malaysia's planned construction of a wall along its international
boundary with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir made the remarks when asked to comment on the
statement by Thailand's Foreign Minister Kasem S. Kasemsri
published in several Thai newspapers last week that there was no
valid reason for the 27 kilometer-long wall.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his residence here, Mahathir said the issue could
be misunderstood if both countries talked through the press,
adding that talks could determine whether there had been any
violation in the construction of the wall.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Malaysia will construct a wall along the
border with Thailand to prevent drug trafficking and illegal
trade.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports quoted Kasem as saying that such a wall was not
good because it showed that the country which is building it did
not want to be friendly with its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The Thai foreign minister was also quoted as saying that the
International Court of Justice at the Hague could be asked to rule
on Malaysia's construction of the wall if there was no agreement
in talks between Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether work on the wall, which is scheduled for
completion in September 1996, would proceed, Mahathir said
Malaysia would discuss the matter with Thailand.

<P>
YANGON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A two-day workshop on
improvement of the vital registration and statistics system in
cooperation with Myanmar and the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) is ending here today, state-run Radio Myanmar said.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the workshop are to foster and join in the
work of the vital registration and statistics system at the
grassroots level, Myanmar Minister for National Planning and
Economic Development Brigadier Gen. Abel told the opening of the

The vital registration system in Myanmar had been in force
before the country's independence. The present system covers 254
towns in urban areas and 165 townships in rural areas under the
assistance of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities
(UNFPA).
</P>
<P>
The vital statistics is useful for implementation of public
health care projects, estimation of future populations, education
planning, social and general administration.
</P>
<P>
The first session of the workshop was held in Mandalay and
Kyaukse in central Myanmar last December. The workshop in Yangon
is the second session.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the population of Myanmar in
1994-95 was estimated at 43.92 million, representing a growth rate
of 1.87 percent. The male population was 21.83 million or 49.70
percent of the whole population while the female population stood
at 22.09 million or 50.30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The birth and death rates were 30.2 and 9.8 per thousand
respectively, while infant mortality and maternal mortality stood
at 49.6 and 1.8 per thousand respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 people suffered
minor injuries while fleeing an Airbus A300 at New York's Kennedy
International Airport today after the captain reported smelling
smoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
American Airlines' flight 587, with 187 passengers and 10 crew
members on board, was backing away from its gate this morning when
the captain radioed the control tower that he smelled smoke in the
cockpit, a Port Authority spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The plane, bound for the Dominican Republic, came to a halt and
passengers were ordered to get off through the emergency chutes.
As they were anxious to get out of the plane, many were coming
down so quickly that bodies were piling up at the bottom of the
chute. Some slid down holding babies in their arms, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 34 people were slightly injured, said Port
Authority spokesman John Kampfe. Four were treated on the scene
and 30 others were taken to local hospitals, mostly suffering from
broken bones and bruises.
</P>
<P>
The Port Authority said later no smoke were found on board the
plane, but the incident was under investigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, New Hampshire, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Conservative
Pat Buchanan declared victory Tuesday over Senate Majority leader
Bob Dole in the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
Results of official returns showed that the 57-year-old
conservative Republican commentator seized 28 percent of the vote
and Dole got 26 percent, followed by Lamar Alexander, former
governor of Tennessee, 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton easily won the Democratic
primary in the state as he faced no serious challenge from the
other contenders.
</P>
<P>
While there was no real race in the Democratic primary, public
attention focussed on a week-long close fight in the eight-man
Republican campaign field.
</P>
<P>
Tonight's results were seen as a crushing setback for the
72-year-old political veteran Dole. This was the third time New
Hampshire had voted against his presidential nomination bid.
</P>
<P>
New Hampshire, a state in northeastern part of the country,
with a population of one million and its voters considered
conservative, has played a pivotal role in American politics.
</P>
<P>
Its primary results, though not decisive in determining whom
each party finally selects as its presidential nominee for the
November election, traditionally have considerable influence on
the outcome of primaries in other states scheduled throughout
March and into the spring.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- One hundred and thirty three
people died of malaria in Zimbabwe between January and the first
week of this month.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health and Child Welfare Timothy Stamps said
yesterday that the government was ready with adequate stocks of
malaria treatment tablets. ''We encourage clinical diagnosis as
it is better to take malaria tablets for flu than take flu
tablets for malaria.''
</P>
<P>
He added that the current recommendation for malaria treatment
was chloroquine as the first line treatment. But if there was no
response within 24 hours, cases should be referred to the nearest
medical center. He urged people in urban areas traveling to
rural areas to take precautions as they were the most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
The ministry of health and child welfare has warned the public
that malaria cases are on the increase and will continue to
increase during the current season.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Russia Launch Nuclear Power Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Russia have quietly
launched construction of a 1,000 megawatt nuclear power plant in
northern Persian Gulf this month despite strong opposition from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source told Xinhua today that there are
over 600 Russian engineers in the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant
and some facilities for the project will be delivered soon.
</P>
<P>
The source said, on condition of anonymity, that the Iranian
authorities have paid 150 million U.S. dollars to Russia
for the one billion dollar nuclear project, which was left
unfinished by a German company.
</P>
<P>
Georgy Matchitidze, counselor of Russian Embassy in Tehran,
had earlier told Xinhua that the nuclear power project was
postponed from last December to this year because of two
reasons: money problem in Iran and elections in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The senior Russian diplomat said that Iran had extended
only 60 million U.S. dollars to Russia for the cost of
feasibility study for the project.
</P>
<P>
"We should need at least 50 million U.S. dollars more to
start construction of the project because we have to purchase
equipment and related facilities of the plant," he added.
</P>
<P>
So, it is apparent that Russia has satisfied with the
payment made by the Iranian side. Iranian authorities regards
the nuclear power project as a political project to thwart
U.S. economic embargo against the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Tehran has to meet the demands raised by the Russian side
despite economic hardships and growing foreign debt problems.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Iran had opened two letters of credit involving
80 million U.S. dollars on the nuclear power plant to be built by
Russian specialists in Bushehr.
</P>
<P>
Russian diplomats said that in accordance with the contract
between the two countries, the first phase of the power plant
would be put into operation by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Russia will help Iran complete the
Bushehr nuclear power plant in southern Iran by supplying
equipment and facilities as well as raw materials such as fuel
for operation.
</P>
<P>
Russia is to supply fuel worth 30 million dollars to the
power plant and get back the fuel wastes from 2001 to 2011.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Annual GDP Growth Rate Targeted At 6.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's annual GDP growth
rate is targeted to reach at least 6.5 percent for the financial
year ending june 1996, the local daily ''the New Vision''
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is a drop from a growth rate of 10 percent of the
previous year, but by international standards, this has been
described as very good, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the head of a visiting International Monetary Fund
(IMF) mid-term review mission, Robert Sharer as saying that in
recognition of this situation, the IMF will soon disburse another
30 million US dollars under the enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
The amount of money is the second half of a 60 million dollar
ESAF program negotiated with the Ugandan government and approved
in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, Sharer said there is a long way for Uganda to go
because the country's economy is still fragile.
</P>
<P>
He told the paper on Tuesday that Uganda's current growth
should be measured against recovery from a very low base.

<HEADLINE> Tranquillity Prevails in Qatar After Aborted Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Qatar is calm today after a
coup has been thwarted.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources in Qatar's capital Doha told Xinhua that
activities are normal as usual after the coup was foiled Tuesday,
the first day of Muslim's Eid al Fitr. Police patrols, however,
have been increased.
</P>
<P>
Qatar's Interior Ministry announced Tuesday that it foiled the
plot and arrested some perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, which was brief, did not say how many were
involved in the coup.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources, however, said that taking part in the
coup were seven officers as well as 40 soldiers and policemen, all
of whom were arrested except for two who fled to Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
"Qatar will seek an emergency Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
ministerial council meeting to inform them of the circumstances of
the aborted plot to undermine Qatar's security and stability,"
Qatar' foreign ministry said in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has arrested more than 100 people in connection with the
anti-government plot involving former bodyguards loyal to the
former Amir, a local press report said today.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the persons arrested are members of the personal
army raised by Sheikh Khalifa during his rule," the report
quoted a senior Qatari official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"These people have been trying to undermine the security and
stability of the country with the help of foreign forces and
disgruntled elements," it added. "The interrogation has revealed
that there was a deep conspiracy to destabilize the country in
which some foregin sides are involved."
</P>
<P>
The official Qatar News Agency (QNA) said the Qatari Foreign
Ministry Tuesday informed the ambassadors of the Britain, China,
France, Russia and the United States -- the five permanent
members of the UN Security Council -- of the foiled coup.
</P>
<P>
QNA said Qatar Amir Sheikh Hamad Tuesday received telephone
calls from the leaders of Jordan, Yemen and Kuwait, who expressed
their support to the Qatar's incumbent government.
</P>
<P>
Qatar, a GCC country along with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), produces
400,000 barrels per day of crude oil. It has
the world's third largest gas reserves, after Russia and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, 26, overthrew his father
last June and became Qatar's Amir.

workers in Xiamen are not only conscious in helping the
enterprises to promote their products, but also to improve their
planning and management.
</P>
<P>
The fast growing sector has also been active in conducting
exchanges with its counterparts in Asian countries and in Taiwan

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's police will not
tolerate any form of behavior aimed at disrupting peace before,
during and after the forthcoming Presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri said here yesterday that
Zimbabweans must tolerate each other's views and shun violence.
</P>
<P>
''Everyone yearns for free and fair elections. These can only
be possible in an environment free from violence, harassment, and
intimidation. I would like to appeal to the contesting parties to
conduct themselves in a peaceful and civilized manner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
There should never be an occasion when any contesting party
persuades itself to resort to violence as an instrument of
achieving any of its objectives, he said.
</P>
<P>
''Like any game, there are winners and losers, winners must
celebrate their victory in peace while the losers should accept
defeat with honor,'' said Chihuri adding that all parties should
stick to the rules of the game.
</P>
<P>
Police officers will be deployed in all polling stations with
a view to enforce law and order and ensure that all people
exercise their right of franchise in a peaceful environment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, ''Those who take the law into their own hands
will find themselves in police custody.''
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will hold next presidential elections in March 16 and
17, this year.

<HEADLINE> Deal With India Widens Nepal's Hydropower Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A recent Nepal-India
agreement on electric power trade has widened the prospects for
the development of Nepal's vast hydropower potentials, according
to Water Resources Minister Pashupati Shumsher Rana.
</P>
<P>
On the agreement initialed during Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba's visit to India last week, Rana said the deal would allow
both Nepalese and Indian public and private companies to export or
import electricity to and from each other.
</P>
<P>
He said the new agreement would attract Indian industrialists
together with investors from third countries to invest in Nepal to
help exploit the country's water resources, he told a press
conference here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on power trade would likely help reduce Nepal's
long-standing trade deficit with India.
</P>
<P>
During Deuba's stay in India, he held talks with Indian leaders
on acquiring loans through donor agencies and private sectors for
the development of hydropower projects that had been jointly
agreed upon by Nepal and India, the minister said.

<P>
FUZHOU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Coastal Fujian Province
received 906,400 overseas tourists in 1995, up 7.3 percent over
1994, according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry of the province generated 490 million US
dollars last year, an increase of 8.8 percent over the previous
year, ranking the fourth in the country for seven consecutive
years.
</P>
<P>
The progress was mainly attributed to successful promotion
schemes to attract more foreign, as well as Hongkong and Macao
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The province becomes a more attractive tourist destination now
after it has improved the infrastructural facilities of its major
tourist resorts, such as the Wuyi Mountain, Meizhou and Dongshan
islands, and the Shishi beaches. Last year, the provincial tourist
authorities also conducted inspections of travel agencies and
hotels in a bid to upgrade their services.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Host International Elevator Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- China is planning its first
international elevator exhibition to revitalize its elevator
industry, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
China World Elevator Expo'96 to be held from April 20 to 24
this year in the Beijing International Exhibition Centre, will be
a joint effort of the China National Tendering Center of Machinery
and Electric Equipment under the State Economic and Trade
Commission, the China Elevator Association and the China Council
for the Promotion of International Trade Beijing Sub-Council.
</P>
<P>
With expansion of foreign exchanges and the growth of national
economy, the domestic demand for offices, residential housing and
service facilities has been growing fast.
</P>
<P>
The demand has inevitably led to the sound and speedy
development of the construction industry, according to Qi Zemin,
deputy director of the China National Tendering Centre of
Machinery and Electric Equipment.
</P>
<P>
The number of the projects under construction in China accounts
for one-forth of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the demand for elevators will increase
more than 10 percent annually in China in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's 123 elevator producers manufactured
about 30,000 elevators and escalators, about 20,000 more than in
1990. The output of escalators doubled every year between 1990 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the production increase has fallen behind the growth
in demand, Qi said, adding that about 8,000 elevators were
imported from abroad in the last two years to fill the gap between
the production and demand.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics also show that China imported from abroad
4,290 elevators valued at 393 million US dollars and 1,280
escalators worth 119 million US dollars in the first 11 months of
last year.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Man Arrested on Charges of Attack Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese man arrested as a
member of the Aum Shinri Kyo Cult was being detained in Bangkok,
the Bangkok Post newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Keijiro Ota, 51, was arrested as he stepped off an
air-conditioned bus from Chiang Rai, northern Thailand, at a bus
terminal in Bangkok, on Monday evening, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Police claimed Ota was linked to a plot to attack leaders at
the Asia-Europe meeting on March 1-2.
</P>
<P>
Ota denied any link to the cult, saying he was merely a
tourist.
</P>
<P>
Thai Immigration Police Bureau Commissioner Kiatisak Praphawat
said the police believed a letter found on Ota contained secret
codes used among members of the sect.
</P>
<P>
The letter, dated February 16, read: "please send Ms Kawai back
home to her parents in Japan. I have found her.'
</P>
<P>
Police were trying to decode the letter, said Kiatisak.
</P>
<P>
Thai Police Director-General Pote Boonyachinda said the arrest
of Ota proved the Thai police are paying serious attention to
maintaining security for leaders of the 25 Asian and European
countries who are expected to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
Pote said cult members carried handcuffs, which were a symbol
of death. The police have a list of 18 cult members and Ota was
the first arrested, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the police were checking information that terrorists of
other countries also planned to come to Thailand posing as
tourists.

<HEADLINE> Juppe Stresses Importance of Single European Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Declaring that "Currency is
politics," French Prime Minister Alain Juppe today reiterated
France's determination to realize the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
"The economic and monetary union is neither a technical issue,
nor an economic demand," Juppe noted at a debate on the European
economic and monetary union in the National Assembly. "It is
firstly and mainly a political plan for us."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that such a political plan concerns the future
of France and Germany, as well as the future role which the
European countries will play in the world.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the introduction of a single currency will be a
great contribution to the unity of an expanded European Union (EU),
Juppe reiterated France's commitment to the timetable and criteria
of the single currency system set in the Maastricht treaty, under
which the single European currency, recently named Euro, will be
realized by January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
At present, qualms about a single currency still exist in
France and many other EU member countries as some economists fear
that a single currency means a country's loss of financial
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Many people worry that the tough budgetary criteria for the
single currency will cause rising unemployment and worsening
social welfare.
</P>
<P>
In view of these confusions, Juppe gave a clear-cut answer by
saying in the speech that only a single currency can guarantee
currency stability, which means "lower interest rates, sustained
economic growth and good prospects of employment."
</P>
<P>
Juppe demanded French leaders make efforts to eliminate the
confusions.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Yeltsin Gets Cautious Backing from Kohl  (by Zhang Tiegang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 21 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin gained
cautious support from his "dear friend," visiting German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, for his bid to win a second term in the
June election.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, 65, the first Western leader received by Yeltsin after he
declared his presidential candidacy in his home town,
Yekaterinburg last Thursday, made it quite clear after his
150-minute talks with Yeltsin here Monday that he favored success
for the Russian leader.
</P>
<P>
"It is not my business to interfere in the presidential
election campaign in Russia," he said. "But as chancellor of
Germany, I want to welcome once again the link between Yeltsin's
determination to be re-elected and his willingness to continue
economic reforms."
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who arrived here Sunday night, also visited
St. Petersburg, the second largest city in Russia, before
returning to Bonn on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During his busy Moscow trip, he also met with Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
and speakers of both the lower and upper houses of the Russian
parliament, Gennady Seleznyov and Yegor Stroyev, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although no major agreements were signed during his three-day
official visit, the trip itself demonstrated support from the West
for Yeltsin, who is facing a strong challenge from the Communists
in running for the presidency in the June 16 polls.
</P>
<P>
In last December's parliamentary elections, the Communist Party
of the Russian Federation won 157 of the 450-seat State Duma, the
lower house of the parliament, and later the position of Duma
speaker.
</P>
<P>
"It (Kohl's visit) is a recognition of his (Yeltsin's) status
as an international statesman -- a status that none of his rivals
can boast," said an anonymous Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev, speaker of the Federation Council, the upper house of
the parliament, said on Tuesday that Kohl is an experienced and
one of the most gifted politicians in the world, and his visit can
support anyone.
</P>
<P>
"Far from everybody in Germany backed Kohl's visit to Moscow,"
Foreign Minister Primakov pointed out on the same day. "But the
timing of the trip and the visit itself underscore Helmut Kohl's
support to President Boris Yeltsin in his election campaign."
</P>
<P>
Other sources said Kohl's meeting with Yeltsin also touched on
the issue of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO)
planned eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
"We (Russians) say firmly and toughly that we are against the
expansion of NATO toward Russia's borders," Yeltsin said. "Helmut,
my dear friend, he thinks that for now this problem needs to be
postponed for a long time and not talked about at the moment."
</P>
<P>
Kohl, while insisting that Russia had no right of veto over the
NATO's admission of new members, said Russia's security concerns

<HEADLINE> Cost of Food Imports Rises in 1995, Report Predicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The low-income countries will
spend 3 billion U.S. dollars more on food imports in the 1995
production year, a quarter more than 1994, the U.N. Food and
Agricultural Organization (FAO) said.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report on the global food situation, released
here today, the FAO said this is due to the continuing decline of
global food reserves and a rise in price.
</P>
<P>
It predicts that the world food output will total 1.89 billion
tons, 3 percent less than the 1994 production season.
</P>
<P>
There will be 546 million tons of wheat produced in the world,
3.8 percent more than 1994. Rice output will also rise by 1.6
percent over the previous year to reach 548 million tons.
</P>
<P>
But the whole world will produce a total of 797 million tons of
coarse grain in the year, 10.6 percent less than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The FAO report said that by the end of the 1995 production
year, world food supplies will decrease by 15.4 million tons to
267 million tons, which the organization said is far below the
safety level of world food supply.
</P>
<P>
The decline of food supplies will further boost the climbing
prices on the market and worsen the financial situation of those
low-income nations struck by food shortage.
</P>
<P>
American corn was sold at a price of 157 dollars a ton in
November, 48 percent higher than a year earlier. Prices of
Argentine wheat and corn in January also climbed 73 percent and 51
percent from those of 12 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, total world food aid will fall to the lowest level
in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The FAO estimated the world food trade volume at 201 million
tons in the 1995 production year. More wheat will be traded during
the year, while the amount of coarse grain and rice traded will
remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The organization said the developing nations, which import
three quarters of world food, will buy more in the year.
</P>
<P>
To meet demand, world food output must increase by at least 4
percent in the next season, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Joint Police Patrol Mostar After Initial Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 20 (Xinhua) -- After initial delay and a fighting
incident, a European-led joint police force on Tuesday began
patrolling Mostar and restoring freedom of movement to the war-torn
Bosnian city.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between Muslims and Croats in Rome
over the weekend, joint patrol was scheduled to start at noon time
on Tuesday. But it was delayed for two hours due to objection from
the Croat side.
</P>
<P>
The joint police patrol, involving West European Union,
Croatian and Bosnian policemen, as well as local Muslim and Croat
police, started following a meeting among EU Administrator of the
city Hans Koschnick, Croatian Interior Minister Ivan Jarnjak and
Bosnian Federation Interior Minister Avdo Hebib.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, trouble erupted when a car
from the Muslim side was attacked by Croats, who beat the driver
and forced the passengers to run back into the Muslims-controlled
east side of the city.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Drop Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE) slid with bonds for the fourth straight session
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Investors sold shares to secure profits from a faltering rally
as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made a typically
cautious assessment of the economy in his report to the Congress
that failed to renew confidence, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, which cracked the 5,600-mark
for the first time just last week, plunged 44.79 points to
5,458.53.
</P>
<P>
The well-known barometer of blue-chip companies has now shed
more than 140 points from a 500-point march that started in late
January.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan did not rule out further interest rate cuts to ensure
continued growth, but his comments apparently weren't soothing
enough to calm jitters about interest rates, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year Treasury bond lost nearly 2 points in price while
its interest rate rose to almost 6.4 percent, a four-month high.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 4 to 1, where
volume totaled 395.02 million shares, down from 432.38 million on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 3.92 to 342.27. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 7.33 to 640.65. The Nasdaq composite index
fell 7.47 to 1,083.24. The American Stock Exchange's market value
index fell 3.32 to 558.52.
</P>
<P>
Analysts were hardly surprised to see financial markets falter
again after a broad advance spurred largely by record flows of
investor money into mutual funds and optimism for another cut in
interest rates.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indian hockey squad was
under investigation by the Federation Internationale de Hockey for
the alleged fraud in its Olympic qualifier, local reports said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Skipper Pargat Singh was one of six Indian players who accepted
money to play a fixed scoreless game against Malaysia, and a drew
between the two last month in Barcelona denied Canada its entry in
the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The allegation was made by Canada who demaned the two countries
be barred from the Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Canadian officials alleged that India which qualified for the
Olympics in advance, played a "fixed" game to help Malaysia earn
its Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia needed only one point to overtake Canada in the tally
for its Olympic outing.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Singh, the other five investigated were Mukesh
Kumar, Sanjeev Kumar, Harpreet Singh, Baljit Singh Saini and
Baljit Singh Dhillon, the Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
All the six were summoned to New Delhi to answer the charges.

<HEADLINE> Snowstorms Blast Europe From Sweden to Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Freak snowstorms and sub-zero
temperatures swept Europe from Sweden to Spain today, plunging
transport into chaos, triggering power cuts, closing schools and
claiming lives.
</P>
<P>
As many usually temperate countries battled Arctic conditions,
weather forecasters said more heavy snows were in store across
much of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Hardest-hit Britain was reeling from a night-long blizzard and
freezing temperatures of below 15 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
Many roads were blocked by snowdrifts, some up to two deep,
toward the end of one of the worst winters on record.
</P>
<P>
The Channel tunnel was temporarily closed to tour buses this
afternoon, while transport lorries were subject to a slowdown due
to signaling problems caused by cold weather, a spokesman for
operator Eurotunnel said.
</P>
<P>
Some 14,000 households were left without power supplies in
Lincolnshire, while residents in Dover had to be evacuated from
their flooded coastal homes.
</P>
<P>
Snow and ice enveloped much of France, disrupting flights at
Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports near Paris. Traffic was held
up in the ports of Dunkirk and Dieppe and on roads, and three
people died in a collision in the Oise region north of Paris.
</P>
<P>
Flights were temporarily suspended at Poland's international
Okecie airport in Warsaw after heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
In northern Germany, snowstorms sowed chaos. A collision
between a car and a school bus at Versmold in the west left one
dead and six injured, including four children.
</P>
<P>
In Switzerland, the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research
warned of a serious danger of further avalanches in areas affected
by fresh snow. Three men were killed in avalanches on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the Netherlands, snowstorms caused 115 kilometers of traffic
jams across the country and one deadly accident, police said. In
the north, many schools remained closed and train services were
subject to delays.
</P>
<P>
The picture in Belgium was similar, but no serious accidents
have been reported so far. The secondary road network was the
worst hit, while major motorways were relatively unaffected.
</P>
<P>
Bad weather in Denmark, which is suffering its worst winter in
a decade, forced the shutdown of the parliament as many MPs could
not reach Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since World War II that bad weather has
forced the assembly to close down and police have implemented a
snow disaster plan for the first time since 1979.
</P>
<P>
Hit by their heaviest snowfall in 25 years were south and
central Jutland in western Denmark and the easternmost Baltic
island of Bornholm, with snowbound motorways and many
kindergartens and schools closed.
</P>
<P>
Southern Sweden, which usually escapes the worst wintry
weather, was also bombarded by blizzards on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Only parts of the Iberian peninsula -- Portugal and southern
Spain -- as well as southern Italy were spared the ravages of
inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow in the northern half of Spain blocked roads and
mountain passes and cut off isolated villages while in Venice,
Italy, Saint Mark's Square was under 30 centimeters of water.

obstacle for strengthening the ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is in Mexico on a two-day visit, said that
Brazil and Mexico may sign a free trade agreement to increase the

The visiting president made the remarks during the breakfast

</P>
<P>
On the economic adjustments in Brazil, Cardoso said that the
adjustments should be carried out without affecting the living
standard of ordinary bread earners.
</P>
<P>
In response, Larios said that the continent tried to form a
free market 30 years ago, but the efforts failed because of
protectionist policies.
</P>
<P>
The conditions are ripe now for the development of a long-term
continental market with Mexico and Brazil enjoying great
possibilities of being trade leaders, Larios added.

<HEADLINE> Impoverished Farmers Finding Better Lives (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The relief by relocation program was started in the late 1980s
in Dingxi, Hexi and Xihaigu, in northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region and in Gansu Province, which are known for their
poverty. In 1995, farmers in those areas earned around 800 yuan
per capita, which was the national average.
</P>
<P>
Guo said their new homes are mostly located on the banks of
rivers with enough farmland and few people. The central government
provides funds for large irrigation and land reclamation
projects. The government also supplies farmers with subsidies to
help farmers with construction work, tree planting, and land
reclamation.
</P>
<P>
He said that local farmers volunteer for the resettlement
programs because of such preferential policies such as agriculture
tax exemptions, displacement funds, and maintaining contracts on
land left behind. Nearly 10 billion yuan in poverty-relief funds
has been set aside by the central government each year, official
sources say.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Xinzhuangzi Village in Ningxia's Tongxin County,
each farmer in the new village has a third of a hectare of
irrigated land. With new irrigation and farming technology and
machines, the village produced 804,000 kilograms of grain in 1995,
or 800 kilograms for each farmer.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, we were often plagued with acute shortages of
food, clothing, and firewood. Today, we have everything," said a
60-year-old farmer on a state farm in Hepu County, in southwest
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, another typical new
village. The old man said that he had moved from nearby Dongshan
County with 400 other families.
</P>
<P>
In the past, each farmer in the village earned a mere 200 yuan,
said Tan Yougan, deputy head of the state farm, who explained that
226 of 400 households now earn 2,000 yuan and 28 households make
10,000 yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
The new form of poverty relief has come to be accepted by more
provinces and autonomous regions. Some experts hail it as "a
breakthrough and method for China's poverty relief work."
Economists also refer to it as "ecological resettlement" and "the
most stable and efficient way to help Chinese farmers escape
poverty." A number of prosperous provinces and municipalities such
as Guangdong, Zhejiang and Beijing also use the method to help
poor areas find relief from poverty.
</P>
<P>
As part of China's effort to help 70 million impoverished
people, it plans to put four billion yuan into poverty relief
construction materials this year.
</P>
<P>
Guo Xing said the Chinese government has decided to help all
5.5 million people suffering from the worst hunger, in mountainous
areas in the northwest and southwest especially, to move.

<P>
YINCHUAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- In a large bazaar at
Xinzhuangzi Village in Tongxin County, in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, muslims returning from the mosque
are busy shopping, while in courtyards decorated for the Spring
Festival, housewives can be seen cooking mutton and baking.
</P>
<P>
Today marks the end of the muslim holiday of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Seven or eight years ago, however, these could be seen going
from door to door begging instead of enjoying the festival at
Yaoshan Village, their original home. At that time about 300
households left their original home village and resettled at
Xinzhuangzi Village to try to find a better life.
</P>
<P>
"Without the government's help, we would still be suffering
from poverty," said Ma Zihai, who is busy loading baskets of food
and other items from the bazaar onto a nearby tractor.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, my family could not make ends meet even though we
worked hard all year round. Today, in addition to farming, we make
some 30,000 yuan a year from the tractor," said Ma, a member of
the Hui, or moslem, ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
The village is only one of the many villages in China that have
found a way out of poverty by relocating. For the past eight
years, more than 900,000 Chinese farmers have moved from their
original villages built on rocky slopes, in deserts, or in karst
areas, resettling in new homes with better farming and living
conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to Guo Xing, an official with the Poverty-Relief
Office of the State Council, a majority of China's 70 million
farmers who still lack adequate food and clothing live in dry
hilly areas of Ningxia, Gansu, and Shanxi, or in karst areas in
Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Zhejiang, and Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 30 years, he said, China has supplied these areas
with large amounts of food, clothing, and relief supplies. Over
three billion kilograms of grain were sold back at lower prices to
330 mountainous counties each year. Still their lives did not
change a great deal.
</P>
<P>
So, to ease the situation, the Chinese government changed from
merely providing relief funds and supplies to helping them
relocate in better areas so that they could support themselves by
agriculture.

MADRID, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Mario Reiter of Austria became
the fastest in both slalom legs on Tuesday night to take the lead
in the men's combined event in the World Alpine Ski Championship
in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian finished at an aggregate of 1:36.57, with an
advantage of 2.42 seconds over runner-up Marc Girardelli of
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Yves Dimier of France was third, clocking 1:39.42.
</P>
<P>
As the downhill slated for Wednesday, veteran Girardelli was
tipped to win the combined medal with his experience although
Reiter had his edge of age as a young challenger.
</P>
<P>
Lasse Kjus of Norway, world champion and combined Olympic gold
medallist, was far away to defend his title as he finished at
ninth place after the slalom.
</P>
<P>
The downhill, scheduled for Tuesday, was delayed for Wednesday
morning due to stormy weather.

GENEVA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Samantha Riley of Australia can
swim at the Atlanta Olympic Games despite of her positive test of
dextropropoxyphen, FINA said on Tuesday in Lausanne, Switzerland.

Yet, coach Scott Volkers would be banned for two years instead
for his prescription of the banned pain-killer, the sport's world

Riley, world champion in both 100 and 200 meters, failed the
test at the World shortcourse championships in Rio de Janeiro last
November.
</P>
<P>
In casting its ruling, FINA explained that "we decided to
sanction her with a strong warning, as the consequences of any
other decision would not be in proportion to the fault committed
by the swimmer."

<HEADLINE> US Economy "Basically on Track," Greenspan says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
Chairman Alan Greenspan today said the nation's economy is
"basically on track for sustained growth" and he did not rule out
a further interest rate cut to ensure continued growth.
</P>
<P>
In his semiannual report to Congress, Greenspan cited a number
of factors acting as a drag on economic growth. But he said most
are temporary and "a number of fundamentals point to an economy
basically on track."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the Fed has recently cut interest rates because
"evidence suggested sufficient risk of subpar performance going
forward to warrant another slight easing of the stance of monetary
policy."
</P>
<P>
He described the small cuts -- a quarter percentage point in
December and another quarter point in January -- as "monetary
policy insurance."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said nothing explicit about a future cut of the
interest rate, but many private economists expect the Fed to order
another quarter point cut in March.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said inflation has been "well contained" over the
past five years and should remain at or under 3 percent this year
despite the recent interest-rate cut.
</P>
<P>
In deciding on future rate cuts, the "goals of containing
inflation in the near term and moving over time toward price
stability... will continue to guide us in the period ahead,"
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
He and other Fed policy-makers are predicting economic growth
of between 2 percent and 2.25 percent this year -- up from between
1.5 percent and 1.6 percent last year -- and an unemployment rate
hovering between 5.5 and 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Indirectly answering President bill Clinton and other critics
who contend the economy can grow appreciably faster, Greenspan
said that the 3.5 percent growth in 1994 was clearly too much.

ATHENS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind started his one-day visit to Greece this evening
by holding talks with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis and
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind, the first senior Western official to visit the country
following the recent Imia Islet crisis in the eastern Aegean, told
the press that relations between Athens and Ankara were discussed
during the talks.
</P>
<P>
"Direct talks are the only way the two nations can achieve a
harmonic relationship," Rifkind said. However, he added,
particular differences exist and both countries must decide on the
best method for their resolution.
</P>
<P>
Greece has so far refused to hold talks with Turkey by arguing
that the sovereignty over the Imia Island "is not negotiable."
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary arrived here this afternoon
after making stops in the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana and
Sarajevo, Bosnia. He is expected to leave for Tirana, Albania,
Wednesday.

WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher today said there had been "good compliance"
with the Bosnian peace agreement and reaffirmed President
Clinton's plan to withdraw U.S. troops by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, who reviewed NATO peace
enforcement in Bosnia with Christopher here today, told a news
conference that according to ground commanders, cooperation among
the ethnic parties was "in general terms, very good," though he
predicted "bumps in the road" in enforcing the peace settlement
reached in Dayton last November with U.S. mediation.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very complicated operation," he admitted. "We will be
overcoming all the bumps on the road" at year's end.
</P>
<P>
Christopher stressed that President Clinton will not reconsider
his decision to withdraw all American troops by the end of 1996. A
longer stay "could be an excuse for the parties to not get into
compliance," he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Recommends Standby Force for Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has proposed that a standby multinational
force for humanitarian intervention be established for Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali said he made the proposal to the Security Council
in the conviction that, whatever the criteria -- political,
security, humanitarian or economic -- the situation in that
country is desperately serious.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report on the situation in Burundi available to
reporters today, the secretary-general said the proposed
multinational force would be established under Chapter VII of the
Charter of the United Nations and led by one member state.
</P>
<P>
Under a worst-case scenario, he said, it is estimated that the
force would require up to five brigade groups, representing a
total of 25,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
To test whether the proposal really works, Boutros-Ghali called
for consultations by a group of countries with proven rapid
deployment capability, including some African countries.
</P>
<P>
"The aim would be for the countries concerned to earmark
contingents for participation in the multinational force that
would remain in their respective home countries but would be fully
trained and equipped, so as to be ready for deployment at very
short notice," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the secretary-general, the seriousness of the
political and security situation in Burundi is defined by
"visceral fears and brutal struggles for power."
</P>
<P>
Much of the Tutsi minority, historically dominant, lives with
the phobia of its physical elimination, while the Hutu majority
demands proper political representation.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 genocide in Rwanda has heightened the fears of the
minority, leading extremist elements to undertake ruthless actions
against Hutu populations.
</P>
<P>
Hutu extremists, in turn, are reinforced and supported from
outside that country by some of the perpetrators of the Rwandan
genocide.

<HEADLINE> IFOR General Meets with Serb Military Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the NATO-led
peace Implementation Force (IFOR) ground troops General Michael
Walker held talks with Bosnian Serb Army deputy commander Zdravko
Tolimir in the Serb stronghold of Pale today.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Tolimir demanded that the IFOR troops treat
all previously warring sides equally from now on, the Tanjug news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which practically helped resume the official
contacts between the Bosnian Serb Army and the IFOR, focused on
the further implementation of the Dayton peace agreement. The Serb
side had suspended all contacts with the IFOR and the Muslim-Croat
federation in protest against the arrests and indictment to the
Hague of its two senior officers.
</P>
<P>
Tolimir failed to attend a meeting Monday with military
representatives of the Bosnian Muslims and Croats and with IFOR
commanders.
</P>
<P>
During the talks today, the Serb commander explained why he was
absent from Monday's meeting. The absence was not a protest, he
said. He added that the Serb side had been informed too late and
that bad weather had prevented the Serbs from sending their
representative to the meeting on the USS aircraft carrier Jeorge
Washington on the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
Tolimir told reporters after the meeting that he had spoken
about the unjustified arrest of senior Serb officers and the
"forceful penetration" the IFOR into the Serb army barracks.
</P>
<P>
"I pointed out the intrusion of the IFOR into the Bosnian Serb
Army barracks in Han Pjesak, which is outside the separation zone,
and recalled its obligation to influence the release of Serb
officers and soldiers captured in IFOR-controlled zones," Tanjug
quoted Tolimir as saying.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR said on Sunday that the U.S. IFOR troops on Saturday
"inspected" heavy weapons in two Serb military bases in Bosnia --
Han Pjesak and Han Kram.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Scarcity Worsens In Lagos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The problem of fuel scarcity
worsened in Lagos today, the last day of the two-day Eid-el-Fitri
holiday.
</P>
<P>
Longer queues of vehicles appeared at the few filling stations
which had some stocks of petroleum products, while a majority of
the stations remained closed.
</P>
<P>
Busy station attendants said they were selling fuel from their
last stocks.
</P>
<P>
An angry motorist claimed that he had bought four liters of
petrol for 70 Naira (0.88 U.S. dollar) instead of the official
fixed price, 44 Naira (0.52 dollar).
</P>
<P>
Because of the fuel scarcity, people who planned to spend the
holidays outside their homes had been stranded. Some commuters
had to stand for hours at bus stops, while operators of
commercial vehicles hiked fares arbitrarily.
</P>
<P>
Lagos, the largest city in Nigeria, has been hit by fuel
shortages for several days.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources attributed the shortages to panic buying
and hoarding occasioned by the fear that the pump price of fuel
might be hiked by the government.
</P>
<P>
However, the government did not announce any fuel price hikes
in its 1996 budget made public on February 15.

<HEADLINE> (updated)Two Killed as Freight Train Derails in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A freight train carrying
chemicals derailed in western U.S. today, killing two crew members
and spilling sulphuric acid.
</P>
<P>
The 82-car freight train jumped tracks in the Rocky Mountains
north of Leadville, Colorado, before six a.m. near Tennessee Pass,
a major mountain pass at more than 10,400 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
Two engineers on the train were killed and a third crew member
was injured and taken to hospital, said Mike Furtney, a spokesman
for the freight train company Southern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said both engines and 25 cars derailed. Two
tank cars containing about 27,000 gallons of sulphuric acid broke
open and spilled the highly caustic liquid onto a major highway.
</P>
<P>
The highway was closed and crews specializing in cleaning up
hazardous materials were rushed to the scene.
</P>
<P>
The train was traveling from East St. Louis, Illinois, to
Roseville, California, when it jumped tracks.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident was not immediately known, but heavy
snowfall was reported throughout the region overnight.
</P>
<P>
This was the fifth major train accident in the country this
month. In the four previous accidents, a total of 16 crew members
and passengers were killed.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Emir Receives Ruling Family Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani today received members of the ruling family,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Emir Sheikh Hamad briefed the family members on the details of
the foiled conspiracy to disrupt security and stability in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem al-Thani has
accused former Qatari Emir Sheikh Khalifa Bin Hamad al-Thani of
involvement in the recent conspiracy targeting the life of Emir
Sheikh Hamad, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the former emir had been assisted by
some foreign powers in the attempt. But he did not identify these
countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Qatar and the U.S. will hold joint military wargames
in accordance with a joint defense agreement between the two
countries, a Defense Ministry official source was quoted by the
Qatari News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The source said the maneuvers aim at enhancing the joint
defense capability of the two countries' armed forces.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency did not mention either the date or the
period of the drills.
</P>
<P>
Qatar is calm and activities are normal as usual today after an
official announcement Tuesday that a coup was foiled. Police
patrols, however, have been increased.
</P>
<P>
Qatar's Interior Ministry announced Tuesday that it foiled the
plot and arrested some perpetrators. More than 100 people have
been arrested in connection with the anti-government plot
involving former bodyguards loyal to the former emir.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the persons arrested are members of the personal army
raised by Sheikh Khalifa during his rule," a senior Qatari
official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Emir Sheikh Hamad overthrew the former emir, his father, last
June and became Qatar's emir.

<HEADLINE> Major Says UK Will Play Leading Role in Europe-Asia  Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major said today that the forthcoming Asia-Europe summit in
Bangkok is an important step to expand practical co-operation
between the two continents and Britain will play a leading role in
this new cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Royal Society for Asian Affairs, Major said
that the economic progress in Asia in recent years and the future
potential there are startling.
</P>
<P>
Asia's share of world imports and exports has overtaken that of
North America, and average growth rates there are twice those of
developed countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asia's GDP should rise from a fourth to a third of the world's
total over the next 15 years, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
He said that Asia's economic success offers Europe new
commercial opportunities and Europe must keep it open for new
cooperation with Asia.
</P>
<P>
Asia and Europe can work together not only to strengthen the
world economy, but to promote global stability as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will work with Asian partners on this shared agenda between
now and a second Asia-Europe meeting in Britain in 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting two specific areas of British interest in Asia,
Major said that a partnership with Japan is the key point in
Britain's developing ties with Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
A second area of key British interest is Hong Kong and China.
he said, "Our political, moral and economic commitment to Hong
Kong will remain a key element in our engagement in Asia well into
the third millenniem," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that Britain is committed to a policy of
closer engagement with China on a wide range of matters.
</P>
<P>
"That is not only in Britain and China's interest, it is also
overwhelmingly in Hong Kong's interest," he said.
