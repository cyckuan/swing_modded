<HEADLINE> Thailand's Premiership Front-runner Lines out Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Thaksin Shinawatra, major rival
of incumbent Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai for the next
premiership, lined out his policies here Tuesday, pledging to
create a sustainable farm sector if his party wins power.
</P>
<P>
"First and foremost, we must repair the foundation of the farm
sector. This is critical to any economic recovery program," the
telecom tycoon-turned-politician told an annual economic review
forum.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 60 percent of the Thai people are farmers, he said,
"there can be no sustainable prosperity for all without the
prosperity of farmers."
</P>
<P>
Thaksin's two-year-old Thai Rak Thai (Thai Love Thai) Party is
expected to be front runner in the coming general elections which
must be held by November.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin said his party has worked out an elaborate program to
revive and promote Thailand's agricultural diversity, bio-
diversity, geographical uniqueness and multidimensional skills of
the Thai farmers.
</P>
<P>
He would launch a national campaign called "One Tambon (village)
one product", which he said will be the cornerstone of the party's
agricultural strategy.
</P>
<P>
He offered to set up a supplementary debt suspension program
for three years for small farmers, which will enable them to "
restart their crop production without the burden from the past and
will enable them to service their debt in the future".
</P>
<P>
"As long as the farmer is in debt he will not be able to
effectively respond to any creative package that we try to
introduce. We must free him from his debt slavery ..., " the
billionaire politician said.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin also proposed giving each of 70,000 villages in
Thailand one million baht (25,000 U.S. dollars) per year to "help
kickstart production and job creation within the village".
</P>
<P>
He promised to help the poor and the less advantaged, urging to
put priority on facilitating the development of a small and medium
sized enterprises (SMEs) and launch a "micro-credit" lending
system to make life less miserable for the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the current government's efforts to reduce
the non-performing loans (NPLs) were not working, he proposed
setting up a national equity fund which will act as an effective
facilitator to help the creditors and debtors reach agreement to
make viable assets.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin promised the Thai people "a better cabinet" , saying
his cabinet ministers will be diligent, clever, honest, being able
to solve problems and free of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's major English newspaper The Nation projected last
month that the Thai Rak Thai Party should win about 170 seats in
the 500-seat House of Representatives in the next general election,
compared to some 150 seats for Chuan's ruling Democrat Party.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Rak Thai was accused of making financial offers to woo
incumbent parliamentary members of the other parties to join it.
The party has dismissed the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Contempt Petition Filed Against Bangladeshi PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The President of the Bangladeshi
Supreme Court Bar Association Wednesday filed a contempt petition
against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for her recent comments on
judiciary regarding bails of hardened criminals.
</P>
<P>
A High Court Division Bench set August 21 for hearing the
contempt petition after the association chief Barrister Moinul
Hossain along with a group of lawyers filed the petition on behalf
of the association.
</P>
<P>
In her interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation on
July 27, the prime minister held the lawyers and the judges
responsible for the deterioration of law and order situation in
the country and criticized the lawyers for seeking balls of the
terrorists and also the judges for granting them.
</P>
<P>
The contempt petition said the bar association feels deeply
concerned and disturbed by the repeated attacks by the prime
minister in recent days on the higher judiciary.
</P>
<P>
But in a related development, a group of lawyers Wednesday
challenged the authority of the executive committee of the
association to lodge the contempt petition without the approval of
the general meeting of the association.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the association secretary, the lawyers called
for convening a general meeting on the issue, saying that filing
such a petition ignoring the general body, was contrary to the
provisions of the association's constitution and is against the
general practice, convention and tradition of association.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Identifies Optics etc. as New Growth Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The head of Singapore Economic
Development Board (EDB) said here Wednesday that Singapore is
restructuring its industrial base and has identified optics,
alternative fuel systems and automotive electronics as important
areas of growth.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the combined headquarters award presentation
ceremony, EDB Co-Chairman Teo Ming Kian said Singapore is mounting
on efforts to transform itself into a knowledge-based economy by
promoting high value-added and knowledge-intensive industries and
identified important areas of growth in several sub-clusters
within the manufacturing industry, such as optics, alternative
fuel systems and automotive electronics.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the four recipient companies of Singapore's
Business Headquarters (BHQ), Operational Headquarters (OHQ) and
Manufacturing Headquarters (MHQ), Teo said the ceremony clearly
affirm the continued growth of smaller sub-clusters like the
construction and paper industries.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, EDB presented BHQ, OHQ and MHQ awards to
Hanson Pacific, a Britain-based international building materials
company, Pan Asia, the largest newsprint producer in Asia outside
Japan, Shimano, a leading manufacturer in the world in the design
of bicycle components, and Siemens Advanced Engineering which
provides world-class solutions for the automation of electronics
manufacturing processes.
</P>
<P>
Teo said that the principal thrust of EDB's Headquarters
program is to encourage companies to locate their international
headquarters in Singapore and use the island as a decision-making
center to manage their businesses in the Pacific and beyond.
</P>
<P>
The total number of HQ awards recipients has reached 190 since
the program's inception in 1986, he added.
</P>
<P>
Teo underlined that EDB has been heightening efforts in the
attraction of companies, -- both foreign multinational companies
and key players -- to establish their international base in
Singapore, encourage companies to set their manufacturing
facilities here, and also strongly urge them to carry out R&AMP;D
activities and enter into local research institutions as well as
institutions of higher learning that have the expertise to support
their research initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Under EDB's HQ program, a BHQ recipient company, among other
criteria, must have minimum incremental total business spending of
two million Singapore dollars (about 1.18 million U.S. dollars)
and minimum incremental headcount of 15 professionals/ technicians.
The main conditions for OHQ recipient are that the paid capital of
at least half a million Singapore dollars with incremental total
business spending more than two million Singapore dollars. The MHQ
criteria requires the company to be world-class player in a
particular industry with high growth or high value products
manufactured in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The recipients will have the benefits of tax-free flow through
of dividends.

<TEXT>
<P>
Cowpland will stay with Corel as a board member and technology
advisor with the company's 10 percent stake of more than 6.5
million shares.
</P>
<P>
Cowpland denied his resignation was related to charges by the
Ontario Securities Commission with insider trading in October 1999.
</P>
<P>
It was alleged that he sold 2.4 million Corel shares just
before announcing the company wouldn't meet revenue projections.
</P>
<P>
In its last quarter, Corel lost 23.6 million U.S. dollars
because of plunging sales.
</P>
<P>
The company failed in its first two attempts to wrestle
Microsoft in the software-applications space and is still in the
hope that its "third-time lucky" adage rings true with the Linux
operating system on computer desktops.
</P>
<P>
Cowpland, 57, founded the company that began by creating
computer graphics software in 1985.

<P>
XIAMEN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A container ship owned by the
world's third biggest shipping company, Peninsula &AMP; Oriental
Nedlloyd Line, stopped at Xiamen Haicang Harbor today to load 500
containers of clothes, food and arts and crafts on it for a trip
to Britain tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The container ship, with a total capacity of 5,468 TEUs, is the
largest container ship the harbor has ever received, and one of
the five vessels the shipping company employs for new operations
between China and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The new China-Europe route will help shorten the trip from
China to Britain from 27 to 21 days, said Adward Van Dord, a
manager for the company's China operation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the company sent five ships with a loading
capacity of 2,900 containers each to open a direct shipping line
between Xiamen City of Fujian Province, east China, and the west
coast of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The company will increase its business in the shipping market
and improve its services in China, where the economy and trade is
growing rapidly, the manager said, adding that Fujian is a major
part of the Chinese market.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hopes to Enhance Friendship With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Greece hoped Thursday that the
dynamics of its friendship with neighboring Turkey will be
reinforced.
</P>
<P>
One year after a destructive earthquake hit Turkey, Greek
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Panayiotis Beglitis said in a statement
that the August 17 earthquake last year has completely changed the
landscape of the Greek-Turkish relations and has brought the
people of the two countries closer.
</P>
<P>
The reciprocal gesture of the Turkish people toward the Athens
earthquake in September contributed decisively to the shaping of a
new climate in the relations between the two peoples, Beglitis
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this immediate response and mutual sentiments
showed that the two peoples feel they need to take initiatives to
build peace, cooperation and stability in the region and to work
toward Greek-Turkish friendship.
</P>
<P>
This dynamism must be maintained and supported, he said, adding
that the people of the two countries will benefit from their
strengthened cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have nearly gone to war
three times in the past 26 years because of their territorial
disputes over the eastern Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem. But
last year's earthquakes in the two countries brought a thaw in
their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the exchange of visits by their foreign
ministers, the two neighboring countries also held several rounds
of low-level talks and signed a number of cooperation agreements.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also expected to start contacts next
month for a joint bid for hosting the European soccer championship
in 2008.

<HEADLINE> Russian, NATO Officials Discuss Submarine Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian naval officer
said here Thursday that the 118 sailors on board the stricken
Kursk submarine could survive for two more weeks before their
oxygen runs out.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Naval Vice Chief of Staff Alexander Pobozhy, head of a
visiting Russian delegation, told a meeting of NATO delegates that
in an incident some years ago when a Soviet submarine sank,
survivors were found after three weeks.
</P>
<P>
"From our experience with the Soviet submarine forces, it can
be as long as two to three weeks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian and NATO officials held a four-hour meeting at the NATO
headquarters in Brussels to discuss what kind of assistance the
western alliance could offer to help save the 118 crew of a
nuclear submarine trapped on the bed of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
The 14,000-ton Kursk has been stranded about 107 meters below
the Barents Sea since last Saturday after a major disaster --
thought to have been caused by a collision or an explosion.
</P>
<P>
Russian rescue efforts have failed so far and Russia has
accepted offers of help from Britain and Norway on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Britain and Norway are sending personnel to the
accident site. A British rescue submarine and back-up staff were
flown to Norway Wednesday en route to the tragic spot. Norway said
it would send up to 15 divers from its offshore oil and gas
industry.
</P>
<P>
But the rescue submarine and divers are not expected to be in
the position until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
NATO officials said further offers of help could involve rescue
equipment and equipment to deal with the medical aftermath, such
as decompression chambers.
</P>
<P>
World reaction showed that hopes of finding any of the Kursk
crew alive are fading after tapped SOS signals stopped on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
NATO officials said Thursday's meeting between Russians and
NATO delegates in Brussels include a telephone link-up with
British submarine rescue experts in Morthwood, England, and a
wider discussion about the angle at which the Kursk was lying on
the seabed, the water and the weather conditions, and other
organizational and technical matters.

<HEADLINE> White House Angry at Leaked Reports on Clinton Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The White House on Thursday
reacted angrily to leaked reports that independent prosecutor
Robert Ray has convened a new grand jury to decide if President
Bill Clinton should face fresh charges for the Monica Lewinsky
affair.
</P>
<P>
"The timing of this leak reeks to high heaven, but given the
record of the office of the independent counsel, it is not
surprising," White House spokesman Jake Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that the jury will investigate whether
Clinton committed perjury or obstruction of justice by denying an
affair with White House intern Lewinsky during sworn testimony.
</P>
<P>
The leak came just hours before Vice President Al Gore, who has
tried to distance himself from the president's scandal, was to
make a speech to accept the Democratic Party's presidential
candidate nomination at a national convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
In December 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of
Representatives on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice
stemming from his affair with Lewinsky. The Senate acquitted him
in February 1999.

<HEADLINE> Northern Irish Protestant Group Calls for Stopping Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The leader of a political party
linked to Protestant guerrillas in Northern Ireland Thursday
called on the loyalists to stop becoming involved in "tit-for-tat"
sectarian attacks on homes.
</P>
<P>
Gary McMichael of the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP), which is
linked with loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Defense
Association (UDA), made the call at a news conference in Lisburn,
south of the Northern Irish capital of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
He said his party would do all in its power within loyalism to
stop the "spiral of attacks", and called on Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army, to do likewise within
republicanism.
</P>
<P>
McMichael's call followed a series of attacks in recent days on
Catholic and Protestant homes in north Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Windows were smashed and paint splattered at the homes in an
Irish nationalist part of Belfast in the latest round of nightly
violence in Protestant and Catholic neighborhoods that have raised
tensions in the British province.
</P>
<P>
A petrol bomb was also hurled at a Catholic school in
Martinstown in rural Antrim County.
</P>
<P>
McMichael added that his party was working to have a shooting
threat by the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF,
a cover name used by the UDA) withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
The UFF and loyalist splinter organization the Loyalist
Volunteer Force recently issued a threat to shoot anyone found
attacking Protestant homes.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise Broadly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose broadly
Thursday as investors became confident that the technology shares
will have a good performance for the rest of the year despite the
slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 47.25 at 11,055.64 points,
bouncing back from a drop of 58.61 points Wednesday and 109.14
points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 79.67 points at 3,940.87 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 16.22 points at 1,496.07.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rose after telecommunications parts maker Ciena Corp.
announced that its fourth-quarter earnings will beat Wall Street
analysts' expectations because of strong demands for fiber-optic
parts.
</P>
<P>
The announcement gave an across-the-board boost to Internet and
telecom equipment companies. Intel Corp., Applied Materials and
Amtech Systems rose, leading the Nasdaq's advance.
</P>
<P>
The market was hit in the past few days because investors
feared that while a slowing economy will prevent the Federal
Reserve from raising interest rates, it also raises the specter of
lower corporate profits in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Investors were apparently in the buying mood for other reasons
today. The Labor Department reported Thursday that new claims for
unemployment benefits rose for a third straight week, providing
more evidence that the U.S. economy is slowing.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve was widely expected to leave the rates
alone at the policy-making meeting next week. The central bankers
have raised rates six times in the past 14 months in an effort to
cool off the economy and prevent inflation from rising.
</P>
<P>
The Dow's rise came in spite of a selloff in Hewlett-Packard Co.
The computer maker, which is the Dow component, reported
lackluster sales of servers.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 4.94 at 671.19 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 6.47 at 914.55. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 3.72 at 516.46.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,615 up, 1,244 down and 528
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 900.91 million shares from 926.79
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Intensify Efforts to Prevent Attacks on Argentine Jews: Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Thursday that her country will intensify
its efforts to prevent new attacks on Argentina's Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
During the second and last day of her visit to the South
American country, Albright visited the new building of Israel
Argentina Mutual Association (AMIA) and met authorities of the
Israeli main benefit society, which counts with 400,000 people.
</P>
<P>
AMIA's new building was inaugurated in 1999 near to where the
former place was found. The former place was destroyed in 1994 by
an attack that left 86 dead, the worst act against Argentina's
Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
After ending her visit to Argentina, Albright traveled to Chile,
where she is completing a visit as part of her tour of five Latin
American nations.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Major Stock Markets Dip On Telecoms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Europe's major stock markets
closed lower Thursday, with telecom stocks tumbling.
</P>
<P>
A sharp fall in Vodafone weighed on London's FTSE 100, dragging
the index off two-month highs set the previous session as
investors fretted over the multi-billion pounds cost of Germany's
new generation phone auction.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark index slipped 0.2 percent to 6518.2, with gains
for the late-charging banking and financial sector unable to
offset wide losses for major telecom companies.
</P>
<P>
Shares of British Telecom shed 1.3 percent after announcing
plans to take control of the Viag Interkom German mobile phone
joint venture, buying another 45 percent from its partner E. ON
for 6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among London gainers were cruise operator Peninsular &AMP; Oriental
Steam Navigation Co., up 2.1 percent, and Britain's second-biggest
supermarket chain, J. Sainsbury, adding 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The broader FTSE Eurotop 300 index, which is made up of a
basket of Europe's largest companies, fell 0.4 percent, with its
telecom services index dropping 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt dropped 36.84 points, or 0.5 percent,
to 7278.43, with chemical and automotive shares moving lower.
</P>
<P>
The Paris stocks ended lower as France Telecom fell, depressed
by record bidding for Germany's third-generation mobile phone
licenses. The CAC-40 index ended down 0.73 percent or 48.74 points
at 6635.34.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Sub Sunken After Collision With Big Object: Russian Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Ilya Klebanov said Thursday that collision with a big object
caused the Kursk nuclear submarine to sink to the bottom of the
Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov, who leads a government commission probing the
incident, told reporters that the collision resulted in "a
dreadful hole" in the sub and that the disaster "was developing
within two minutes," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles. The vessel can operate autonomously for
up to 120 days, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kursk was participating in exercises of the Russian Northern
Fleet when disaster struck, reportedly on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov said the sub fell to the seabed from a depth of 20
meters. When it struck the sea floor, the submarine received a
second blow.
</P>
<P>
He said there were no signs of internal blast in the sub's
compartments. An explosion inside had been suspected as one of the
possible causes.
</P>
<P>
All efforts to evacuate the 118 submariners aboard the ill-
fated Kursk have so far bore no result, but the rescue operation
is continuing with 22 surface ships at the site of the accident.
</P>
<P>
There have had no banging signals from inside the submarine
from Wednesday, but officials said the crew might be lying low to
conserve oxygen and strength.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said earlier that the oxygen availability aboard
the Kursk could last until Friday, but they later revised that
prediction, saying if the crewmembers minimize their activities
oxygen could last until next week.
</P>
<P>
In live footage from the scene, the RTR television showed
improved weather and calmer seas, but the underwater currents
remain very strong, which, coupled with near-zero visibility, has
hampered the rescue vessels' repeated attempts to dock with sub.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the submarine carries no nuclear weapons and
that the nuclear reactors aboard have already shut down. Radiation
levels are also normal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Interfax quoted Navy spokesman Igor Dyagalo
as saying that the sub is slowly sinking deeper into the seabed,
although the hatches on the submarine, to which rescue capsules
are trying to attach, remain accessible.
</P>
<P>
Four submersible rescue vehicles took turns Thursday at working
deep in the water near the site where the Kursk sank, the Navy
press service said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Russia agreed to enlist help from Britain and
Norway in the rescue bid. It had earlier refrained from seeking
outside assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian vessel "Sea Eagle," with 12 deep-water divers
from a special Defense Ministry unit, is expected to reach the
site Friday evening, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
A second Norwegian vessel carrying the British submarine rescue
craft "LR-5" is also expected to arrive at the scene at about 1 p.
m. Saturday, Interfax said, quoting military sources.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Germany has also offered to send a team of doctors
and decompression chambers to the place where Kursk went down.

<HEADLINE> Barak Implies Consent to Palestinian Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Thursday dropped a strongest-ever hint that Israel will agree
to the Palestinians' plan to declare statehood if they promise to
end their conflict with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Israel's National Military Colleague graduation
ceremony, Barak said clearly he will agree to a Palestinian state,
a political taboo which the prime minister has consistently avoided
touching in the past.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak added, the condition for Israel's consent to
Palestinian statehood will be the Palestinians' announcement of the
final end of the conflict with Israel, and no less than that.
</P>
<P>
He also threatened that if the Palestinians adopts a unilateral
declaration, Israel will also resort to extreme counter-measures,
which will ruin the best ever chances for reaching a peace
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of deterioration would hurt, first and foremost, the
Palestinians themselves," he said, without elaborating on the exact
measures.
</P>
<P>
Israeli legislators suggested in the past that if the
Palestinians take unilateral steps, Israel should annex its
occupied lands in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and block entry of
Palestinian workers and stop trade, which will surely choke the
frail Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
Under a series of interim deals between Israel and the
Palestinians, the two sides should end their final-status talks
this September and then the Palestinians can declare independence.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest effort to reach an accord, the summit talks
between Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President
Bill Clinton at Camp David last month, failed to make good due to
significant gaps between them, especially on the fate of Jerusalem
and the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Arafat has toured world capitals to drum up support
for his plan to declare statehood even without an agreement with
Israel. However, most world leaders reportedly advised him not to
let any stone unturned in the negotiations and choose a more proper
time for declaring a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast special envoy Dennis Ross arrived in Israel
Thursday afternoon and met with Israeli Acting Foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami immediately.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Ben-Ami said the Palestinians should "
substantially" change their "uncompromisable stands" in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is aiming to assess the progress that has been made
since the Camp David talks and explore the idea of holding another
summit to add a final stroke to an agreement, which should be
prepared by lower-level officials in a so-called "pre-summit" in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Ross told reporters before the meeting "Our focus is on ...
making a judgement as to how both sides are working and whether or
not the differences that exist can be overcome."
</P>
<P>
The envoy will meet Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat
late Thursday or Friday. He will meet Barak on Friday.

project for future supply of gas to Mexico, Central America, the

<HEADLINE> France Issues Arrest Warrant Against Ex-Secret Agent Over Elf Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- France on Thursday issued an
international warrant for the arrest of a former secret agent of
an intelligence agency for his suspected role in corrupting German
officials in the purchase of a German refinery by the Elf oil
group in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Judge Renaud Van Ruymbeke, who is in charge of investigating
numerous corruption cases of Elf, issued the warrant for arresting
Pierre Lethier, a former officer of the General Direction of
Exterior Security (DGSE) who is living in Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Lethier is suspected to have accepted 96 million francs (12
million U.S. dollars) in commission from Elf when the oil group
bought the Leuna oil refinery in former Democratic Republic of
Germany, when he served as a middle man in the deal.
</P>
<P>
Another middle man in the deal, German businessman Dieter
Holzer, is also wanted by the French judicial authorities and an
international arrest warrant has also been issued against him by
Judge Ruymbeke.
</P>
<P>
Holzer is suspected to have received 160 million francs (23
million U.S. dollars) in commission from Elf.
</P>
<P>
Lethier and Holzer were accused of paying some government
officials of Germany at that time for agreeing to the deal and
funding the Christian Democratic Union party of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl for its election campaign.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Sub Sunken After Collision With Big Object: Russian Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Ilya Klebanov said Thursday that collision with a big object
caused the Kursk nuclear submarine to sink to the bottom of the
Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov, who leads a government commission probing the
incident, told reporters that the disaster with the sub "was
developing two minutes," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles. The vessel can operate autonomously for
up to 120 days, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
All efforts to evacuate the 118 submariners aboard the ill-
fated Kursk have so far bore no result, but the rescue operation
is continuing with 22 surface ships at the site of the accident.
</P>
<P>
There have had no banging signals from inside the submarine
from Wednesday, but officials said the crew might be trying to
conserve oxygen and strength.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said earlier that the oxygen availability aboard
the Kursk could last until Friday, but they later revised that
prediction, saying if the crewmembers minimize their activities
oxygen could last until next week.
</P>
<P>
In live footage from the scene, the RTR television showed
improved weather and calmer sea, but the underwater currents
remain very strong, which, coupled with near-zero visibility, has
hampered the rescue vessels' repeated attempts to dock with sub.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the submarine carries no nuclear weapons and
that the nuclear reactors aboard have already shut down. Radiation
levels are also normal.
</P>
<P>
Kursk was participating in exercises of the Russian Northern
Fleet when disaster struck, reportedly on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Interfax quoted Navy spokesman Igor Dyagalo
as saying that the sub is slowly sinking deeper into the seabed,
although the hatches on the submarine, to which rescue capsules
are trying to attach, remain accessible.
</P>
<P>
Four submersible rescue vehicles took turns Thursday at working
deep in the water near the site where the Kursk sank, the Navy
press service said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Russia agreed to enlist help from Britain and
Norway in the rescue bid. It had earlier refrained from seeking
outside assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian vessel "Sea Eagle," with 12 deep-water divers
from a special Defense Ministry unit, is expected to reach the
site Friday evening, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
A second Norwegian vessel carrying the British submarine rescue
craft "LR-5" is also expected to arrive at the scene at about 1 p.
m. Saturday, Interfax said, quoting military sources.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Germany has also offered to send a team of doctors
and decompression chambers to the place where Kursk went down.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov did not specify what kind of object that submarine had
hit, but Eduard Baltin, an ex-commander of the Black Sea Fleet,
speculated Wednesday that the Kursk must have collided with a
surface vessel.
</P>
<P>
Baltin said that the Kursk submarine must have been rising to a
periscopic level at between 11:30 a.m. and 11:45 a.m. Moscow time
(0700 and 0745 GMT) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The Kursk is an ocean submarine, whose systems function
perfectly at great depths. But at a depth of 100 meters, the
submarine's hydro-acoustic system may have failed to spot an
approaching surface ship," Baltin said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says No Form of Communication Heard From Russian Sub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said on Thursday
that the United States had not detected any form of communication
from the crew of the sunken Russian Submarine Kursk in the Barents
Sea.
</P>
<P>
"We, the United States, heard no form of communication,"
Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley told reports.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a question that whether the United States
had heard tapping of SOS on the hull of the sunken Kursk as was
reported.
</P>
<P>
Quigley also said the United States had received no request
from Moscow for help in the rescue of the submarine, but said "it'
s never too late."
</P>
<P>
"If the Russians feel that there is something that the United
States or any other nation, for that matter, could provide to
assist in the rescue of the crew member, we're very confident that
they will say so," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll do our very best to provide that. Whatever that might be,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
If requested, it would take a couple of days for a U.S. Navy
deep submergence rescue vehicle to be moved into the position from
its base in San Diego, California.
</P>
<P>
Now a British mini-sub that has been deployed to the Barents
Sea at Russia's request may be better suited for the task of
rescuing the Kursk's crew, Quigley said.

<HEADLINE> Internet Drives Demand for Customer Relationship Management Applications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Renewed focus on winning and
retaining customers has driven the worldwide market for customer
relationship management (CRM) applications, a U.S. market research
firm reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
International Data Corporation (IDC) said that global business
upheaval caused by the Internet is driving companies to reassess
their business strategies and secure customer relationships. This
need is creating enormous opportunities in the market for customer
relationship management applications.
</P>
<P>
The research firm estimated that the worldwide CRM market
jumped 71 percent in 1999, with revenues amounting to 3.3 billion
U.S. dollars. While growth will slow, it will remain solid at an
annual growth rate of almost 30 percent through 2004, bringing the
market to 12.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
CRM is an integrated information system used to plan, schedule
and control the presales and postsales activities in a business.
IDC divides CRM applications into sales automation software,
marketing automation software, and customer support and call
center software.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the sales automation segment was the largest. This
year, the customer support and call center software will become
the largest part of the market. Through 2004, marketing automation
applications will be the fastest-growing segment of the market.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, North America accounted for more than 70 percent of
the worldwide market's revenues. But by 2004, IDC said, the region
's share will have declined to 64 percent. The CRM market in
Western Europe will grow faster than any other region and revenues
there will increase at an annual growth rate of 36 percent.

GAZA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) rejected on Thursday the U.S. warning to U.S. nationals in
the Palestine self-rule areas and Israel against possible
terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
Commander of Palestinian Preventive Security in the West Bank
Jebriel Rayoub told reporters that the statement of the U.S. State
Department on possible terrorist acts against U.S. nationals was
baseless.
</P>
<P>
"I am personally responsible for the security situation in the

safe in the Palestinian territories."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the U.S. State Department warned the U.S.
nationals in the area against using public transportation, saying
that they should be very caution near bus stations and crowded
areas. "There is an increasing possibility of terrorist acts," it
warned.
</P>
<P>
The warning followed the killing of a U.S.-Palestinian in the
West Bank city of Ramallah in a shoot-out with the Israeli forces
on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed, 10 Others Injured in Egypt When Tree Falls on Minibus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and 10
others injured on Thursday when an old and very large tree
collapsed in front of the minibus they were riding on an Egyptian
southern highway, a security official said.
</P>
<P>
The tree suddenly fell onto the front of the minibus, which was
travelling on the road near the village of Aziza Deshna between the
southern towns of Nagaa Hamadi and Qena, the official at the
Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It killed a mother and her child who were sitting in the front
of the minibus, and injured the father, the driver, and the eight
other passengers, the official was quoted as saying by Egypt's
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The injured were hospitalized in the Deshna hospital in Qena,
capital of Qena Governorate, 450 kilometers south of capital Cairo,

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Chief "99 Percent Sure" Flight 990 Downed by Technical Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- EgyptAir Chairman Mohamed Fahim
Rayan said on Thursday he is "99 percent sure" that a technical
problem rather than a suicidal pilot brought down an EgyptAir plane
last October.
</P>
<P>
Rayan told a news conference that he is almost certain that
there is something wrong in the elevator control system, citing as
evidence a Boeing service bulletin earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The elevators are movable panels on the horizontal tail surface
which direct the aircraft's nose up or down.
</P>
<P>
The plane's manufacturer, Boeing Co., urged on Tuesday all
airlines flying the Boeing 767s to perform a special inspection to
ensure the integrity of parts that help move elevators, but said
the stepped-up inspection is not connected to the crash probe.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said last
week it had been unable to conclude what caused the crash of
EgyptAir Flight 990, which was heading for Cairo from New York on
October 31, 1999, when it suddenly plunged into the ocean, killing
all 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
U.S. investigators hinted the relief co-pilot, Gameel el-
Batouti, "brought down the plane in a suicidal act." The Egyptian
side has strongly opposed the speculations, stressing technical
failure might cause the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian and U.S. investigators "were seeking to know exactly
what happened to the EgyptAir plane," Rayan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) "has given
credence to the Egyptian theory" that a prevalent malfunction in
the elevator control system could result in a fatal accident,
referring to FAA's decision to intensify inspection of Boeing 767s'
elevator system.

BUCHAREST, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government has
decided that the scientific research institutes will be included
into universities, the official Rompres news agency Thursday
quoted Education Minister Andrei Marga as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government started this action from three prerequisites,
Marga said, adding that universities are the main suppliers of
scientific research, two thirds of the researchers are with the
universities and the scientific research must be reorganized in
Romania.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ministry had informed the universities about
the list of research institutes to be included into universities.
</P>
<P>
"The solution is rational; it belongs to a real reform and it
is useful for all who are involved. Both the institutes and the
universities will be the beneficiaries of this solution and
eventually, Romania's scientific research will also benefit,"
Marga said.

<P>
PRAGUE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Slovak Education Ministry has
decided that all elementary and secondary schools in the country
will be linked to the Internet by 2003.
</P>
<P>
According to the project, all of Slovak's 3,300 elementary and
secondary schools will have access to the Internet. So far, only
10 percent of the schools have enjoyed it, the Czech News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government will provide schools with required software,
computer literature, scanner and a package of CD-ROMs as well as
teachers.
</P>
<P>
The decision aims to "change the traditional 20th century
school to a creative school," an official from the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
But the lack of money is a big problem blocking the development
of the project. The government should allocate about 1.5 billion
Slovak crowns (32.3 million U.S. dollars) to get such goals. But
for the time being the ministry only gets 90 million Slovak crowns
(1.9 million U.S. dollars) for the project, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Military to Replace Sea King Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian military will
replace its aging fleet of 28 Sea King helicopters over eight
years, Canadian Defense Minister Art Eggleton announced here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Today's announcement demonstrates the government's commitment
to equip its forces for the future," Eggleton said.
</P>
<P>
The replacement is estimated to cost 2.9 billion Canadian
dollars (about 2 billion U.S. dollars) with first aircraft to be
delivered in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Bidding will be managed for a new fleet of versatile
helicopters on missions to patrol, carry cargo and take part in
anti-submarine warfare.
</P>
<P>
The country's Sea King fleet was built in the early 1960s and
is expected to expire between 1998 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports about breakdowns with the fleet since
last year. The most recent incident occurred less than two weeks
ago, when one of the two Sea Kings failed in its operation to land
a boarding team on the GTS Katie, a ship holding nearly 10 percent
Canadian military equipment off the coast of Newfoundland because
of a contract dispute.

According to the plan, which was approved earlier this week by
Prime Minister Atef Obeid, the total cost of the 10-year project is
estimated to amount to 441 million U.S. dollars, said Hassan
Refaat, spokesman of the Suez Canal Authority based in Ismailia at
the center of the canal.
</P>
<P>
The project will be financed entirely by government fund and
canal revenues, Refaat was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The expansion work will increase the width of the Suez Canal
from 345 to 400 meters and its depth from 22 to 25 meters, bringing
in enough water to permit the passage of 92 percent of the existing
commercial ships, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Suez Canal earned 1.868 billion dollars in the 1999-2000
fiscal year, ending on June 30, up 5.8 percent from the year
before, due largely to a revival of business in southeast Asia,
according to the canal authority. The canal is one of Egypt's main
foreign currency earners.
</P>
<P>
By next year, 200,000-ton ships with a draft of 18.9 meters will
be allowed to sail through the international waterway, compared
with 18.29 meters now, Refaat said.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, 250,000-ton ships with a 20.12-meter draft will be able
to use the dock-free canal, followed five years later by 350,000-
ton vessels of a 21.95-meter draft, the limit under an
international environmental agreement that takes effect in 2015.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Should Change Their Attitude Toward Talks: Ben-Ami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Acting Foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami Thursday stressed the Palestinians should "
substantially" change their "uncompromisable stands" in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with U.S. Mideast special envoy Dennis
Ross in his Tel Aviv office, Ben-Ami promised Israel will keep
making efforts to push forward the peace process, according to
Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Ross, the first high-ranking U.S. official visiting Israel and
the Palestinians self-rule areas since last month's Camp David
talks breakdown, arrived in the region Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aimed to assess the progress that has been made
since the Camp David talks and explore the idea of holding a "pre-
summit" to iron out the two sides' differences over core issues
ahead of a concluding summit between top leaders.
</P>
<P>
Hours ahead of the meeting, Ben-Ami told reporters that a second
summit will only take place when Israel is certain that the
Palestinians will show more flexibility in such a summit.
</P>
<P>
"The question of the summit is for the time being not really on
the agenda. What is on the agenda is trying to detect any
meaningful change in the positions on the other side," said Ben-
Ami, who officially resumed the peace talks with two Palestinian
senior negotiators Saeb Erekat and Mohammed Dahlan Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David summit, attended by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, lasted for 15 days in July but failed to reach an
agreement due to significant gaps over the fate of Jerusalem and
the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Israeli negotiation teams accused the Palestinians of adopting
uncompromisable stands on the two issues and rejecting many
sensible proposals during the talks.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration now adopts a more cautious attitude
toward a second summit until signs show that sufficient progress is
made to warrant the summit's success.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami and Palestinian negotiators Erekat and Dahlan reportedly
inclined to holding a "pre-summit" in Washington at the end of this
month or in the beginning of next month.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Jerusalem said such talks, under the guidance of U.
S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, will enhance the
prospects of success at a full-fledged summit later.
</P>
<P>
Ross is scheduled to meet with Barak on Friday before heading
for the Palestinian areas. He will also go on vacation with his
family at an undisclosed location in the region on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Based on his reports, Clinton and Albright will then decide
whether conditions are ripe for a concluding second summit for
reaching a final Israeli-Palestinian accord.
</P>
<P>
A possible date for the proposed second summit is September 4-6,
when Barak, Arafat and Clinton will meet at the U.N.'s Millennium
Summit in New York.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Saving and Credit Bank Hit by Arrears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Commercial operation of the
Angolan Saving and Credit Bank (BPC) has been seriously affected
by the large amount of arrears the local private businesses and
some public enterprises owe to the bank, the official news agency
Angop reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted Paixao Junior, chairman of the BPC
managing board, as saying that the amount of arrears is estimated
at some 80 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking the 9th anniversary of the bank
on August 16, Junior said this situation is "seriously worrying
the BPC managing board" and is a "heel of Achilles" for the
permanent realization of its commercial operation towards desired
growth.
</P>
<P>
There is need to turn the businessmen's debt to the BPC into a
net profit so that the bank gains more capacity to undertake more
businesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
The BPC has sued 40 debtors to seek a coercive charge. The bank
started seeing a decline in 1997, when the institution began to
experience the reflexes of some of its operations due to lack of
liquidity caused by the debtors.
</P>
<P>
"It was in the fourth trimester of 1997 when we did operation
in support for the implementation of some government programs, the
difficulties started thence to rise," said Junior, who refused to
disclose what programs they are.
</P>
<P>
The programs did not go well and the BPC did not get any
interests from the loans, he said.

<HEADLINE> Somalia Expected to Have Top Legislator Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DJIBOUTI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Somalia is possibly to have its
first parliament speaker next week since the country fell into
anarchy in 1991, said Doyen of the assembly Mohamed Abshir Muse
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"After we approved the internal regulations on Saturday, we
will set the deadline for the election of the speaker. Hopefully
by Monday of next week we will have our speaker," Muse told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Following months of preparation, a 245-strong transitional
assembly of Somalia was inaugurated last week in Arta, a summer
resort which is some 45 kilometers away from the capital of
Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
Muse, 74, was elected as temporary speaker of the assembly last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The assembly will hold meetings with various clans in Somalia
to discuss power sharing before the election of the state
president and the formation of the council of ministers, Muse said.
</P>
<P>
According to Muse, participants of the ongoing Somali Peace
Conference that began on May 2 came from all walks of life in
Somalia, even from oppositions.
</P>
<P>
Muse rejected the saying that Hussein Mohamed Aidid, a well-
known warlord in southern Somalia, is still powerful to derail the
national peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Aidid is not at all a problem in Somali peace process because
all his top aides are here to attend peace conference, he is
isolated," he said.
</P>
<P>
It has been suggested that the newly-born parliament should
consult leaders of Somaliland and Puntland before the Somali
national authority is established.
</P>
<P>
"We need advices from our brothers, we can benefit from their
wisdom," said a senior official of the assembly, who asked not to
be identified.
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of unity, we should consult our brothers before
we elect president, before we elect our government," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Somaliland declared independence in May 1991 months of after
the downfall of former Somali president Mohamed Siad Barre.
</P>
<P>
Top leaders of Somaliland, who refused to attend the Djibouti-
sponsored Somali Peace Conference, insisted that they would not
talk to the new government of Somalia until the southern part of
the country is put into order.

<HEADLINE> More Zimbabwean Women Go for HIV/AIDS Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- There has been a marked increase
in the number of Zimbabwean women being tested for HIV/AIDS to
avoid mother to child transmission.
</P>
<P>
Presenting here on Thursday a paper at a two-day conference
aimed at highlighting and providing an analysis of HIV/AIDS in
Zimbabwe and charting the way forward, Mother to Child
Transmission project officer Iman Chitsike said more and more
pregnant women are being tested for the deadly virus.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed through a pilot project which started
operating in April 1999, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said "we are happy to say that now we have gone over the
counseling stage and nurses are complaining that they cannot cope
with the number of women coming for HIV/AIDS testing."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same occasion, the United Nations Children's
Fund country representative Justin Maeda said the rights of women
and children are at stake as the HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to
spread unabated.
</P>
<P>
There is need to intensify efforts to avoid more babies being
infected and dying from HIV/AIDS related conditions, Maeda said.
</P>
<P>
He said "we are aware that in Zimbabwe the rate of HIV/AIDS
infection among pregnant women stands at 33 percent."
</P>
<P>
AIDS has orphaned about 11 million children in the world and in
Zimbabwe more than 600,000 children have lost one or both parents,
he noted.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Resettlement Program Slower Than Anticipated: Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Vice President Joseph
Msika Thursday said the country's land resettlement process has
been slower than anticipated due to lack of financial resources to
fund the program.
</P>
<P>
The program has been affected by the suspension of funds by the
donor community, Msika told Netherlands ambassador to Zimbabwe
Beatrix Ambags.
</P>
<P>
He said the Zimbabwean government had been forced to fast track
the program because the patience of the people was running out,
resulting in the farm occupations by war veterans since February
this year.
</P>
<P>
"We accelerated the program and have adopted a fast track
process with less infrastructure on the farms except for
essentials such as safe drinking water and rough roads," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told Ambags that "we realize that with the help which you
had pledged we will be able to move faster and smoothly but
without the help the road will be rough and slow."
</P>
<P>
According to Msika, the Zimbabwean government wants to ensure
that people who own more than one farm would give up other
requests for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Ambags told reporters after the one-hour meeting that she and
Msika had underlined the need for the Zimbabwean government to
have open communication to the people on how the fast-track
program would be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands government would continue to provide technical
support to Zimbabwe's land reform process but had frozen its
financial assistance pending the outcome of discussions to be held,
she said.
</P>
<P>
She said "our promise in 1998 at the donors conference of
technical assistance still stands, but for the time being money
has been frozen."
</P>
<P>
According to Ambags, she had been assured of the security of
Dutch farmers in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has announced to compulsorily acquire
more than five million hectares of land from whites for
resettlement.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Imposes Arms Sanctions Against Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has imposed "silent
sanctions" against Zimbabwe by barring it from purchasing military
arms which its northern neighbor could use in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) war, a Zimbabwean senior government
official said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Zimbabwe Defense Industries Company
Tshinga Dube told the Zimbabwe News Agency that with the sanctions,
Zimbabwe can no longer procure sophisticated arms and ammunition
which South Africa is selling on the international market.
</P>
<P>
"Today we cannot buy any arms from South Africa because of our
involvement in the DRC," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Dube, the South Africans have not yet officially
announced the sanctions and preferred to remain silent on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
"But the effects are the same, they make it very difficult for
us to buy military equipment from them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has been involved in the DRC war since it broke out in
August 1998. The country has deployed 12,000 troops there, joined
by soldiers from Namibia and Angola, to help the DRC government
fight against rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"The imposition of sanctions doesn't enhance our relations, I
want South Africans to understand that we are not happy about it,"
Dube said.
</P>
<P>
When war broke out in the DRC, South Africa declined to send
its forces there.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Uganda to Set up Joint Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Uganda
have agreed to set up a permanent joint commission aimed at
strengthening bilateral ties, the South African government said in
a statement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This agreement was reached after South African Foreign Affairs
Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma had a three-day visit to Uganda at
the invitation of her Ugandan counterpart Eriya Kategaya.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two ministers discussed bilateral
issues, including trade and investment and cooperation in
agriculture and agro-processing.
</P>
<P>
On regional matters, the ministers discussed the conflicts in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Burundi and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed how to improve Africa's international image
and economic performance.
</P>
<P>
"Both parties expressed their satisfaction with the existing
relationship, and committed themselves to strengthening bilateral
ties," the statement said. "To this effect, the setting up of a
permanent joint commission was agreed upon."
</P>
<P>
According to Ugandan foreign affairs officials, the issue of
the failed talks in Lusaka on the DRC peace earlier this week
would feature prominently in the commission.

<TEXT>

JOHANNESBURG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The South African National
Defense Force (SANDF) arrested 6020 illegal immigrants in July,
the highest number in a single month this year, said SANDF
spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Hester Boshoff on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the illegal immigrants were from Zimbabwe, she said,
noting that about 5,000 Zimbabweans illegally crossed the Limpopo
River into South Africa in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SANDF Lieutenant-Colonel Chris Steyn said the influx
could be attributed, in part, to the subsiding of the Limpopo
River following February's floods.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5,196 Zimbabweans were arrested in the Beit Bridge
area between August 1 and 17, while the average for the year --and
previous years -- was about 1,000 a month, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SANDF arrested 2,922 illegal immigrants in May and 4,495 in
June.

<HEADLINE> German UMTS Auction Reaps 98.8 Billion DM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The auction on Germany's third
generation mobile phone frequency licenses ended Thursday with
final bidding reaching 98.8 billion Deutsche marks (46.2 billion U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The final bidding were offered by six participating consortiums,
namely Deutsche T-Mobil, Mannesmann-Mobilfunk, E-Plus Hutchison,
VIAG-Interkom, Mobilcom and Group G3, which in return each gets a
license for a two-block frequency for UMTS, or universal mobile
telecommunication system.
</P>
<P>
Started on July 31, the auction went through 173 rounds of
fiercely competitive bidding and could not have ended without
concession by two bigger consortiums of the six, the T-Mobile and
Mannesmann, which finally decided on a two-block frequency,
instead of a three-block frequency.
</P>
<P>
UMTS offers a data-transporting speech 200 times more than the
currently used GSM, or Global System of Mobile phones, enabling
customers to enjoy multi-media functions as well as Internet-
surfing on mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Hans Eichel has made it clear that
expected billions of proceeds from the UMTS auction will go to
debt reduction. But opposition parties have called for part of the
income to be used in alleviating the tax burden of ordinary
families.
</P>
<P>
The 98-some billion DM is almost five times what was originally
expected by Eichel, who said that in case that 20 billion DM (9.4
billion dollars) is committed to slashing Germany's national debt,
the federal government can save one billion DM (468.1 million
dollars) in interest payment. Germany's national debt stands at 1.
55 trillion DM.

<HEADLINE> Computer Virus Attacks UBS E-Banking Clients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's largest bank UBS
has admitted that a new e-mail virus which attacks UBS PIN
software has been released but the identity of those responsible
is as yet unknown.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Thursday, UBS said that an analysis by UBS has
shown that only a small proportion of UBS e-banking clients are at
risk. The vast majority do not use PIN software, which inputs
serial numbers automatically, and are therefore not affected by
the virus. There are no reports of damage as yet.
</P>
<P>
UBS claimed that its IT specialists set up virus filters
Wednesday morning, and this successfully prevented the virus from
spreading within UBS. The bank is preparing to take legal action
against whoever is responsible.
</P>
<P>
Like the "I LOVE YOU" virus, this new variant is spread via the
e-mail program Microsoft Outlook. The virus comes with "Resume" in
the Subject field and an attachment bearing the name "resume.txt.
vbs". As soon as this attachment is opened, the virus attempts to
steal scratch list numbers from the UBS PIN module. It cannot do
so if the user has configured UBS PIN according to the
installation instructions provided.
</P>
<P>
Anti-virus software companies are already offering updates that
can detect this new virus, according to UBS. UBS recommends that
all clients who use UBS PIN install suitable anti-virus software
and update it regularly.
</P>
<P>
UBS told its e-banking clients who use UBS PIN on their PC AND
have opened the e-mail attachment named above to proceed as
follows: block their e-banking authorization immediately by
entering an incorrect password three times, and then inform the e-
banking hotline on 0848 848 062 without delay.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Russia Meet Over Submarine Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- NATO and Russia officials met
here Thursday to discuss what kind of assistance the Western
alliance could offer to help save the 118-strong crew of a nuclear
submarine trapped on the bed of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the Russians' visit is to settle certain
organizational and technical issues, Naval Vice Chief of Staff
Alexander Pobozhy, head of the Russian delegation, told reporters
at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The submarine, the Kursk, has been on the seabed since the
weekend. Russian rescue efforts have failed so far and Russia
accepted offers of help from Britain and Norway Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Britain and Norway are sending aid to the accident
site. A British rescue submarine and back-up staff were flown to
Norway Wednesday en route to the tragedy spot. Norway said it
would send up to 15 divers from its offshore oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
But the rescue sub and divers are not expected to be in the
position until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
NATO officials said further offers of help could involve rescue
equipment to deal with the medical aftermath, such as
decompression chambers.
</P>
<P>
Hopes of finding any of the Kursk crew alive are fading after
tapped SOS signals stopped Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS,August 17(Xinhua) -- A French aviation expert of the
Concorde supersonic aircraft Thursday disputed the suspension of
the airworthiness certificate of Concorde by the French and
British governments.
</P>
<P>
In an article published in the daily Le Monde dated Friday,
Andre Turcat, the pilot of test for Concorde, said that the
supersonic plane is not dangerous.
</P>
<P>
"The announcement of the withdrawal of the airworthiness of
Concorde is a decision of gravity and without precedent according
to my knowledge," said Turcat.
</P>
<P>
He said that the plane is as solid as others according to the
request of certification and a total security does not exist for
anyone in aviation.
</P>
<P>
"We remain hopeful that the authorities of civil aviation and
our minister (of transport Jean-Claude Gayssot) will remain open
to solutions and that the stop of the flight of the plane is thus
temporary," he said.
</P>
<P>
France and Britain withdrew the airworthiness certificate of
Concorde Wednesday, three weeks after the crash of an Air France
Concorde which killed 113 people.
</P>
<P>
Many observers said that this means a death penalty for the
plane, which was launched in 1969 by Paris and London and has
flown the Europe-North America lines since 1976.

<HEADLINE> UK Retail Sales Weaker Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- UK retail sales were weaker than
expected in July as price cuts by retailers failed to draw in
consumers.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Office for National Statistics Thursday
showed that retail sales volumes in July were unchanged on the
month to stand 4 percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
One of the analysts in the City said, "There is a bit of a drop
back from the bumper month we had in June, although the June
numbers have been revised out slightly There are some signs that
consumer activity is easing a little bit."
</P>
<P>
The data adds to the growing argument that a series of interest
rate rises by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee late
last year, and earlier this year, is cooling the economy.
</P>
<P>
The weaker than expected figures, following data earlier this
week showing a sharp fall in earnings growth and softer than
expected inflation, will strengthen calls from industry for the
Bank of England to leave interest rates on hold.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Gives Bright Economic Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov
said Thursday that Russia has overcome the financial crisis of
August 1998 and now the economic situation in the country could
improve further in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
The optimistic view coincided with the second anniversary of
the start of the crisis, which caused the ruble to slide from six
to around 28 against the U.S. dollar and brought down the cabinet
of Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
"Recalling today what happened on August 17, 1998, one can say
that the consequences of the most difficult and dramatic crisis
have been overcome," Kasyanov told a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
"There is every reason to believe that in a short time the
economic situation in the country can be improved even further,"
the Interfax news agency quoted Kasyanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of the year, the gross domestic product
(GDP) rose by 7.3 percent. At this rate, the GDP growth could
exceed 5 percent for the year, Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production grew by 10 percent in the first half of
the year and real wages are also rising, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation was 9.5 percent in the first six months, and 1.8
percent in July. The first week of August indicates that the rate
of inflation is accelerating somewhat, Kasyanov said.

In addition, the central bank's gold and foreign exchange

<HEADLINE> Russian Sub Sinks Into Seabed, Rescue Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The crippled Russian nuclear
submarine Kursk with its trapped crew of 118 is slowly sinking
deeper into the Barents Sea floor, although rescue is still
possible, Russian navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This process is very slow and does not significantly impact on
the rescue operation," the Interfax news agency quoted Dygalo as
saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the hatches on the submarine, to which rescue capsules
are trying to attach, so far in vain, remain accessible.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the weather conditions, the attempts to dock with the
submarine have once again failed," Dygalo said.
</P>
<P>
Weather has somewhat improved but a fresh breeze continues to
blow and there is still fog and drizzle on the surface.
</P>
<P>
Four submersible rescue vehicles took turns Thursday at working
deep in the water near the site where the Kursk sank, the Russian
Navy press service said.
</P>
<P>
As rescue efforts continue, experts are analyzing video and
photo materials picturing the damage done to the bow of the sub.
The accident reportedly happened last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is estimated as being critical," the press
service stressed.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 ships on the surface were involved in the rescue
bid.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated submarine was commissioned for the Russian Navy
in 1995. It has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive
to depths of up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with
torpedoes and "Granite" cruise missiles. The vessel can operate
autonomously for up to 120 days, Interfax reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Russia agreed to enlist help from Britain and
Norway in the rescue bid. It had earlier refrained from seeking
outside assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian vessel "Sea Eagle," with 12 deep-water divers
from a special Defense Ministry unit, is expected to reach the
site Friday evening, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
A second Norwegian vessel carrying the British submarine rescue
craft "LR-5" is also expected to arrive at the scene at about 1 p.
m. Saturday, Interfax said, quoting military sources.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin called British Prime Minister
Tony Blair Thursday and the two discussed the rescue operation,
Putin's senior aide Sergei Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
They discussed concrete aspects of the rescue efforts,
Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Germany has also offered to send a team of doctors
and decompression chambers to the place where Kursk went down.
</P>
<P>
The offer was extended Wednesday through the German embassy in
Moscow and to Russian Navy command officers holding consultations
at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on assisting in the rescue of
the crew of the sunken sub, Interfax reported, quoting diplomatic
sources in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Romanian PM Inaugurates Hotline for Heeding Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Since Thursday, any citizen of
Romania willing to address the prime minister, a message or to ask
him questions, or make suggestions or proposals, may dial 01-80-80-
888, the "green phone."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Isarescu inaugurated this open phone line in the
presence of all his ministers before the beginning of the
government's weekly sitting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The green line is a means of communication not only for the
journalists but also for all the citizens, and it comes and helps
the consolidation of the ties between the citizens and the
authorities," Isarescu said on the occasion. The premier aims at
heeding to all the messages, coming to outline and as clear as
possible an idea about what the government has more importantly to
do for the people.
</P>
<P>
The line is open to the public from Monday to Friday, between 8
a.m. and 8 p.m. A think-tank of the government's Department for
Communication, takes over the messages, and each of them is to
receive a reply by the prime minister's advisors or, according to
each case, by the minister in charge with the specific issues.
</P>
<P>
The line is free, it is put at the disposal of the citizens by
the World Bank's financial support, and its subscription and
logistics cost about 3,000 or 4,000 U.S. dollars a month.

<HEADLINE> Romania Prepares New Issue of Foreign Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Finance Ministry
will try in the next two weeks to attract 250-300 million U.S.
dollars or the equivalent in euro from the international capital
markets by floating a new issue of foreign bonds with an interest
between 11 and 13 percent, governmental sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Romania had been encouraged by the improvement
in the Western media perception of its economic performances.
Likewise, the sources said Romania should enter the Western
markets as often as possible by taking advantage of the favorable
time it currently enjoys.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, economic analysts opine that the issue of
foreign bonds can wait, because for the time being, the domestic
economic sudden change for the better will not influence the
interest level. According to Daniel Daianu, former minister of
finance, the wisest measure could be the preparation of the bond
issue and its launching after the end of the fiscal year, when the
market will be more favorable.
</P>
<P>
The state has borrowed money from the domestic market until now.
At present, Romania does not need a finance, but, a foreign market
test is very important, other economic analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Governmental advisor Lucian Croitoru thinks that a continuous
presence on the international capital market could allow Romania
to get lower credit interests, a prolongation of the settling day
as well as a fusing pressure on the domestic market.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Learns Lessons From Last Year's Quakes: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said on Thursday that Turkey has learnt lessons from last
year's two deadly earthquakes and is stepping up "works to prevent
jerry-built houses and make rescue teams more active."
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the pledge at a news conference prior to a cabinet
meeting to mark the first anniversary of the August 17, 1999
earthquake measuring 7.4 degrees on the Richter scale in Marmara
region, followed by another 7.2-magnitude quake rocking the
northwestern Bolu province in November.
</P>
<P>
"A total of 18,243 people were killed while 48,901 others were
injured in the two earthquakes. And 377,879 dwellings and business
places suffered damage," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that the military, public institutions and mining
workers in Turkey, as well as foreign rescue teams, have played
significant role in the salvations and carried out "productive
cooperations."
</P>
<P>
Although "the two massive earthquakes are among the worst
disasters in our history and in the world history," said the
minister, Turkey has "proved its power and succeeded in meeting
quake survivors' accommodation and food requirements."
</P>
<P>
Turkish people had vented anger towards the government that at
first appeared ineffective and slow to react to the August 17, 1999
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the government's response to the disaster was so
disorganized that foreign rescue teams had to asked civilians for
advice on where to go.
</P>
<P>
In response to such criticism, Ecevit listed official aid
efforts for the quake-stricken regions, saying that in the wake of
the disasters, the government provided a total of 165,239 tents to
set up 162 tent cities and constructed almost 40,000 permanent
housing units.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkish Daily News, the number of people living in
tents has fallen from some 120,000 after the quake to 26,000 at
present, and the government expects that the number to decline
sharply in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The cash-strapped state gives some 56,000 families 155 U.S.
dollars one month in rent subsidies and has provided free meals to
some 195,000 survivors for most of the past year.
</P>
<P>
But some survivors, who are still living in cramped
prefabricated homes or tents that are extremely hot in summer and
bitterly cold in winter, complained that "the state doesn't care
about us."
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer visited
quake-hit western Kocaeli province, making observations and
participating in several activities in the region upon the first
anniversary of the quake.
</P>
<P>
Ten provinces having a population of nearly 16 million were
affected by the August 17 earthquake. "Production loss was 2.4
billion U.S. dollars in four provinces which were badly affected by
the disasters,"Ecevit said.

<HEADLINE> Mild Quake Jolts Northern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A mild earthquake measuring 4.0
degrees on the Richter scale jolted the Karadeniz area of northern
Turkey's Kastamonu province at 1449 local time (1249 GMT) on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the Istanbul-based Kandilli Seismology Observatory
said the quake, also felt in neighboring provinces, was centered on
the south of Kastamonu province, Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
The mild tremor took place while the Turkish people are marking
the first anniversary of the August 17, 1999 earthquake measuring
7.4 degrees on the Richter scale which hit Marmara region, followed
by another 7.2-magnitude quake rocking northwestern Bolu province
in November.
</P>
<P>
The two deadly earthquakes claimed a total of 18,243 lives and
injured 48,901 others while 377,879 dwellings and business places
suffered damages.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference on Thursday, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit called for strict measures to be taken to prevent the
building of jerry-built houses and make rescue teams more active.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey should learn lessons from the two devastating
earthquakes, be well prepared for potential quakes which
seismologists warn could happen in the quake-prone country at any
time.
</P>
<P>
Turkish people vented their anger toward the government that at
first appeared ineffective and slow to react to the August 17
earthquake, during which the government's initial response was so
disorganized that foreign rescue teams had to ask civilians for
advice on where to go.
</P>
<P>
Also, many people died due to poor buildings which collapsed in
the quake like cardboards.
</P>
<P>
At the first anniversary of the August 17 earthquake, people
criticized the government for failing to settle all survivors even
one year after the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Some survivors, still living in cramped prefabricated homes or
tents that are extremely hot in summer and bitterly cold in winter,
complained that "the state doesn't care about us."
</P>
<P>
But Ecevit defended the government's efforts in the salvations,
saying that although "the two massive earthquakes are among the
worst disasters in our history and in the world history," the
country has "proved its power and succeeded in meeting quake
survivors' accommodation and food requirements."

According to official figures, 10 provinces having a population
of nearly 16 million were affected by the August 17 earthquake.
Production losses were 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in four provinces
which were badly affected by the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Ruling Party Elects New General Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (
SLFP), the flagship party in the ruling People's Alliance, on
Thursday elected a confidant of President Chandrika Kumaratunga as
its new general secretary.
</P>
<P>
S.B. Dissanayake, minister of sports and youth affairs,
received 16 votes in a secret ballot, defeating his rival
Maithripala Sirisena, minister of Mahaweli development, who
received 12 votes.
</P>
<P>
The SLFP was founded on September 2, 1951, by President
Kumaratunga's father late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike,
who left the United National Party. Sri Lanka's former Prime
Minister and mother of Kumaratunga, Sirimavo Bandaranaike is the
president of the party.
</P>
<P>
The election was held at Temple Trees, the president's official
residence in Colombo. The general secretary's post became vacant
after the sudden death of Minister of Tourism and Civil Aviation
Dharmasiri Senanayake late last month.
</P>
<P>
Minister Dissanayake who spoke to the media after his election
said that Sri Lankan Parliament will be dissolved as scheduled on
August 24.
</P>
<P>
However, he reminded that President Kumaratunga could dissolve
it earlier if she wishes to.
</P>
<P>
The new general secretary said that the country will go into
election on the existing proportional representation system and
that there will not be any change in the system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the People's Alliance led by President Kumaratunga
is confident of winning the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is scheduled to go into elections by early November
this year. Political Analysts expect the coming general elections
to be keenly and fiercely contested.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga's government faced a setback last week when the
proposed draft new constitution had to be shelved with the main
opposition, the United National Party, withdrawing support for the
bill. Other opposition parties and the Buddhist clergy led mass
scale protests against the draft bill.

<HEADLINE> Release of Sipadan Hostages Postponed Anew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The release of nine Western
hostages held by Abu Sayyaf rebels in the southern Philippine
province of Sulu, which was expected on Thursday, has been
postponed anew due to bad weather in the southern island.
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Roberto Aventajado said in a
statement that the delay has been caused by the stormy weather,
making the transfer of hostages to the helicopter impossible.
</P>
<P>
"The chopper can not take off at 3 p.m. because clouds are
starting to close in at that time," Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
The release of nine Western hostages has been postponed since
Wednesday, under a deal bankrolled by Libya. The nine hostages
include two French, two Germans, two Finns, two South Africans and
one Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
They are among the 21 hostages taken by the Abu Sayyaf from the
Sipadan Island diving resort in Malaysia on April 23. Of the 21
hostages, eight have been released so far, including six
Malaysians, one German and one Filipino woman.
</P>
<P>
A chartered plane from Libya arrived in Manila on Monday to
fetch the nine Western hostages. The plane will take the western
hostages to Libya, from where they will travel to their own
countries.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said that he is confident the hostage crisis would
finally end over the weekend with the collective release of the
Abu Sayyaf captives, also including three Malaysians, three French
journalists, and 13 Filipinos.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- An agreement to construct the
Paksey Bridge over Padma river in the Pabna district, some 160
kilometers west to Dhaka, was signed Thursday between Bangladesh's
Roads and Highways Department of the Ministry of Communications
and China's Major Bridge Engineering Bureau (MBEB) of the Railways

</P>
<P>
The 1.8-kilometer-long and 18.1-meter-wide road bridge, to be
built under Japanese assistance at a cost of 6.47 billion taka (
120 million U.S. dollars), will be the second longest bridge in
the country.
</P>
<P>
After its completion by the year 2003, the bridge, which will
connect the country's northern region with the southwestern part,
will play an important role in transportation of goods under
transit arrangements among Bangladesh, Nepal and India, said an
official handout.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese contractors, MBEB, will build the main bridge as
well as carry out the river training works.

<HEADLINE> De Klerk Recommended as Mediator for Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The South African New
National Party (NNP) on Thursday urged the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to seriously consider a request by
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that former South
African president FW de Klerk act as mediator to revive the peace
process in the country.
</P>
<P>
As a Nobel Peace Prize winner, De Klerk had a good record in
conflict resolution and the fact that he had no connection to any
of the six warring parties, placed his impartiality above
suspicion, NNP spokesman Boy Geldenhuys said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Peace in the DRC was of the greatest importance and the process
should not be derailed because of the mediator, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
If De Klerk had to replace former Botswana president Ketumile
Masire as mediator in the interests of peace in the DRC, then "so
be it", he said.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk was one of a number of former African leaders proposed
by DRC President Laurent Kabila's government as possible
replacements for Masire.
</P>
<P>
Masire has been appointed by the Organization of African Unity
as a facilitator for all-party national dialogue on the political
future of the DRC. But the DRC government said he was not welcome
as a mediator for sympathizing with the rebels.

JOHANNESBURG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 150 traditional
leaders from six provinces gathered for a two-day conference in
Johannesburg on Thursday to discuss the role of traditional
leadership in governance.
</P>
<P>
In an opening speech to the conference, Public Works Minister
Stella Sigcau said traditional leaders were an important part of

"We all met here together as proud descendants of illustrious
warriors and immortal statesmen who in difficult times of the
history of our people stood firm in the defense of our land from
the forces of colonialism," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the conference would deliberate on the role and powers
that traditional leaders would have in rural and local governments.
</P>
<P>
The conference was organized by the Department of Local and
Provincial Government.

<HEADLINE> De Klerk to Consider Mediation Role in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president FW de Klerk on Thursday indicated that he would consider
acting as a mediator for peace talks in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
His remarks followed reports that the DRC government was
requesting his help in this regard.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said in a statement that he had taken note of the
reports, but had not been approached by any of the parties
involved in the conflict and was therefore not in a position to
comment.
</P>
<P>
However, he said his FW de Klerk Foundation was dedicated to
the promotion of peace in divided societies.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said he would accordingly give positive consideration
to such an approach, provided that it had the support of all the
parties and international organizations involved.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the New National Party said the request that De Klerk
act as mediator to revive the peace process in the DRC should be
seriously considered by the Southern African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
As a Nobel Peace Prize winner, De Klerk had a good record in

<HEADLINE> France Expects Production of New Generation of Concorde Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS,August 17(Xinhua)-- French Minister of Transport Jean-
Claude Gayssot said on Thursday that the suspension of the flying
certificate of the Concorde supersonic aircraft does not mean the
death of the plane and instead could lead to the production of a
new generation of such planes.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily L'Humanite, Gayssot said that
since September 1999, the French government has established a
commission in charge of studying the possibility of producing a
new generation of Concorde aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that there exists a market for a supersonic plane
which cares about the environment. Of course, we are in this field
in the middle term," said Gayssot.
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview with radio Europe 1, Gayssot said that
if a new generation of Concorde is envisaged, France and Britain
will not do it alone and will invite other European states and
even the United States to join them.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot do it alone, or with two countries. We should work
on a European scale, and even a world scale, including thinking
about the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
France and Britain launched the Concorde plane in 1969 and put
it into commercial flight in 1976.
</P>
<P>
The 12 Concorde aircraft belonging to Air France and the
British Airways are permanently grounded after the civil aviation
authorities of France and Britain suspended their flying
certificate on Wednesday, three weeks after the crash of an Air
France Concorde near Paris which killed 113 people.

big names like Clyde Drexler, Buck Williams, Ronaldo Blackman, to
put up their strength for the first game against the American

point play and forward Hu Weidong drunk two 3-pointers in a row to
initiate a 15-4 run in just three minutes. The scoreline was 46-
31 at 3:05 in the second half and the Legends never came within 10
points after that.
</P>
<P>
"We took control of the game with the defence," said Chinese
coach Jiang Xingquan. "We played more aggressive tonight."
</P>
<P>
"China played with more character and heart in this game," the
Legends coach Rick Barry said. "And Yao Ming played an
exceptional game."
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Yao, 2.23 meters high, scored 20 points,
grabbed 10 rebounds and blocked four shots in 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>

game-high 22 points. Drexler, one of the NBA 50 Greatest Players,

<HEADLINE> China Sees Shortage in Ethylene Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The gap between ethylene supply
and demand stands at 3.3 million tons last year, creating a
shortage in China, despite the fact that the country is stepping
up efforts to increase ethylene production, according to today's
China Petrochemical News.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that China produced 4.3 million tons of
ethylene in 1999, however, its annual demand reached 7.78 million
tons, leaving a gap of 3.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
China expects to produce 5.05 million tons of ethylene by the
end of this year, but experts expect the shortage to continue
which should be eased with exports, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited experts as saying that by 2002 China's
ethylene production capacity will increase to 6.25 million tons,
and by then its annual demand is expected to hit 9 million tons,
leaving a shortage of some 3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper added that five giant petrochemical enterprises,
namely SHELL, BASF, BP-AMOCO, DOW and EXXON-MOBIL, are planning to
establish five petrochemical production centers in Huizhou,
Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Quanzhou, respectively, with
combined ethylene production capacity forecast to reach 3.3
million tons.
</P>
<P>
The above mentioned petrochemical production centers are
expected to be operational between 2005 and 2006, the paper said.

Although consumption fell by 6 percent, imports went up by 19.44
percent.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The volume of investments in Saudi Arabia's foodstuff

<HEADLINE> Estrada No Longer Interested in Emergency Powers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has dropped his call for Congress to grant him extra
powers, convinced that lawmakers will pass the necessary measures
that will allow him to speed up the rehabilitation of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before flying to Mindanao Thursday morning, the
president told reporters here two measures which are being
considered by Congress should enable him to speed up the
implementation of the vital infrastructure programs.
</P>
<P>
One of the measures bars lower courts from issuing temporary
restraining orders (TROs) against government projects while the
other will allow the government to expedite the issuance of right-
of-way for public works running through private properties.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Estrada called on Congress to grant him
special powers that will enable him to speed up the implementation
of the critical infrastructure projects designed to rehabilitate
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that some losing bidders in government projects
have many times succeeded in seeking a TRO against the
implementation of the priority government contracts.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the refusal of private property
owners to grant the government right-of-way in infrastructure
projects have also been a major cause of delay in the construction
of roads, bridges and other public works.
</P>
<P>
"My only purpose there (in seeking emergency powers) is to
accelerate the development and rehabilitation of Mindanao. With
the passage of this TRO and the right-of-way bill, I don't think I
will need it anymore," said Estrada.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Should Convert Foreign Aid to FDI: Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah
A.M.S. Kibria Thursday emphasized on converting foreign aid to
foreign direct investment (FDI) as the new pillar of strengthening
the country's balance of payment position.
</P>
<P>
"We should not depend on foreign aid any more, rather we should
bring dynamism in attracting FDI," Kibria said while launching the
Continental Insurance Limited in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Kibria said that with the cold war gone, there is no realistic
reason for increase of foreign aid. The importance of foreign aid,
one of the three main pillars of balance of payment, has been
declining gradually, he added.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said the FDI, which emerged as a new
sector of balance of payment, is very much dynamic although very
little foreign investment took place in Bangladesh in last 20 to
25 years.
</P>
<P>
The FDI started taking place mainly in the "extraction
industries" like gas, power and telecom sectors for quick profit
making, he said, adding that foreign investment is also coming to
other sectors like cement and jute.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said the country has the advantage of a
low-cost, skilled and easily trainable workforce to attract FDI
and face the challenge of globalization.
</P>
<P>
"If we can add high productivity to low labor cost, we will be
able to stand against any competition. We should work out a proper
plan to increase productivity of our workforce," Kibria said.

<P>
Chaudhry, who arrived here late Wednesday evening and visited
Rohtak town in north India's Haryana state on Thursday, said he
was thankful to the people of India for their support during his
56 days of captivity after he was ousted by rebel leader George
Speight on May 19, the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
"During my captivity, I was very much aware of your prayers and
support and was very moved," Chaudhry, who received a honorary
doctorate from a local university in Haryana, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Stating that he would continue his struggle for restoration of
democracy, he said he would seek India's support when he meets
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the Indian capital
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry said the honor bestowed on him would go a long way in
strengthening ties between the two countries, adding: "All people
of Indian origin in Fiji will share this honor with me."
</P>
<P>
However, he regretted that the honor did not come "at a happier
time for me and my country".

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes New People's Army as Top Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that the leftist New People's Army (NPA) has remained the
number one threat to the country, with the number of NPA
guerrillas being placed at over 11,000 as of June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
Virgilio Totanes, deputy chief of staff for intelligence of the
Armed Forces of the Philippines, said NPA rebels have some 5,000
assorted firearms in their arsenal, still lower compared to 1987
when they had 15,000 guns.
</P>
<P>
"The movement is the number one threat since they have been
trying to expand and recruit all over the country," Totanes said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the NPA had boosted its strength to 25,700 fighters,
the highest since it was formed in 1969.
</P>
<P>
When the military launched a massive offensive operation in
early 1990s, the NPA's strength went down to 5,000 in 1995. But
lately, the NPA was monitored to have increased in number.
</P>
<P>
At the end of December 31, 1999, the NPA had 10,600 fighters
with 6,200 firearms, Totanes said.
</P>
<P>
He said concentration of NPA rebel is found in Northern Luzon,
Southern Tagalog, Bicol Region, Samar, Bohol, Mindoro, Compostela
Valley and the Caraga Region.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado told members of Congress on
Monday that out of the country's more than 42,000 barangays (
villages), 1,200 of them are considered NPA-influenced or affected
areas.

<HEADLINE> Fake Somali Banknotes Flood into Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Businesses came to a halt in
the Somali capital's main Bakara market on Thursday following the
arrival of billions of counterfeit Somali banknotes which flooded
into the market last night.
</P>
<P>
A large consignment of Somali banknotes worth over 2.5 million
U.S. dollars were escorted to the market by over 70 battle wagons
and more than 500 heavily armed militiamen after two medium-sized
planes carrying the banknotes landed in Ballidogleh airport, about
90 kilometers south of the capital on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The money, which is printed in Ottawa, Canada, will be used for
the encouragement of the peace in Mogadishu and will not hurt the
economy or cause a serious inflation, according to the businessmen
owning the money.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the impact of the arrival of the money is already
hampering the smooth flow of the business activities after the
money traders stopped exchanging any more money and the owners of
main food stores refused to accept Somali shillings in selling
out their goods.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar, which has been loosing ground against the
Somali shillings since the inauguration of Somalia's transitional
parliament in Djibouti last Sunday, is now regaining strength
after this new shipment arrived last night.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate fell to more than 1050 shillings to one
dollar Thursday from 930 shillings to one dollar Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Somali shilling will further devaluate
once the newly printed money hits the markets in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim scholars in Mogadishu have condemned the act of
printing the fake money and blamed the countries that helped such
businessmen for being behind what they called the dirty business
of helping Somali civil strive to continue.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Accuses S. African Farmers of Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Some South African farmers
dodge remunerating Mozambican employees by handing them over to
the police before payday, a visiting Mozambican minister claimed
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The farmer contacts the police on the eve of payday, and the
worker is arrested and repatriated," Mozambican Labor Minister
Mario Sevene said after meeting his South African counterpart
Membathisi Mdladlana in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Farmers perpetrating this practice kept the documents proving
that the Mozambican laborer was legally recruited so as to prevent
the worker from proving to the police that he was not an illegal
alien, Sevene told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Mdladlana said the practice was clearly widespread, especially
around in Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.
</P>
<P>
"This is exploitation of people. Our Bill of Rights does not
allow people to do such things," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mdladlana said he had raised alleged abuses by farmers in a
meeting with leaders of Agri South Africa, a farmers' association
about two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to form a task team to look into the problems. It
will report back to me by the end of the month," Mdladlana said.
</P>
<P>
There were about 25,000 Mozambicans legally employed on South
African farms.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's air cargo business
is expected to grow by more than 20 percent this year, with both
employment and remuneration in this sector increasing.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong Airport Authority, Hong Kong
International Airport (HKIA) handled more than 2.16 million tons
of cargo in the 12 months to July, a 23-percent jump over the same
period a year earlier. Cargo traffic has maintained double digit
growth every month this year.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, visited on Thursday the Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals Limited (HACTL) to have a first-hand feel of the impact
of economic recovery on the market.
</P>
<P>
"Export-led growth is bringing prosperity to Hong Kong which
will benefit more and more people in the long run," said Tung.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Airport Authority had been taking a series of
initiatives to increase the airport's cargo throughput capacity
and to further strengthen Hong Kong's position as an air cargo
center.
</P>
<P>
He was told that HACTL had recently launched a new service
which provided a high-speed sealed trucking service to transfer
air cargo between the HKIA and the Baiyun Airport in Guangzhou,
capital city of neighboring Guangdong Province.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Marks Anniversary of Strong Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Turks held
candles, waved black flags or simply wept in silence early Thursday
in Marmara region to commemorate the 17,000 people killed by the
devastating earthquake exactly a year ago.
</P>
<P>
People gathered in central squares in hard-hit towns and sirens
sounded at 03:02 a.m. (2402 GMT), the time the 40-second tremor
took place, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people turned up at the Memorial Park in downtown
Golcuk and mourned in silence for one minute for the dead. Imams
prayed for the killed during a 20-minute ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In Yalova town, where thousands of people were killed in the
tremor, people also assembled and observed minutes of silence for
the dead.
</P>
<P>
Yuksel Er, who was rescued out of collapsed building four days
after the tremor, said that people died and lost their right to
life by the mistakes people did.
</P>
<P>
"Negligence is not the destiny. We won't forgive those who were
responsible," Er said, apparently referring to the jerry-
contractors.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, thousands of people went to the mausoleum
and laid a black wreath in tears there.
</P>
<P>
Kenan Cakal, who lost his child in the quake, said the
construction companies gave long advertisements in newspapers
promoting sales on reasonable never-never.
</P>
<P>
But the buildings are neither inspected nor licensed and local
quality supervising authorities should be responsible for the
consequences, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is an earthquake-prone country, which lies on a few
established fault lines. Two above-seven-magnitude quakes rocked
west Turkey on August 17 and November 12 respectively, killing
nearly 20,000 people and causing a property loss of 20 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
At least 600,000 people were left homeless by the quakes which
damaged more than 33,000 buildings, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
A year later, 147,000 people still live in prefabricated
buildings and 30,000 in tent villages, local authorities say. And
the towns and villages still bear the scars of the catastrophe.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Expects to Meet Deficit Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
expressed optimism Thursday that it would be able to keep its
budget deficit target of 62.5 billion pesos (1.56 billion U.S.
dollars) within the year.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed by Budget and Management Undersecretary
Mario Relampagos as he shared the views of economic managers that
the country's inflation and gross domestic product rates would be
kept at their reasonable levels.
</P>
<P>
Relampagos said in a statement that because of these, the
government is confident that the budget deficit target for the
second half of the year is really achievable in the near term.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government posted a budget deficit of 59.7
billion pesos (1.5 billion dollars) for the first seven months of
2000. This was 60 percent higher than the programmed 37.3 billion
pesos (933 million dollars) deficit for this period.
</P>
<P>
Relampagos stressed that the Bureau of Internal Revenue, which
was suspected to have been remiss in its collection activities due
to alleged graft and corruption inside, is seen to recoup its
revenue shortfall for the rest of this year.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that there are other sources of revenues
that could fill up the target deficit, which was set by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a pre-condition for releasing
the last tranche of the country's standby loan facility from the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
Relampagos explained that the government is seen to generate
revenues from the impending disposition of government assets in
big ticket items which the Committee on Privatization expected to
sell within the year.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned these ticket items as the shares of government in
the Philippine National Bank, San Miguel Corporation and the
Manila Electric Company.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada called Thursday for unity among the people of Mindanao so
that his administration can push forward its development program
for the island.
</P>
<P>
According to the Presidential Palace, the president made this
call in the southern Cotabato City in his speech before local
government officials and those of the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the Philippines has been left behind by its
neighboring countries because of continued fighting and enmity
among the people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there can never be a genuine economic recovery
for Mindanao and the whole country as long as there is peace and
order problem.
</P>
<P>
"That is why whatever development projects we have for Mindanao,
if there is no peace and order, nothing will happen," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
The president appealed anew to the separatist Moro Islamic
Liberation Front and the Abu Sayyaf to lay down their arms and to
help in the development of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said that the determination of his administration to develop
Mindanao is shown by the budget for Mindanao for the year 2000
which is 107 billion pesos (2.7 billion dollars), much bigger than
the budget for Luzon or the Visayas.
</P>
<P>
The president and his official party arrived in Cotabato City
before noon to start his three-day working visit to Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Last week, from August 8 to 11, the president also visited
Mindanao and the Visayas, the first part of a series of visits to
Mindanao that would last for more than one month.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Flocking to Watch Anti-Corruption Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- While local films dwarf in
comparison to foreign film industry giants like Hollywood, a made-
in-China anti-corruption movie is breaking new earnings records at
box offices in many Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
"Live or Die," a new film from the Shanghai Film Studio, tells
about how the character, Mayor Li Gaocheng, struggles against
corrupt officials, including one of his long-time friends, and his
wife who has been lured into the crime.
</P>
<P>
The film has become very popular among Chinese audiences.In
fact, the issue the film is made about has become a hot topic for
many local families these days.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, the largest financial center in China, over 11
million tickets have been sold, bringing about over 14.3 million
yuan to local cinemas.
</P>
<P>
At the gate of Daguangming Cinema, one of the oldest in
Shanghai, Yu Benzheng, the film's director, was spotted by an old
couple. They came up and thanked him many times. They said: "Hope
you will shoot more films about what we ordinary people care about.
"
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, the Chinese capital, Secretry of Municipal Party
Committee Jia Qinglin and other city leaders watched the film
Wednesday, before its debut in the city.
</P>
<P>
The city authorities have decided to include the film in a
package of ideological textbooks to educate local officials, after
the cases of corruption of Hu Changqing, former vice governor of
Jiangxi Province, and Cheng Kejie were revealed. Hu was executed
in March, while Cheng is awaiting for the same fate.
</P>
<P>
Provincial leaders in Hubei Province did something special a
couple of days ago, when their spouses, secretaries and drivers
were invited to watch the film.
</P>
<P>
"Some evil people are attempting to capture leading officials
via their relatives and aides. All of us must keep a cool head
about the issue," said Jiang Zhijie, the provincial party chief,
after he viewed the film.
</P>
<P>
In Tianjin, a north China port city, local cinemas had to debut
the film ahead of the timetable under increasing pressure from
local cinema-goers. Telephones at the box offices rang all day as
people were rushing to buy tickets.
</P>
<P>
"When a film chooses the people, the people are sure to choose
the film," said Yu.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the script writer Zhang Ping as saying, "Writers are
not the savior, but they must not keep a distance from the time
and the people."

<HEADLINE> Yunnan to Become Asia's Biggest Floral Production Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province is taking on the ambitious task of becoming Asia's
biggest floral production base and auction market, an official
announced today at an ongoing high-level meeting of the Chinese
Florist Association (CFA).
</P>
<P>
Li Gang, secretary-general of the Yunnan Flower Association,
said that since the mid-1990s, Yunnan began fostering new
lucrative industries, such as tourism, biological resources, and
particularly the floral industry.
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed a "natural garden" and "floral kingdom," Yunnan has
more than 2,500 different kinds of wild flowers. In recent years,
the province has expanded its floral plantation area from 16 ha in
1994 to 1,729 ha in 1999.
</P>
<P>
To date, Yunnan produces some 1.1 billion branches of fresh
flowers annually, accounting for 45 percent of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the construction of a province-level model
floral park started in March, with its total investment reaching
160 million yuan and its area surpassing 300 ha.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Family Planning among Ethnic Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to promote
the family planning policy in the areas where ethnic minority
groups live and help develop their economy and improve their lives
there, according to a national meeting on family planing of ethnic
minorities, which opened today in Hailar City, north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region today.
</P>
<P>
Since most of the population of Chinese Ethnic minority groups
are in west China, the central government should give overall
consideration to the population and family planning work in the
development program of west China, said Zhang Weiqing, chairman of
the State Family Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said that reproductive health services such as contraceptive
and birth control services, prenatal tests for neonatal defects
and check-ups for gynecological diseases should be provided where
the ethnic minority groups live. Family planning workers should
try to introduce new styles of living like "late marriage and late
child birth" and "fostering fewer, but healthier children" to
those areas in accordance with the religious and cultural
traditions of the ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Family planning workers at grassroots levels should also help
people to become rich by providing them with agricultural
techniques, education and knowledge of health care, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
China has 55 ethnic minority groups with more than 100 million
population, or 8 percent of the country's total. The central
government does not implement any compulsory family planning
policies in minority nationality regions, but local governments in
those regions usually have their own family planning policies
which are more flexible than the one-child policy.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the local governments in those regions should
adhere to family planning policies and try to provide a better
population environment for the economic and social development of
minority ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> PCCW Wraps Up Merger with HKT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Internet up-star
Pacific Century CyberWorks Ltd. (PCCW) Thursday announced the
completion of its long-planned merger with Hong Kong's dominant
telecoms operator Cable and Wireless HKT.
</P>
<P>
The merger, valued at 38 billion U.S. dollars, is said to be
the largest-ever merger in Asia and has created one of the world's
largest Internet companies engaged both in Internet business and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The merged company, named Pacific Century Cyberworks HKT, will
utilize an innovative "8 x 3" model that operates eight business
units via three operating sectors, said Richard Li, chairman and
CEO of PCCW, while briefing the press about the new company's
development strategy.
</P>
<P>
Li identified the three operating sectors as Telecommunications
Services, Global Communications Services and Net Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications Services consists of fixed line operations,
representing the engine room providing cash for the other two
growth sectors. Global Communications Services consists of
Mobility Services and Connectivity Services.
</P>
<P>
The third Net Enterprises consists of four business units:
Broadband Business to Consumer Services, Business to Business
Services, DATA Center/Web Hosting Services and CyberWorks Ventures.
</P>
<P>
"The new structure is designed to best realize the myriad
Internet, broadband and communication opportunities in the Asia-
Pacific region and beyond," Li said.
</P>
<P>
PCCW reached a deal with Cable and Wireless PLC, the British
parent of Cable and Wireless HKT, in February this year to buy
Cable and Wireless HKT, after beating rival bidder Singapore
Telecom (Singtel).
</P>
<P>
PCCW, founded by Richard Li, is comprised of Pacific
Convergence Corporation, CyberworksVentures and the Cyber-Port
project and is mainly engaged in Internet-related investment.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong's biggest communications provider with a 97
percent market share, HKT markets a full array of quality voice
and data telecommunications services backed by a state-of-the-art,
fully digital, fiber-optic network and an extensive regional
Internet backbone.

<HEADLINE> Russian Plane to Arrive in Iraq on Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A Russian plane will arrive in
the Iraqi capital Baghdad on Saturday on a humanitarian mission, a
reliable diplomatic source told Xinhua on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the flight is to offer humanitarian help to the Iraqi
people, who have been under stringent United Nations sanctions
since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
A Russian government minister will arrive aboard the plane,
whose flight has been permitted by the U.N. Sanctions Committee,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. embargo, any flight to and from Iraq must get
prior permission from the Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Russian plane will most probably land at the Saddam
International Airport, which reopened on Thursday, 10 years after
it was closed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been calling on its supporters to take more practical
measures to protest the U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Marie Benjamin, the French priest who broke the embargo in
April by taking a direct flight from Amman, capital of Jordan, to
Baghdad, has announced that he will organize another flight from
Paris to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin said that he will take a Boeing passenger plane with
some 300 people on board, including politicians, parliamentarians
and humanitarian organization members, as well as journalists, to
protest the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin and other three people from Italy arrived in Baghdad on
April 3, becoming the first group flying to Iraq without U.N.
authorization.

<HEADLINE> Ben-Ami Lowers Expectations for Second Israeli-Palestinian Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli acting Foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami Thursday tried to lower expectations for a second
Israeli-Palestinian summit, ahead of an important visit to the
region by U.S. Mideast special envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Israel Radio, Ben-Ami said that a second summit,
following last month's botched Camp David talks, will only take
place when Israel is certain that the Palestinians will show more
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
"The question of the summit is for the time being not really on
the agenda. What is on the agenda is trying to detect any
meaningful change in the positions on the other side," said Ben-
Ami, who officially resumed the peace talks with two Palestinian
senior negotiators Saeb Erekat and Mohammed Dahlan Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Ross was due to arrive in the region Thursday afternoon and will
hold a meeting immediately with Ben-Ami in the latter's Public
Security Ministry office in Tel Aviv. Ben-Ami holds the public
security portfolio concurrently.
</P>
<P>
The Ross's visit, which was originally slated to begin on
Sunday, will be the first visit by high-ranking U.S. officials to
Israel and the Palestinians self-rule areas since the Camp David
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
The envoy reportedly will try to assess the progress that has
been made since the Camp David talks and explore the idea of
holding a "pre-summit" to iron out the two sides' differences over
core issues before a concluding summit between top leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David summit, attended by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, last for 15 days in July and failed to reach an agreement
finally due to significant gaps over the fate of Jerusalem and the
return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration now adopts a more cautious attitude
toward a second summit until sighs show that sufficient progress is
made to warrant the summit's success.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami and Palestinian negotiators Erekat and Dahlan reportedly
inclined to holding a "pre-summit" in Washington at the end of this
month or the beginning of next month.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Jerusalem said that the talks, under the guidance
of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, will enhance the
prospects of success at a full-fledged summit later.
</P>
<P>
Ross is scheduled to meet with Barak on Friday before heading
for the Palestinian self-rule areas. He will also go on vacation
with his family at an undisclosed location in the region on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Based on his reports, Clinton and Albright then will decide
whether conditions were ripe for a concluding second summit for
reaching a final Israeli-Palestinian accord.
</P>
<P>
A possible date for the proposed second summit is September 4-6,
when Barak, Arafat and Clinton will meet at the U.N. Millennium
Summit in New York.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Thursday discussed the latest developments of the Middle
East peace process on telephone with his Russian counterpart Igor
Ivanov, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation initiated by Ivanov, he voiced
Russia's desire to reactivate its role in helping advance the peace
talks between Arab countries and Israel as Moscow is one of the co-
sponsors of the peace process, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Egypt welcomes the Russian position and is
ready to cooperate with Russia in the efforts to help the
Palestinians and Israelis find just and final settlement of their
decades-old conflict, it added.
</P>
<P>
Russia reportedly has an intention to put forward its own ideas
concerning the Mideast peace process. Russian President Vladimir
Putin's personal envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Vassily Seryeddin
will begin a visit to the region to assess the latest situation and
Russia's possible role.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will meet with the Russian envoy, who will deliver a
message from Ivanov, the news agency added.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Putin exchanged
views on the Middle East conflict and obstacles in the peace
process. The two leaders underlined the importance of continuing
efforts to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting peace based on
international legitimacy resolutions for the peoples in the region
to enjoy genuine stability.
</P>
<P>
The lastest Palestinian-Israeli peace talks ended in
fruitlessness on July 25 at the Camp David in the U.S. as the
Syrian-Israeli negotiations have been stalled since January this
year.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Edible Oil Production Expected to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the increased production, the total quantity of edible oil
available in the country will grow to 740,000 tons against the
national requirement of 1.9 million tons, leaving behind a gap of
1.1 million tons to be imported, the Associated Press of Pakistan
(APP) quoted officials sources as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Targets of 350,000 acres of canola (oilseed rape of a variety
developed in Canada) and 600,000 acres of sunflower have been
assigned to the field force of the Pakistan Oilseed Development
Board for the crop 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
From the total cultivation of canola, some 67,000 tons of oil
will be secured while another 152,000 tons of oil will be produced
from the sunflower crop.
</P>
<P>
In addition, cottonseed, rape seed and other oilseeds will
contribute about 520,000 tons edible oil.
</P>
<P>
During 1999-2000, sunflower crop was cultivated on 289,880
acres while canola crop was cultivated on 163,500 acre in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in edible production is due to the conscious
efforts by the government to boost indigenous oilseed production
and reduce its import bill," said the official sources.
</P>
<P>
During 1998-99, 788 million dollars were spent on edible oil
import which came down to 450 million dollars during the previous
fiscal year, helping the country slash its food import bill
significantly.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
approved Thursday to provide a 300 million U.S. dollar loan to
China to help the country build a new railway linking four
interior provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release of the ADB, the 2.8-billion-dollar
Hefei-Xi'an Railway Project involves constructing a 954-km single-
track railway and 52 new stations linking the provinces of Anhui,
Henan, Hubei and Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said the project, scheduled for completion by December
2005, is in line with the Chinese government's push to develop the
poor interior.
</P>
<P>
"The lower transport costs are expected to attract new
industries to the interior to develop natural and agriculture
resources as well as associated businesses and commerce," said the
ADB, adding that the project alone will create over half a million
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The new line's link with four north-south railways will also
increase the efficiency of China's rail sector, the ADB pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is financing some 11 percent of the project cost and
the remainder will come from the Ministry of Railways and the
China Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loan will come from its ordinary capital resources with
a repayable period of 25 years, including a grace period of 5
years.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Breakthroughs in Controling Rice Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A cover story of the British
magazine "Nature" published today introduced China's achievements
in controlling rice blast.
</P>
<P>
The story, entitled "genetic diversity and disease control in
rice", was written by Zhu Youyong and Chen Hairu, scientists of
the Yunnan Agricultural University in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and his colleagues began the research on the new technology
in 1997 in cooperation with the International Rice Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, they have made resistance factor
analysis on more than 200 rice strains and analyzed over 1,000
bacterial strains. Based on repeated experiments, they have
developed a way of rice inter-planting.
</P>
<P>
The new cultivation technique has been experimented on 43,000
hectares of land in nine Chinese provinces. Tests proved that the
technique raises the per hectare output by 630 kg to 1,110 kg and
reduces the use of insecticides by 60 percent.

<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing No.1 Intermediate People
's Court today started the hearing of Microsoft's anti-piracy case
against ABD company.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft discovered last year that ABD's three computers
illegally installed Windows 95, Chinese Windows 98 and Chinese
Office 97.
</P>
<P>
ABD is a small computer manufacturer in the Zhongguancun
Technological Development Zone in Beijing. It was fined in
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft asked ABD for two million yuan in compensation and a
public apology. The main conflict between the two is the amount of
money.
</P>
<P>
The court will issue its final judgment in days.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft sued two Beijing-based companies in May 1998 for
illegally packaging and selling Microsoft products, receiving 790,
000 yuan in compensation. In November last year, Microsoft anti-
piracy case against Beijing Yadu Science and Technology Group in
November 1999 was thrown out of court due to lack of evidence.

<HEADLINE> China's E-Business Sector Still Immature: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China's growing e-business is
still immature, according to the latest survey conducted by the
Ministry of Information and Industry and the Lantian Market
Research Company.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on more than 30,000 samples from 31 provinces
across China, shows that the scale of e-commerce in China still
lags far behind developed countries, with its on-line trade-off
volume accounting for less than 0.02 percent of the total social
retail volume, 70 times lower than that in the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, only 40 percent of the respondents
said they were "satisfied" with China's e-business service, while
the average ratio in the world is 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also as much as 80 percent of those surveyed are not confident
about the security of on-line businesses, the survey says.
</P>
<P>
However, great development potential has also appeared in China
's e-commerce market, according to the survey, adding that over 90
percent of the respondents are willing to try on-line trading in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
At present the major commodities traded through Internet in
China are books, disks and computer software and hardware.
According to the survey, other such commodities and services like
telecommunication products, domestic appliances, on-line education
and tickets services are also booming very fast in China.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that currently China has a total of
over 10 million Internet users and 1,100 e-business websites on
various consumption products.

<HEADLINE> Preventative Measures to Control Landslides in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Landslides in the Xiaojiang
River Valley in southwest China's Yunnan Province, called the
Natural Museum of Landslide, have been effectively curbed after 30
years of hard work.
</P>
<P>
The 86-kilometer Xiaojiang is a branch of the Jinsha River,
which is a tributary of the Yangtze River, and its 140 km-long
valley is an area most frequently hit by landslides in China.
</P>
<P>
Landslides have not only resulted in more than 6 million tons
of silt into the Yangtze every year, but also caused heavy
casualties and property losses.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s, landslides have damaged 2,100 hectares of
farmland and killed 187 people.
</P>
<P>
To curb the disasters in the area, the central and local
governments have spent more than 10 million yuan in landslide
control projects each year and adopted three measures: stabilizing
mountain slopes through afforestation, constructing levees to
block mud and rocks, and building troughs to channel mud and
rocks to safe places.
</P>
<P>
In Dongchuan district in the provincial capital of Kunming,
more than 50,000 hectares of mountains have been afforested, with
177 levees built and 28 km-long troughs dug.
</P>
<P>
Feng Yingsong, Dongchuan's chief leader, said that to curb
landslide and improve the environment is essential for the
survival of Dongchuan, adding that the district will retire 10,000
hectares of farmland and turn it into forests.

<HEADLINE> Reforms of Government institutions in China Running Smoothly: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Reforms of China's government
institutions have been running smoothly, said Song Defu, Minister
of Personnel, in a recent interview with Xinhua and "People's
Daily" reporters.
</P>
<P>
Subordinate departments under the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee and the State Council are being restructured to
strengthen the leadership of the ruling Party and improve the
efficiency of the central government.
</P>
<P>
The number of employees at these departments has been cut by 20
percent, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Draft plans for all the 31 provincial-level governments in
China had been approved by mid-May and are being carried out, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that one of the major breakthroughs in
the reforms of government institutions is that the government will
no longer interfere in the operation of enterprises such as
intermediate agencies engaged in accounting and auditing as well
as law firms.
</P>
<P>
The number of employees of provincial governments will be cut
by 74,000. This number does not include public servants working
with law-enforcing departments.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has also turned many of its subordinate
institutions into enterprises. Of the one million people working
in the institutions, over 600,000 are now working for enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The key to the reform of government institutions is to
streamline governments at the city and county levels, Song said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Food Expo 2000, an event
featuring a great variety of delicacies, opened Thursday in Hong
Kong, drawing 222 exhibitors from around the world.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Trade Development Council (TDC) of Hong Kong,
the five-day event provides a business opportunity for exhibitors
to showcase their best products and services.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Michael Sze, TDC's executive
director, said the participation of a wide range of food companies
indicates that the Food Expo, which began 11 years ago as a local
summer activity, has extended beyond geographical barriers and
developed into a significant regional event.
</P>
<P>
"This is an encouraging result and we are confident that this
fair will continue to thrive in variety and popularity," he added.
</P>
<P>
Apart from local companies, this year's exhibitors, up 15
percent from last year, also come from the Chinese mainland,
Taiwan, the Republic of Korea and South Africa.

bakery products, beverages, health food and ginseng products.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Clearing System Goes Live in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will process its
first transaction through the new U.S. dollar clearing system on
August 21, officials from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new service will allow local financial institutions to
settle U.S. dollar transactions real time in the Asian time zone
instead of 12 hours later in the New York time zone.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five banks as well as the HKMA will join as direct
participants of the U.S. dollar clearing system following a series
of successful simulation tests conducted by the HKMA, the Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC), Hong Kong
Interbank Clearing Limited (the operator of the system), and the
participating banks.
</P>
<P>
"With an efficient and reliable U.S. dollar clearing system in
Asia, the Herstatt risk -- which is the foreign exchange risk
related to time zone differences -- associated currently with the
settlement of U.S. dollar denominated transactions in New York
time, can be reduced, if not eliminated," HKMA Chief Executive
Joseph Yam said.
</P>
<P>
This U.S. dollar real time gross settlement (RTGS) system will
be an important addition to the region's financial infrastructure
and will strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international
financial center, Yam said.
</P>
<P>
David Eldon, chairman of the HSBC, said, by enhancing U.S.
dollar settlement efficiency and reducing settlement risks for
local banks, the system will provide the necessary infrastructure
for Hong Kong to further develop its stock and debt markets and
attract more investment.
</P>
<P>
"This will bring new business opportunities for the financial
sector in Hong Kong," Eldon stressed.
</P>
<P>
The system will be launched in three phases, with full
implementation expected by the year-end. The first phase will
launch the U.S. dollar RTGS system for interbank payments as well
as delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement for U.S. dollar
denominated stocks traded in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This clearing capability will allow products traded on the
securities and derivatives markets of Hong Kong Exchanges and
Clearing to be denominated and cleared in U.S. dollars. Similarly,
locally traded Nasdaq shares can also be settled in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The second phase, to be launched on September 25, will
facilitate payment versus payment (PvP) settlement for foreign
exchange transactions between U.S. dollars and Hong Kong dollars,
and the third phase, covering U.S. dollar paper cheque clearing
and the RTGS interface with the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU)
for settling U.S. dollar denominated debt securities, will be
launched before Christmas.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reopens International Airport Despite U.N. Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Saddam International Airport
in the western suburb of capital Baghdad reopened Thursday, 10
years after it was closed under sweeping U.N. sanctions over Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held Thursday morning to mark the reopening of
airport, regarded by many as a fresh and bold move by Iraq to
counter the U.N. ban on commercial flights to and from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Minister of Transport and Communications Ahmad Murtadha
Ahmad Khalil attended the ceremony at the airport, which used to be
one of the best in the Middle East region before sanctions started.
</P>
<P>
"We are now ready to receive any aircraft day and night," Khalil
said, adding that the airport is capable of providing all the
necessary facilities and services just like other foreign airports.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi passenger plane, the only one of the Iraqi Airways
fleet left in the country, flew around Baghdad for about one hour
and half without receiving any threat from the U.S. and Britain, he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
All the other some 30 planes of the Iraqi Airways are now
stranded in Jordan, Iran, Libya and Tunisia, and will not be
allowed back until the sanctions are lifted.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister called the air ban against Iraq "illegal" and
said he is "optimistic" that a foreign plane will arrive here soon.
But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Mamoun Al-Nassry, general director of the Iraqi Civil Aviation,
said the plane will be from a "friendly country," and it can arrive
as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
If this becomes true, the plane will be the second arriving in
Iraq in defiance of the U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
On April 3, a European airplane landed in Baghdad to show
solidarity with Iraqi people, becoming the first plane coming to
Iraq without U.N. authorization.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. embargo, any flight to Iraq must get prior
permission from the U.N. Sanctions Committee.

JERUSALEM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's security adviser Danny Yatom reacted strongly on Thursday
to a U.S. statement warning American citizens of terrorist threats
and safety concerns in the region.
</P>
<P>
Yatom said he tried to talk U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk out of
issuing a statement when informed of it beforehand, but to no
avail.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by the U.S. State Department on Wednesday,
said that "The U.S. government believes that there is, at this
time, an increased possibility for terrorist attacks in Israel, the
West Bank and Gaza."
</P>
<P>
The statement urged all U.S. citizens travelling in these areas
to remain alert and vigilant, and avoid the use of public buses.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, Yatom told Army Radio on Thursday that "I truly do
not know why the embassy made this public...I told him that in my
opinion this notice didn't need to be published."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the statement, Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz said on
Thursday that "For the moment I wouldn't say there is a concrete
warning we need to issue."

Accountability Bureau (NAB), which was established after last
October's military takeover, reported the Associated Press of
Pakistan (APP) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In all, six accountability courts have been set up in the
province of Punjab since January, APP quoted official sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The current military government has vowed to carry out across-
the-board accountability to and punish corruptive officials and
eradicate corruption.

<P>
Nawaz Sharif, prime minister of the government preceding the
military one, has been convicted in a corruption case in an
accountability court and will be tried in more cases.
</P>
<P>
Benazir Bhutto is facing an assets case. This case has recently
been transferred from the Ehtasab Bench of Lahore High Court, APP
said. Bhutto has already been sentenced to five years'
imprisonment in April last year and she has been in exile ever
since.
</P>
<P>
Others facing trial under NAB ordinance include former chief
minister of Punjab Manzoor Wattoo, Ex-federal ministers Nawaz
Khokhar, Anwer Saifullah, Navid Qamar, Ahmed Mukhtar and Asif Ali

KUALA LUMPUR, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Singapore Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew Thursday described his visit to Malaysia
which was aimed at enhancing Singapore-Malaysia bilateral ties as
"fruitful."
</P>
<P>
"I discussed key issues outstanding between our two countries
with Mahathir and I am more optimistic now," Lee told a press
conference here at the end of his four-day working visit, his
first in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides need to make political decision in this
regard and both sides will gain when the leaders of the two
countries put the issues behind them and move on.
</P>
<P>
"If there are gifts from both sides on key issues, within two
to three months, the outstanding issues could be solved," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two neighbors have sometimes been testy due to
differences over several issues such as water supply by Malaysia
to Singapore and customs checkpoint.

<P>
Lee Lauded the achievements Malaysia made during the last
decade, saying he learnt a lot during the visit which changed some
of his perceptions.

<HEADLINE> Farmer Creates Utopian World Through His Poetry (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some poetry magazines and journals in Beijing had invited Li to
serve as editor. Former Deputy Minister of Culture Gao Zhanxiang
once met the farmer-turned poet and wrote an inscription praising
him as "being of common stock, but showing great literary talent".
</P>
<P>
"A cowherd can become a celebrity, so why not me?" said a
certain Liu, one of Li's villagers.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers in Qingxi have become passionate about poetry.
One can usually see somebody reciting poems while tending their
herd of cattle, or someone taking notes on a cigarette case as
soon as they find the inspiration.
</P>
<P>
Li attributes his achievements to China's attempts to eliminate
illiteracy since the 1950s. The number of illiterate youths and
adults only account for six percent of the country's total, a
massive drop from 80 percent in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
"I had a strong desire to get an education, and rid myself once
and for all the label of being illiterate. Otherwise I'll just
live my life like as an ox and spend the whole day eating,
sleeping, and working," says Li.
</P>
<P>
It goes without saying that economic development in rural areas
is one of the major factors in the growing popularity of poetry
and other writing in the village.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that farmers now spend more than one-fourth of
their income on education and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Unique and pastoral scenery provides a good environment to
write poems full of inspiration and passion. However, people
living in urban areas are generally fickle and impetuous and bent
on hankering after personal fame and gain, which is not conducive
to writing poetry, scholars say.
</P>
<P>
Li has passed on his passion for writing poetry to his
offspring. They are also poets and have had their works published
in China.
</P>
<P>
"To earn more money, my children left the village to seek work
in big cities," says Li.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I prefer to live the same life as Tao Yuanming,a
renowned ancient Chinese pastoral poet (AD 365-427) who created a
Utopian world in his poems."
</P>
<P>
"I would like to live my life just like Tao's devoting myself
to working on the farm and writing poetry. I want to stay as far
away from the baleful influence of the money-oriented world," he
adds.

<HEADLINE> Farmer Creates Utopian World Through His Poetry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Li Jinxin, 56, is a typical
farmer living in east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
His sunburned skin, chapped and thick-callus-covered palms,and
weather-beaten legs -- all this makes Li no different from other
farmers in China. There are more than 800 million farmers in the
country.
</P>
<P>
But Li is somewhat different. Quite a large number of farmers
have little diversion to relax after working all day and
invariably go to bed early to spend a sweet night with their
spouses.
</P>
<P>
Like other farmers, Li gets up as the sun rises, but unlike
most of them, he spends most of his evening composing poems under
the dim light of an oil lamp. Many of his poems are popular among
farmers as they are imbued with new outlooks and fresh ideas about
rural life.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 poems written by Li have been published. Eight
have even been translated into English and Japanese in a dozen
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Li's bucolic poems are often quoted and loved by a growing
number of people. As a result, Li has gained popularity not only
in his small village of Qingxi, but also across China and other
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Li now serves as the director of a Poets Society in the village
sponsored by local villagers. There are more than 300 farmers
living in the village.
</P>
<P>
"Writing poetry is one of the best ways for farmers to express
their emotions, dreams, and respond to improved living conditions
in rural areas," says Li.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the farmers in the village have followed in
Li's steps to write poetry. They believe that writing poems
enables them to express their feelings and lift their spirits. It
also gives them an outlet to narrow the cultural gap between
farmers in rural China and those living in the city.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers are not satisfied with knowing just a few words. They
want to have the vocabulary and ideas that will enable them to
enrich their souls and raise their spirits," said Li.
</P>
<P>
One of Li's poems reads: "In spring we work hard tilling the
land/in autumn we harvest crops as well as poetry/as farmer-poets
we have lofty ideals/striving for both material and cultural
prosperity...."

<P>
BAGHDAD, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A big ceremony was held on
Thursday morning to mark the reopening of the Saddam International
Airport in the western suburb of the Iraqi capital Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
This has been regarded as a fresh and bold move for Iraq to
counter the United Nations embargo that was imposed on Iraq in 1990
following its invasion of Kuwait. The airport has been out of
service since the embargo started.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. embargo, any flight to Iraq must get prior
permission from the U.N. Sanctions Committee, which has been
dominated by the U.S. and its allies.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Minister of Transport and Communications Ahmad Murtadha
Ahmad Khalil attended the ceremony, which began at 11:10 a.m. local
time(0710 GMT) and lasted for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
Mamoun Al-Nassry, general director of the Iraqi Civil Aviation,
told Xinhua that a flight "from a friendly country" will arrive at
the airport as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
If this comes true, it will be another plane in defiance of the
the U.N. embargo. On April 3, a European airplane landed at Baghdad
without prior permission from the U.N..

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Three Gorges Relocation Project Significant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to relocate
125,000 people living in the dam area of the Three Gorges Power
Project to 11 regions in coastal provinces in the next nine years.
</P>
<P>
The relocation project is of great significance. Firstly, it
will help improve the environment in the dam area of the Three
Gorges Power Project, the largest hydro-electric power project in
China and the world.
</P>
<P>
The forest coverage rate of this densely-populated area has
dropped from 26 percent in the 1950s to 17 percent at present.
Sixtytwo percent of the 21,667 square kilometers of land in the
Three Gorges dam area suffer from soil erosion. An estimated 40
million tons of sand in the region silts up in the Yangtze River
annually.
</P>
<P>
The relocation of the 125,000 people to other parts of China
will make it possible for the region to cover the barren land at
mountain slopes with trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, relocation of residents in the dam area to better-off
regions on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River
provides a larger space of living for the migrants.
</P>
<P>
The population density in the dam area is more than double the
national average. As many as 260 people are cramped into an area
of one square kilometer.
</P>
<P>
When the water level of the Three Gorges Reservoir rises to a
height of 175 meters, 26,000 ha of farmland is expected to be
inundated, and the life of 340,000 rural residents will be
affected.
</P>
<P>
If the affected farmers move to Shanghai, Guangdong, Jiangsu
and other economically-developed coastal areas, they will have
ample opportunities to use their skills and expertise to become
better off in a shorter period of time.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the relocation project also offers an opportunity for
the areas where the migrants will resettle to achieve rapid
economic developments.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu Province, for instance, will receive 200 million yuan
from the central government as subsidies for the 700 resettlers
there. The funds will be used in building infrastructure projects
in new villages and developing agriculture, thus promoting the
economic growth in the province.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeeping in Cyprus Costs 43 Million Dollars Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The cost of maintaining the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) from July 2000 to the end of
June 2001 amounts to some 43.4 million U.S. dollars, local media
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has decided to offer a voluntary
contribution for UNFICYP of approximately 14 million dollars and
Greece has pledged to provide 6.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly has expressed regret at the member
states' absence of adequate response to appeals for voluntary
contributions.
</P>
<P>
Some 22 percent of the member states have paid their assessed
contributions in full. The General Assembly urged all other member
states concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure payment
of their outstanding assessed contributions.
</P>
<P>
It also asked the secretary general to continue efforts to
recruit local staff to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens
coup.
</P>
<P>
UNFICYP was set up in 1964 and controls the 180-kilometre long
buffer zone across this east Mediterranean island created after the
1974 Turkish invasion.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures show that UNFICYP's authorized strength
stands at 1,230 troops, 35 civilian police officers, 44
international members of staff and 215 members of local staff.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Yet to Settle Tens of Thousands Quake Survivors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 26,000 survivors of the
August 17, 1999 earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western
industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents
one year after the quake.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Daily News reported on Thursday that an additional 150,
000 people live in cramped prefabricated homes that are extremely
hot in summer and bitterly cold in winter.
</P>
<P>
Some victims who survived the disaster complained about their
grievance, saying that "the state doesn't care about us."
</P>
<P>
It is a bitterness that was widely felt after the 7.4-magnitude
earthquake destroyed jerry-built apartment buildings, crushing some
17,000 people as they slept.
</P>
<P>
The quake almost leveled parts of Izmit, 60 miles east of
Istanbul, as well as other towns in western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The government has done a lot to handle the post-quake cleanup,
and the number of people in tents has fallen from some 120,000
immediately after the quake to 26,000 at present. The government
expects that number to decline sharply in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
It also has taken extensive measures to prepare for a new quake,
which seismologists warn could take place at any time.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arabic Broadcasts Stop Due to Transmitter Radiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel Broadcasting Authority's
(IBA) Arabic Language program went off the air since midnight
Wednesday due to environmentalists' protest against its powerful
main-transmitter's radiation pollution.
</P>
<P>
The program, which serves Israeli Arabs, Palestinians and other
Arabic-speaking audience in the neighboring Arab world, had been on
the air for 40 years,
</P>
<P>
The radio, which could be picked up at 738 Medium Wave, was
turned off because of a decision by Israeli Environment Ministry
not to renew the radiation permit for its transmitter station in
the Sharon area.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists had claimed that the transmitter's antennas
endangered the health of residents of the area.
</P>
<P>
The station's radiation permit expired Wednesday. So if it went
on broadcasting without permission, it would be considered as "a
full-fledged pirate station."
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that dozens of protests were received from
Arabic-speaking listeners over night.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Ministry is angry at the Environment Ministry's
decision as the transmitter also worked for the army.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Defense Ministry will appeal the
decision to Israel's High Court of Justice.

<HEADLINE> Business Picks Up at Mombasa Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Business at Mombasa port in
southeastern Kenya is picking up with at least 47 ships loaded
with more than 189,000 tons of cargo expected in the next two
weeks, the Kenya Ports Authority has said.
</P>
<P>
The daily shipping advisory released by the authority Wednesday
showed that a total of 1,189 new and used vehicles will arrive at
the port starting Thursday, the Daily Nation reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the next fortnight, ships to dock at the port will off-load
47,200 tons of maize, 37,300 tons of fertilizers, 18,700 tons of
jet fuel, 20,000 tons of wheat and 26,000 tons of vegetable oil,
among others, the authority said.
</P>
<P>
Mombasa is a major port along the Indian Ocean in East Africa
for imports and exports of the hinterland African countries such
as Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Presently the imported goods are reaching Uganda within four
days, which was not the case in the past due to close cooperation
for speedier delivery by the port authority and Kenya railway
authority.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Registers Revenue Increase Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA)
collected 168.5 billion shillings (about 2.2 billion U.S. dollars)
in the 1999/2000 fiscal year, a 2.2 percent rise over the previous
fiscal year, the official Kenya Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report, KRA Commissioner General John Msafiri
said on Wednesday that under hard economic conditions in the
country, the authority had enhanced its tax administration, which
led to the increase in revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
He said that the authority had launched a plan for improved
revenue collection and better service delivery.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure was below the fiscal year's budget target
of 173.5 billion by 2.9 percent, according to the authority.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Olympic team
leaves for Sydney, Australia Thursday in time for the 2000 Summer
Olympic Games to be held from mid-September to early October.
</P>
<P>
The team, comprising four athletes, was presented the national
flag by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education and
Culture, Mary Mushi, here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The southeastern African country will be represented in
athletics only because other sports disciplines, including sprint
and boxing that Tanzanians are good at, failed to produce
qualified candidates, said Tanzanian Olympic officials.
</P>
<P>
The runners to make the trip are the team captain Restituta
Joseph, who will compete in the female 10,000 meters, male
marathoners Zzebedayo Bayo, Angelo Peter and Focus Wilbroad.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania won its last medal two decades ago during the Moscow
Olympics, where the former 1500-meter world record holder, Filbert
Bayi scooped a silver.

off through hard work".
</P>
<P>
The newcomers were given "resettlement badges" by
representatives of 11 townships where they will resettle.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A nature reserve covering the
headwaters of three major rivers was set up in northwest China's
Qinghai Province recently.
</P>
<P>
The reserve, the largest in China, covers 318,000 square
kilometers. It is the source of the Yangtze, Yellow and Lancang
rivers.

and promote sustainable economic development in the region.
</P>

The Zone has more than 70 kinds of wildlife including Tibetan
antelope and wild donkey. However, the environment in the region
is deteriorating due to drought, overgrazing, desertification and
decreasing levels of water on lakes.

The Zone is part of the central government's drive to develop
its western regions and "build a beautiful northwest China", said

BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
said today that the restoration of the Palestinian people's
legitimate national rights accords with relevant resolutions of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
It is also a consensus reached by Israel and Palestine, and
supported by the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks in a meeting with Israeli Minister of
Regional Cooperation Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Qian told Peres that he hopes that Israel and Palestine will
use their wisdom and continue negotiating, to reach solutions as
soon as possible, reiterating that China will continue to make its

<HEADLINE> "We Pray to the Same Pope": Chinese Bishop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- "Everyday morning at mass, we
pray to the same Pope," said Michael Tieshan Fu, chairman of the
Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, in an interview with
Chinese and foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who was ordained bishop of the Catholic diocese of Beijing
in 1979, advocated the Chinese government's policy to protect
religions, stressing that under the Constitution, the legal rights
and interests of religions are protected by law in China.
</P>
<P>
Since China launched its reform and opening drive in the late
1970s, the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association has trained
almost 1,000 young priests.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more than 50,000 people have converted to
Catholicism every year, Fu said. Currently, there are 5 million
Catholics, 5,000 Catholic churches, 110 dioceses and 12 religious
schools in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a journalist's question about the so-called "
underground churches" in China, Fu said it is unnecessary for any
"underground" religious activity in China, since Chinese Catholic
churches are open to all.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that with the support of groups and individuals
from overseas, a handful of Catholic believers hold different
views with the majority of Chinese Catholics. "We take care of
these people with the love of Christ," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to his assistant Zhang Tianlu, the bishop said the man
's parents used to work for a so-called "underground church".
</P>
<P>
Zhang told Xinhua that he could received only limited education
about Catholicism from the "underground church", which even
indoctrinated anti-government thinking to its believers.
</P>
<P>
After he got rid of the "underground church" and joined Fu's
church, Zhang was sent to study in Britain. "I've learned a lot
from the real church," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was so fortunate for me to meet Pope John-Paul II," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Fu said his association has not set up any ties with the Roman
Catholic Church as Vatican City keeps diplomatic relations with
Taiwan. "This has greatly hurt the Chinese on the mainland," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the links between Chinese Catholics and Vatican are
personal, Fu said.

</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer told Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit on Wednesday that he would not sign for the second
time the governmental decree stipulating dismissal of civil
servants involved in fundamentalist activities.
</P>
<P>
The government had said that a second rejection by the president
would be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Even though one year elapsed after the devastating earthquake
which rocked Turkey's Marmara region on August 17 of last year,
most families in the quake zone have not been settled in permanent
homes.
</P>
<P>
The government will convene on Thursday to explain the things
which have been done since last year's earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- The Istanbul Quake Research Group, formed by 58 scientists
from various universities, prepared a report on a potential
earthquake in the biggest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the quake risk for Istanbul in the next 30
years was very high, proposing that "1 million people, in the first
phase, should be moved to new settlements which will be set up on
solid ground."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein began
deliberations on Wednesday which will lead to a decision on whether
or not to prosecute former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said prosecutors were leaning toward indicting
Netanyahu regarding suspicions that he tried to get the state to
pay a bill of 440,000 shekels (about 110,000 U.S. dollars) for
mostly private work done for him by mover and contractor Avner
Amedi.
</P>
<P>
After Netanyahu and his wife were questioned repeatedly, police
recommended on March 28 that Netanyahu be prosecuted for taking a
bribe, grand larceny, fraud, breach of trust, and disruption of
judicial procedures in connection with the Amedi affair.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Two Lebanese men Wednesday succeeded in crossing the border
into Israel in the northern Mount Dov area under the noses of
Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Military sources admitted that the incident was deeply
embarrassing and said that if the two had been terrorists they
would have been able to perpetrate an attack with no difficulty.
</P>
<P>
The incident reflects the tenuous situation that still prevails
along the northern border, where some 50 kilometers of fencing are
still lacking.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers and Palestinian
security officers tried to calm the atmosphere in a village north
of the West Bank city of Ramallah after soldiers shot and killed an
elderly Palestinian who had opened fire at them during a military
raid, thinking they were thieves.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers responded to the shots and the man was shot in the
head. He was severely wounded and died later on the way to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli economy grew dramatically by 5.4 percent in the
first half of the year. This follows a 5.7 percent growth rate in
the second half of 1999. The government's adjusted growth-rate
objective for 2000 is 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Central Bureau of Statistics show a
booming economy. Most of the indices are positive, many beyond
expectations.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Forms Youth AIDS Lobby Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A new youth AIDS lobby group,
Africa Alive, has been formed in Kenya, aimed at sensitizing the
youth about the disease whose rapid spread has become of concern
in the country, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The group is backed by Johns Hopkins University of the United
States with a mission to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic among the
youth. The university is the leader in applying modern
communication media and new technologies to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the group comes at a time when the Kenyan
government and many nongovernmental organizations are involved in
activities geared towards combating the killer disease which
perishes 500 Kenyans daily.
</P>
<P>
Tina Dyrssen, head of the group, said her organization plans to
reach the youth through drama, musical concert and live shows, and
even build kiosks bearing messages on combating the disease which
serve as distribution points for condoms to the youth.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is seriously affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Since the
country found the first AIDS case in 1984, an estimated 1.1
million Kenyans have reported perished duo to HIV/AIDS scourge and
the cost of the pandemic to the Kenya's economy is estimated at 10
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> PM: Situation on Sunken Sub "Almost Catastrophic" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The situation aboard the sunken
submarine Kursk "is almost catastrophic," but "we still hope that
chances for saving the crew have not been lost," Russian Prime
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"No cardinal changes, negative or positive, occurred last night,
" Kasyanov said while opening a cabinet session on the rescue of
the multipurpose nuclear submarine that reportedly went down to
the bottom of the Barents Sea last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov said Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov and Commander
of the Russian Navy Vladimir Kuroyedov are about to fly to
Severomorsk to observe the rescue operation, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Western rescuers will join the efforts to save the 118 crew
Thursday, Kasyanov said, noting that "hope for saving the Kursk
crew has not faded yet."
</P>
<P>
Russia had earlier refrained from requesting outside help and
that stance changed Wednesday. British and Norwegian help is on
the way.
</P>
<P>
All attempts so far to evacuate the servicemen aboard Kursk had
failed due to strong currents and poor visibility, Interfax
reported, citing a source with the headquarters of the Russian
Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The source confirmed the absence of any tapping SOS signals
from the crew aboard Kursk, but noted that the submariners might
be saving strength given a shortage of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the oxygen would last only until Friday.
</P>
<P>
There has been no final word on what caused the submarine to
sink while participating in a major naval exercise, but Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev said the theory that Kursk may have
collided with another object is receiving increasingly concrete
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
"An increasing amount of evidence suggests that the submarine
must have collided with an external object," Interfax quoted
Sergeyev as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Russia has 22 ships on the surface involved in the rescue bid.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles. The vessel can operate autonomously for
up to 120 days, Interfax reported earlier.

an organization to protect retail stock investors' interests when

</P>
<P>
The proposed organization would function as a coordinator
between relevant institutions and retail investors in case the
latter's interest was damaged.

If the coordination fails to solve the problem, it will proceed
against the offenders on behalf of retail investors, said a source

The source said the operation of such an organization would
borrow experiences from similar organizations overseas.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to preferential policies from the government, China's
institutional investors soared 28 percent in the first seven
months of this year to 350,000.
</P>
<P>
However, retail investors still account for an overwhelming
majority of China 50 million stock investors.
</P>
<P>
Research by the China International Capital Company shows that
speculations in the Chinese stock market are much frenetic than

<HEADLINE> Daily Air Quality Report for 42 Chinese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Seven Chinese cities, namely
Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Shanghai, Nanjing and
Lanzhou, reported slight air pollution today, with the highest
pollution reading at 151 in Taiyuan.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Downgrades Fiji Travel Advisory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Thursday joined
the United States, Britain and Australia in downgrading its
earlier travel advisory against all travel to Fiji.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs' alteration to the
travel advisory for Fiji reflects an improvement in the security
situation there, Foreign Minister Phil Goff said in a government's
press release.
</P>
<P>
Since the crackdown of coup leader George Speight and his
supporters by the Fiji Military Forces, law and order has been
restored to most areas in that country, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The overall security situation has improved and life in most
parts of the main island of Viti Levu is returning to normal.
</P>
<P>
"In the western side of Viti Levu, Nadi, the offshore island
resorts and the Coral Coast the situation is calm," he said.
</P>
<P>
But, the minister noted the security situation in Suva, the
Central Division of Viti Levu (the eastern side) and the island of
Vanua Levu remains potentially volatile.
</P>
<P>
He warned there remains the possibility of isolated incidents
and New Zealand travelers are still advised to maintain a high
level of caution and security awareness.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Expands by 24 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade in
July this year expanded further by 24 percent year-on-year to 40.2
billion Singapore dollars (about 23.6 billion U.S. dollars),
reflecting growth in key trade components, Singapore's Trade
Development Board (TDB) said Thursday in its monthly trade
bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The strong growth was bolstered by buoyant demand for key
electronic products as well as continued strong demand from key
Asian economies, TDB said.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) rose 13.8 percent to 9.78
billion Singapore dollars (about 5.75 billion U.S. dollars) in
July and non-oil re-exports (NORX) increased by 31.1 percent to 8.
63 billion Singapore dollars (about 5.08 billion U.S. dollars)
during the month while non-oil imports expanded further by a
double-digit rate of 23.3 percent to 18.17 billion Singapore
dollars (about 10.69 billion U.S. dollars) in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Domestic exports of electronics rose by 6.6 percent driven by
strong demand for integrated circuits (ICs) and telecommunication
equipment and growth was eroded by decline in domestic exports of
disk drives and printed circuit board assembled, which have
remained in the doldrums this year.
</P>
<P>
The exports of non-electronic products expanded further by 27.7
percent year-on-year in July, supported by strong exports of disc
media products to Japan and petrochemicals and specialized
machinery to the region.
</P>
<P>
The most significant growth was recorded in the oil domestic
exports, which expanded by 60.2 percent on the back of higher oil
price as compared to a year ago. But in volume terms, domestic
exports of oil remained weak due mainly to keen competition from
the other Asian refineries.
</P>
<P>
The broad-based expansion in the non-oil re-exports was boosted
by strong demand for ICs, parts of semiconductors, PCBAs
capacitors CD-ROM drives and transistors and the growth came
mainly from the continued expansion to the major markets in Asia
as well as to the U.S. and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Among the five major markets, NODX to Malaysia, Japan and Hong
Kong increased by 22.5 percent, 19.2 percent and 32.9 percent
respectively while that to the U.S. and the EU remained weak with
a contraction of 3.4 percent and 4.7 percent separately in July.
</P>
<P>
NODX to the emerging markets including China and India rose
sharply by 36.5 percent in July with main contributions from
exports to India and Middle east.

NAIROBI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Kenyan newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Times:

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa's Economy to Grow 3 Percent in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The paper quoted Robert Okello, director of the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) Sub-Regional Development
Center for Southern Africa (SRDC-SA), as saying that growth is
expected to double last year's.
</P>
<P>
Okello said indicators confirmed that the region was on course
to achieve the three percent economic growth with the agriculture
sector expected to be the driving force for the growth.
</P>
<P>
He observed that despite the floods experienced earlier in the
year which wrecked havoc in some parts of the region, the larger
part benefited from the rains resulting in favorable grain
production.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia's outlook was particularly good in view of the
completed mines privatization and the outcome of the recently held
Consultative Group meeting where donor aid flows were expected to
materialise.
</P>
<P>
Despite last year making some reasonable recovery over the
previous year, Okello said the 1.5 percent growth rate was still
too low in terms of per capita growth rivalled by the high
population growth rate.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although Southern Africa had been able to attract
more Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as compared to other parts of
Africa, it had yet to reach the expected levels.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the insufficient investment inflows to various
perceptions of the region such as conflict, crime and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Okello said the escalation of internal conflicts in Angola and
the Democratic Republic of Congo had actually stunted regional
growth.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Blasts Bush, Praises Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 16 (Xinhua) - Accepting the vice-
presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention,
Joseph Lieberman Wednesday praised Al Gore as a leader of vision
and dismissed his Republican rivals as pleasant men who offered
empty talk.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman did not mention Republican presidential nominee
George W. Bush or his vice presidential running mate Dick Cheney
by name. But he said the Republican ticket had no idea how to
protect the environment, fix the health care system, reform
education or cut taxes for the middle class.
</P>
<P>
"Under their plan, the middle class get a little and the
wealthy get a lot. Their tax plan operates under that old theory
that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the
horses," Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was good that Bush talked about the environment but
the quality of the air and water in Texas was among the worst in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He praise Gore as a pioneer of defending environment for the
American people and Gore and he, if elected, will continue to
fight for clearer sky, air, water for them.
</P>
<P>
It was good, Lieberman continued, that Bush talked about health
care but only one state had a worse record than Texas when it came
to providing health insurance for women and children.
</P>
<P>
He promised to supply the best health care for the American
citizens, especially for women and children.
</P>
<P>
"And I think it's a good thing that our opponent talks about
education ... But I'm sad to say their plan doesn't provide the
resources our schools need," he said. "Sometimes it seems to me
like their idea of school modernization means buying a new
calendar for every school building."
</P>
<P>
He promised Gore and himself, if elected, will be committed to
making America's public schools the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
Analyst believe that Lieberman's evaluation of Gore as a man of
"vision and values" seemed aimed at voters who need reassurance
after President Clinton's well-chronicled personal failures.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman said the Republicans "are decent and likeable men,"
but told delegates to the convention and a nationwide television
audience there are "very real differences between us in this
election" and that if elected they would "squander" the current
economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman said he tries to see the world through other people's
eyes and, in this way, he understands that "the smallest changes
can make the biggest differences in all of our lives."
</P>
<P>
On the economy, he said, Republicans would spend the surplus to
"give a tax break to those who need it least, at the expense of
all our other needs."
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say Lieberman had fulfilled an important task of
portraying Gore in a positive light and reaching out to the
independent voters who have so far shown little enthusiasm for the
vice president's campaign.
</P>
<P>
Others predict his blast on Bush's policies, particularly the
education policy, may backfire in the coming days.

training camp in the Qeensland state in northeast Australia,
officials said on Thursday.

be frozen and stored to be tested for currently undetectable
substances some time in the future. For example, when scientists
find an effective test for human growth hormone, the blood samples
will be tested.

They said the measure was part of a pro-active campaign with
the aim to present a positive public image of the sports. Athletes
Commission Chair Lee Naylor candidly admitted that the initiative
had a public relations emphasis.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Airforce Steps up Attacks on Tamil Tiger Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's airforce has stepped
up attacks on Tamil Tiger targets in the Northern part of the
country following reports of fresh Tamil Tigers build-up in the
area, the Island newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Brigadier Sanath Karunaratne was quoted as
saying that the airforce launched the attacks Wednesday morning
despite missile threats from Liberation Tiger of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that LTTE front line positions at
Colombuturai near Jaffna town were repeatedly bombed as part of
the ongoing efforts to weaken the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He added that the airforce had scored a number of good hits
and the aircraft had returned to base after carrying out sorties.
</P>
<P>
He said that monitored Tiger transmissions had revealed that
four senior LTTE officials including a self styled Lieutenant
Colonel Planiran Parani were killed when the airforce attacked
Tiger positions north of Chalai. The other dead officials were
identified as Kadani Karusha, Arisi Thuiyawan and Thiseiarasi.
</P>
<P>
The airforce headquarters said they were confident of further
improving and expanding air strikes when they take delivery of
ordered aircraft and helicopter gunships following recent crisis
in Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil Tigers have been in a bloody war against the
government forces for 17 years in an ambitious attempt to create a
separate Tamil state in the north and east of the country. In late
April this year they captured series of government forces barracks
and pushed forward to Jaffna, a cultural city for minority Tamils.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Introduce Ethics Lesson in Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's education ministry
plans to make civics and morals compulsory for students at all
levels, the Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move is in response to Thai Queen Sirikit's remark on her
birthday last week that children were being supplied with
technical knowledge, but not ethics and morality.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Somsak Prisasananathakul was quoted as
saying that the plan could be introduced as early as the next
academic year, noting that it is in line with the education reform
policy which aims to improve academic excellence and morality.
</P>
<P>
The ministry would recruit professionals like monks and
spiritual leaders to handle the new subject, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the university level, it is likely the subject will bear no
credit, but students will not be able to graduate if they fail to
take the course.
</P>
<P>
Civics and morals, once a core subject, has been left out of
Thai schools for more than 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, India to Revise Air Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and India are moving
closer towards the revision of the existing Air Service Agreement
between the two countries signed three decades ago, The Kathmandu
Post said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A highly placed official at the Ministry of Culture, Tourism
and Civil Aviation was quoted as saying that civil aviation
authorities of the two countries have already exchanged proposal
for such a review.
</P>
<P>
"We are currently discussing proposals from two sides and
expect to reach final agreement soon," said Yagya Prasad Gautam,
joint secretary at the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Increasing operating points and enhancing air capacity have
been the issues for deliberation between the two sides, said
Gautum.
</P>
<P>
Increment in operating points is expected to further boost
Nepalese tourism industry through increased inflow of Indian
tourists, who account for more than one third of the total tourist
arrivals in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"We are demanding it (increasing operating points) because we
foresee a tremendous growth in the number of Indian holiday makers
years ahead," said Gautum.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Nepalese airplanes fly only to four Indian cities,
namely Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, and Varanasi. Nepal aspires to fly
her airlines to other Indian mega cities including Bangalore,
Hyderabad and Chennai.
</P>
<P>
Nepali officials expect the air capacity utilization to grow
with the addition of new operating points in India. The current
per week limit of 6,000 passengers is not fully utilized.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali civil aviation authority also propose for "beyond
point" flight permission facility, which means Nepal can pick up
passengers from Indian cities en route to third destination.
</P>
<P>
Nepal-India air agreement signed in 1964 has already been
revised three times in 1972, 1991 and 1997.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Celebrates 55th Independence Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia Thursday celebrated
the 55th anniversary of independence with a grand national
ceremony held at the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid, Vice-President Megawati
Soekarnoputri, Cabinet ministers, high-ranking government
officials, army chiefs and officers, diplomats and veteran
fighters wearing medals attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony opened with the booming of field guns at 10 a.m.
local time (03:00 GMT), the time in 1945 when Soekarno, Indonesia'
s first president, proclaimed independence after over three-and-
half centuries of Dutch colonial rule and four years of occupation
by the Japanese military during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
The text of independence proclamation was re-read by Amien Rais,
Chairman of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) followed by a
flag-hosting ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In his televised address to the nation on Wednesday night,
Wahid called for national reconciliation to stop the country from
tearing itself apart.
</P>
<P>
"We need national reconciliation so that we do not kill each
other as in several regions now, so that there are no fundamental
misunderstandings such as we are now experiencing, and most of all,
to prevent our disintegration as a nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said reconciliation would give meaning to the
commemoration of the state's independence anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Indonesians had been living for too long under pressure, under
rulers who did not deem it necessary to account to their people,
and served the narrow interest of the few.
</P>
<P>
"Now we leave this all and enter a new era, the era of
democracy," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The new era is also one of legal openness and the supremacy of
law in which all citizens stand equal in front of the law and
where tolerance reigns, he said, adding that national
reconciliation should be attained without sacrificing the
superiority of law, freedom of opinion and equality in front of
the law.

export, The Daily Star reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The outcome of the recent devaluation may only lead to higher
inflation without lasting benefits for competitiveness and
external performance, unless the action is quickly complemented by
prudent fiscal and monetary policies," said Ronald P. Hicks, IMF's
Resident Representative in Dhaka Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday the central Bangladesh Bank devalued taka by
about six percent to 54 taka against one dollar. In the past four
and a half years, Bangladesh devalued its currency by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hicks termed the rapidly-expanding fiscal deficit as the
principal culprit, suggesting immediate measures for boosting
revenues by increasing the prices of petroleum products, natural
gas, electricity and fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Currently the monetary expansion rate is almost 20 percent,
which not only threatens inflation ignition, but also reduction of
the country's external competitiveness, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Also, Debapriya Bhuattacharya, Executive Director of the Center
for Policy Dialogue, stressed the need for institutional reforms,
saying that price-related issues alone would not help change the
private investment and domestic savings scenarios.
</P>
<P>
Bhattacharya mentioned lack of fiscal equilibrium, faltering
manufacturing sector growth, stagnating domestic savings and
private investment and dampened export growth as major problems
the country is now facing.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the situation in some other areas including port,
customs and law and order is improved, devaluation may prove to be
self-defeating," Bhattacharya observed.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea is importing more
goods from Japan than from the United States, said the Commerce,
Industry and Energy Ministry on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, South Korea's imports from Japan
amounted to 15.9 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 20.2 percent
of its total imports.
</P>
<P>
Before this year, the United States was the largest exporter to
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Japanese electronic products were the most popular imported
items in South Korea, making up to 38.1 percent while machinery
accounted for 24.5 percent and petrochemical products 20 percent.
All together, these three sectors made up 83 percent of the
imports from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Machinery imports in the first six months soared 110 percent
from the same period last year.

<P>
South Korea registered a trade deficit of 6.1 billion dollars
with Japan in the first half of the year, up 50 percent from the
same period a year ago, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Minister Warns Against Right-wing Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Minister of the Interior
Ernst Strasser Wednesday warned against the spread of right-wing
extremists' violence from Germany to Austria, adding that Austria
will not tolerate it.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the local press, Strasser said Austria
has the toughest laws in Europe to prevent Nazism from reviving.
The establishment of organizations like the German National
Democratic Party is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
Strasser, however, expressed his concern that Austrian right-
wing extremists will move to Germany and other European countries
and that right-wing and Neo-Nazi violence in those countries would
boost the morale of Austrian right-wingers.
</P>
<P>
About 20 out of the 900 members of the National Democratic
Party in Bavaria, Germany, reportedly hold Austrian passports.
There have been indications that they hope to widen their
activities to Austria, according to the Austrian Press agency.
</P>
<P>
Strasser said he was relieved to see that no right-wing rioting
has taken place in Austria this year thanks to the population's
vigilance and legislation.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of violent cases against foreign immigrants,
including Jews, increased 48 percent during the first half of the
year, compared with the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Online Advertising to Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Web advertising in the
United States is expected to quadruple during the next four years,
despite the widespread talk of softening in the online ad market,
said a report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Online advertising revenue will reach 16.5 billion U.S. dollars
by 2005 from 3.5 billion dollars in 1999. That will put the
Internet the fourth-largest ad medium in the U.S., behind
television, radio and newspapers, and ahead of Yellow Pages,
magazines and cable advertising dollars, which currently dwarf
online spending, according to a report from the Internet research
firm Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, online ads will represent almost 8 percent of the
total U.S. advertising market.
</P>
<P>
The number of Internet ads that a Net surfer will be exposed to
is also expected to increase. The study found that by 2005, the
average person could view 950 marketing messages a day online.
</P>
<P>
This clutter will make it more difficult for advertisers to get
their message out. Therefore, advertisers will have to diversify
their ad models and online methods, including cross media
promotions and using both offline and online vehicles, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Jupiter estimates that in 2005, financial services, automotive,
computer hardware and software, travel, consumer packaged goods
and media companies will lead the categories for top spenders for
online advertising. Taking the lead will be media spending, from 1.
1 billion dollars this year to 2.4 billion dollars by 2005.

WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will stop in Tanzania during his African tour this month, the
White House announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the White House did not provide any details of Clinton's
trip to the East African country. It was reported that Clinton
will go to Tanzania on August 28 at the invitation of former South
African president Nelson Mandela, who is now mediator of the
Burundian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has set August 28 as the deadline for the signing of a
comprehensive peace agreement that will end the seven-year-old war
in Burundi. Clinton may join Mandela in Tanzania, where the
proposed agreement is expected to be signed, to show U.S. support
for the Burundi peace process.
</P>
<P>
Burundian President Pierre Buyoya flew to South Africa on
Monday for talks with Mandela after peace talks broke down in
Arusha, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is the second leg of Clinton's two-nation African trip.
The White House announced last month that Clinton would visit
Nigeria from August 25-27.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in Burundi has claimed at least 200,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Power Transmission Project be Built in NW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Planning
Commission of China recently approved construction of a 360-
kilovolt (kv) power transforming and transmitting project in
northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
The power transforming and transmitting line starts from Ulan
County and runs through Dulan, Xiangride and Nomhon and ends at
Golmud City with a total length of 391 kilometers. Over 80 percent
of the power transmission line will zigzag along the Qinghai-Tibet
highway.
</P>
<P>
The project will be divided into two phases and cost 602
million yuan. Nearly 80 percent of the funds will be provided by
the State Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
In the 2000-2001, workers will lay a 330-kv high-tension power
transmission line and erect a 150,000-kv transformer. Another 150,

<HEADLINE> Traces of Siberian Tigers Discovered in NE China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Traces of a female Siberian tiger
were recently found in the suburban area of Harbin, capital of
northeast Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The tigress is believed to have eaten five heads of cattle and
hurt two others.
</P>
<P>
According to historic records, this is the first time that a
Siberian tiger visited the city of Shangzhi, 200 kilometers from
Harbin, since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Local cattle herders said that they were breeding 60 head of
cattle in the forest. However, they found five head of cattle
missing and two others hurt in early August.
</P>
<P>
Yu Xiaochen, a research fellow with the Heilongjiang Provincial
Wild Animal Research Institute, said that judging by the
footprints and other traces left by the animal, as well as the
bodies of dead cattle, the animal could be an adult tigress.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the tigress might have chased after boars and roe deer
and finally came to Shangzhi County.
</P>
<P>
The Siberian tiger is an endangered species in the world. They
mainly live in northeast China and Siberia of Russia. China now
has less than 20 Siberian tigers.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Chinese Prefer Homey Apartments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Wang Wencheng and his wife Sun
Jingzhi were immersed in happiness these days -- they just moved
into a private apartment for the elderly in Tianjin together with
their furniture and domestic appliances.
</P>
<P>
"We want a new home, not just a new apartment," Wang said. But
it is interesting that Wang and his wife seem to move about their
new apartment with the same familiarity they had when they lived
in their old one.
</P>
<P>
"We have reformed the management of retirement homes to make
the elderly people feel at home," said Wang Yingmei, an official
with Tianjin municipal social welfare office.
</P>
<P>
Wang's resthome is not the only one in Tianjin that tries to be
more homey. Besides equipping the flat with the lodgers' own
furniture, the caretakers of these apartments for the elderly have
taken various steps to cater to the increasing demands for better
services.
</P>
<P>
They offer lodgers with around-the-clock services like ordered
meals and visiting doctors. Experts on gerontics do a scientific
examination on each person according to their case studies. They
also enjoy being with many lively students who visit them
regularly.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has about 1.24 million people who are above the age of
60. They account for 13 percent of the municipality's 9.6 million
people. A survey indicated that more than 10,000 elderly people in
the municipality prefer living in a resthome.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that this type of apartment for the elderly has
created a new form of retirement home in China.
</P>
<P>
China has some 126 million people above 60, making up 10
percent of the country's total population.
</P>
<P>
Chinese used to take it for granted that the aged parents
should live with their children and were supported and taken care
of by them. The tradition is fading away as the nuclear family is
gradually taking the place of the big family, and their adult
children are busier with work.
</P>
<P>
The one-child family planning policy adopted in 1970s makes
more parents realize that it would be a hard job for a young
couple to support four old people at the same time.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that a growing number of elderly people,
especially those who are better-off in cities, are living in the
retirement homes.

<HEADLINE> Old Industrial Base Pledges to Make Way out This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, one of the country's traditional industrial bases, is
expected to succeed in getting most large and medium-sized State-
owned enterprises (SOEs) out of financial difficulty by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guoguang, governor of the province, said that Liaoning
has made great progress in reaching the goal. Large and medium-
sized SOEs and holding companies of SOEs in the province
registered nearly 4.3 billion yuan in profits during the first
half of this year, 9.5 times the figure for the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The SOE reform and the efforts to extricate themselves from the
predicament started in 1998 have been the focus of the economic
work in Liaoning Province, home to one-tenth of China's large and
medium-sized SOEs.
</P>
<P>
The SOEs and holding companies of SOEs in the province have
reported an accumulated profit of 1.3 billion yuan in 1999, ending
57 consecutive months of loss-making.
</P>
<P>
The favorable growth momentum continued this year as the coal
and non-ferrous metal industries and military enterprises are
showing signs of turning deficits into profits.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of the large and medium-sized SOEs in the
province have turned themselves into viable firms with modern
enterprise mechanisms and 7.4 percent of them have been listed
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Technological renovation also gave old enterprises a much
better chance of restoring their former glory. Anshan and Benxi
iron and steel companies, two of China's steel giants, have had
their major equipment meet international standards during the
1990s and are ready to compete with foreign competitors.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that Liaoning has set up economic and trade ties
with more than 150 countries and regions around the world. More
than 100 of the world's top 500 businesses have opened branches in
the province. More than half of the SOEs in the province have
become joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The import and export trade of the province is expected to make
a historical breakthrough, he said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is working on an independent social
insurance system to create a better climate for its SOEs which are
undertaking reform and trying to make up deficits and increase
surplus.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt to Maintain Free Trade Policy in Energy Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will
continue to pursue its free trade policy in the energy sector
despite a current hike in domestic oil prices, the Thai News
Agency (TNA) said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Minister to the Prime Minister's Office Savit Pothivihok was
quoted as saying that the government has no policy to intervene in
the existing free trade system in the local energy sector, but
would just ask the state-run Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT)
to negotiate with energy firms in which it has stakes to
temporarily reduce oil supply costs to the PTT.
</P>
<P>
Savit's remarks followed local prices of gasoline jumping to
over 17 baht (about 0.425 U.S.dollars) a liter, the highest
recorded level over the past years, due to a continued increase in
prices of imported refined oil from Singapore, Thailand's major
energy source in the region.
</P>
<P>
The government was also considering not to use oil prices in
Singapore as a key base in adjusting local oil prices, as current
prices of refined oil in Singapore are affected by vulnerability
of oil refineries in the region, namely Indonesia, Kuwait and
Taiwan, and, thus, are 9 to 10 U.S.dollars a barrel higher than
crud oil, forcing Thai authorities to have to increase local
prices unrealistically, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
The minister affirmed, however, that retail prices of cooking
gas would be curbed at current prices until the end of this year
to ease consumers' burden.
</P>
<P>
Savit also said that the current hike of domestic oil prices
would not affect the country's economic growth, targeted at 4-5
percent this year, as the Office of the National Economic and
Social Development Board had indicated that the Thai economy would
slow down 0.3 percent only if oil prices this year average stood
at 29 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The average oil price of 29 dollars a barrel this year means
that crude oil prices in the world market will have to surpass 32
dollars a barrel over the rest of the year, which is unlikely, he
pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Exports Hit Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Romania's exports in the first
six months rose 27.4 percent to a record high of 4.91 billion U.S.
dollars, state media quoted the statistics office as saying
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts forecast that the country's export volume in the year
is likely to exceed 8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the increase to the depreciation of the
currency and an export tax cut. In the first six months, the
country's currency, the leu, lost 17 percent of its value, and the
export tax dropped significantly from 25 percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trade with the Central European free trade zone and the
European Union increased. Romania's exports to the two areas went
up 55.9 percent and 21.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The country's main trading partners are Italy, Germany, France,
Russia, Britain and Hungary.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Urges End of War After Children Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres
Pastrana on Wednesday called on rebel forces to start a ceasefire
as soon as possible following the deaths of six children on
Tuesday during an army attack against the rebel National
Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
Pastrana made the call in the capital when inaugurating a
clinic of the Colombian Institute of Family Well-being, one day
after six schoolchildren lost their lives during an operation of
the army in a rural zone in Antioquia department, in the northwest
of the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged the insurgents to sign as soon as possible
humanitarian agreements to save the civilian population from the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot permit their sacrifice to go to waste. We cannot
permit one more day to go by in which the tender and innocent
future of Colombia continues dying under the bullets, the
cylinders and the bombs," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He promised to investigate the case. "I will personally see
that necessary investigations are made until any responsibility
that may exist for these terrible events is clarified and the
culprits are punished," he said.
</P>
<P>
The children, aged between 6 and 11, were killed when they were
on a hike with 40 other schoolchildren. Four other children were
injured, together with two teachers and eight parents who were
accompanying them.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy occurred when the troops of an army brigade were
carrying out an operation against the ELN "Che Guevara" Front.

BOGOTA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Fernando Rincon, former mayor of

<HEADLINE> Teenager Vendt Sets National Mark to Win 1,500m Freestyle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Erik Vendt claimed his first
Olympic tickcet by setting a new national mark in the last final
at the U.S. Olympic swimming trials which concluded in
Indianapolis Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old swimmer, who became the ninth men teenager
Olympian from the trials, clocked 14:59.11 for a national record
to savor his victory in the men's 1,500m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
However, his winning timing is still far away from the world
mark of 14:41.66 set by Kieren Perkins of Australia on August 24,
1994.
</P>
<P>
Claiming the second spot was Chris Thompson who timed in 15:09.
16, beating Robert Margalis to third in 15:13.59.
</P>
<P>
In the women's last event of the 50m freestyle, Dara Torres,
who came out of a seven-year retirement, claimed the title in 24.
90 at the absence of chief rival Jenny Thompson.
</P>
<P>
This was the third straight Olympic berth for the veteran
swimmer who is to compete her record-setting fourth Olympic Games
since 1984, following two second-place finishes in the 100m
butterfly and 100m freestyle behind Thompson.
</P>
<P>
Amy Van Dyken, 27, also made her first outing to the Olympic
Games by
finishing second in the 50m freestyle in 24.99.
</P>
<P>
As the trials concluded today, a total of nine national records
were broken without a single world record.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Enjoys Brisk Tourism Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
a mysterious place in the eyes of many Chinese and foreign
visitors, received a record 1.4 million Chinese and 26,000
tourists from other countries in July.
</P>
<P>
The region gained a monthly tourist income of 1.1 billion yuan
domestically and 10 million U.S. dollars from overseas tourists,
said Naim Yasin, director of the regional tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
The source of visitors has expanded from southern China's
Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai Municipality to the
whole of northwest China as well as Sichuan and Shandong provinces,
Taiwan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Apart from sightseeing, nearly one-fifth of tourists made spot
investigations, sought business partners and negotiated with the
local government departments on projects for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Xinjiang also spent their summer holidays touring
picturesque Kanas Lake, Narat Grassland and Swan Lake.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang was also known as "Xiyu" (western territory) in
ancient times. The ancient Silk Road was divided into three major
routes in Xinjiang. Numerous historical monuments along the Silk
Road still can be seen today. The landscape of Xinjiang varies
immensely, ranging from spectacular snow-crowned mountains to the
boundless lush grassland and from the vast expanse of desert to
charming oasises and deep serene lakes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Securities Giant Debuts Through Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China has formed a super large
brokerage firm by merging several smaller ones so as to compete
with international brokerages after entering the World Trade
Organization (WTO), China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
China Galaxy Securities Co., the only State-owned brokerage
firm in China, was formed on Wednesday by merging the securities
departments and operation outlets of China Huarong, China Great
Wall, China Orient, China Cinda and People's Insurance trust and
investment corps.
</P>
<P>
With registered capital of 4.5 billion yuan (about 542.2
million U.S. dollars) and 174 outlets nationwide, China Galaxy far
exceeds the second largest securities house, Guotai J &AMP; A, which
has 3.7 billion yuan (about 445.8 million U.S. dollars) of
registered capital and 117 operation outlets.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of this super large brokerage firm is aimed
to prepare China's brokerage sector for the impending competition
to come with China's WTO accession.
</P>
<P>
In terms of capital, scope and service, Chinese brokerage firms
are still lagging far behind their international rivals that
commonly possess assets of several hundred billion US dollars, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Paper Calls for Preserving the Urban Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The English-language newspaper
China Daily has called for preserving the historic sites in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
Chinese cities have witnessed remarkable changes in the past 20
years of reform and urbanization. While futuristic skyscrapers and
trendy shopping centers multiply, it seems the traditional look
and feel of the city is receding.
</P>
<P>
"These places are the best material record of our past and
identity and should be protected," the paper said in its opinion
page.
</P>
<P>
An example of the loss was the demolition of the old city
blocks of Zhoushan, a city of East China's Zhejiang Province. The
area was famous for its intact Qing Dynasty (1644-1911)
architecture. Its picturesque residential districts were once used
as the setting for the film "The Opium War."
</P>
<P>
A national survey conducted by the Historical Cities Research
Committee revealed that four cultural sites under State protection
have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The main problem confronting historical sites is how to strike
a balance between economic development an cultural preservation."
Solutions do exist. The preservation of our historical urban
fabric is not necessarily anathema to development," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Preserving the past may incur a large costs for local
governments, but it will also create new sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited the example of the ancient Pingyao city. Before
added to the list of UNESCO world Cultural Heritage sites in 1997,
the city's annual tourism income was less than 200,000 yuan. The
figure exceeded 5 million yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the country needs more than profit-motivated reasoning
to save threatened ancient sites.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the harsh realities of cultural preservation, there is
some hope for the future of the remaining ancient city blocks,"
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing municipal government was reported to adopt a new
relic protection policy to protect 25 sections of the old city. "
This is a late blessing for the cultural sites in our capital, but
may lead the way for other cities."
</P>
<P>
"After all, it is never too late to try to correct the mistakes
of the past," the paper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia Wednesday accused Washington of multiplying the sufferings
of the Afghans by leveling allegations about the presence of "
terrorist camps" as well as Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
"We once again ask the United States to stop baseless
propaganda and not to increase the miseries of Afghans," Afghan
Foreign Ministry said in a statement which was released by the
Afghan embassy here.
</P>
<P>
In response to recent U.S. State Department spokesman remarks
accusing Taliban of sponsoring terrorism and sheltering alleged
terrorist Osama bin Laden the statement said, "We are fighting
against terrorism and we consider terrorism as an un-Islamic and
inhuman act."
</P>
<P>
"Regarding terrorist camps, we have repeatedly said that there
is no terrorist camp and our doors are opened for any one to come
and see if there is any camp," it said.
</P>
<P>
On Osama, the statement said he came to Afghanistan before
Taliban took over. "We have controlled Osama. He can not work
against any country from Afghan soil."

<HEADLINE> Argentina Tries to Keep out Foot-and-Mouth Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Argentina has taken a
series of measures to prevent foot-and-mouth disease from entering
the country as the virus of the epizootic has been detected in
some cattle illegally introduced from Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
The National Service of Sanitation and Agricultural Food
Quality published an order Wednesday in the Official Gazette for
intensifying physical and documental control and identification of
the commercial remittances for the products of animal authorized
to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
The agency also sent a report to the international epizootic
organization in charge of granting the sanitary status to
agriculture and livestock products.
</P>
<P>
Argentina was certified in May as "country without foot-and-
mouth disease without vaccination," which opened the door of the
international market for its beef.
</P>
<P>
However, the possibility of an outbreak of the disease in the
country forced it to suspend beef export to the United States,
Canada, Chile, Uruguay, and delay negotiations with Mexico, South
Korea, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that if the situation continues until year-end,
the total loss to Argentina would amount to more than 130 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Germany off to Dream Start Under New Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- New coach Rudi Voeller scored a
dream start on Wednesday as Germany routed Euro 2000 quarter-
finalists Spain 4-1 in a friendly in Hanover on the first big
night of international soccer action of the new season.
</P>
<P>
Two goals each from Mehmet Scholl and Alexander Zickler meant
that Voeller became the first coach since Jupp Derwall in 1978 to
guide Germany to victory in his first match in charge.
</P>
<P>
Spain were fielding a new-look side after coach Jose Antonio
Camacho dropped 14 players from his squad, and never really got
going. Raul scored a 70th minute consoaltion goal when they were
already 4-0 down.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen friendlies were played across the continent with many
countries making their final preparations before their World Cup
qualifying campaigns begin next month.
</P>
<P>
World Champions France, playing their first match since winning
the European Championship on July 2, outclassed the FIFA World
Stars 5-1 in Marseille.
</P>
<P>
David Trezeguet, who scored the golden goal winner, produced a
hat-trick and Robert Pires and Nicolas Anelka added the others.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Baggio scored for FIFA with a penalty seconds after
Anelka had put France 5-0 up 11 minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, beaten 2-1 by France in the semifinals in Brussels,
were other impressive winners, demolishing Lithuania 5-1 in Viseu
after a slow start.
</P>
<P>
Goals from Joao Pinto, Luis Figo, Rui Costa, Roberto Severo and
Pedro Resendes gave Portugal a well-deserved win over Lithuania
whose goal came from the penalty spot.
</P>
<P>
In other matches, Finland beat Norway 3-1 in Helsinki and
Bosnia scored a surprise 2-0 win over Euro 2000 quarter-finlaists
Turkey in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, the co-hosts who suffered the disappointment of being
knocked out by Turkey in the tournament, bounced back with a 3-1
win over Bulgaria in Sofia.
</P>
<P>
There was also a surprise win for Iceland, who beat Sweden 2-1
in Reykjavik thanks to an 84th minute penalty from Helgi
Sigurdsson.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rejects Israeli Sovereignty Over Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Wednesday firmly rejected Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem
which it considered part of the Arab land captured by the Jewish
state in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
Abdullah reaffirmed the importance of Jerusalem's position in the
Arab and Muslim world, and noted the future of the holy city should
be addressed in line with U.N. resolutions 242 and 338.
</P>
<P>
The monarch said a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the
Middle East should live up to the legitimate rights of all parties,
and the international legitimacy is the sole option for the states
and peoples to solve the long-term conflicts in the region.
</P>
<P>
The King stressed the need to overcome the difficulties in the
peace process, to achieve peace and to meet the Palestinians'
aspirations, including the establishment of an independent state
with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Barak briefed Abdullah on the latest developments in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks following the collapse of the July
trilateral summit in the U.S. Camp David between Barak himself, U.
S. President Bill Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The two-week summit failed to reach any agreement on the thorny
issues, such as the future of Jerusalem, borders, refugees and
security arrangements, between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah emphasized Jordan's principled stand on the Palestinian
refugees' rights to return to their homeland and get compensation.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Jordan has taken in some 1.5 million Palestinian
refugees, most of whom were given Jordanian citizenship, but the
government said it does not mean the refugees have given up their
rights to return home.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by Jordan's Crown Prince Hamza Bin
Hussein, Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Ali Abul Ragheb,
Chief of the Royal Court Fayez Tarawneh, Foreign Minister Abdul
Ilah al-Khatib and other senior Jordanian officials.
</P>
<P>
Barak expressed appreciation for Abdullah's efforts to push
forward the peace process, and for Jordan's commitment to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He left Amman after the brief visit to Jordan Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel and its Arab
neighbors since they signed a peace treaty in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Currently Jordan and Egypt are the only two Arab countries to
have reached such a peace deal with the Jewish state.

JOHANNESBURG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- South African Provincial
and Local Government Minister Sydney Mufamadi said on Friday that
the differences between the government and traditional leaders
regarding proposed municipal border changes would be resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
President Thabo Mbeki would meet with traditional leaders

Mufamadi said both sides were working on the dispute.
</P>
<P>
"The government will do what needs to be done for the (upcoming
municipal) elections (in November) to be successful," he said.
</P>

Mufamadi said South Africa's three-tier system of governance at
national, provincial and local government had to co-exist with the
traditional leadership.
</P>
<P>
Local traditional leaders are opposed to the government
demarcation plan which would reduce the areas traditionally
controlled by the leaders.

published Friday the anti-personnel mines prohibition bill which
will make it an offence for anyone to produce, stockpile, transfer

<P>
The penalty for contravening the convention is a fine not
exceeding 2,000 U.S. dollars or imprisonment for a period not

<HEADLINE> Teachers Demand 400 Percent Pay Rise In Malawi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Teachers in Malawi are demanding
a 400 percent pay rise to cope with the prevailing economic crisis
in the country, a report reaching here said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The demand was put forward by executive secretary of the
Teachers Union of Malawi, Alfred Kamhonje, in a memorandum to the
Office of the President and the education, science and technology
ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, which was released to the press, the
current minimum monthly salary of 1,400 kwacha (about 25 U.S.
dollars) was too little for a teacher to survive.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that teachers should be paid a minimum monthly
salary of 5,930 kwacha (about 104 dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The working budget at the present salary assumes that the
teacher will forgo clothing, school fees for children, medication,
church offerings, tea, salt, radio and television," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kamphonje added that low pay had forced most teachers in Malawi
to opt for the private sector since they cannot make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the fall in the standard of education in the
country to lack of motivation among teachers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the secretary to the Cabinet, Alfred Upindi,
described the teachers' salary increment demand as unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
"Meeting their demands would be tantamount to crashing the
economy," he said, adding that accepting them would create a chain
reaction in other sectors of the civil service.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Police Expose Passport Syndicate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police detectives have
unearthed a passport racket at the country's Immigration
Department which helps about 100 Somalis migrate illegally to
Europe every week, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The racket which began their operation in 1997, was exposed on
August 10 when senior officials at the Jomo Kenyatta International
Airport in the capital Nairobi became suspicious of the mass
exodus of Somalis.
</P>
<P>
Police laid a trap and seized 12 Somalis and two of the
racketeers who are also non-Kenyans, the paper said, adding that
the racket is run by a syndicate of immigration officials, a
Nairobi politician and some officers from the Criminal
Investigation Department.
</P>
<P>
The syndicate charges each immigrant 4,000 U.S. dollars which
covers identity and travel documents and a one-way air ticket to
Turkey, via Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
After handing over their cash, the Somalis are first given
Kenyan birth certificates and national identity cards, needed by
anyone who applies for a Kenyan passport.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday evening, the paper said, the country's Registrar of
Persons had scrutinized identity cards of nine of those being held
and confirmed they were not registered as Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations showed that between 3,000 and 4,000
Somali immigrants had illegally acquired Kenyan passports each
year to enable them to immigrate to Europe.

HARARE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
identified an additional 229 farms for designation, bringing the
total number of farms identified for resettlement so far to 3,270.
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary notice for compulsory acquisition of the farms,
Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement Joseph Made

writing, with my ministry."
</P>
<P>
The government already identified 3,041 farms gazetted for
acquisition at the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
Clarifying the issue of the removal of people who have occupied
commercial farms throughout the country, Presidential Press
Secretary George Charamba said the government's policy is to move
war veterans who presently occupy farms that they don't wish to
acquire.
