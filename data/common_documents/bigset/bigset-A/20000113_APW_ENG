<HEADLINE> Maine House Fire Kills Three Kids  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITY, Maine (AP) -- Seven-year-old triplet boys died when their house caught
fire Wednesday afternoon, authorities said. Their mother escaped with another
child and yelled to firefighters that her sons were still inside, but
firefighters couldn't reach them.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters were recovering the bodies of the three brothers from the
gutted home late Wednesday night, Stephen McCausland of the Maine Public Safety
Department said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unity Fire Chief Dennis A. Turner identified the triplets as Josh, Marcus
and Brydon Freyer.
</P>
<P>
	   The mother, Carmen Freyer, 28, was hospitalized in good condition, and the
other child was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
	   John Dean, the state fire marshal, said after the fire was extinguished that
the house ``still has walls and part of the roof, but it's destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said it was too early to tell the cause of the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Waldo County Sheriff Robert M. Jones, 48, who responded to the call as a
firefighter, collapsed near the home and later died at Maine General Medical
Center in Waterville, a hospital spokesman said. The cause of death was not
available, but McCausland said it was believed to be a heart attack.

<HEADLINE> Twice As Many Americans by 2100  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A century from now there will be twice as many Americans
as today, the Census Bureau predicts.
</P>
<P>
	   While no one knows what daily life will be like in 100 years, the new
population projections being issued Thursday conjure images of twice as many
cars jostling for position on the highways and twice as many shoppers crowding
the aisles at Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
	   From an estimated 275 million people today, the bureau projects a U.S.
population of 571 million in the year 2100. That might not seem terribly
crowded, however, because the nation is so sprawling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you look at the density for the United States, we are not even coming
close to the densities that you see in Europe,'' said Census statistician
Tammany J. Mulder.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. population density in 2100 would be 161.4 people per square mile,
about one-fourth the current population density of Germany and the United
Kingdom, Mulder said.
</P>
<P>
	   The increase is expected even though childbearing rates in the United States
are only about what is necessary to replace the current population.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The increasing number of potential parents and continued migration from
abroad would be sufficient to add nearly 300 million people during the next
century,'' said Census Bureau analyst Frederick W. Hollmann.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the population will be older -- with some 5.3 million folks over
the age of 100 -- and include a larger share of minorities, led by Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because the Hispanic and Asian and Pacific Islander populations in the
U.S. are younger than the nation as a whole and because they continue to receive
international migrants, these populations will become increasingly prominent,''
Hollman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Census projectioncalls for the nation's population to probably reach 300
million in 2011, 400 million in 2049 and 500 million in 2081.
</P>
<P>
	   By comparison, the U.S. population was 5.3 million in 1800 and 75.9 million
in 1900.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations, in its own projections, expects the world's population
to rise from the current 6 billion to about 9.4 billion in 2100.
</P>
<P>
	   The age breakdown of America would look different in 2100, Mulder noted,
with a more uniform distribution and more elderly people as medical care
lengthens lifespan.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, currently the Baby Boom generation creates a bulge in the U.S.
population at ages 35 to 39 and 40 to 44, the only two segments making up more
than 8 percent of the total. And today's population includes just 65,000 people
aged 100 and over, 0.02 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
	   By 2100 the over-100 crowd is expected to grow to 0.9 percent of the total,
and no five-year age group will even reach 7 percent of all Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest age group is expected to be those aged 15 to 19, at 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The projections show an especially rapid surge in the elderly population as
the surviving baby boomers pass age 65. In the year 2011, baby boomers -- those
born between 1946 and 1964 -- will begin turning 65.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 2011 and 2030, the number of elderly would rise from 40.4 million,
13 percent of the population, to 70.3 million, 20 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
	   The projections call for the number of children under 18 to increase from
70.2 million in 1999 to 95.7 million in 2050.	   The median age in 2100 is
expected to be 40.3, compared to the current 35.8. Median means half of all
Americans will be older than that and half younger.
</P>
<P>
	   Projections about race include:
</P>
<P>
	   --The Hispanic population is expected to triple from 31.4 million in 1999 to
98.2 million in 2050. By 2005, Hispanics could become the nation's largest
minority group with their percentage rising from 12 percent in 1999 to 24
percent in 2050.
</P>
<P>
	   --The Asian and Pacific Islander population, meanwhile, would more than
triple, from 10.9 million in 1999 to 37.6 million in 2050. Its percentage of the
total population would rise from 4 percent now to 9 percent in 2050.
</P>
<P>
	   --The non-Hispanic white population would rise 9 percent, from 196.1 million
in 1999 to 213.0 million in 2050. Its share of the total population would
decline, however, from 72 percent in 1999 to 53 percent in 2050.
</P>
<P>
	   --The black population would rise from 34.9 million in 1999 to 59.2 million
in 2050, a 70-percent increase. Under this projection,the black share of the
total population would increase slightly, from 13 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The projections for racial and ethnic groups are given only through 2050
because they are considered less reliable for the latter parts of the century.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 1999 and 2050, the total number of foreign-born Americans would more
than double, from 26 million to 53.8 million, to make up 13 percent of the
population.

<HEADLINE> Rams' Fletcher Has New Nickname  </HEADLINE>
    By R.B. FALLSTROM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- London Fletcher has a new nickname, and the game to back
it up.
</P>
<P>
	   The St. Louis Rams' first-year starter isn't bashful, often calling himself
the best middle linebacker in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think when you have the No. 1 run defense in the league and I'm the
leading tackler on that defense, I feel like I'm definitely the best in the
league," Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
	   To that end, in midseason he asked teammates to stop calling him Fletch and
refer to him as "dot.com."
</P>
<P>
	   "Because I feel like on Sundays, I'm on line with the other team," Fletcher
said. "I'm into their playbooks, so it's dot.com."
</P>
<P>
	   Teammates don't want Fletcher getting too carried away.
</P>
<P>
	   "He'll never get me to call him that," outside linebacker Mike Jones said.
"A few call him that, but not me."
</P>
<P>
	   But that's not to say they don't recognize his value to the Rams' underrated
defense.
</P>
<P>
	   "For an entire season, I haven't seen anybody play better than him," Jones
said. "I thought he should have made the Pro Bowl."
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Dick Vermeil certainly is in his corner. Vermeil gives Fletcher, a
former undrafted free agent who was the team's top special teams player last
year, the highest praise.
</P>
<P>
	   "He is to our defense what Kurt Warner is to our offense," Vermeil said.
"London is a very, very fine player."
</P>
<P>
	   Fletcher came from nowhere just like Warner, who emerged as the NFL MVP
after spending time in the Arena League and NFL Europe. Fletcher is undersized
at 6-foot and 240 pounds, and he had to beat out Lorenzo Styles and Charlie
Clemons in training camp for the middle linebacker job.
</P>
<P>
	   He quickly showed Vermeil he'd made the right choice, building a reputation
of flying to the ball and making plays. He totaled 138 tackles, 80 of them solo
stops, and led the team in tackles eight times. Fletcher also had three sacks
and forced a fumble.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Fletcher was selected to the all-Madden team. That made
up for his disappointment at being only a Pro Bowl second alternate.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's more respected to be all-Madden around the league," Fletcher
said. "Madden is a former coach and he knows the game, so I think it's more
prestigious to me than the Pro Bowl because you have a guy selecting it that
really knows football."
</P>
<P>
	   He has the same attitude toward media that remain skeptical of the Rams
because they didn't beat a team with a winning record all season. Fletcher
points out the team's average winning margin of 33-15, second-best in league
history.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've known all along that we're a good team," Fletcher said. "You don't
beat the teams the way we've beaten them so convincingly without being a good
team."
</P>
<P>
	   Fletcher has been known to celebrate a bit after big plays, and he relishes
the opportunity to show his ability to the nation. The Rams haven't been on
Monday Night Football since they moved to St. Louis in 1995, and Fletcher is
looking forward to "chasing around" Robert Smith, Randy Moss, Cris Carter, Jake
Reed and Jeff George.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's something I'll have to take in," Fletcher said. "Nothing is guaranteed
next year, so you have to just enjoy every moment of it."

<HEADLINE> Three Teens Dead After Garage Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- Two teen-age sisters and a young friend were found dead
Wednesday after a flash fire in a sealed garage room in their suburban Oklahoma
City home, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators found a can of gasoline spilled in the room and a small
electric space heater, police Sgt. Scott Singer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Firefighters, who had to use a key to get into the room, found the bodies of
Fallon Brown, 16, her sister, Brandi, 13, and friend Shelly Franklin, 12.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is thought that the space heater may have ignited the concentrated gas
fumes that created a flash fire, killing the girls,'' Singer said. The fire
apparently ``snuffed itself out due to a lack of oxygen or explosive force
confined in the small space.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Brown girls' mother called police about 4:30 p.m. after arriving home
and smelling smoke and being unable to find her daughters, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire investigators were still at the scene late Wednesday, and an autopsy
was planned to determine the causes of the girls' deaths, Singer said.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes 3, Penguins 1  </HEADLINE>
    By MEL REISNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Shane Doan broke up goalie Jean-Sebastien Aubin's shutout
bid in the second period, and the Phoenix Coyotes went on to a 3-1 victory over
the Pittsburgh Penguins on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Rick Tocchet added a power-play goal and Keith Tkachuk scored on a penalty
shot in the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   Sean Burke improved to 3-1-1 with the Coyotes, who acquired him in a trade
with Florida in November. He stopped 21 shots and weathered eight Pittsburgh
power plays for the win, but lost his shutout when NHL scoring leader Jaromir
Jagr scored his 33rd goal 8:10 into the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal was the 19th point in the last 10 games for Jagr, who had two goals
in a 4-2 win over the Coyotes on Dec. 11 in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes recovered from a seven-game stretch in which they were outshot
by opponents by an average of 14 shots a game. This time, they bettered the
Penguins 27-22, avenging not only the loss but the embarrassment of an 11-shot
game that set a Pittsburgh franchise record for fewest shots by an opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   Tocchet got his ninth goal -- and the 420th of his career, leaving him one
point shy of 900 -- when he banged into Penguins defenseman Hans Jonsson just as
a slap shot by Trevor Letowski arrived at the top of the crease. The puck hit
Tocchet's skate and went in 3:04 into the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   Tkachuk made it 3-0 just 2:16 later after Darius Kasparaitis dragged him
down at Aubin's doorstep. Tkachuk, stopped by current Phoenix goalie Bob Essensa
on his first career penalty shot Jan. 24, 1998, against Edmonton, took a
forehand approach to the net, then fired a sharp wrist shot between Aubin's
legs.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, New York's Brad Isbister scored on a penalty against Phoenix
during a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
	   Aubin stopped 12 shots in the first period, one more than the Coyotes took
their first game against the Penguins. Aubin made 24 saves in all.
</P>
<P>
	   But even though Pittsburgh had five power plays in the second period to two
for the Coyotes, the pace caught up with the 22-year-old goalie.
</P>
<P>
	   Doan sent Phoenix into a 1-0 lead with 8:35 left in the second. He got the
puck from Mika Alatalo, who fielded the rebound of a slap shot by Yuha Ylonen,
and skated to his left for a 10-foot forehand that beat Aubin on the near side.

<HEADLINE> Coke Unveils New Ad Campaign  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Coca-Cola is betting that its "Enjoy" advertising theme
will put some pop in sales of its top-selling flagship soft drink even though
rival Pepsi is already singing about "The Joy of Cola" in its ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola Co., the world's biggest soft drink concern, unveiled its new
slogan along with 10 TV commercials and 19 radio ads for its bottlers on
Wednesday, saying the new approach will help it reconnect with consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   At first glance, the "Coca-Cola. Enjoy" theme may appear to echo the less
specific "Joy of Cola" line that its biggest U.S. rival, Pepsi-Cola Co.,
introduced less than a year ago for its flagship Pepsi brand.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ian Rowden, advertising director for Atlanta-based Coke, said there is
little chance consumers will confuse the messages.
</P>
<P>
	   "They come from totally different perspectives," he said in discussing the
new ads earlier this week. "Ours is all about our ability to connect with
people. It's an invitation to people to enjoy what they do."
</P>
<P>
	   Coke has periodically used "enjoy" on its packaging, but Coke officials said
this is the first time it has been used as the brand's ad theme.
</P>
<P>
	   Television and radio commercials in the new campaign begin appearing Monday
in the United States and are already running in some overseas markets. Coca-Cola
declines to say how much it is spending to run the ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The new theme replaces the "Always Coca-Cola" campaign which has been
appearing since 1993. Coke executives said that campaign has worked well but it
was time for a change.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of the flagship Coca-Cola brand were up an average 6.7 percent a year
worldwide in the first six years of the "Always" campaign but sales growth
slowed last year, according to Coke spokesman Bob Bertini.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the magnitude of the slowdown has not yet been disclosed but
attributed it to the impact of economic conditions overseas, the recall of
Coca-Cola products in France and Belgium due to a health scare, and to price
competition in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, Coca-Cola Classic accounted for 20.6 percent of
carbonated soft drink sales in the United States in 1998, well ahead of the
second-place Pepsi at 14.2 percent, according to figures from the trade
publication Beverage Digest. The 1999 figures aren't in yet.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Coke's share was the same in 1998 as a year earlier and down
from 20.8 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The theme change is part of a broader marketing overhaul that has included a
makeover of the imagery used in the Coca-Cola logo and packaging which now shows
the cap popping off and the drink splashing out.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Frenette, Coca-Cola's chief marketing officer, said the changes are
designed to point up the unique sensory experience of drinking a Coke -- the
bubbles, the fragrance and the chill.
</P>
<P>
	   That is a recurring theme in the 10 new TV ads as well.
</P>
<P>
	   In one ad, a man steps up to a cafe bar and the house parrot perched nearby
mimics the sound of a bottle being opened, poured and gulped. The man grows
thirstier but before he can order, the waitress shows up with a bottle of
Coca-Cola. "Enjoy," the parrot cackles.
</P>
<P>
	   In another ad, three boys in a dusty village in Morocco wait for a delivery
of Coca-Cola and wonder how it will taste.
</P>
<P>
	   "My father says it's just like kissing a girl," one boy says. After a truck
arrives, the oldest boy takes a bottle out of a cooler and drinks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is it like kissing a girl?" the younger boys ask their 12- or 13-year-old
friend. The older boy replies, "I hope so."
</P>
<P>
	   Dancers appear to be performing inside a bubbly bottle of Coke in another
ad, energetically moving through tap, hip-hop, merengue and modern dance
routines. Teens dive down a waterfall to retrieve Coke bottles buried in the
frothy water below in another ad.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola also has developed 19 radio ads which feature multiple
interpretations -- mainstream, urban, Tejano, reggae, country and others -- of a
melody written for the new campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Four of the TV ads including the one with the parrot and the one with the
three boys were created by the agency Leo Burnett while the remaining six come
from Edge Creative, which was responsible the much of the "Always" campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The polar bears who first appeared in the "Always" campaign have survived
the change in ad theme -- the parent bears roust two cubs to sit on the snowy
tundra and watch fireworks while sipping Coca-Cola in the new ad.

<HEADLINE> H&AMP;R Block Launches Expansion  </HEADLINE>
    By DANA FIELDS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- H&AMP;R Block Inc. is hoping an aggressive new
advertising campaign will convince its customers that it is more than just a tax
preparation company.
</P>
<P>
	   The $100 million campaign and a new Refund Rewards program that debuted
Wednesday also are designed to help Block spread its profits beyond tax season.
The Kansas City company typically has three money-losing quarters a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our core business is as strong as ever, but it's seasonally oriented, and
the rest of the year we have this wonderful distribution system of 9,000 offices
we really don't use efficiently," chief executive Frank Salizzoni said from New
York, where Block executives were deployed Wednesday to call attention to the
new campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Block has been on a three-year buying spree of accounting and investment
firms, including discount brokerage Olde Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Block aired the first of 21 new commercials on Tuesday night's edition of
ABC's popular "Who Wants to Be A Millionaire," then announced Wednesday the
opening of 94 Block Financial Centers around the country. Some of the centers --
more of which will open in the coming year -- formerly housed Olde Financial
offices, others were Block Tax offices.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, with revenue of $1.3 billion last year, hopes to nudge some of
its 16.5 million tax preparation customers toward its other products, including
financial planning and software.
</P>
<P>
	   Customers at the Block Financial Centers will be able to talk not only with
tax preparers but with brokers and financial planners, Salizzoni said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company makes no secret of its target clients. It commissioned a Gallup
poll, released Wednesday, that found 48 percent of households with more than
$20,000 in income don't have financial plans. Two-thirds of that group don't
feel they save or invest enough -- and seven out of 10 have "some" or "great"
concern about paying for retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   "These clients also indicate they look upon H&AMP;R Block as a valued and
trusted final adviser and they would love to be able to get more than just tax
advice from Block," said analyst Michael Millman of Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
	   Offering financial advice in the unintimidating setting of a Block office
"makes Block's tax business much more attractive to clients, and makes
individual clients more profitable for the company," Millman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fresh blast of publicity for Block's Internet services -- with links to
insurance and banking -- is also likely to pay off, said Michael Hodes, an
analyst with Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides online tax tools, the expanded Web site includes links to E-LOAN's
online mortgage business and to Citibank's new online banking service, Hodes
said.
</P>
<P>

healthy amount of traffic in coming months on the tax site," Hodes said. "They
have their flag out and they're letting people know the door's open."

	   Under the Refund Rewards programs, taxpayers' refunds are loaded onto
prepaid buying cards that can be used for purchases -- at a discount -- from
General Motors, Sears, Radio Shack and other selected merchants.

	   The other major partnership offers discounts on Block tax and financial
services to the 13 million members of the AFL-CIO.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid Stock Plummets After Delay  </HEADLINE>
    By HOPE YEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp.'s shares took a hit amid speculation
that the New York Stock Exchange would delist the stock because of the company's
delay in releasing financial reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The NYSE postponed trading for nearly two hours Wednesday morning after
Lehman Brothers analyst Meredith Adler said the exchange may delist the stock.
The NYSE later said it would not delist "at this time," though it was closely
monitoring the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for the exchange said it had halted activity after hearing
news of a possible delisting, but declined to comment further. Adler later
retracted her statement.
</P>
<P>
	   "At the time that I wrote what I did, I had not been able to talk to the
company," Adler said. "As soon as I spoke to the company, and they said, 'No,
no, no, there isn't going to be a delisting,' I put out a correction."
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid shares closed at $7.87 1/2, down 26 percent from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's third-largest pharmacy chain announced after the close of
markets Tuesday that it had reached agreement with its lenders on the delay and
planned to seek extensions on Securities and Exchange Commission filings for the
remaining quarterly and annual reports for fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid's third quarter report for the period ending Nov. 27 was due
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't have any reason to believe we're delisted, and have no indication
that we would be," senior vice president Karen Rugen said Wednesday. Exchange
officials "hadn't mentioned a word until they called to ask where the delisting
headlines came from."
</P>
<P>
	   The Camp Hill-based chain has been trying to recover after financial woes
sent the company's stock tumbling by more than 80 percent in a year. Former top
executive Martin L. Grass was ousted in October, and a new team led by CEO
Robert Miller has pledged to improve profitability with stricter financial
controls and strategic marketing.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid also has switched auditing firms and a restatement of its earnings
for the past three years was expected to result in a $500 million reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts have said the chain's delay in financial reports may be troubling
in light of December same-store sales figures showing a "poor" 5.9 percent
increase, compared to the double-digit growth of Walgreen's and CVS.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Adler's report Wednesday, Lehman Brothers also downgraded Rite
Aid's stock to "neutral" from a "buy."
</P>
<P>
	   "Given the nearly complete lack of information on the earnings power of Rite
Aid, we can no longer recommend the stock, and so are lowering our rating to
3-Neutral," the report stated.

<HEADLINE> Six Cut From U.S. Soccer Roster  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- Six players were cut from the U.S. soccer team
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The cuts, who include Los Angeles Galaxy goalie Kevin Hartman and midfielder
Clint Mathis, Miami Fusion midfielder Henry Gutierrez and Tampa Bay Mutiny
midfielder Steve Ralston, come just four days before the U.S. team's exhibition
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Cherundolo, a midfielder from San Diego who plays for Germany's
Hanover 96, and John O'Brien, a midfielder from Playa del Rey, Calif., who plays
for Ajax in Holland, were assigned to the under-23 national team, currently
training in Chula Vista, Calif. The team faces Armenia after the U.S.-Iran
match.
</P>
<P>
	   All six players will be considered for other national team matches this
year, a U.S. Soccer spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's match is the first between the nations since Iran's 2-1 upset in
the 1998 World Cup. It is also the first time they have met on U.S. soil since
relations between the countries declined during the 1979-81 hostage crisis.

</P>
<P>
	   Cleveland scored just 10 points and made three field goals in the fourth
quarter as the Blazers turned the game into a rout. The Cavs also had 18
turnovers, nine more than their previous high this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Portland trailed by eight in the second quarter, but used a 16-4 run in the
final 4 1/2 minutes to take a 51-44 halftime lead. Pippen hit two 3-pointers
during the run.
</P>
<P>
	   Stoudamire scored eight points in the third, including a driving layup with
six-tenths of a second left, for a 73-65 lead. Detlef Schrempf's short jumper
made it a 13-point lead less than two minutes into the fourth, and it only got
worse from there for the Cavs.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace injured his right ankle with 3:57 left in the third when he hung on
the rim after an alley-oop pass from Pippen, then fell backward and stepped on
Kemp's heel. He lay on the court for several seconds and hobbled off the court,
but returned to score four points in the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes 3, Penguins 1  </HEADLINE>
    By MEL REISNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Shane Doan broke up goalie Jean-Sebastien Aubin's shutout
bid in the second period, and the Phoenix Coyotes went on to a 3-1 victory over
the Pittsburgh Penguins on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Trevor Letowski added a power-play goal and Keith Tkachuk scored on a
penalty shot in the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   Sean Burke improved to 3-1-1 with the Coyotes, who acquired him in a trade
with Florida in November. He stopped 21 shots and weathered eight Pittsburgh
power plays for the win, but lost his shutout when NHL scoring leader Jaromir
Jagr scored his 33rd goal 8:10 into the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal was the 19th point in the last 10 games for Jagr, who had two goals
in a 4-2 win over the Coyotes on Dec. 11 in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes recovered from a seven-game stretch in which they were outshot
by opponents by an average of 14 shots a game. This time, they bettered the
Penguins 27-22, avenging not only the loss but the embarrassment of an 11-shot
game that set a Pittsburgh franchise record for fewest shots by an opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   Letowski scored on a slap shot that went off the skate of Penguins
defenseman as he jostled with Rick Tocchet at the top of the crease 3:04 into
the third period. Tocchet, who originally was credited with the goal, got an
assist -- the 480th of his career, leaving him one point shy of 900.
</P>
<P>
	   Tkachuk made it 3-0 just 2:16 later after Darius Kasparaitis dragged him
down at Aubin's doorstep. Tkachuk, stopped by current Phoenix goalie Bob Essensa
on his first career penalty shot Jan. 24, 1998, against Edmonton, took a
forehand approach to the net, then fired a sharp wrist shot between Aubin's
legs.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, New York's Brad Isbister scored on a penalty against Phoenix
during a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
	   Aubin stopped 12 shots in the first period, one more than the Coyotes took
their first game against the Penguins. Aubin made 24 saves in all.
</P>
<P>
	   But even though Pittsburgh had five power plays in the second period to two
for the Coyotes, the pace caught up with the 22-year-old goalie.
</P>
<P>
	   Doan sent Phoenix into a 1-0 lead with 8:35 left in the second. He got the
puck from Mika Alatalo, who fielded the rebound of a slap shot by Yuha Ylonen,
and skated to his left for a 10-foot forehand that beat Aubin on the near side.

<HEADLINE> Hall of Fame Pitcher Bob Lemon Dies  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM WITHERS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Bob Lemon, who made the Hall of Fame for a brilliant
pitching career and then managed the New York Yankees to a World Series
championship, died at age 79.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon, a seven-time 20-game winner with the Cleveland Indians and manager of
the Yankees during their amazing 1978 title run, died Tuesday night at Palmcrest
North Convalescent Home in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon led the American League in victories three times and won two games in
the 1948 World Series -- the last time the Indians were champions. He finished
with a 207-128 record and was inducted into the Hall in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years later, Lemon, who also managed for Kansas City and the Chicago
White Sox, took over the Yankees at midseason when Billy Martin resigned and
focused a turbulent clubhouse, where Martin, owner George Steinbrenner, Thurman
Munson and Reggie Jackson had been feuding.
</P>
<P>
	   New York overcame a 14-game deficit, beat Boston in a one-game playoff at
Fenway Park to win the AL East, then defeated the Royals in the AL playoffs
before triumphing over the Los Angeles Dodgers to win its second straight World
Series title.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon remained on the Yankees' payroll until his death as a scout and
adviser to Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is with tremendous sadness that I was informed today of the passing of
Bob Lemon," Steinbrenner said. "He was an idol of mine when he pitched for the
Cleveland Indians and he has been a true friend of mine for many, many years.
</P>
<P>
	   "When our team was going through the turmoil during the 1978 season, Bob
Lemon was just what we needed. He was such a calming influence and, of course,
he guided the club to the world championship in one of the greatest comebacks in
sports history. He was a gentle but consummate competitor."
</P>
<P>
	   The news of Lemon's death came just hours after another former Cleveland
sports figure, Cavaliers guard Bobby Phills was killed in a traffic accident in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon, a seven-time All-Star, began his playing career as a third baseman
with the Indians in 1941. After serving in the Navy during World War II, he
became a pitcher, one of the most successful in Indians history.
</P>
<P>
	   The right-hander twice won 23 games. In 1948, sometimes pitching on one
day's rest, he went 20-14 with a 2.82 ERA and led the AL with 20 complete games,
10 shutouts and 293 2-3 innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
	   "Lem" as he was known to his teammates, then beat Boston's Warren Spahn in
Game 2 of the World Series before pitching Cleveland to a 4-3 victory in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1954, Lemon went 23-7 and along with Bob Feller, Early Wynn and Mike
Garcia combined on what many still call the best starting rotation ever. The
Indians won a then-record 111 games that season before being swept in the World
Series by the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon, who pitched a no-hitter at Detroit on June 30, 1948, also was an
outstanding hitter, as far as pitchers go, finishing with a .232 career average
and 37 home runs. He occasionally was used a pinch-hitter, batting .284 in 109
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
	   After retiring in 1958, Lemon worked as a scout, coach and minor league
manager. In 1966, he applied for Cleveland's vacant managing position but was
turned down by Indians owner Gabe Paul, who later called his decision not to
hire Lemon, "the biggest mistake I made in baseball."
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon managed Kansas City from 1970-72 and the White Sox in 1977 and 1978
before taking over the Yankees on July 25.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon was replaced by Martin midway through the '79 season but returned to
the Yankees for the second half of the strike-shortened 1981 season. New York
won its division and the AL pennant before losing to the Dodgers in the Series.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really sad to lose a man like Lemon. Everybody liked him so much --
even the opposition," said 90-year-old Mel Harder, who played with and coached
Lemon. "He joked with everybody -- I don't care who you were. He was one of my
best friends."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesperson at Palmcrest North Convalescent Home said funeral
arrangements were being made by Lemon's family.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon is survived by his wife, Jane, and two sons.

<HEADLINE> Driver's license renewals in New York will require eye exam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New Yorkers of all ages will be required to pass an
eye exam when renewing their licenses as of April 1.
<P>
	   After vetoing a similar measure in 1997, Gov. George Pataki reinstated the
eye exam requirement. He also changed the schedule for renewing licenses from
every five years to every eight. The change does not effect commercial drivers,
who already had eye exams every five years.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Pataki said the eye testing would have been too expensive for the
Department of Motor Vehicles to conduct and he was not convinced of the traffic
safety benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Pataki's veto, the DMV's medical advisory board has recommended that
eye exams be reinstated, Division of Budget spokesman Kevin Quinn said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the new measure differs from the 1997 legislation in that it will cost
$400,000 a year to administer, instead of $2 million, because of the eight-year
schedule, according to Quinn.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sound, scientific medical evidence was reviewed that shows that testing for
vision at driver renewal is important for driver safety at all ages," said Dr.
George Stasior, chairman of the DMV medical advisory board.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1994, motorists renewing their licenses have been permitted to do so
by mail by self-certifying that they have acceptable vision. Vision tests are
required for someone getting a license for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   The state is working on a plan that would allow drivers to mail in
certificates from health care providers attesting that eye tests were passed, so
that drivers wouldn't be required to go to the DMV, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking to make this as easy and as customer friendly for drivers as
possible," Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Studies have shown that states without vision tests for drivers had higher
accident and death rates, particularly in age groups over 65, said Dr. Robert
Kennedy, president of the New York State Ophthalmological Society.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're happy that the governor has agreed to reinstitute the driver's
license vision testing requirement," Kennedy said. "We're just not sure that
eight years is often enough."
</P>
<P>
	   Stasior said that the DMV medical advisory board is continuing to discuss
ways to help protect public safety, including legislation that would deal with
reporting people who should not be driving.
</P>
<P>
	   The new measure, which does not require legislative approval, will effect
roughly 2 million motorists a year, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   The $5 annual fee for renewals will not change. Drivers will pay $43 for
eight years, and an existing $3 photo document fee. Currently, drivers pay $28.

<HEADLINE> Niagara Mohawk helps test experimental street light  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SACKETS HARBOR, N.Y. (AP) - There may be a bright future for a dim light
hanging outside a grocery store in this historical Lake Ontario village.
<P>
	   With a round, bluish head that faces the ground and a rectangular solar
panel that looks like a hat pointing toward the sky, it sits 12 feet high at the
entrance to the Harbor Market's parking lot.
</P>
<P>
	   Since mid-December, Niagara Mohawk scientists have been testing the
one-of-a-kind street light in this community 75 miles north of Syracuse. Hardly
anyone has noticed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bright lights of the city are alluring for some people. In the country,
though, glaring bright lights can actually limit a person's vision," said Art
Peterson, a Niagara Mohawk research and development specialist.
</P>
<P>
	   "This light illuminates like moonlight. It doesn't wreck your night vision.
That's the whole idea behind it," Peterson said. "It's a neat concept. People
often think brighter is better. It's not true."
</P>
<P>
	   If successful, the light could be used along places like the Erie Canal,
hiking trails, parks and waterfronts where a softer light is preferable, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not designed to do an intersection," said Anthony Andre, the utility's
regional manager.
</P>
<P>
	   "Where it would be great is in an area where there should be low light
pollution. Someplace where, instead of just blinding light, the light allows you
to see into the reaches of a field," Andre said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most street lights emit a glare that obscures stars at night and temporarily
blinds people. Lights that allow people to see where they are walking without
eliminating all other views are part of a recent trend in light design, Andre
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The light Niagara Mohawk is testing was designed by Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute and Howard M. Brandston, who designed lights for the Statute of
Liberty and Central Park.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to being powered by solar energy, the experimental light
contains light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, which are the latest technology in
low-glare, energy-efficient lighting, said Peterson.
</P>
<P>
	   The experimental light uses only 25 watts compared to a normal street
light's 100 watts.
</P>
<P>
	   "It also offers the promise of a longer lifetime," Peterson said. The LED
light will last in the range of 40,000 hours, up to three times longer than
conventional street lights, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the apparent ecological and aesthetic advantages, the little lamp
with its soft blue hue hasn't won many fans. One drawback is the light does not
illuminate a very large area.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't even see it and it goes out in the middle of the night," said
Margaret Fein, who owns the Bed of Roses Flower &AMP; Gifts shop next to the market.
"That light, it doesn't light up anything."
</P>
<P>
	   Andre said it is unfair to judge this type of light just yet, because the
prototype was only designed to stay on two hours and while solar-powered, it was
installed in mid-December, when the sun shines for the fewest hours.
</P>
<P>
	   "Until it gets going, we can't answer what the light's potential is," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Said in Talks To Buy Hughes  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Boeing Co. reportedly is in talks to buy Hughes
Electronics Corp.'s satellite manufacturing operations, a deal that would make
the aircraft builder a dominant player in space-based communications.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing would pay $4 billion for Hughes commercial satellite business,
according to a Dow Jones Newswires report Wednesday that cited unidentified
sources familiar with the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Boeing's board would meet today to discuss the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesmen for Boeing and Hughes declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes is the leading maker of commercial satellites with about 40 percent
of the market. It is owned by General Motors Corp., but its shares trade
separately from regular GM stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing wants to position itself broadly in the aerospace market, said Jon
Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, an investment bank
specializing in aerospace acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
	   The move would reduce its dependency on jet airliner sales, and put the
company in position to capitalize on potential growth in the commercial
satellite industry. Boeing already has several satellite launch programs
including SeaLaunch, which uses a Russian-built rocket that blasts off from a
floating launch pad, and the Delta family of land-based rockets.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchase would reflect some uncertainty on Boeing's part as to which
areas of aerospace will become the most lucrative in the next century, Kutler
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "For Boeing, it's hard to sit here and decide which way things are going to
go, and they want to be represented across the board," Kutler said. "They're
trying to have their arms in most of the major areas of the space market in
order to be well-positioned regardless of how the market goes."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal would complete the transformation of Hughes from a major military
aerospace contractor to what would become primarily a commercial
telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes was founded as Hughes Aircraft by wealthy eccentric Howard Hughes in
1932 and branched out into defense electronics after World War II. The company
began to move into commercial ventures, such as DirecTV, after the end of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes shares have more than doubled during the past year, driven by the
growth of DirecTV. The service, with more than 8 million subscribers, had
revenue of $1.05 billion in the third quarter, up from $408 million in the third
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes, however, has spent heavily developing the subscriber base. The
company lost $29.6 million in the third quarter, mainly because of expenses from
its acquisition of two satellite-TV rivals, as well as higher satellite costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale of its satellite manufacturing business would provide cash Hughes
needs to continue developing DirecTV and other communications businesses, said
Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes shed its aircraft operations in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a company that had a lot of money after selling off Hughes Aircraft to
Raytheon, but they've gone through that and now they're substantially in debt,"
said Nisbet. "This would be a source of funds to keep their growth going in
these new fields."

<HEADLINE> Pataki budget pushes for control of state Education Department  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki again is asking the state
Legislature for full control of the state Education Department, saying the
record amount of money the schools have been getting aren't improving education
in New York.
<P>
	   Pataki not only wants to take away the department's control over the state
Library, Archives and Museum, he also wants to slash some of the Education
Department's staff; personally choose the department's commissioner, as well as
its controlling board, the Board of Regents, and the Regents' chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   He even wants to strip the department of $250,000 in charter school money.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki never specifically mentioned his plans during his State of the State
address last week or in his executive budget address on Tuesday to legislators.
Instead, Pataki focused on the record amount of public school aid he wants to
spend in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   "By the way, we haven't seen the results from the schools that we should
have expected when you pour this amount of money into them," Pataki told
reporters after his executive budget address Tuesday. That "is why we don't need
just the additional dollars that we're proposing but we need structural reform.
We need accountability."
</P>
<P>
	   State officials got the first test results from the Board of Regents' push
to increase the educational standards in New York last year.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of the fourth grade students did not pass the Regents' new
English test, a third failed the fourth-grade math test and a quarter of those
who took the senior English exam needed to graduate have to take it again.
</P>
<P>
	   But Education Commissioner Richard Mills, who was hired by the
Assembly-controlled Board of Regents, didn't like Pataki's education plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think this is personal. We have a very good working relationship
with the governor's staff but I certainly don't agree with this proposal," Mills
said Wednesday. "The Board of Regents has mustered the forces at their command
to raise standards. The Regents have been very persistent about this. I don't
see the logic of that change at all."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers, especially in the Democrat-controlled Assembly, are unlikely to
go along with Pataki's plan. Pataki has suggested that the Legislature give him
greater control of the state's schools every year since the first year of his
term, Assembly Education Chairman Steven Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Legislature has rejected this autocratic approach to education every
year since," Sanders said. "We will certainly reject it again this year."
</P>
<P>
	   While Pataki has suggested abolishing the Board of Regents before, this is
the first time he has suggested taking away the state Museum, Archives and
Library from the Education Department, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Conway, a spokesman for Pataki's Budget Division, said all of Pataki's
suggestions were "common-sense" initiatives. The State University of New York
gets more charter school applications than the Education Department and
streamlining the command structure will provide a greater level of
accountability, Pataki's plan says.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10 percent reduction Pataki wants would consist of 18 employees from the
department's Office of Management Services and Elementary, Middle, Secondary and
Continuing Education divisions, which would be accomplished through attrition,
Conway said. "We would rather spend general fund dollars on the classrooms, not
on the bureaucracy," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The point behind the initiatives is "producing the best possible result for
the students," Conway said. "This plan would allow the Education Department to
focus its attention where it belongs, on the classrooms."
</P>
<P>
	   But Carole Huxley, the deputy education commissioner for cultural education,
worried about the separation between politics and education. Putting political
appointees in charge of information distribution and education might not be a
good idea, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "A buffer between politics and libraries, public broadcasting, archives and
museums is an important thing," she said.

<HEADLINE> Portnoy's complaint: Legislators don't like names named  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - No matter how the criminal case against tobacco
lobbyist Sharon Portnoy goes, the revelations surrounding her activities already
represent a low point in the state Legislature's recent history.
<P>
	   A deposition she gave on Nov. 10 about her activities on behalf of Philip
Morris was released this week by the state Lobbying Commission and it is a tough
read for anyone who believes that selflessness is the motivation for a career in
public service for many of New York state's legislators.
</P>
<P>
	   In her deposition, Portnoy admits to repeatedly doctoring the spending
reports she was required to make to the Lobbying Commission from 1996-99 by
falsely adding the names of fellow lobbyists who had attended dinners,
receptions and other events with lawmakers. Those other lobbyists were not
actually on hand, Portnoy testified.
</P>
<P>
	   But by adding the other names, Portnoy was able to divide the total amount
spent at those events by more people and thus get the per-person costs under
$75. She considered that crucial because it prevented her from having to list
the names of the dozens of individual legislators she was wining and dining in
reports to the Lobbying Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Lobbyists only have to name names when they spend more than $75 per event on
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   For people cynical of government, Portnoy's activities are doubly troubling.
</P>
<P>
	   First, as she admits repeatedly during her deposition, it was well
understood among lobbyists that state legislators didn't like their names
turning up in lobbyists' reports to the state commission. That was even more
true when the lobbyist paying for dinners, drinks, tickets and so forth was
Philip Morris, a giant in the much-maligned tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was thinking in terms of not embarrassing legislators by naming them on a
lobbying report," she told Lobbying Commission officials. At another point, she
said she felt "compelled" not to "put the legislator in the position of having
their name listed on the lobbying report."
</P>
<P>
	   The lengths Portnoy went to maintain the appearance that legislators were
staying beneath the $75 spending limit suggest that moderation was not on many
lawmakers' minds when they knew Philip Morris was picking up the tab.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, for a March 1997 reception at the fancy Nicole's Bistro
restaurant in Albany, Portnoy admitted adding the names of 12 people who weren't
actually there in order to make the per-person spending numbers work out right.
</P>
<P>
	   For another night out a week later at the same restaurant with legislators,
she doctored the books with the names of 11 people who were not on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   What such instances suggest, according to Blair Horner of the New York
Public Interest Research Group, is that these parties were extremely lavish and
that many legislators almost certainly consumed drinks and food worth far more
than $75.
</P>
<P>
	   Privately, some legislators who attended Portnoy's events insisted that they
were simply not that extravagant and they wondered how they could have cost
thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   Then there were the smaller, quirkier events Portnoy had Philip Morris pay
for, such as the little get-together for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. It
featured bagels - $629 worth - and was catered by Mom's Bagels.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked by the executive director of the Lobbying Commission, David Grandeau,
how she could spend that kind of money on bagels, Portnoy said it wasn't just
bagels. There was smoked fish and poached salmon and since Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver, a devout Jew, was the guest of honor the caterers also had to
provide kosher dishes and flatware, Portnoy explained.
</P>
<P>
	   Portnoy's deposition and other documents in the Lobbying Commission's case
against her have been turned over to Albany County District Attorney Sol
Greenberg's office for possible criminal prosecution. She and Philip Morris were
fined late last year by the commission and Portnoy was banned from lobbying in
New York state for three years.
</P>
<P>
	   She had been paid a base salary of $132,500 plus annual bonuses. In 1998,
that bonus was $45,000, she told the lobbying commission.
</P>
<P>
	   She could face a misdemeanor, a $1,000 fine and up to one year in jail if
Greenberg's office wins a conviction against her.
</P>
<P>
	   Portnoy told the commission that she brought her troubles on herself, that
other lobbyists did not know she was claiming they were at certain events and
that she was not asked to falsify records by Philip Morris or legislators.
</P>
<P>
	   Did it ever happen, Grandeau wondered during Portnoy's deposition, that
state legislators actually insisted on paying for their own food and drinks at
one of her events?
</P>
<P>
	   "No, not that I can recall," she replied.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Portnoy filed an addendum to her deposition to say that
statement wasn't accurate. She said she could recall two state legislators
offering to pay for a portion of their dinners.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Said in Talks With Hughes  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Boeing Co. reportedly is in talks to buy Hughes
Electronics Corp.'s satellite manufacturing operations, a deal that would make
the aircraft builder a dominant player in space-based communications.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing would pay $4 billion for Hughes commercial satellite business,
according to a Dow Jones Newswires report Wednesday that cited unidentified
sources familiar with the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Boeing's board would meet today to discuss the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesmen for Boeing and Hughes declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes is the leading maker of commercial satellites with about 40 percent
of the market. It is owned by General Motors Corp., but its shares trade
separately from regular GM stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing wants to position itself broadly in the aerospace market, said Jon
Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, an investment bank
specializing in aerospace acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
	   The move would reduce its dependency on jet airliner sales, and put the
company in position to capitalize on potential growth in the commercial
satellite industry. Boeing already has several satellite launch programs
including SeaLaunch, which uses a Russian-built rocket that blasts off from a
floating launch pad, and the Delta family of land-based rockets.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchase would reflect some uncertainty on Boeing's part as to which
areas of aerospace will become the most lucrative in the next century, Kutler
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "For Boeing, it's hard to sit here and decide which way things are going to
go, and they want to be represented across the board," Kutler said. "They're
trying to have their arms in most of the major areas of the space market in
order to be well-positioned regardless of how the market goes."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal would complete the transformation of Hughes from a major military
aerospace contractor to what would become primarily a commercial
telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes was founded as Hughes Aircraft by wealthy eccentric Howard Hughes in
1932 and branched out into defense electronics after World War II. The company
began to move into commercial ventures, such as DirecTV, after the end of the
Cold War.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton and Giuliani camps trading letters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
are continuing to spar over the financing for what could become the nation's
most expensive Senate race ever.
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager invited his counterpart on
Giuliani's political team to negotiate a mutual ban on the use of "soft money"
contributions - money from groups or individuals that is spent on issue
advertisements designed to build support for the party or a particular nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   But Giuliani campaign chief Bruce Teitelbaum, in a subsequent letter to
Clinton campaign manager Bill de Blasio, said that before any negotiations could
take place, the first lady would have to refund such money already spent on her
behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   "You should also determine how much soft money you have already raised and
publicly declare that none of that money will be used to benefit the Clinton
campaign in any way," the aide to the Republican mayor of New York City wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading letters, de Blasio criticized Giuliani's fund-raising activities and
said "we are disappointed that you are apparently rejecting our offer to meet."
</P>
<P>
	   Thus far, the national Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has raised
several hundred thousand dollars in unlimited soft money donations aimed at
helping Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign in New York. And, it spent more than
$200,000 to finance television ads across upstate New York late last year
promoting the first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the DSCC, said
the committee was prepared to spend "whatever is required to win" New York's
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   Under fire for her use of soft money, Mrs. Clinton began pressing Giuliani
at the end of last year to agree to a ban on the use of such funding and to
disavow third-party advocacy advertising in their race. The Giuliani camp
demanded the proposal in writing before entering into such talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign team, said Wednesday
that de Blasio had telephoned Teitelbaum Tuesday to discuss the issue, was
unable to get through and left a message. Teitelbaum returned the call
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bruce said he would talk with his boss and get back to us," Wolfson
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Teitelbaum did so in his letter to de Blasio, and made it public.
</P>
<P>
	   "I agree this is a good opportunity to discuss the role that soft money will
play in the upcoming Senate race," the Giuliani aide wrote. "We must, however,
start the discussion on a level playing field."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to demanding that Mrs. Clinton pay the cost of the DSCC-financed
TV ads out of her campaign account, Teitelbaum said "it would also be useful if
we could agree on an ironclad, verifiable method of accountability to ensure
that any agreement we reach will be honored throughout the campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   "Because of the soft money you have already raised, and the massive
fund-raising apparatus at your disposal, the issues of verification and trust
are of paramount concern to us," the Giuliani aide added.
</P>
<P>
	   Verification and trust was a concept promoted by President Reagan in his
dealings with the Soviets over arms control.
</P>
<P>
	   While Giuliani has not been actively raising soft money for the Senate race,
he has not ruled out using such funds. And de Blasio in his letter to Teitelbaum
noted that third-party attack ads aimed at Hillary Clinton have already appeared
in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Under federal rules, Senate candidates can accept no more than $2,000 from
individual contributors to spend on their races - so-called hard money. But
those same contributors can give unlimited money to political committees such as
the DSCC that can then use it to promote a candidate, as long as they don't
directly ask you to vote for that candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   On the "hard money" front, the Clinton camp has said it expects to raise $25
million or more for the race while Giuliani has said he plans to raise $20
million.

<HEADLINE> Silver pushes new campaign finance limits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Fund-raising events for state office candidates held
within 40 miles of the state Capitol would be banned during annual legislative
sessions under legislation from the state Assembly's Democratic majority.
<P>
	   The wide-ranging campaign finance reform legislation also proposes limits on
the amount of money political party committees could transfer to such state
office candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, party committees could only give $700,000 to candidates for
governor; $50,000 to state Senate candidates; and $25,000 to Assembly candidates
under the Assembly majority's proposal. There are currently no such limits.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure, which stands almost no chance of becoming law in its current
form, also renews the Assembly Democratic majority's past calls for partial
public financing of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   "As we enter the 21st century, it is incumbent upon elected officials to
face directly the challenge of campaign finance reform and come up with a system
that is equitable and fair to the public," Stephen Kaufman, a Bronx Democrat who
is chairman of the Assembly's Election Law Committee, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Assembly leadership indicated the proposal to ban fund-raising events in
the Albany area during legislative sessions was aimed at the practice of
politicians hitting up lobbyists and their clients for money at a time when they
want to influence legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   In June, Gov. George Pataki unveiled his own sweeping campaign finance
proposal that would have barred fund-raising events from even being held within
25 miles of the state Capitol during the annual legislative session that
normally runs from early January through June or July.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pataki plan would also eliminate the unlimited "soft money" donations
special interests can give to political parties and impose lower campaign
contribution limits for all state office races. The Republican governor did not
call for public campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the Democratic-led Assembly or the Republican-controlled Senate has
acted on the governor's proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing its campaign finance proposal, the Assembly Democrats called
on the Senate GOP majority to approve the governor's plan and then allow a joint
Assembly-Senate conference committee to work out compromise legislation
acceptable to both chambers.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican, said
Wednesday that his GOP Senate colleagues would be unveiling their own campaign
finance proposal. He gave no timetable for when that plan might be made public.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno did take a jab at the Assembly Democrats, noting that they have
refused to go along with legislation approved by the Senate to bar all gifts
over $25 from lobbyists. The Senate leader noted that the senators have agreed
to abide by that ban voluntarily even without Assembly approval of the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said Wednesday that in that same spirit, the Assembly Democrats should
pass their campaign finance plan and then voluntarily abide by its restrictions,
even without agreement from the Senate.

    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
are continuing to spar over the financing for what could become the nation's
most expensive Senate race ever.
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager invited his counterpart on
Giuliani's political team to negotiate a mutual ban on the use of "soft money"
contributions - money from groups or individuals that is spent on issue
advertisements designed to build support for the party or a particular nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   But Giuliani campaign chief Bruce Teitelbaum, in a subsequent letter to
Clinton campaign manager Bill de Blasio, said that before any negotiations could
take place, the first lady would have to refund such money already spent on her
behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   "You should also determine how much soft money you have already raised and
publicly declare that none of that money will be used to benefit the Clinton
campaign in any way," the aide to the Republican mayor of New York City wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading letters, de Blasio criticized Giuliani's fund-raising activities and
said "we are disappointed that you are apparently rejecting our offer to meet."
</P>
<P>
	   Thus far, the national Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has raised
several hundred thousand dollars in unlimited soft money donations aimed at
helping Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign in New York. And, it spent more than
$200,000 to finance television ads across upstate New York late last year
promoting the first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the DSCC, said
the committee was prepared to spend "whatever is required to win" New York's
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   Under fire for her use of soft money, Mrs. Clinton began pressing Giuliani
at the end of last year to agree to a ban on the use of such funding and to
disavow third-party advocacy advertising in their race. The Giuliani camp
demanded the proposal in writing before entering into such talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign team, said Wednesday
that de Blasio had telephoned Teitelbaum Tuesday to discuss the issue, was
unable to get through and left a message. Teitelbaum returned the call
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bruce said he would talk with his boss and get back to us," Wolfson
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Teitelbaum did so in his letter to de Blasio, and made it public.
</P>
<P>
	   "I agree this is a good opportunity to discuss the role that soft money will
play in the upcoming Senate race," the Giuliani aide wrote. "We must, however,
start the discussion on a level playing field."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to demanding that Mrs. Clinton pay the cost of the DSCC-financed
TV ads out of her campaign account, Teitelbaum said "it would also be useful if
we could agree on an ironclad, verifiable method of accountability to ensure
that any agreement we reach will be honored throughout the campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   "Because of the soft money you have already raised, and the massive
fund-raising apparatus at your disposal, the issues of verification and trust
are of paramount concern to us," the Giuliani aide added.
</P>
<P>
	   Verification and trust was a concept promoted by President Reagan in his
dealings with the Soviets over arms control.
</P>
<P>
	   While Giuliani has not been actively raising soft money for the Senate race,
he has not ruled out using such funds. And de Blasio in his letter to Teitelbaum
noted that third-party attack ads aimed at Hillary Clinton have already appeared
in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Under federal rules, Senate candidates can accept no more than $2,000 from
individual contributors to spend on their races - so-called hard money. But
those same contributors can give unlimited money to political committees such as
the DSCC that can then use it to promote a candidate, as long as they don't
directly ask you to vote for that candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   On the "hard money" front, the Clinton camp has said it expects to raise $25
million or more for the race while Giuliani has said he plans to raise $20
million.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The Thai government is considering joining hands
with the private sector to build a $1 billion silicon wafer factory to boost the
local electronics industry, local newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The government is considering funding about a quarter of the plant's cost,
with the private sector raising the remainder, Industry Minister Suwat
Liptapallop was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   The cabinet is set to vote on the proposal later this month, the Bangkok
Post reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Thailand has long planned a silicon wafer factory, which would reduce its
dependency on imports.
</P>
<P>
	   Silicon wafers, which form a part of integrated circuits, or chips, for the
electronics industry, are currently imported from higher-end production centers
such as Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Thailand wants to move away from the low-end electronics sector -- where it
competes with China -- toward production of integrated circuits.
</P>
<P>
	   A unit of Thailand's Alphatec Electronics, Submicron Technology, planned a
silicon wafer factory, but the project was put on hold after the parent company
entered bankruptcy proceedings in 1998.

    CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Jason Wiemer scored 2:03 into overtime, giving
Calgary a 2-1 win Wednesday night over the Dallas Stars, the Flames'
league-leading eighth overtime win.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin St. Louis fought off both Dallas defenseman behind the Dallas net to
get the puck to Wiemer, who beat Manny Fernandez high.
</P>
<P>
	   Calgary improved to 8-1-5 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas lost captain Mike Modano with an undetermined injury when Wiemer
drove him hard into the boards with 9:09 left. Modano had to be helped off the
ice and did not return.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Lindsay also scored for the Flames, 10-1-1 in their last 12 home games.
</P>
<P>
	   Blake Sloan scored the lone goal for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   For the second straight game, the Stars were outshot badly with Calgary
holding a 41-22 edge. Dallas was outshot 39-16 at Edmonton on Tuesday in a 3-2
win over the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
	   Sloan tied the game 1-1 at 9:22 of the third with his first goal in 16
games.
</P>
<P>
	   Lindsay gave the Flames a 1-0 lead 1:02 into the third with his first goal
in 23 games. The play was set up when Calgary defenseman Denis Gauthier took out
Modano in the Calgary end, forcing a turnover.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis picked up the loose puck and carried it into the Dallas zone
before dropping it off to Lindsay, who beat Fernandez on the blocker side with a
slap shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Brathwaite has a 0.66 goals-against average against Dallas in five career
appearances.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stars got some good news on the injury front when Joe Nieuwendyk
returned after missing the previous 10 games with cartilage damage in his ribs.

also snapped a five-game road losing streak.

    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Jason Kidd scored 20 points and recorded
his fifth triple-double in 13 games, as the Phoenix Suns snapped a three-game
losing streak with a 95-92 victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite going 4-for-18 from the field, Kidd went 11-for-13 from the
free-throw line, and added 10 rebounds and 10 assists as the Suns won for only
the second time in seven games. Luc Longley scored 15 points for Phoenix, which
also snapped a five-game road losing streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Othella Harrington scored 19 and Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Michael Dickerson
had 17 each for the Grizzlies, who blew an opportunity to win their
franchise-record fourth straight.
</P>
<P>
	   With Phoenix clinging to a 94-92 lead, Kidd sealed the victory when he
pulled down his 10th rebound following Abdur-Rahim's miss with 10.5 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
	   Fouled on the play, Kidd sank one of two free throws, putting the Suns ahead
95-92.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grizzlies' last gasp to pull even failed when Mike Bibby missed a
3-point attempt and Tom Gugliotta pulled down the rebound. The Grizzlies lost in
their first home game since Dec. 30, after coming off a 4-1 road trip, the best
in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a sloppy game in which neither team shot better than 39 percent from
the field. The Grizzlies, in fact, went 15-of-57 from the field over the last
three quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Foul shooting kept Vancouver in the game, as the Grizzlies went 40-for-45
from the line. In comparison, the Suns were 20-of-27.
</P>
<P>
	   The Suns won despite going 35-for-90 from the field, and failed to hit a
field goal in the final 2:33 of the game. Notes: Prior to the game, the
Grizzlies held a moment of silence in memory of the Charlotte Hornets' Bobby
Phills, who was killed in a car accident earlier in the day. Read public address
announcer Al Murdoch: "(Phills) represented the very best in sports -- a caring
and generous person who was also a talented competitor on the court. Bobby will
be greatly missed throughout the NBA and by fans of basketball around the
world." ... Prior to the game, the Grizzlies activated veteran swingman Doug
West, who missed 10 games with a stress fracture in his left wrist, and placed
rookie forward Obinna Ekezie (sprained left ankle) on the injured list. ... Suns
center Oliver Miller missed his third-straight game with a pulled right tricep.
Recouperating in Phoenix, Miller may be ready to return to action by this
weekend.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton tells Letterman she couldn't resist following him  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - After weeks of needling Hillary Rodham Clinton for being
a carpetbagger who was scared to appear on his show, David Letterman stifled the
sarcasm when the first lady actually turned up.
<P>
	   "We have to give this woman a tremendous amount of credit for just showing
up," Letterman told his "Late Show" audience just before his first interview
with Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He started by lobbing her a softball, asking her to "tell us a little bit
about yourself."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton smiled and told Letterman she grew up in the Midwest - as he
did - has a mother named Dorothy - as he does - and just couldn't resist the
temptation to follow him to New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton made a joke at Letterman's expense when he was asking her about
her new home in suburban Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every idiot in the universe is going to drive by honking now," Letterman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Was that you?" Mrs. Clinton asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman has made a running gag of Mrs. Clinton, who is running for Senate
from New York, a state she hadn't lived in before last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton admitted to being "just a little" nervous, but told Letterman:
"I knew if I was going to run for Senate, I was going to have to come and sit in
this chair and talk to the big guy."
</P>
<P>
	   Her likely opponent in the Senate race, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani,
has been on the show 14 times, chatting up Letterman about the Yankees, Mrs.
Clinton and life in New York. He even got some laughs in a few comedy skits.
</P>
<P>
	   During the interview, Letterman asked Mrs. Clinton what she thought of the
mayor and if he had the temperament to be a senator.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's done a lot of stuff as mayor but I think being senator is a different
kind of job," she said. "A senator can't go arrest a homeless person."
</P>
<P>
	   She aced Letterman's New York quiz, correctly identifying the state bird
(bluebird) and the state tree (sugar maple).
</P>
<P>
	   A special list of Mrs. Clinton's Top 10 reasons for finally appearing on the
show included "I lost a bet with Tipper" and "If Dan Quayle did it, how hard
could it be?"

<HEADLINE> Hornets' Phills Killed in Accident  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NOWELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets players Bobby Phills and David
Wesley were racing each other in their Porsches when Phills lost control and was
killed in a wreck, investigators said late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Preliminary estimates show Phills and Wesley were driving at speeds of more
than 75 mph when Phills lost control of his car just before 11 a.m. Wednesday,
police Sgt. Ricky Robbins, a supervisor in the traffic unit conducting the
investigation, told The Charlotte Observer.
</P>
<P>
	   The speed limit in the area where Phills wrecked is 45 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   Robbins said the players were in a spur-of-the-moment race. Racing on public
thoroughfares is prohibited by state law, and the district attorney's office
will determine what charges, if any, should be filed, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both players have been charged with speeding in the past, the Observer
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In February, Phills was charged with driving 60 mph in a 35 mph zone on Main
Street in Pineville. Court records show he paid a $25 fine and $86 in court
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Wesley was twice charged with speeding, according to Mecklenburg County
court records. In October 1997, he was charged with driving 60 mph in a 45 mph
zone. He paid $80 in court costs, according to court records. In December 1998,
Wesley was charged with driving 79 mph in a 65 mph zone on Interstate 485. He
paid $80 in court costs, and successfully completed the National Safety
Council's defensive-driving course six days after he was charged, according to
court records.
</P>
<P>
	   Stunned and tearful teammates and Hornets officials gathered at the accident
scene less than a mile from the Charlotte Coliseum, where minutes earlier Phills
and the other players had been practicing for Wednesday night's game with the
Chicago Bulls. The game was postponed.
</P>
<P>
	   Phills, 30, was traveling at a "very high rate of speed" when he collided
with a car headed toward the coliseum, police spokesman Keith Bridges said. A
minivan rear-ended the other car. Two people in those vehicles were
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
	   Wesley's car wasn't involved in the accident, but he was questioned at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Bridges said it will be at least several days before investigators
reconstruct what happened.
</P>
<P>
	   Phills lost control on a hilly curve where the posted speed was 45 mph, said
Capt. L.E. Blydenburgh, the crash investigator. "The skid marks indicate he was
not going in a straight line," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Phills' car, with the vanity plate "SLAMN," left skid marks several hundred
feet long and came to rest in one of the opposite lanes, Bridges said.
Firefighters had to cut his body from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
	   Listed in stable condition at Presbyterian Hospital were Robert Woolard Jr.,
31, of Cornelius, the driver of the other car; and Yao Agbegbon, 33, of
Charlotte, who was driving a minivan taxi, Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the ultimate tragedy, and our immediate thoughts and prayers are
with his wife, Kendall, children and family," Hornets owner George Shinn said in
a statement. "Not only was Bobby a tremendous person, but a great husband,
father and role model that everyone respected and admired. He was someone that
you would want your children to be like."
</P>
<P>
	   Phills, a 6-foot-5 defensive stopper and a team leader, started often at
shooting guard or small forward for the Hornets, and sometimes was a reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   He joined the Hornets in 1997 after six years with Cleveland and was in the
third year of a seven-year, $33 million contract. Phills averaged a career 10.9
points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.7 assists a game at the end of last season. He was
fourth on the team in scoring this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Cavaliers president Wayne Embry gave Phills his start in the NBA by signing
the guard to a 10-day contract.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bobby Phills was all that you would want in a human being," Embry said. "He
had extreme high character. A family man. I can't tell you what he meant to the
Cavs. If there's a person you would want to your children to be, a role model,
it's Bobby Phills."
</P>
<P>
	   Active in the community, Phills volunteered for children's charities and
related organizations. In 1998, he was one of four finalists for the NBA's
Sportsmanship Award and started the "Bobby Phills Educational Foundation."
</P>
<P>
	   "He touched all of our lives," said Bob Bass, the Hornets' executive vice
president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
	   NBA commissioner David Stern said Phills was "a caring member of the
community."
</P>
<P>
	   "Bobby Phills represented the very best of the NBA," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Phills earned a bachelor's degree in animal science from Southern
University. Ben Jobe, Phills' former coach at Southern, said Wednesday he tried
to keep Phills from the NBA.
</P>
<P>
	   "He could have been one of the foremost black leaders in the country," Jobe
said. "He had the brain power, he had the great family background. He had
everything. For years, I tried to get him to go on to med school like he talked
about when he was a kid."
</P>
<P>
	   Clay Moser, an assistant coach when Phills played for the CBA's Sioux Falls
Skyforce, said Phills had wanted to be a veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a very in-depth person and just a treasure to be around," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Phills' death was another in a series of shocks to hit North Carolina sports
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   Carolina Hurricanes defenseman Steve Chiasson died in May when his pickup
truck crashed outside Raleigh. Police said he was driving drunk.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Carolina Panthers receiver Rae Carruth was charged with killing his
girlfriend in November and could be sentenced to die if convicted of murder and
conspiracy charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Shinn was sued by a woman who claimed he sexually assaulted her. A Columbia,
S.C., jury found in his favor in December.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, Hornets guard Eldridge Recasner suffered a broken shoulder and a
collapsed lung and teammate Derrick Coleman was charged with drunken driving in
a traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the NBA, there have been three other active players who were
killed in accidents: Drazen Petrovic (1993) and Terry Furlow (1980) in car
crashes and Nick Vanos (1987) in an air crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Phills is survived by his wife, Kendall, and two children -- Bobby Ray III,
3, and Kerstie, 1.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks Hire Sidwell for Defense  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- Steve Sidwell was hired Wednesday as defensive coordinator
of the Seattle Seahawks, coach-general manager Mike Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sidwell, 55, arrives with a three-year contract to fill the gap left by the
death of defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur, who arrived with Holmgren from
Green Bay but was diagnosed with cancer and left the team last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   An 18-year league veteran, Sidwell was defensive coordinator for the New
England Patriots the last two years under Pete Carroll, who was fired the day
after New England ended n 8-8 season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Steve is a good coach with a strong system and has had a great deal of
success in the NFL," Holmgren said in a release.
</P>
<P>
	   Before his tenure with the Patriots, Sidwell joined the Green Bay staff in
1995 as linebackers coach under Holmgren, but left before the start of the
season to become defensive coordinator for the Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm glad I have a second chance to add Steve to my coaching staff,"
Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sidwell was defensive coordinator for the New Orleans Saints from 1986
through 1994. He previously was a defensive line coach with Indianapolis and
linebackers coach with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
	   Defensive assistant Bob Zeman announced his retirement Wednesday. He came
out of retirement in 1999 to assist the Seahawks' defensive coaching staff after
Shurmur's death. Zeman handled linebackers for the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bob Zeman was enjoying the good life of retirement and did a personal favor
to me this season," Holmgren said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Candidate Fights for Image  </HEADLINE>
   By KEN GUGGENHEIM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The biggest issue in the Mexican presidential campaign
these days is opposition candidate Vicente Fox's image. Literally.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox, considered the opposition's best hope of ending the ruling party's
70-year hold on the presidency, has been trying to get his photo in a
``V-for-victory'' pose included as part of his electoral coalition's logo on the
July 2 presidential ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   When an electoral court rejected the proposal, Fox's campaign came up with
another idea: the same logo with a silhouette replacing his photo. On Wednesday,
the court rejected that as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox said the alliance would try to fight the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the first decision was illegal and arbitrary, this is doubly so,'' he
said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, has a
powerful electoral tool in its logo. It is red, white and green -- the same
colors as the Mexican flag -- and is as widely recognized in Mexico as the
Coca-Cola emblem is in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   For the decades in which the PRI held a monopoly on power, many voters cast
ballots for any name alongside that logo in a gesture that often was more of a
statement of patriotism than an exercise in democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox has tried to defeat the PRI's powerful machinery and deep-rooted support
through an intensive media campaign, which he began an unheard of three years
before the election. His face has become a fixture on television and on
billboards, and he has gone from unknown governor of the small state of
Guanajuato to become the main rival of the PRI's candidate, Francisco Labastida.
</P>
<P>
	   Given Fox's wide recognition -- and that neither of the parties backing him
has massive, national support -- having his photo on the ballot would be a boost
in what could be a close election.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox is running under the banner of a coalition formed especially for the
election: the Alliance for Change, consisting of Fox's center-right National
Action Party and the small Green party.
</P>
<P>
	   The emblem originally submitted by the alliance showed a smiling Fox in the
victory pose against a backdrop of the logos of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Electoral authorities originally approved the logo, but their decision was
reversed Saturday by the electoral court. Though photographs were not expressly
prohibited, they were also not explicitly permitted, the court ruled. It also
said the emblem was an unacceptable form of propaganda.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox was furious, using a crude word to describe the decision as a ``dirty
trick.'' The party came back with a trick of its own: submitting the same logo
two days later, but with a white silhouette in place of Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   The court ruled that wasn't a significant change. It said it still violated
electoral laws because it served to boost a specific candidate rather than
represent the political parties.
</P>
<P>
	   It gave Fox's campaign 24 hours to present another logo, or it said it would
have one designed for the alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox said the alliance would probably let the court carry out its threat.
``Let's see if they make better emblems than they do judicial decisions,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Jail guards plead guilty to fatal beating of Nassau Jail inmate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) - Their job was to guard prisoners, but this
morning two Long Island corrections officers are spending their first full day
in a federal lockup after pleading guilty to fatally beating a recovering heroin
addict in his cell at the county jail.
<P>
	   The Jan. 8, 1999, beating was the most severe of more than 100 alleged cases
of abuse at the Nassau County jail in the last eight years and has led to an
ongoing investigation by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The guards, Patrick Regnier and Edward Velazquez, entered their guilty pleas
Wednesday before U.S. District Court Judge Jacob Mishler after a third guard cut
a deal last week, admitting that he served as the lookout during the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line here is they all pleaded guilty, really, to causing Thomas
Pizzuto's death and vindicated everything that this family has said about how it
happened," said attorney Barry Scheck, who represents the family in a civil
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Pizzuto, a 38-year-old recovering heroin addict, was crying out for his
methadone treatment at the time of his fatal beating. The Hicksville resident
was serving a 90-day sentence for traffic violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Three days after the beating, he suffered a seizure and died. The Nassau
County medical examiner determined Pizzuto suffered a ruptured spleen and ruled
the death a homicide.
</P>
<P>
	   Velazquez, under questioning from the judge, admitted that he went to
Pizzuto's cell "to quiet him down and use unreasonable force if necessary."
Regnier admitted to Mishler: "I did land on him with my knees. I did punch him
in the back."
</P>
<P>
	   The courtroom was packed for the guilty pleas, with Pizzuto's mother, widow
and wheelchair-bound father weeping quietly during the 70-minute session.
Outside, dozens of corrections officers stood quietly in support of their
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
	   "I cried," said Pizzuto's mother, Carol, at the sight of the officers'
supporters. "I walked up here today and I cried, because I couldn't believe this
is the world that we live in. That these people are backing up murderers ... to
my face. How could they do that?"
</P>
<P>
	   None of the corrections officers wanted to speak with reporters outside the
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount of prison time Velazquez and Regnier face at their April 7
sentencing will be determined by Mishler after a hearing on whether their
conduct amounted to murder or manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   A determination of murder could bring each guard up to life in prison, while
a manslaughter ruling would yield a sentence of between 3 1/2 and 12 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Pizzuto, tears streaming down her face, said she hopes they receive the
maximum.
</P>
<P>
	   "They plead for mercy, they showed my son no mercy," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense case suffered a major setback last week when a third guard
charged in the case, Ivano Bavaro, pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy and
witness tampering charges and agreed to testify.
</P>
<P>
	   Bavaro admitted he acted as a lookout while Velazquez and Regnier went into
Pizzuto's cell and pounded the inmate into silence.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial against a fourth guard, Joseph Bergen, accused of filing a false
report indicating that Pizzuto had slipped in the shower, is scheduled to start
next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The East Meadow jail, which houses about 1,800 inmates and is patrolled by
approximately 1,100 guards, has been the subject of numerous allegations of
guard misconduct. Following Pizzuto's death and other allegations of abuse, the
U.S. Attorney's office began an investigation to see whether a "pattern and
practice" of civil rights violations exists at the jail. That investigation
remains open.
</P>
<P>
	   Last March, a Nassau County corrections officer was found liable in the 1993
beating of a mentally retarded jail inmate with a frying pan. County officials
agreed to a $500,000 settlement in the inmate's civil rights lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   "The truth of the matter is that this has been going on for a long time in
the Nassau County Jail and everybody knows it," said Scheck. "There have been
civil suits that have been successfully brought against these guards and yet
nothing is done about it. And there's a code of silence and this code of silence
has to be broken."

<HEADLINE> Spain OK With Pinochet Decision  </HEADLINE>
   By KERNAN TURNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- If Britain allows Gen. Augusto Pinochet to leave
London a free man, it will be welcome news to the Spanish government, which has
been in a diplomatic hot seat since his arrest nearly 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   An end to the Pinochet saga will be especially satisfying to Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar, whose re-election depends on the outcome of the national
parliamentary vote in March.
</P>
<P>
	   Should Britain free Pinochet, Aznar will no longer have to fend off
criticism from the socialist opposition that he has been lukewarm about seeing
the former Chilean dictator stand trial in Spain on charges of human rights
abuses.
</P>
<P>
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw announced Tuesday that an independent
medical exam found the 84-year-old general unfit to stand trial, and Straw said
he was therefore inclined to cancel extradition proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   That opens the door for Pinochet to return home to Chile within weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Aznar has maintained neutrality since Pinochet was detained in London in
1998 on an arrest warrant filed by Spanish investigative magistrate Baltasar
Garzon.
</P>
<P>
	   Garzon's indictment accused Pinochet of genocide, terrorism and torture to
intimidate and silence political opponents, including Spanish citizens,
throughout his 1973-90 dictatorship. An official Chilean government report says
3,197 people died or disappeared after Pinochet led a coup to topple elected
Marxist President Salvador Allende.
</P>
<P>
	   Aznar's government never endorsed Pinochet's arrest or extradition. Neither
did it block extradition efforts by Garzon that pushed the case to the brink of
bringing Pinochet to Spain to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Along the way, Aznar's government caught much of the blame from both
Pinochet supporters and the governments of Chile and neighboring Argentina, an
uncomfortable position for a country that has staked much of its economic growth
on commercial ventures in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   Garzon has indicted 98 former military officers in Argentina on charges of
genocide, terrorism and torture and issued Interpol detention orders for 48 of
them involved in the 1976-83 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 9,000 Argentines vanished at the hands of the junta's troops during
the country's so-called ``dirty war'' two decades ago. Human rights groups say
the figure is closer to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
	   As the Pinochet case advanced, Argentina and Chile accused Spain of behaving
like it was still a colonial power in South America. Questions were raised over
what gave Spain the right to judge other dictatorships when it did nothing at
home after the death in 1975 of its own despot, Gen. Francisco Franco.
</P>
<P>
	   Spanish historians assert there is a major difference between the Chilean
and Spanish regimes. For one thing, Franco cannot be prosecuted because he is
dead. Pinochet's brutality was one-sided, they note, whereas in Spain, Franco's
opponents also committed atrocities before and during the Civil War that brought
him to power.
</P>
<P>
	   Adopting the slogan, ``Amnesty and Liberty,'' all sides agreed to a general
amnesty after Franco's death in order to help Spain avoid bloodshed and build a
stable democracy.

<HEADLINE> Novelist Bellow, 84, Has Baby Girl  </HEADLINE>
    By ERICA NOONAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Saul Bellow, the 84-year-old Nobel Prize-winning novelist, is
the father of a baby girl.
</P>
<P>
	   Bellow's fifth wife, Janis Freedman, 41, gave birth on Dec. 23, according to
sources close to the family. The child's name, her weight and the name of the
hospital where she was born were not available.
</P>
<P>
	   Bellow has three grown sons from previous marriages and several
grandchildren. This was his first child with Ms. Freedman.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Montreal to Russian immigrants, Bellow spent more than 50 years
living in and writing about Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, Bellow stunned the literary and academic world by joining the
faculty of Boston University, which offered positions to him and Ms. Freedman,
who holds a doctorate in the humanities.
</P>
<P>
	   Bellow is the author of 18 novels, including "Seize the Day," "Henderson the
Rain King," "Mr. Sammler's Planet," "The Adventures of Augie March" and
"Herzog." He also won three National Book Awards and the Pulitzer Prize for
"Humbolt's Gift," published in 1975.

<HEADLINE> R.I. Mayor Says No To 'The Sopranos'  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID RISING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Mayor Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr. rejected an
invitation to participate in a local screening of the season premiere of HBO's
mobster series "The Sopranos."
</P>
<P>
	   The cable network wanted to buy jars of the Mayor's Own Marinara Sauce,
which Cianci sells for charity, and give them away at the event.
</P>
<P>
	   But the mayor of the city once known as New England's mob headquarters
suggested the show makes Italian-Americans look bad.
</P>
<P>
	   "To offer my marinara for sale to 'The Sopranos' would be too high a price
to pay, even while adding to my scholarship fund for our Providence students,"
Cianci, who appeared in a first-season episode of NBC's sentimental show
"Providence," wrote to HBO.
</P>
<P>
	   "To accept would be to compromise the pride I have for my heritage, my
ethnic background and my strong beliefs that bias against any individual or
group is morally wrong."
</P>
<P>
	   Henry Gomez, HBO corporate affairs vice president, wrote back to say he was
disappointed by Cianci's response. The series' stars -- including James
Gandolfini and Lorraine Bracco -- would never "lend their talents to a program
that disparaged their Italian heritage," Gomez wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Gomez said, out of courtesy to Cianci, HBO canceled the Providence
premiere, set for mid-January. Screenings in about two dozen other cities are
proceeding as planned.
</P>
<P>
	   The New England mob had a strong presence in Rhode Island during its 1970s
heyday. Some brick walls still bear bullet holes from gangland slayings. But the
mob has been greatly weakened over the years, reduced to small-time operations
such as theft rings, authorities say.

<HEADLINE> Hysteria Blamed for Tenn. Outbreak  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF DONN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   It started with a funny smell, first noticed by a teacher in a school
kitchen. She felt sick to her stomach and several of her students felt strange.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon, by the dozens, students throughout the school complained of nausea,
dizziness, headaches and drowsiness.
</P>
<P>
	   Before it was over, more than 170 students, teachers and others sought
emergency treatment during the November 1998 outbreak at Warren County High
School in McMinnville, Tenn. The school of 2,000 students was closed for more
than two weeks. Nearly $100,000 was spent on emergency care alone.
</P>
<P>
	   A raft of government investigators studied the school grounds and analyzed
blood samples. They examined puddles and grease traps and even checked an air
space above the foundation. They looked for viruses, germs, pesticides,
herbicides, poisons -- anything that could conceivably make so many people ill
so quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   They found nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   In an article published in today's New England Journal of Medicine, they
blame the outbreak on mass hysteria -- real symptoms set off by spreading
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigators say such outbreaks are much more common than recognized at
schools and in other close-knit communities. And they say cases of mass hysteria
-- now called ``psychogenic illness'' -- will probably become more frequent and
more severe with rising public worry over biological terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   New technology may also be promoting new forms of hysteria. Dr. Ron House, a
University of Toronto researcher who has studied mass hysteria in Canada, said
Internet messages about real or imagined symptoms of conditions like chemical
sensitivity now appear to be touching off such outbreaks in people at great
distances from one another.
</P>
<P>
	   The phenomenon, though, has long historical roots. Hundreds of outbreaks of
mass hysteria have been documented over the past century, often among
schoolchildren, soldiers and factory workers. Some historians attribute a
feverish medieval mania of jerky movements, known as Saint Vitus' Dance and once
blamed on demons, largely to mass hysteria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a previous era, spirits and demons oppressed us. Although they have
been replaced by contemporary concerns about invisible viruses, chemicals and
toxins, the mechanisms of contagious fear remain the same,'' said Dr. Simon
Wessely of Guy's School of Medicine in London.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tennessee investigators are emphatic in saying that no virus, chemical
or toxin spread the illness through the school.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We did the most thorough environmental and epidemiological study that was
humanly possible,'' said Dr. Timothy Jones, a federal epidemiologist now at the
Tennessee Department of Health and lead author of the report.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it is still possible the outbreak was touched off by a real chemical
smell, though such a chemical was never discovered. But he said mass hysteria
soon took over and brought on the vast share of illness.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, the investigators found some classic hallmarks of contagious
anxiety: Victims were about three more times more likely than others to have
seen another sick person or to know that a classmate was ill. Sixty-nine percent
were women, compared with 52 percent of the school population.
</P>
<P>
	   Psychogenic illness is imperfectly understood. Females have long been
thought prone to it, though some experts now dismiss that as the bias of male
researchers. Others suggest that working women feel less control over their
environment than men -- another classic factor in hysteria. Outbreaks, often
worsened by news reports, are also thought to be more likely in groups under
great psychological or physical stress.
</P>
<P>
	   The impact was so profound at the Tennessee school that it remains a
sensitive topic for Principal George Bolding.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he smelled an odor himself and came down with a headache. But he
agrees that the outbreak later did turn into hysteria. ``Kids are unreal about
copying,'' he said. ``They see someone get sick, and they get sick.''
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers say outbreaks can sometimes be stemmed with fast reassurances.
But people often resist the mass-hysteria explanation, because they find it
embarrassing. Also, there are real environmental and biological threats that
often can't be ruled out without time-consuming tests.

<HEADLINE> Violations in Crane Collapse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Federal authorities have fined three companies more than
$500,000 for alleged safety violations in a crane collapse that killed three
ironworkers at the Milwaukee Brewers ballpark.
</P>
<P>
	   The workers were killed in July when a crane lifting a 400-ton section of
the ballpark's retractable roof toppled.
</P>
<P>
	   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company that
employed the ironworkers, Danny's Construction Co., $168,000 and alleged it
failed to keep employees clear of the suspended roof section.
</P>
<P>
	   Neil F. Lampson Inc., which leased the 567-foot crane to Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, was fined $131,300. Mitsubishi was fined $240,500. They were accused
of overloading the crane and failing to factor in wind conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel that if these companies had been in compliance with our
regulations, possibly this tragedy would not have occurred,'' OSHA area director
George Yoksas said.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to say what the agency thought caused the collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators relied on a 78-second videotape taken by OSHA employees who
were at the ballpark the same day investigating a previous accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Lampson, president of Neil F. Lampson Inc., said Wednesday his company
will appeal the citations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's absolutely inappropriate,'' he said. ``We leased the crane to
Mitsubishi and we're being cited for violations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Willie Mizell, president of Danny's Construction, said officials will meet
with OSHA before deciding whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitsubishi attorney Franklyn Gimbel said company officials also plan to meet
with OSHA officials in an attempt to erase or modify the citations. ``To claim
willfulness of these violations suggests that there was some conscious misdeeds,
and we just don't believe that's the fact,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> W.Va. Gov. Faults Same-Sex Marriage  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER BUNDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Gov. Cecil Underwood wants West Virginia to join
other states with legislation ensuring that people of the same sex cannot marry.
</P>
<P>
	   Underwood's staff said Wednesday that he will ask the Legislature to put on
all marriage license applications: ``Marriage is designed to be a loving and
lifelong union between a woman and a man.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a moral issue for him. He just believes in family values and family
traditions,'' said Jim Teets, the governor's chief of staff. ``It's an issue
that needs to be addressed before it becomes a problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, Hawaii's Supreme Court ruled that the failure to recognize gay
marriages amounted to gender discrimination. That set off preemptive legislation
in Congress and at least 30 states to ban same-sex marriages. Lawmakers feared
that gay couples would get married in Hawaii and then expect their home states
to recognize the marriages.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawaii eventually drew up a constitutional amendment against gay marriage,
and voters approved it 2-to-1 last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vermont Supreme Court ruled in December that gay and lesbian couples
there should enjoy all benefits and privileges afforded to heterosexual couples
who can legally marry. It was the first court in the nation to make such a
sweeping ruling on the question.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermont Gov. Howard Dean at the time predicted the state would comply with
the court decision by enacting a domestic partners law rather than making
marriage legal for same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
	   The West Virginia Legislature has debated bills banning same-sex marriages
for three years. Versions have passed both houses, only to die on the last day
of the legislative session because lawmakers could not compromise on language.
</P>
<P>
	   Changing marriage license applications to ensure that people of the same sex
cannot marry is unnecessary and promotes a negative stereotype of homosexuals,
said Chuck Smith, co-chairman of the West Virginia Gay and Lesbian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Under current law, ``It would be hard to find a county clerk to issue a
license to a same-sex couple,'' Chuck Smith said Wednesday. ``There is no reason
to do this. It's another message to the public that gay and lesbian people are
suspect at best, or bad at worst.''

<HEADLINE> Hit HBO Series 'Sopranos' Is Back  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Dysfunctional at best, murderous at worst, the Sopranos are
hardly anyone's idea of a model family.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet television viewers have embraced Tony, Carmela and their extended
famiglia. And on Sunday night they return -- after a long wait -- for a second
season on HBO.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Sopranos" received so much critical praise after only 13 episodes that
it was considered an upset when the series won just four of the 16 Emmy Awards
it was nominated for. Cable's TV Land network last week gave "The Sopranos" its
"Future Classic" award.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hands down, 'The Sopranos' is the most important television show to come
along in years," said Larry Jones, TV Land general manager. "The show's complex
characters and exciting, continuous plotlines all blend seamlessly thanks to one
of the most superb casts ever assembled on television."
</P>
<P>
	   Life doesn't improve this year for New Jersey mob boss Tony, already
suffering from anxiety attacks and a hit attempt ordered by his mother. His
flaky sister arrives from the West Coast and a new nemesis, Richie Aprile, is
released from jail with a chip on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a tribute to the deft work of series creator David Chase that Tony
Soprano became a favorite. The role even made balding, overweight star James
Gandolfini a sex symbol.
</P>
<P>
	   Filming on location in New Jersey with a largely Italian-American cast gives
the plot an ominous authenticity. The mix of mundane family problems with the
more unusual occupational hazards -- like inter-family gunplay -- often makes
"The Sopranos" hilarious.
</P>
<P>
	   Watch in the new season's third episode how the feared mob boss is reduced
to jelly by his teen-age daughter, who suggests her own "punishment" after being
caught partying: a brief ban on using her credit card. Tony and Carmela live in
fear that their daughter will discover how powerless they are to really
discipline her.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominic Chianese, who plays Soprano's uncle and rival, Junior, traces some
of "The Sopranos" success to feelings he remembers from watching King Kong as a
youngster. He feared the monster as he watched it toss subway cars like toys,
yet also felt a little sorry for him.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's got extremely relatable characters, aside from what those characters
do for a living," said Chris Albrecht, HBO president of original programming.
"Their emotions and what drives them feel honest for a wide variety of people."
</P>
<P>
	   As with most successful TV, few people saw it coming. Other networks, most
notably Fox, turned the series down. HBO chief executive Jeff Bewkes, almost
shuddering at the memory, said HBO nearly ordered Chase to change the series'
name.
</P>
<P>
	   In a short time, "The Sopranos" has helped change HBO's image. Once thought
of primarily for its movies and special events, the pay cable outlet is getting
more attention now for original series like "Sex and the City," "Oz" and "The
Chris Rock Show."
</P>
<P>
	   "These shows are successful because they're smart, they're real and they're
well done," Bewkes said. "They're not watered down to make sure everybody gets
it, so they'll still be sitting there when the Pringles commercial comes on."
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 10 million people watched each episode of "The Sopranos" during
its four weekly airings last year. The series rang up some of its best numbers
on New Year's week, when HBO ran the entire series for an unprecedented third
time, proving people are catching on by word of mouth.

	   HBO, which is in roughly a quarter of American homes, gained 350,000
subscribers last year, according to an outside analyst. No one can say how many

<HEADLINE> Illegal Immigrants Fight Deportation  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVE KARNOWSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- For nine Holiday Inn Express housekeepers from Mexico,
U.S. law cuts both ways.
</P>
<P>
	   They helped unionize their fellow housekeepers at the hotel in downtown
Minneapolis. Soon afterward, the hotel fired them and reported them to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service as illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the nine workers won a $72,000 settlement from the hotel in the
first case in which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission intervened on
behalf of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   But they still are almost certain to be deported to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   Though all nine have admitted entering the United States illegally, the
housekeepers say they would gladly trade their $8,000 checks for the right to
stay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have nothing in Mexico,'' said Norma Lerma del Torro, 28, a mother of
three. She said she might try to start a small business with her settlement
money and eke out a living if she is sent back.
</P>
<P>
	   Another one of the fired housekeepers, Estela Albino, 28, said she didn't
think her check would go far back home. Two of her sisters and three of her
cousins are also in the group. ``Things are so expensive there I don't think the
money would last long,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The housekeepers' attorney, Jorge Saavedra F., has asked Attorney General
Janet Reno and the INS to grant them amnesty. He said they deserve to stay
because they helped investigators from the National Labor Relations Board and
EEOC build a case against the hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now that the federal government is done using these folks as their key
witnesses, then they're calling in a third federal agency in the form of the INS
to show them the door,'' Saavedra F. said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barring amnesty or a favorable ruling from an immigration judge, the
immigrants will probably be deported in four to five months, said Curtis Aljets,
director of the regional INS office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're not entitled to pursue employment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The housekeepers have won supporters in high places, including Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., who said he spoke with INS Commissioner Doris Meissner on
Monday and plans to discuss the case with Reno.
</P>
<P>
	   Wellstone said he supports amnesty for the immigrants as ``a plea for
justice.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it was very courageous of these workers. They cooperated with the
EEOC. They cooperated with the Justice Department. They cooperated with the
NLRB,'' Wellstone said. ``If ever there could be an exception made, I think it
would be for these workers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like many other illegal immigrants, Ms. Albino and Ms. Lerma didn't have big
ambitions when they came to the United States about two years ago. Through an
interpreter, both women said they just wanted to find jobs that would support
them and let them send money home to their families.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Holiday Inn Express, they joined the army of immigrant workers --
legal and illegal -- that keeps hotels going across the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   There they claimed they were subjected to low wages, discriminatory working
conditions and exploitation because of their race, so they began organizing.
Several of the nine took leadership roles, and won a unionization vote in
August.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, managers of the hotel fired them and reported them to the INS,
which had them arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Hotel general manager Kevin Koenig denied reporting the workers to the INS
in retaliation for their union activity. He said that he had a duty to report
them after discovering they were in the country illegally, and that he feared
possible fines.
</P>
<P>
	   After the arrests, Local 17 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
Union filed a complaint with the NLRB and the EEOC.
</P>
<P>
	   That led to the first major test of new EEOC policies meant to protect all
employees against discrimination regardless of their immigration status. The
EEOC's lawsuit against the hotel was the first under the new guidelines, which
were issued in October.
</P>
<P>
	   While denying any wrongdoing, the hotel agreed Jan. 6 to settle the case and
train its managers on the relevant discrimination and labor laws. It agreed on a
contract with the union last month.

<HEADLINE> Russia Media Question Chechen War  </HEADLINE>
   By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- After a string of military setbacks in Chechnya, the Russian
news media are starting to question the handling of the war as casualties mount
and the promises of swift victory look increasingly empty.
</P>
<P>
	   Suddenly, newspapers are challenging the military's claims that the war is
going well and are portraying the war as a replay of the botched 1994-96
campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Triumphal march in Chechnya -- stepping on a rake'' read a headline in the
daily Moskovsky Komsomolets. ``Chechnya turns into minefield for Russian
politicians,'' said the daily Segodnya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The period of great victories and claims of success is over,'' the daily
Izvestia wrote this week. ``The federal troops suffered a serious defeat, which
immediately brought to light military commanders' errors.''
</P>
<P>
	   But while the military is under fire, there is little sign that the blame is
rubbing off on acting President Vladimir Putin, despite warnings that it could
damage his chances in March 26 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
	   When the war started in September, the media mirrored the view of many
Russians that the campaign was justified by Chechen attacks on Dagestan, a
neighboring region, and a string of apartment bombings in Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   The media started to question the war after rebels attacked several towns
this week that ostensibly were under Russian control. Russian forces suffered
heavy losses in the 1994-96 Chechen war and some observers say the latest
conflict is sinking into a familiar quagmire that will erode public support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sooner or later, society may decide that the price of the little
victorious war is becoming unacceptable,'' Izvestia columnist Georgy Bovt wrote
in a front-page commentary.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the military setbacks, opinion polls show Putin's popularity has not
been damaged, even though many people now realize the war is in trouble,
pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
	   In a nationwide poll by the respected ROMIR polling agency, 55 percent of
respondents said they would vote for Putin. The acting president's closest
rival, Communist chief Gennady Zyuganov, had the support of just 13 percent. The
poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's popularity does not depend on his handling of the war, as has been
suggested by some analysts, said Natalia Laidinen, a researcher with ROMIR. Many
Russians like Putin because they believe he is a tough leader who can tackle the
country's problems, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Public opinion doesn't link the military setbacks in Chechnya with
Putin,'' Laidinen said. ``People view Putin as an embodiment of their dream of a
strong and tough leader. His charisma of a heroic winner will continue to make
him immune from any talk of defeat.''
</P>
<P>
	   The same poll found that 50 percent of respondents said they expect the war
to drag on for a ``very long time,'' while 19 percent expected a quick victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Strong support for Putin will last until the election even if the
situation in Chechnya grows worse,'' Laidinen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some journalists say the media criticism of the war may not last. The
government may appeal to the media to support national interests and the army
will make it tough for critical news organizations to cover the war, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At some point, Putin will simply meet with newspapers editors and remind
them about the need to stand up for Russia's interests, and it will be quiet
again,'' Yulia Kalinina, military editor of Moskovsky Komsomolets, said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian military, with the help of state-run television, has tried to
control media coverage to sustain public support for the war. Extensive coverage
of the last war helped turn public opinion against it as people saw horrific
scenes on their television screens.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign journalists have mostly been barred from Chechnya, and Russian
journalists generally travel under military supervision. Russian reporters who
have covered the war say the military press service bans journalists who write
even mildly critical stories.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reporters entirely depend on the military officials and know far too well
that they would never be allowed to visit troops again if they make a negative
report,'' Kalinina said.

<HEADLINE> Tall Guys Get Girls, Have More Kids  </HEADLINE>
   By RICK CALLAHAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   If it seemed as if the tall guys got all the girls in high school, it wasn't
your imagination. New research suggests taller men are more likely to marry and
tend to have more children than short guys.
</P>
<P>
	   What's behind the phenomenon -- whether women prefer taller men or those men
are simply more outgoing -- is up for debate. But the numbers clearly stack up
against shorter guys.
</P>
<P>
	   Polish and British scientists studied the medical records of about 3,200
Polish men ages 25 to 60 and found that childless men were on average 1.2 inches
shorter than men who had at least one child.
</P>
<P>
	   Bachelors were about an inch shorter on average than married men. That was
true even after researchers took into account the fact that men's heights
increased in recent decades because of better nutrition and health care.
</P>
<P>
	   The records, which were collected in Wroclaw, Poland, from 1983 to 1989,
showed that tall men in their 20s, 30s and 40s all had more children than their
shorter peers.
</P>
<P>
	   Height didn't seem to matter for men in their 50s. Robin I.M. Dunbar of the
University of Liverpool said that is because those men came of age after World
War II -- a catastrophe that claimed the lives of many Polish men and reduced
women's mating options.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Dunbar said the numbers clearly show that women favor taller men --
something that other research suggests is true across all cultures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Basically, height is a proxy for other variables that women find desirable
-- men who can protect them, provide them with resources, have good social
status and aren't easily dominated by other men,'' said Dunbar, a professor of
evolutionary psychology and the study's co-author.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings were published in today's issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
	   Out of the military service records of 4,400 men, the researchers excluded
men who were abnormally short or tall. The average height of the 3,200 men whose
records were part of their final sample was 5-foot-6.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers meant to study men whose height and reproductive success
were not so gargantuan, or so small, as to have skewed their results. Their
methodology would have excluded someone like Wilt Chamberlain, the 7-foot-1
basketball star who bragged of sleeping with 20,000 women.
</P>
<P>
	   While other studies have shown that taller-than-average men have higher
incomes and social status than shorter men, this study is the first to
demonstrate a direct link between height and reproductive success, said David
Buss, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
	   Buss, who has written two books on human mating habits, said the female
preference for taller males harkens back to the earliest stages of human
evolution. That was a time when prehistoric women chose mates who could offer
them the best protection and provide for their needs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This study shows that even in modern times the kind of selection we might
think of as prehistoric continues to operate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunbar said he undertook the research after noticing that in personal ads
men advertised their height only if they were tall or taller than average.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You didn't see any advertisements saying, `I'm 5-foot-3, give me a
call,''' he said.

<HEADLINE> Twice As Many Americans By 2100  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America will be a bit older and much more diverse a
century from now, and there will be twice as many of us.
</P>
<P>
	   New population projections from the Census Bureau today call for the
population to jump from the current 275 million to 571 million in 2100, with a
median age rising above 40 and larger proportions of minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   An older America could mean profound social and economic changes, such as an
increased demand for nursing home care, prescription drugs, and greater demands
on the country's Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even though childbearing levels in the United States remain quite close to
the level needed only to replace the population, the increasing number of
potential parents and continued migration from abroad would be sufficient to add
nearly 300 million people during the next century,'' said Census Bureau analyst
Frederick W. Hollmann.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because the Hispanic and Asian and Pacific Islander populations in the
U.S. are younger than the nation as a whole and because they continue to receive
international migrants, these populations will become increasingly prominent,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Census projection calls for the nation's population to probably reach
300 million in 2011, 400 million in 2049 and 500 million in 2081.
</P>
<P>
	   By comparison, the U.S. population was 5.3 million in 1800 and 75.9 million
in 1900. The United Nations projects the world's population to rise from the
current 6 billion to about 9.4 billion in 2100.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, the Baby Boom generation creates a bulge in the U.S. population
at ages 35 to 39 and 40 to 44, the only two segments making up more than 8
percent of the total. And today's population includes just 65,000 people aged
100 and over, 0.02 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
	   By 2100 the over-100 crowd is expected to grow to 5.3 million, 0.9 percent
of the total, and no five-year age group will even reach 7 percent of all
Americans. The largest age group is expected to be those aged 15 to 19, at 6.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The projections show an especially rapid surge in the elderly population as
the surviving baby boomers pass age 65. In the year 2011, baby boomers -- those
born between 1946 and 1964 -- will begin turning 65.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 2011 and 2030, the number of elderly would rise from 40.4 million,
13 percent of the population, to 70.3 million, 20 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
	   The median age in 2100 is expected to be 40.3, compared to the current 35.8.
Median means half of all Americans will be older than that and half younger.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hispanic population is expected to triple from 31.4 million in 1999 to
98.2 million in 2050. Hispanics could become the nation's largest minority group
with their percentage rising from 12 percent in 1999 to 24 percent in 2050.
</P>
<P>
	   The Asian and Pacific Islander population, meanwhile, would more than
triple, from 10.9 million in 1999 to 37.6 million in 2050. Its percentage of the
total population would rise from 4 percent now to 9 percent in 2050.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the projections, the non-Hispanic White and African American
populations would increase more slowly than the other groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The non-Hispanic White population would rise from 196.1 million in 1999 to
213.0 million in 2050, a 9 percent increase. Its share of the total population
would decline, however, from 72 percent in 1999 to 53 percent in 2050.
</P>
<P>
	   The black population would rise from 34.9 million in 1999 to 59.2 million in
2050, a 70-percent increase; under this projection, the black share of the total
population would increase slightly, from 13 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The projections for racial and ethnic groups are given only through 2050
because the figures are considered less reliable for the latter parts of the
century.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 1999 and 2050, the total number of foreign-born would more than
double, increasing from 26.0 million to 53.8 million. The proportion of the
nation's population that is foreign-born would rise from 10 percent in 1999 to
13 percent in 2050.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture's Future Outlined  </HEADLINE>
    By ROXANA HEGEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREAT BEND, Kan. (AP) -- Widespread social and lifestyle changes, coupled
with unprecedented household wealth, will allow 21st Century farmers to use
emerging technologies to deliver safer, healthier foods to consumers at premium
prices, a futurist says.
</P>
<P>
	   Lowell Cattlett, a professor at the New Mexico State University, outlined
his vision for the future Wednesday at the Agriculture Vision 2000 conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Changes in the past century have created a spoiled society with the money to
demand agricultural products that integrate the latest medicinal benefits and
are produced on environmentally safe farms, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It means we are not just feeding hungry mouths. It means we can take
agriculture to the next step," Cattlett said.
</P>
<P>
	   Technologies are now being developed that will intertwine medicine and
agriculture to produce foods that can vaccinate the world against diseases such
as small pox.
</P>
<P>
	   The future of Kansas wheat production, for example, may lie in growing
genetically modified wheat to produce bread for people who are glucose
intolerant, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a world totally inseparable from medicine, totally inseparable from
the environment," Cattlett said.
</P>
<P>
	   As 1900 dawned across America, the average person lived to the age of 46.
But by the end of 1999, the average person lived to age 76 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have four generations of people alive and healthy -- with lots of
money," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   That money -- $36 trillion in household wealth in this country -- will play
an increasingly bigger role in the coming years, he said, because $26 trillion
of it is held by an aging generation that will soon pass it on to the free
spending, baby-boom generation.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we get the $26 trillion, we are going to spend it," Cattlett said.
</P>
<P>
	   In agriculture alone, $7 trillion in farm real estate is going to change
hands as aging farmers retire in the next few years, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a phenomenal change -- get ready for it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two-day Vision 2000 conference was sponsored by Kansas State University,
Water Protection Association of Central Kansas and the consulting firm of
Kennedy and Coe, LLC.
</P>
<P>
	   The conference explored some of the emerging technologies and issues shaping
agriculture in 2000 and beyond. Among them is growing use of precision
agriculture to do such things as help farmers calculate -- using ground
positioning systems from orbiting satellites -- the exact amount of fertilizer
to put on a field.
</P>
<P>
	   For some, the vision of the future includes returning to some of the
practices of the past.
</P>
<P>
	   Pete Ferrell, a Butler County rancher, has put together the Tall Grass
Prairie Producers Cooperative to help him and his neighbors raise beef cattle in
the Flint Hills in the same manner that buffalo once roamed the plains --
without intervention from the rancher.
</P>
<P>
	   "For all our technology and hoopla, we haven't improved over nature,"
Ferrell said.
</P>
<P>
	   His vision for the future includes cooperatives where ranchers have pooled
their land to allow cattle to range unfenced prairies.

<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- After more than a century as the minority party,
Republicans have seated their first majority in the Virginia House of Delegates
and taken total control of state government for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   S. Vance Wilkins Jr., who worked for 20 years to bring the GOP to power in
the House, took the oath of office Wednesday as the first Republican speaker
since 1883.
</P>

George Allen and Linwood Holton, jammed the House chamber for the start of the
60-day legislative session.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans won House control in November, capturing 52 seats. The Democrats
won 47, with one independent who usually votes with the GOP. Republicans
maintained their 21-19 majority in the Senate.

	   ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. (AP) -- Mayor Arlene Mulder says residents in this
fast-growing Chicago suburb are entitled to some peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
	   She fears a federal proposal to require trains to blow their whistles at all
public railroad crossings would shatter that quiet -- and drop property values
in a community where developers are spending millions of dollars to build
condominiums and townhouses near commuter tracks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The real threat is to quality of life,'' Mulder said. ``We've been working
so hard to rebuild and revitalize downtown, and now they say they're going to
blow whistles?''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Railroad Administration officials say train whistles are being
silenced at the expense of lives in many communities. They want nearly 250
communities that have banned whistles to let the warnings sound once more unless
other steps are taken to improve crossing safety.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is really about life and death and how we can prevent truly preventable
injuries and deaths,'' FRA Administrator Jolene Molitoris said Wednesday.
``That's our goal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Agency officials said there were 431 deaths and more than 1,300 injuries in
highway-rail crossing accidents in 1998. And they said the collision rate jumps
62 percent when train whistles aren't blown.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue is especially important in Illinois. The state had the
second-highest number of train-related deaths in the nation even before an
Amtrak train collided with a steel-laden semitrailer in Bourbonnais last March,
killing 11 people and injuring more than 100.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 1991 and 1998, there were 288 train-related deaths in Illinois,
second only to Texas. Illinois has the second-highest number of crossings in the
nation -- 15,746 -- meaning more noise for residents if the federal regulation
is adopted.
</P>
<P>
	   Train horns -- two long blasts followed by one short and one long -- are
standard practice at most of the 158,000 public railroad crossings across
America. But there are about 2,200 railroad crossings in 247 communities that
have enacted local bans prohibiting trains from sounding their horns.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal rule would likely supersede local ``quiet zones.'' The FRA will
grant exceptions to communities that take steps to improve crossing safety,
including adding gates or lane dividers to keep motorists from zigzagging around
gates, or installing cameras to catch violators.
</P>
<P>
	   Molitoris said communities can apply for federal and state grants and loans
to help pay for improvements needed to qualify as quiet zones.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ronald Hamelberg, president of Barrington -- a village of some 10,500
people and nine railroad crossings about 35 miles northwest of Chicago -- said
the town's portion of the cost still would be too much.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't lay this all on our citizens,'' he said. ``We're going to need
some financial help.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mulder said Arlington Heights would have no choice but to find money
somewhere to help the ``thousands and thousands of people trying to sleep at
night.''
</P>
<P>
	   Public hearings on the rules, which also propose a volume limit for train
horns, will be held this spring in Ohio, Massachusetts, Florida, Oregon,
California, the District of Columbia, Indiana and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials don't expect to finalize the regulation until 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Leroy Jones, a former engineer and national legislative representative for
the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, said blowing train horns would reduce
deaths and injuries from crossing collisions, which totaled 3,508 in 1998, the
most recent figures available.
</P>
<P>
	   Noisy train horns, however, have been too much to take for some residents in
Elkhart, Ind., east of South Bend.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Gilot, public works and utilities director, said his city has
petitioned state officials to prevent engineers from blowing horns at 11 of 38
crossings in the community, which is home to a large rail yard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At some of these crossings there's like 85 trains a day. The long blasts
have gotten some people upset. They understand it in rural areas where they
don't have gates, but don't think they're needed where there's gated
crossings,'' Gilot said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the business leaders calculated how many horn blasts we had been
subjected to every day. It was astronomical.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Despite setbacks, state stays with teacher education plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York's schools deserve an "A" for standards and
accountability, but class sizes and parental involvement rate a "D-plus",
according to a national education magazine.
<P>
	   For the quality of teachers - which measured both the number of teachers
working in their fields and individual assessments - Education Week gave Empire
State educators a "C-plus."
</P>
<P>
	   Quality Counts 2000, the Maryland-based publication's fourth annual look at
public schooling in kindergarten through 12th grade, found that many states,
including New York, often fail to meet their own goals.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine, which rated schools in all 50 states in a report published
Wednesday, said New York education officials have stuck by most of the goals the
Board of Regents adopted in mid-1998. But it noted that the state has
backtracked in some areas, including tougher teacher education, certification
and continuing education standards.
</P>
<P>
	   State education officials say they are not turning back, they simply know
more now than when they set the goals and they are doing some fine-tuning.
</P>
<P>
	   "Whenever you bring a policy to life there are all kinds of adjustments and
compromises that are made," state Education Commissioner Richard Mills said.
"Much of that has to do with the fact that the Regents never propose things
without listening to a number of different ideas or voices."
</P>
<P>
	   According to Education Week, there's been a major shift in the state's
thinking on tenure.
</P>
<P>
	   A recent state policy would have required new teachers to get a master's
degree within two years.
</P>
<P>
	   But the latest proposal, which the state Board of Regents is expected to act
on this year, would extend that period to three years. Currently, the state
gives beginning teachers five years to earn a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state's decision is an acknowledgment that for many people it is
financially impossible to get a masters' degree as a beginning teacher," Philip
Ellis, manager of educational services with the New York State United Teachers
union, said. "It's particularly tough if those young teachers are working on a
full-time basis because at this time they should really be trying to get
acclimated to the job."
</P>
<P>
	   Mills said the Regents' ultimate goal is to employ teachers who are fluent
in the subjects they are instructing, and who have broad experience and the
ability to teach students with diverse needs.
</P>
<P>
	   Other controversial proposals included those which narrowed the number of
grades that an educator is licensed to teach in New York. Now, the state has two
types of certification for teachers in regular education: pre-kindergarten
through sixth grade and seventh grade through 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the latest proposal before the Board of Regents, those would be
replaced by four certificates: birth through second grade; first grade through
sixth grade; fifth grade through ninth grade; and seventh grade through 12th
grade.
</P>
<P>
	   "New teachers need to understand the subjects they teach but they also need
to understand how children grow and develop and the Regents are trying to
combine both perspectives in the standards for teachers," Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   But according to Ellis, the new breakdown might be self defeating.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have concerns that the narrowing of certification areas could
potentially lead to shortages of teachers in some areas, especially the first
certification (birth to second grade)," Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a student was going to become a teacher and was concerned about
long-term employment they might look for certification areas with the widest
grade spans, so people may not want to become kindergarten teachers and we may
potentially end up with a shortage of kindergarten teachers.

<HEADLINE> Senators 2, Mighty Ducks 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Ron Tugnutt earned his seventh career shutout and
Vaclav Prospal scored the go-ahead goal with 8:31 left as the Ottawa Senators
extended their road-unbeaten streak to five games Wednesday night with a 2-0
victory over the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
	   Tugnutt and Guy Hebert, who shared goalie duties in Anaheim during the
Ducks' inaugural season of 1993-94, were in a scoreless battle until Prospal
beat Hebert with a slap shot from the middle of the left circle for his 10th
goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Marian Hossa, on his 21st birthday, added an empty-net goal with a minute to
play.
</P>
<P>
	   Tugnutt, who earned the first-ever Ducks victory, stopped 32 shots for his
fourth shutout this season. Hebert made 23 saves for Anaheim, winless in its
last seven games (0-5-2).
</P>
<P>
	   Ottawa goalies have recorded five shutouts, one fewer than last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Anaheim's power play, which has gone from first in the league last season to
last this season, went 0-for-3 and is 1-for-33 in eight games.
</P>
<P>
	   About three minutes into the game, Anaheim's Ted Donato found Paul Kariya
all alone about 15 feet in front of the net with a pass from the left boards,
but the Ducks' career-leading goal scorer fanned on the shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Anaheim's Jeff Nielsen was sent off for boarding 25 seconds into the third
and Kariya had a short-handed chance moments later. But Tugnutt got his blocking
pad on a rising slap shot from the top of the left circle to deny him.
</P>
<P>
	   Tugnutt's closest call came with 2 1-2 minutes left in the second when he
stopped Teemu Selanne twice from the edge of the crease.
</P>
<P>
	   Selanne came close again with 12 1-2 minutes left, when his rising slap shot
from between the circles glanced off Tugnutt's mask.

<HEADLINE> Politics Seeing Sharper Tongues  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Clinton's face morphs into Sen. John McCain's.
Pollution bellows out of Texas smokestacks. A narrator explains the importance
of abortion rights over the image of the Supreme Court's majestic facade.
</P>
<P>
	   Each image has run across voters' television screens in an attempt to
influence the presidential debate. But not one was paid for -- or even tied to
-- a candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   As actual voting nears, candidates are inching closer to negative
advertising, but the nastiest ads by far have been produced by outside groups
with their own agendas.
</P>
<P>
	   They're called issue ads, they've been on the rise during the 1990s, and
experts say campaign 2000 won't be any different.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a matter of keeping up with the Joneses,'' said Larry Sabato, a
political scientist at the University of Virginia. ``If some of your competitor
interest groups are airing ads you want to get out there, too.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sometimes campaigns welcome them, but in many cases, even the candidate who
is ostensibly helped is wary. Unlike their own ads, they have no control over
what many outside groups put on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
	   Take Grover Norquist, an anti-tax advocate who is airing ads against McCain
because the Arizona senator backs legislation overhauling campaign finance laws.
Furious, McCain said Norquist was a supporter of GOP presidential front-runner
George W. Bush and he demanded that Bush tell him to get the ads off the air.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush responded that he had nothing to do with the ads. Norquist, he said,
once ran ads against him, too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that candidates feel compelled to respond to these issue ads
suggest they worry the candidates,'' said Bill Benoit, who studies political
advertising at the University of Missouri. ``If they want to raise the issue,
then I'd say mission accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League was first out of
the box in the presidential race, airing ads accusing Bush and then-candidate
Elizabeth Dole of being more anti-abortion than they were trying to appear.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, Citizens for Life, a New Hampshire group, complains in ads that McCain
once referred to the Leisure World senior citizens home as ``Seizure World.'' He
also said: ``The nice thing about Alzheimer's is you get to hide your own Easter
eggs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Citizens for Life didn't think it was funny.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates themselves usually are much more subtle in their jabs at one
another.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and McCain each have ads attacking President
Clinton, but only Republican Steve Forbes names an opponent in his paid media.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't believe in negative campaigning,'' Bush told reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, just days ago, his campaign was taping footage of people on the
street, including some criticizing McCain's tax plan with prompting from the
Bush team. Bush aides said the footage was not turned into an ad and a decision
had not been made about whether to run a critical spot. Then Bush and McCain
agreed during a debate to forgo negative ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign put the footage on the shelf. But a college student who was
filmed, Heidi Quigley, wasn't happy about being coached to poke at McCain, and
she has defected to the Arizona senator's camp.
</P>
<P>
	   That left Bush aides pedaling backward, saying they were simply preparing in
case McCain went negative first. ``The ad will not run,'' Bush said Wednesday.
``I'm going to treat my friend and opponent with respect.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign didn't buy the Bush line. ``Taping a negative ad and then
promising not to run it is the high-tech version of smoking pot without
inhaling,'' said Dan Schnur, a McCain spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, meanwhile, is flooding Iowa airwaves with an ad accusing Bush, the
Texas governor, of breaking a promise not to support tax hikes in his state. In
the ad, an anti-tax activist accuses Bush of ``a record of broken promises'' on
taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Bush supported a tax-cut bill that included some increases in the
sales tax, which critics say was a violation of his no-new-taxes pledge, made in
1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is set to respond. In a new ad planned for Iowa, he promises to run a
campaign free of ``cynical and negative politics.'' He also says, without naming
Forbes, that ``my opponent has chosen to run a negative campaign,'' advisers
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He's hoping Iowa voters will recall the barrage of negative ads Forbes used
to weaken eventual GOP nominee Bob Dole during the 1996 primaries.

<HEADLINE> Texas, Okla. Execute Killers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man who strangled a woman and child who lived
next door to him was put to death Wednesday, the 200th execution in Texas since
capital punishment resumed in the state in 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   Earl Carl Heiselbetz Jr., 48, was executed by injection for the 1991
killings of Rena Rogers and her 2-year-old daughter, Jacy. Early Thursday, a
convicted killer was executed in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
	   Strapped to a gurney before the execution began, Heiselbetz looked at his
mother and father, who were watching through a window nearby, and said: ``Love
y'all. See you on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
	   Heiselbetz had said he could not remember killing the woman and child, who
were his closest neighbors in a secluded area near the Sabine National Forest in
east Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Rogers and her daughter disappeared after returning home from a
midmorning trip to the grocery store. Their remains were found a month later in
a barn.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Heiselbetz confessed after the bodies were found. They said
Heiselbetz, an unemployed truck driver, had gone over to the Rogers house to
make 1-900 calls for a sweepstakes and might have been caught there when the
woman and her daughter came home.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas leads all states in executions since the Supreme Court allowed the
death penalty to resume in 1976. Virginia is second with 72.
</P>
<P>
	   In McAlester, Okla., a man who strangled five people in 1984 was executed by
injection as nearly three dozen of his victims' relatives watched.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Alan Walker, 46, was executed for the murder of his first victim. Eddie
Cash, a 63-year-old widower, had been beaten with a brick and strangled with a
vacuum cleaner cord.
</P>
<P>
	   Walker, 46, killed Cash on May 6, 1984. By the month's end, Walker had
murdered four other people.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony in Walker's defense told of beatings as a child at the hands of
his stepfather and of an incestuous relationship with his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts said Walker, a former mental patient, suffered a psychotic episode
and killed Cash while confusing him with his abusive stepfather. The jury
rejected the insanity defense.

<HEADLINE> Small college prepares for Clinton visit while mourning death of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - President Clinton is slated to visit a small Brooklyn
college today just days after a maintenance worker was found murdered there.
<P>
	   Who killed Jorge Cordova remained a mystery. According to initial police
reports, investigators thought the 46-year-old had fallen down the stairs at
Boricua College on Monday, and, in a freak accident, punctured his chest with
the pens in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Wednesday, the medical examiner's office ruled Cordova's death a
homicide, finding that the puncture wound came from a bullet.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is slated to help launch a small business development center at the
private, four-year bilingual institution. The more than 1,000 students are
predominantly Latino.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's visit was to continue as planned, said White House spokesman
Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is obviously a tragedy, but the president very much wants to visit the
college," Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cordova was found unconscious inside the school with a puncture wound and
blood on his chest after officers responded to a 911 call from Assistant Dean
John Guzman about a noise, police said. Cordova was taken to Woodhull Hospital
where he was pronounced dead shortly after 8 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   He had worked as a maintenance worker for about five years, said his boss,
Angel Reyes.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a happy person - he never spoke about any enemies or anything like
that," Reyes said. "Everybody here loved him."
</P>
<P>
	   Cordova's family could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbor Julissa Pena said Cordova, his wife, and their two daughters - ages
15 and 18 - were like family to her.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a great father and also he was a good housewife, because he would
always be planting flowers. He would always cook," said Ms. Pena, 17.
</P>
<P>
	   She said her building's residents will miss Cordova's singing and guitar
playing.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every Saturday he would play his music loud and he would sing because he's
a great singer," Ms. Pena said, adding that Cordova was originally from Puerto
Rico, and came to the city when he was a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a very friendly, very nice person," she said. "He used to come to my
house to put up the curtains, help out with anything we needed, help put in the
air conditioner, anything like that."

<HEADLINE> Additional Links in Border Arrests  </HEADLINE>
   By WILSON RING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- Federal officials say cellular telephone records
link a woman arrested last month in Vermont to two Algerians suspected of trying
to smuggle explosives into the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In court documents filed Wednesday, federal prosecutors for the first time
tied Canadian Lucia Garofalo with Algerians Abdel Ghani and Ahmed Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   Their arrests stirred fears of terrorist attacks over the holiday season.
Ressam had a one-night reservation at a motel near Seattle's Space Needle, which
was cited as one reason for the cancellation of the New Year's bash there.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Garofalo was arrested trying to cross the border at Beecher Falls, Vt.,
on Dec. 19. Five days earlier, Ressam was arrested in Washington state allegedly
trying to carry bomb materials into the United States. And on Dec. 30, Ghani was
arrested in New York City and accused of attempting to meet up with Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a close and concerning link between Ms. Garofalo and the
investigations that are under way in New York and Seattle,'' Assistant U.S.
Attorney Tristram Coffin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Ms. Garofalo, a 35-year-old mother of three, have disputed the
government's allegations and say they do not prove she was part of a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Magistrate Judge Jerome Niedermeier agreed to continue holding Ms. Garofalo
without bail until her trial on immigration violations, tentatively scheduled
for Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   The alleged telephone links are circuitous, prosecutors said. But they said
that was how the terrorist organization that Ghani and Ressam belonged to
operated. Previously, Ressam and Ghani have been linked to the Algerian Armed
Islamic Group, known by its French acronym GIA.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Kirby said there were a series of telephone
calls between people who have ties to Ressam and Ms. Garofalo last month around
the time of both their arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The timing of the link is remarkable in that it occurs during the December
period when the defendant and Ressam were committing their crimes,'' Kirby
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam, who was arrested at Port Angeles, Wash., has pleaded innocent to
five charges related to bomb-making. Ghani, 31, was charged with being Ressam's
accomplice.
</P>
<P>
	   The individual common to most of the players was a man named Raja Aslam,
prosecutors said. A telephone number registered to Aslam allegedly was in Ms.
Garofalo's pocket when she was arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Records show that on Dec. 14, 1999, the date Ressam tried to bring
explosives into the United States, Garofalo called this cell phone,'' according
to court records.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Garofalo's attorney, Maryanne Kampmann, said that did not prove Ms.
Garofalo was part of a conspiracy. She said Ms. Garofalo did not know who made
the call.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Garofalo told Kampmann someone else had used her phone, although Coffin
said that did not explain the telephone number in Garofalo's pocket.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It may be the gentleman who used the phone left the scrap of paper in her
car. We are talking one phone call. There is no other contact,'' Kampmann said.
</P>
<P>
	   Additional calls were placed from a number assigned to Aslam to one that
prosecutors said was assigned to Abdel Ghani and to the cell phone belonging to
an unidentified person.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Records disclose that over the period Dec. 11 to 19, this latter (person)
called a number belonging to Abdel Ghani over 20 times, including six times on
Dec. 19, the day that Garofalo was arrested,'' Kirby wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Other telephone records showed contacts between a cell phone belonging to
Aslam to a cell phone ``somewhere in Vermont during the early morning hours of
Dec. 15, 1999.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors have alleged that Ms. Garofalo was turned back on that date when
she tried to cross the border at Pittsburg, N.H. They allege that she later
crossed the border successfully but illegally. On a third attempt, they said,
she was arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Another Algerian linked to Ghani was indicted Wednesday by a federal grand
jury in Seattle. Abdel Hakim Tizegha, 29, was charged with illegally re-entering
the United States and eluding border officers at the Canadian border at Blaine,
about 100 miles north of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Tizegha was arrested Dec. 24 and had been held without bond. No link has
been made in court between Tizegha and Ressam, but newspaper reports have said

<HEADLINE> GOP Chooses Moderates for Response  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are turning to two soft-spoken first-term
senators who are known as political conciliators to present the party's views
following President Clinton's State of the Union address Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   Sens. Bill Frist of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine will go before a
national audience after Clinton's speech to Congress to outline GOP approaches
to such issues as health care reform and education.
</P>
<P>
	   They will also help the party convey an image that it is made up of young --
both are 47 -- down-to-earth pragmatists motivated by more than political
one-upmanship.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in selecting the two, emphasized
their expertise in education and health care issues, two major legislative
battlegrounds in this year's session.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lott also is following the example set by House Republican leaders last
year when they chose a personably pleasing pair of lawmakers, former NFL
football star Steve Largent of Oklahoma and Jennifer Dunn of Washington, to be
the face of the party responding to Clinton's annual speech.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a real effort on the part of the Republican leadership to put
forward the people in the party who are attractive, who are not threatening
characters,'' said Rutgers University professor Ross Baker, who studies
Congress. ``They are trying to defang the accusation that they are
mean-spirited.''
</P>
<P>
	   Frist, a heart-lung transplant surgeon in Nashville before his election and
the Senate's only physician, gained a moment of fame in July 1998 when he
treated the wounded gunman who killed two Capitol Hill police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   He has been the Republican point man on such health issues as medical
privacy and the rights of patients in managed care programs. But he also has
also worked closely with Democrats on education bills and leads a bipartisan
group working for Medicare reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins is in the moderate tradition of her old Senate boss, former Maine
senator and current Defense Secretary William Cohen. She has led her party's
efforts to loosen federal controls over education money, but has also differed
with most Republicans by supporting abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins attracted national attention twice last year -- first during
Clinton's impeachment trial when she unsuccessfully pushed a plan to find
Clinton guilty without removing him from office and second when she sponsored
popular legislation to stop sweepstakes company deceptions. She was one of five
Republican senators to vote not guilty on both articles of impeachment.

<HEADLINE> White House Unveils Education Money  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an effort to stem youth violence and create better
learning environments, the Clinton administration has earmarked $367 million in
its new education budget for safer and smaller classrooms.
</P>
<P>
	   The funding request, part of the fiscal 2001 budget President Clinton will
submit to Congress next month, will include $247 million for the Safe
Schools/Healthy Students Initiative, which awards grants to help develop
community-wide responses to school and youth violence, Vice President Al Gore
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also will propose spending $120 million for the Small, Safe
and Successful High Schools Initiative, which encourages school districts to
create smaller schools.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the aftermath of tragic violence in our schools, there can be no doubt
that this investment in our children's safety is essential,'' Gore said. The
goal, he said, is to offer ``young people the safe and healthy environments they
need to thrive.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for smaller schools, Gore said it would mean ``more personal attention to
the varied needs of all our children.''
</P>
<P>
	   In September, Clinton announced over $100 million in Safe Schools/Healthy
Students grants for 54 school districts. The amount being proposed in the new
budget is an increase of more than $100 million and will allow grants for 40
more communities.
</P>
<P>
	   The second program allows schools to break up larger schools using
innovative strategies such as autonomous schools-within-schools, restructured
school days and career academies.
</P>
<P>
	   The program is structured around research that has shown that smaller
schools are safer and more productive because students feel less alienated, more
nurtured and more connected to caring adults.
</P>
<P>
	   There are more than 12,400 three- and four-year high schools in the United
States. More than 70 percent of students in those schools attend a school with
more than 1,000 students. Enrollments of 2,000 and 3,000 are not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
	   The program started last year with $45 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Elizabeth Teasley, government relations director for the National
Education Association, said it is partnerships like the ones being proposed that
help school districts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The resources will make a significant difference both in funding these
programs and in highlighting these issues. ... It's an encouragement for
districts that are lagging behind.''

<HEADLINE> Chechen Borders Closed to Men, 10-60  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNA DOLGOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- Men trying to escape the bloodshed of Chechnya
came to the border and were turned back by Russian soldiers for the same brusque
reason.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem is that you are not 60 yet,'' said the stern,
Kalashnikov-toting border guard. The men could do nothing but turn and walk
away.
</P>
<P>
	   They were feeling the sting of a new Russian policy to crack down on rebels
who have shown recent signs of resurgence. A top Russian military commander,
Col. Gen. Viktor Kazantsev, on Tuesday ordered that all males between 10 and 60
years old be detained and checked for possible rebel ties.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the military's orders, all roads between Chechnya and the neighboring
Russian region of Ingushetia were closed Wednesday to such males.
</P>
<P>
	   The order also affected those who wanted to get back into Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Vakhid Ashakhanov, 41, said he left Chechnya on Tuesday to drive a friend's
daughter to a hospital in Ingushetia. The girl, 16-year-old Zarema Shishkhanova,
was suffering from an acute form of tuberculosis she developed after living for
several months in a cold basement.
</P>
<P>
	   After the unexpected tightening of border regulations, Ashakhanov was cut
off from his two teen-age sons, who remained in their home village of Gikaly,
just outside Grozny, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They can't leave (Chechnya), and I can't go back,'' Ashakhanov said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shishkhanova's father, Gilany Shishkhanov, showed his daughter's hospital
admission record to the Russian guards -- but with no success.
</P>
<P>
	   At 61, Shishkhanov was old enough to go back to Chechnya, where he had left
his 4- and 6-year-old granddaughters. But having no money to pay for a ride
home, Shishkhanov said he could not leave without his younger friend.
</P>
<P>
	   A straight-backed, dignified-looking man wearing a traditional sheepskin
hat, Shishkhanov was wiping away tears from his wrinkled face.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let God be their judge,'' Shishkhanov said, turning around to walk back to
Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
	   The new policy brought sharp criticism from the watchdog agency Human Rights
Watch.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Chechen males are now effectively trapped in a war zone where they face
grave threats to their lives,'' said Peter Bouckaert, an agency worker in
Ingushetia. ``The Russian authorities are deliberately violating their
international obligations.''
</P>
<P>
	   The orders to screen Chechen men came after rebel fighters launched
counterattacks in the key towns of Shali and Argun, driving back federal troops.
The rebel offensive caught the Russians by surprise, embarrassing senior
commanders who had been predicting imminent victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Kazantsev said Russian forces had been too lax in making sure that all
rebels had been driven out of the towns.

<HEADLINE> White House Earmarks Cancer Money  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's next budget request calls for $27
million to develop ways of testing whether people have been exposed to hundreds
of carcinogens and toxic substances.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration plan being announced today aims to strengthen the
government's ability to study environmental causes of cancer and other diseases
and assist state and local public health officials investigating unusually high
cancer rates or chemical accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wants to tests
thousands of people with cancer or other diseases for toxic exposures and be
able to identify regions of the country where Americans are exposed to
cancer-causing substances.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There may well be significant environmental factors in the incidence of
disease,'' said Chris Jennings, President Clinton's health policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   The funds, to be included in Clinton's 2001 budget request to Congress,
would more than double what the government spent last year to develop ways of
measuring toxic exposure in humans. They would be used for research, test
development and assistance to state and local communities by CDC's Environmental
Health Lab, which does a national survey that tracks lead exposure in children.
</P>
<P>
	   The lab has developed tests that are designed to be used in a research
environment but is working on tests that can withstand the rigors of field work
so that communities can routinely monitor people for exposure to over 100
potentially toxic substances and, in the case of chemical accidents, quickly
determine whether people were exposed to dangerous poisons.
</P>
<P>
	   Right now there are few tests for measuring a wide variety of toxic
chemicals in humans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The lab is developing ways to look for dozens or hundreds of chemicals in
just a teaspoon of blood,'' said Dr. Richard Jackson, director of the CDC's
center for environmental health. ``The CDC wants to take them from the research
lab to the country health officer who is dealing with a cancer cluster or a
toxic spill.''

<HEADLINE> Malay Opposition Leader Charged  </HEADLINE>
   By SEAN YOONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- The Malaysian government today charged a
newspaper editor with sedition and warned that more arrests were possible in a
widening crackdown on opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   In a surprise sweep Wednesday, police arrested the editor of the Harakah
paper and a lawyer for ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on sedition
charges. A vice president of Anwar's National Justice Party was also detained
for provoking racial discord.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If more people commit offenses, there will be more arrests,'' Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told the national news agency Bernama. ``But it
need not necessarily be all opposition people. Whoever it is, if he commits a
wrong, will have to be punished.''
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition leaders had long feared that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who
has ruled this Southeast Asian nation for 18 years, would use the police to
silence his critics -- especially those close to Anwar. The former deputy
premier is serving a six-year prison term for corruption and is also on trial
for sodomy.
</P>
<P>
	   But few expected the crackdown now. Political temperatures had cooled after
the November general election, in which the opposition made significant gains
while Mahathir's United Malays National Front coalition retained its two-thirds
majority in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   The editor, Zulkifli Sulong -- whos e newspaper is the mouthpiece of the
Pan-Malaysia Islamic Party, or PAS -- appeared in court today to be charged with
sedition for an Aug. 2 article on Anwar's trials. The person responsible for
printing the newspaper was also to be charged with sedition.
</P>
<P>
	   The article quoted a National Justice Party leader alleging there was a
conspiracy planned by Mahathir in which the police, the Attorney General's
office, the courts and local media would be used to destroy Anwar.
</P>
<P>
	   Sessions Court Judge Abdul Karim Abdul Jalil fixed bail at $1,315 and set
Zulkifli's trial for May 22.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am ready to defend myself, and I am ready to face the consequences,''
Zulkifli said after his court hearing. If convicted, he faces three years in
prison and a fine of $1,315, and his newspaper could be shut down.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Karpal Singh, who is Anwar's lawyer and a longtime critic of
the Mahathir administration, was arrested on charges of sedition for alleging in
court last year that someone had tried to poison his client.
</P>
<P>
	   Marina Yusoff, a leader of the National Justice Party, was arrested and
charged with ``provoking racial discord.'' She too could face a jail term.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrests came as Mahathir left for a two-week vacation in Argentina and
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first crackdown here since dozens of Anwar supporters were
arrested following Mahathir's dismissal of his popular deputy in September 1998.
Anwar was later arrested. He insists the corruption and sodomy charges against
him have been trumped up to eliminate him from politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Several international human rights and journalism groups expressed outrage
over the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Malaysia has again resorted to strong-arm tactics to silence its critics,
rather than playing by the rules of international law,'' said Robert O. Varenik
of the New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
	   The Paris-based Reporters without Borders wrote to the Malaysian government,
warning that punishing Zulkifli with a jail term would be a ``serious
infringement of press freedom.''

Court: Flight Can Justify Police Searches
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave police broad
authority to stop and question people who run at the sight of an officer. The
5-4 ruling came short of giving police a blanket right to stop anyone who runs
after seeing the police. But it said such flight may indicate a crime is being
committed and therefore can help justify a police stop. The decision was a boost
for police but worried some civil libertarians. "Nervous, evasive behavior is a
pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion" to justify a stop, Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court. "Headlong flight -- wherever
it occurs -- is the consummate act of evasion."

Russian Media Question Chechen War
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- After a string of military setbacks in Chechnya, the Russian
news media are starting to question the handling of the war as casualties mount
and the promises of swift victory look increasingly empty. Suddenly, newspapers
are challenging the military's claims that the war is going well and are
portraying the war as a replay of the botched 1994-96 campaign in Chechnya.
"Triumphal march in Chechnya -- stepping on a rake" read a headline in the daily
Moskovsky Komsomolets. "Chechnya turns into minefield for Russian politicians,"
said the daily Segodnya. When the war started in September, the media mirrored
the view of many Russians that the campaign was justified by Chechen attacks on
Dagestan.

Twice As Many Americans By 2100

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A century from now there will be twice as many Americans
as today, the Census Bureau predicts. While no one knows what daily life will be
like in 100 years, the new population projections being issued Thursday conjure
images of twice as many cars jostling for position on the highways and twice as
many shoppers crowding the aisles at Wal-Mart. From an estimated 275 million
people today, the bureau projects a U.S. population of 571 million in the year
2100. That might not seem terribly crowded, however, because the nation is so
sprawling.

execution of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, a move aimed at enhancing the
country's prospects for joining the European Union. The decision, which came
after coalition leaders met for eight hours, came in response to a request from
the European Court of Human Rights to review Ocalan's appeal. The rebel leader
was sentenced to death in June by a Turkish court. Italian Premier Massimo

chemical computer has no immediate practical applications, but it nudges the
fledgling technology of DNA computing further out of world of science fiction
and into the realm of the possible, the University of Wisconsin-Madison

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Appears on Letterman  </HEADLINE>
   By DEEPTI HAJELA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- After weeks of needling Hillary Rodham Clinton for being a
carpetbagger who was scared to appear on his show, David Letterman stifled the
sarcasm when the first lady finally appeared.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to give this woman a tremendous amount of credit for just showing
up,'' Letterman told his ``Late Show'' audience just before interviewing Mrs.
Clinton on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton even proved to hold her own in the zinger department when the
TV host asked about the first lady's new home in suburban Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every idiot in the universe is going to drive by honking now,'' Letterman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Was that you?'' Mrs. Clinton asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman has made a running gag of Mrs. Clinton, calling her an outsider
from Arkansas seeking political opportunity in a Senate bid from New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton admitted to being ``just a little'' nervous, but told
Letterman: ``I knew if I was going to run for Senate, I was going to have to
come and sit in this chair and talk to the big guy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman started by lobbing her a softball, asking her to ``tell us a
little bit about yourself.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton smiled and told Letterman she grew up in the Midwest -- as he
did -- has a mother named Dorothy -- as he does -- and just couldn't resist the
temptation to follow him to New York.
</P>
<P>
	   During the interview, Mrs. Clinton aced Letterman's New York quiz, correctly
identifying the state bird -- bluebird -- and the state tree -- the sugar maple.
</P>
<P>
	   Her likely opponent in the Senate race, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani,
has been on the show 14 times, chatting up Letterman about the Yankees, Mrs.
Clinton and life in New York. He even got some laughs in a few comedy skits.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman asked Mrs. Clinton what she thought of the mayor and if he had the
temperament to be a senator.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's done a lot of stuff as mayor but I think being senator is a different
kind of job. A senator can't go arrest a homeless person,'' she said, referring
to the mayor's recent crackdown on the homeless who refuse police orders to
move.
</P>
<P>
	   A special list of Mrs. Clinton's Top 10 reasons for finally appearing on the
show included ``I lost a bet with Tipper'' and ``If Dan Quayle did it, how hard
could it be?''

<HEADLINE> Candidates Target Key Constituencies  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gay attorney Charlie Spiegel says that when the
Democratic presidential candidates voiced opposition to an anti-gay marriage
proposal in California, members of the homosexual community took notice -- and
opened their wallets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the kind of thing that energizes people,'' Spiegel said, noting that
he sent a check to Al Gore and his domestic partner sent one to Bill Bradley.
``The first thing that happened was they were writing checks to both of those
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
	   Now Bradley and Vice President Gore are competing for their votes with calls
to let homosexuals serve openly in the military. Spiegel says the call for an
end to discrimination is a mainstream position, not an appeal to the fringe.
</P>
<P>
	   While Democrats are reaching out to gays and blacks -- key constituencies --
the Republican presidential candidates are tailoring their messages to appeal to
conservatives who oppose abortion and value tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   As the first votes of campaign 2000 approach, candidates are sharpening
their appeals to core constituencies -- a short-term necessity with long-term
risks.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, the Democratic front-runner, and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican leader, began their campaigns by aiming at the broad middle of the
electorate. Each now faces strong challenges, particularly in New Hampshire,
from Bradley and Sen. John McCain, respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   The potential pitfalls of a narrowly targeted approach became clear when
Gore said he would insist before appointing anyone to the Joint Chiefs of Staff
that they agree with his policy that gays be allowed to serve openly in the
military.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore later backpedaled to say he meant he would not tolerate officers not
following orders. Republicans already have pounced on the Democrats'
military-gays debate as evidence that a Democrat would not be suitable as
commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has proposed a $483 billion, five-year tax package that would spend a
large chunk of projected surpluses. A tax cut that size should play well with
conservative Republicans, but taxes are not a top issue with other voters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For any presidential candidate from either party to succeed, they have to
be able to communicate to their own partisans, but at the same time communicate
to people who are not partisans,'' said political scientist Earl Black of Rice
University. ``Every successful presidential candidate has figured out a way to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls from the 1996 presidential election show that almost half of the
voters identified themselves as moderates, a group that went almost 2-1 for
President Clinton. And a fourth of voters identified themselves as independent,
voting for Clinton by a 43 percent to 35 percent margin.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's two victories have helped redefine the winning formula for
presidential elections. It was developed by moderate Democrats, including Gore
and the Democratic Leadership Council, and is based on crafting a broad message
that appeals to the center but can be tailored when necessary to retain the
party's base.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course you want to appeal to every constituency,'' said Al From,
president of the DLC, noting that Walter Mondale successfully won Democratic
constituencies in 1984 before being soundly defeated by Ronald Reagan. ``But
today's voters are more informed, more educated, more affluent, more
independent, more suburban, less unionized, less urban. With that kind of an
electorate, you have to appeal with your ideas.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to debating over health care and education, Bradley and Gore
fought hard for organized labor's backing before Gore was endorsed by the
AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also complains that Gore is playing ``constituency politics'' when
he tells various groups how Bradley's proposed health-care plan would hurt them.
</P>
<P>
	   While the support of these groups is important in a Democratic primary, only
23 percent of all voters in November 1996 exit polls said they had a union
member in their household. Only 5 percent said they were gay.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has the kind of advantage in the Republican competition -- he has
raised more than $67 million and has a big lead in national polls -- that allows
him to appeal to a broad audience with a centrist agenda, while he signals
conservatives from time to time with a tax-cut proposal or a comment about his
Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's biggest challenge comes from McCain, who is neck-and-neck with him in
New Hampshire and whose style appeals to reform-minded conservatives,
independents and military veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   Publisher Steve Forbes also has mounted a credible challenge to Bush in Iowa
with a well-financed campaign targeting fiscal and social conservatives. Forbes
had 18 percent support to Bush's 45 percent in an Iowa Poll this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Political veterans say Iowa is the ideal state for coalition-building
because of the stable population and clearly identifiable leaders of different
voter groups. But a longtime leader of one of those groups says constituency
politics is tougher than ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Chuck Gifford, a veteran labor leader, recalled when candidates would rely
heavily on key organizers in constituency groups spread the word about which
presidential candidate had the best positions on issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It made you a power broker,'' he said in a recent interview. ``There used
to be a significant number who would follow the pied piper. Now there's just too
many people who aren't willing to go down that road.''

<HEADLINE> Ben Stein Gets Robbed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Someone stole Ben Stein's money.
</P>
<P>
	   The host of Comedy Central's "Win Ben Stein's Money" game show was
confronted Jan. 5 by two men, one armed with a handgun, after he parked his car
in the garage of his home, police Lt. Edward Kreins said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "They didn't actually hit me but they did point a gun at me and it was very,
very scary," Stein said. "They didn't seem to know who I was."
</P>
<P>
	   The robbers demanded money, jewelry and his briefcase, Kreins said. The
actor handed over his wallet with about $1,000 cash, credit cards and his
paycheck. The men then fled on foot.
</P>
<P>
	   Stein said the robbery has caused him to change some of his routines and he
now has a part-time bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought I was totally immune from crime just because I'm a middle-aged,
middle-class guy and I never go into bad neighborhoods," Stein said. "I will be
eternally grateful to the guys who mugged me that they didn't shoot me and kill
me."
</P>
<P>
	   Stein, 55, who was in the 1986 comedy hit "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" and
portrayed the monotone science teacher in TV's "The Wonder Years," is also a
lawyer and writer.

<HEADLINE> Chet Atkins Statue Unveiled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Chet Atkins came face-to-face with himself during
the unveiling of a life-sized bronze statue on a busy downtown sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
	   The sculpture of Atkins playing guitar was created by Russell Faxon, who
said he tried to capture the country musician's gentle nature. Atkins said he'd
like to see more statues of artists along downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the crowd of about 300 there to mark the occasion were many of Atkins'
colleagues from five decades in Nashville. Singer Vince Gill spoke, as did
Nashville Mayor Bill Purcell and Gov. Don Sundquist.
</P>
<P>
	   "You couldn't build a life-sized statue of Chet Atkins that this building
could hold," Sundquist said. "Because he's bigger than life."
</P>
<P>
	   A native of Luttrell, Tenn., Atkins, 75, has contributed to dozens of
records including "Heartbreak Hotel" by Elvis Presley and "Your Cheatin' Heart"
by Hank Williams.

<HEADLINE> Sale of Radioactive Metals on Hold  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department has put on hold plans to sell
thousands of tons of radioactive scrap metal, mostly nickel, for use in
everything from braces to silverware.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on Wednesday blocked the sale of 6,000 tons
of nickel, planned for later this year at a defunct uranium enrichment plant in
Oak Ridge, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   The department also was reviewing future plans for another 10,000 tons of
radioactive scrap metal -- mostly nickel left over from weapons production at
other facilities -- and likely will not allow it to go unrestricted into
civilian commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists and some members of Congress have been sharply critical of
the recycling program, which had been approved by the Energy Department in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers who have pressed the Clinton administration to abandon the
recycling program applauded Richardson's action. ``Common sense is finally
beginning to take hold,'' said Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   British Nuclear Fuels Inc., which is under DOE contract to clean up the Oak
Ridge facility, planned to sell the nickel to private buyers for $41 million
later this year. The company contended the nickel could be cleaned to the point
that it no longer would pose a health risk.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale had been approved by the state of Tennessee and in 1997 by the
federal Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said he was modifying the government's contract with British
Nuclear Fuels to block the impending sale until the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission establishes health standards for the material.
</P>
<P>
	   The nickel is contaminated with radiation throughout, as opposed to only on
the surface, which would make it easier to clean. The NRC has for some time
attempted to establish a standard for disposal of such material.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will give the Nuclear Regulatory Commission time to develop national
standards ... (and) it will allow DOE to examine alternatives to free release,''
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear when the NRC planned to consider a proposed standard for such
scrap metals. The NRC regulates consumer products in which radiation has been
intentionally added, but has said the state had jurisdiction over the planned
nickel recycling at Oak Ridge.
</P>
<P>
	   While materials with surface contamination often can be cleaned, it is
unclear whether radioactivity that permeates a metal can be removed sufficiently
to be used in civilian manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa., said that consumers and steel producers alike were
concerned about the material being used in everything from braces and zippers to
silverware and toys. Steel companies were concerned about having to explain
having a radioactive metal -- no matter how small the dose level -- in such
products.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior DOE official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that while
these materials might eventually be considered safe, the public concerns raised
by the planned Oak Ridge sale prompted Richardson to reevaluate the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the NRC sets national safety standards for the material, some
``restricted use'' sales might be permitted, although not into the general
market, this official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists and nuclear watchdog groups, meanwhile, want the recycling
program scrapped altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're concerned about is this will be just window dressing,'' said
David Adelman, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which sued
to try to stop the recycling.

<HEADLINE> Racial discrimination lawsuit filed against city police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A stage performance centering on racism turned all too
real for Alton Fitzgerald White when police seeking drug dealers in his
apartment building falsely arrested him, a lawsuit alleges.
<P>
	   "They didn't have any reason to stop me - it was because I am black," White
said in an interview with The Associated Press shortly after his July arrest.
"They searched my bag and didn't find what they were looking for. There were so
many opportunities for them to let me go but they didn't."
</P>
<P>
	   White, 35, who has the lead role in the current Broadway production of
"Ragtime," continues to suffer severe emotional distress and damage to his
reputation, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a statement Wednesday, New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner
for Legal Matters George Grasso called the arrest "a clear-cut example of police
officers putting their lives on the line and acting well within the scope of
their duties to protect the lives of Mr. White and his neighbors. It is, indeed,
a shame that Mr. White refuses to understand this concept."
</P>
<P>
	   White's civil rights action seeks unspecified damages for violations of his
constitutional rights to be free of false arrest, illegal imprisonment and
racial discrimination, according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit filed on his behalf by the New York Civil Liberties Union noted
that White's experience was not uncommon for black men. It cited a Dec. 1 state
attorney general report finding blacks are significantly more likely to be
stopped and arrested without legal justification than whites.
</P>
<P>
	   White's lawsuit stems from a July 16 encounter with police who entered his
Harlem apartment building in search of drug dealers. Instead, they found the
actor and three other black men and arrested them along with two Hispanic men.
</P>
<P>
	   The other three black men - Ronald C. Jackson, Christopher Montgomery and
Marcus McCollum - filed a separate federal lawsuit Wednesday seeking $2.22
million in damages. Jackson is the student activities coordinator at Columbia
University while Montgomery is a graduate student at Columbia and McCollum is a
clothing merchandiser for designer Donna Karan. All three were in White's
building helping a friend move.
</P>
<P>
	   White has said his run-in with police has strengthened his performance as
Coalhouse Walker, the musician he plays in "Ragtime." In the musical set in
1906, Walker is harassed by white firemen as he drives through a small New York
town.
</P>
<P>
	   But the incident also left White deeply affected - he stayed in his
apartment for five days and missed five performances before he felt he came to
terms with the arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   "'Ragtime' is a very intense show - what my character has to go through and
what he has to say," White said. "As an actor that is a challenge, but as a
black man it's very upsetting. And that all occurs in 1906. We're in 1999 - what
happened to me is like an updated version of that."
</P>
<P>
	   White said he found it humiliating to be put "in a jail cell, strip searched
and then questioned three times."
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, realizing he would not make that night's performance, White
began weeping and repeatedly told the police he was innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is standard procedure," was the answer cops gave him, White said.
</P>
<P>
	   Five hours later, White and his three black acquaintances were released.
Only the two Hispanic men - whom White contends he did not know - were charged
in connection with the drug sweep.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview last year, "Ragtime" author E.L. Doctorow said he was
saddened by White's arrest but was not surprised.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every time a non-white person steps out of his door today he can expect his
humanity to be challenged," Doctorow said. "There's a deep fault line in
America's society, a fault line that runs through America's heart."
</P>
<P>
	   "These days the structural racism in this country finds its worst expression
in the culture of big city police departments - it seems to be the preferred
style in police work to violate rights and to debase people," said Doctorow, who
sent White a note expressing his sympathies.
</P>
<P>
	   "It didn't require any gift of prophecy on my part, in telling the story of
Coalhouse in epic terms," Doctorow said about his novel published in 1975. "In
writing about America 100 years ago, you are sadly talking about times today."

<HEADLINE> Braves' Rocker: I Spoke Like 'Jerk'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MACON, Ga. (AP) -- John Rocker, while admitting that his notorious comments
in Sports Illustrated made him look like "a complete jerk," denies that he is a
racist and is sorry for any hurt he caused.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think I have been definitely, grossly misrepresented, and that's really
the hardest thing, despite the fact the comments really offended a lot of
people, and that certainly was not my intent," the Atlanta Braves relief pitcher
said Wednesday in an ESPN interview.
</P>
<P>
	   It was his first public response, other than a brief written apology, to the
uproar that followed the December publication of his derogatory remarks about
foreigners, minorities and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
	   "You hit one home run in the big leagues, it doesn't make you a home-run
hitter. To make one comment like this doesn't make you a racist," the
25-year-old Rocker said to ESPN reporter Peter Gammons at Rocker's home in
Macon.
</P>
<P>
	   He pointed out that teammates Andruw Jones, Bruce Chen and Odalis Perez --
all from outside the United States -- lived with his family while they were
playing for the Braves' minor league affiliate in Macon.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I was a racist, would I want a black guy living in my house and would I
invite him to come to my house? I did that three times over," Rocker said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sports Illustrated article said he called a black teammate "a fat
monkey," which Rocker explained as clubhouse humor.
</P>
<P>
	   "This wasn't a black guy. It was a Latin player who I consider to be a good
friend," Rocker said. "In the past I've said it to his face and he'll fire back
with this, that or the other and we laugh about it."
</P>
<P>
	   He said he said things he didn't mean about New York fans because he wanted
"to inflict some emotional pain in retaliation to the pain that had been
inflicted on me."
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker said he was frustrated by New York Yankees fans who threw batteries
at him during the World Series. He said Mets fans spit in his face, poured beer
on him and beat a likeness of him during the NL Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll reiterate again and apologize one more time to anybody I've offended,"
Rocker said. "It certainly was not my intent."
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker was asked what he would think if someone else made similar comments.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd think he was a complete jerk," he said. "Who the heck does this guy
think he is mouthing off like this? What kind of experiences does he have to
talk from?"
</P>
<P>
	   Macon Mayor Jack Ellis, who is black, said he believes Rocker was sincere.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that he was genuine," Ellis said. "I think he said what he felt --
that he was sorry."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, Ellis spoke with Rocker in person at a private meeting in
Ellis' home.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker said the reaction to his remarks already has forced his family to
change its phone number twice. He has hidden in the back of a van to avoid
photographers and TV cameras outside his home.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said he believed his life eventually will return to normal.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Sign LHP Oliver for $19M  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Rangers are happy to have three new
pitchers in their rotation. They're ecstatic that all three are left-handed.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas capped a busy offseason Wednesday by signing Darren Oliver, a former
Rangers starter, to a $19 million, three-year contract. He joins fellow lefty
newcomers Kenny Rogers and Justin Thompson.
</P>
<P>
	   The trio's arrival proves general manager Doug Melvin is serious about Texas
shifting its priorities from hitting to pitching. It also shows the Rangers are
targeting the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
	   New York, which has knocked Texas out of three of the last four postseasons,
went 19-14 against lefty starters last season and hit 23 points lower against
left-handers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we've made the transition," Melvin said. "The look and depth of our
pitching staff is much better. It'll be up to them to show us it's the best
we've ever had."
</P>
<P>
	   Texas began reshaping its priorities Nov. 2 by trading slugger Juan Gonzalez
to Detroit for several players, including Thompson and hard-throwing reliever
Francisco Cordero.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rangers were thought to be finished making deals when Rogers was signed
Dec. 29 to be the staff ace, but Melvin got the green light to pursue Oliver a
few days ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really don't think I could've imagined getting three left-handers with
their ability in the offseason," Melvin said. "I think we're very fortunate."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the trio of lefties, the Rangers also have right-handed
starters Rick Helling and Esteban Loaiza. The 35-year-old Rogers is the only one
over 30.
</P>
<P>
	   The 29-year-old Oliver came up through the Texas organization, reaching the
majors in 1993. He was being groomed as a reliever for a few seasons, then
became a full-time starter in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   He was the team's pitcher of the year in '97 with 13 wins, then the
following summer was traded to St. Louis at the trading deadline along with
third baseman Fernando Tatis for shortstop Royce Clayton and pitcher Todd
Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
	   Oliver was 9-9 with a 4.26 ERA in 30 starts for the Cardinals last season.
He led the team with 196 1-3 innings and set a career-high with 119 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
	   "Being in the National League, being in different scenery, helped me a lot,"
Oliver said. "I feel I've grown up as a person and a pitcher. I'm more
confident; I feel a lot better about myself."
</P>
<P>
	   Melvin said Texas kept an eye on Oliver last season, even sending scouting
director Chuck McMichael to watch him pitch twice.
</P>
<P>
	   "He came back with glowing reports that Darren looked like a much better
pitcher," Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Oliver will make $3 million this year and $5 million each of the next two
seasons. Of his $6 million signing bonus, $1.5 million is payable in each of the
2001 and 2002 seasons and the remaining $3 million in 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   Melvin made it clear that signing Oliver was not done in response to
division rival Seattle signing Sele.
</P>
<P>
	   Oliver underwent a physical with Texas doctors Monday when Sele was still
believed to be under contract with Baltimore. That deal fell through because of
Sele's physical and he wound up with the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the Cardinals offered Oliver arbitration, which he refused, St.
Louis will get Texas' first-round pick in the upcoming draft. The Rangers have
the New York Mets' pick for signing Todd Zeile.

<HEADLINE> Hall of Fame Pitcher Bob Lemon Dies  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM WITHERS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Thirty years after he pitched the Cleveland Indians to
their last World Series title, Bob Lemon guided the New York Yankees to one
they'll never forget.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon, a Hall of Famer who won 20 games seven times during his brilliant
pitching career in Cleveland, died Tuesday night in Long Beach, Calif. He was
79.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon led the American League in victories three times and won two games in
the 1948 World Series -- the last time the Indians were champions. He finished
with a 207-128 record and was inducted into the Hall in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years later, Lemon, who also managed for Kansas City and the Chicago
White Sox, took over the Yankees at midseason when Billy Martin resigned and
focused a turbulent clubhouse, where Martin, owner George Steinbrenner, Thurman
Munson and Reggie Jackson had been feuding.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Lemon's easygoing leadership, the Yankees overcame a 14-game deficit,
beat Boston in a one-game playoff at Fenway Park to win the AL East, then
defeated the Royals in the AL playoffs. New York then triumphed over the Los
Angeles Dodgers to win its second straight World Series title.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon, who often said all he did was "fill out the lineup card" was given a
"lifetime contract" by Steinbrenner and remained on the Yankees' payroll until
his death as a scout and adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   "When our team was going through the turmoil during the 1978 season, Bob
Lemon was just what we needed," Steinbrenner said. "He was such a calming
influence and, of course, he guided the club to the world championship in one of
the greatest comebacks in sports history. He was a gentle but consummate
competitor."
</P>
<P>
	   The news of Lemon's death came just hours after another former Cleveland
sports figure, Cavaliers guard Bobby Phills was killed in a traffic accident in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon, a seven-time All-Star, began his playing career as a third baseman
with the Indians in 1941 and briefly played center field. But after Lemon served
in the Navy during World War II, the Indians decided to try him as a pitcher,
and he became one of the most successful in club history.
</P>
<P>
	   "He made himself a great pitcher," said Mel Harder, Lemon's pitching coach
in Cleveland. "He worked hard at it. He had a good sinker, especially for a guy
who never did pitch."
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon twice won 23 games. In 1948, sometimes pitching on one day's rest, he
went 20-14 with a 2.82 ERA and led the AL with 20 complete games, 10 shutouts
and 293 2-3 innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
	   "Lem" as he was known to his teammates, then beat Boston's Warren Spahn in
Game 2 of the World Series before pitching Cleveland to a 4-3 victory in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1954, Lemon went 23-7 and along with Bob Feller, Early Wynn and Mike
Garcia combined on what many still call the best starting rotation ever. The
Indians won a then-record 111 games that season before being swept in the World
Series by the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
	   "They don't make them like Bob Lemon anymore," Feller said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon's No. 21 was retired by the Indians in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon, who pitched a no-hitter at Detroit on June 30, 1948, also was an
outstanding hitter, as far as pitchers go, finishing with a .232 career average
and 37 home runs. He occasionally was used a pinch-hitter, batting .284 in 109
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
	   After retiring in 1958, Lemon worked as a scout, coach and minor league
manager. In 1966, he applied for Cleveland's vacant managing position, but was
turned down by Indians owner Gabe Paul, who later called his decision not to
hire Lemon "the biggest mistake I made in baseball."
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon managed Kansas City from 1970-72 and the White Sox in 1977 and 1978
before taking over the Yankees on July 25 when Martin.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon was replaced by Martin midway through the '79 season, but returned to
the Yankees for the second half of the strike-shortened 1981 season. New York
won its division and the AL pennant before losing to the Dodgers in the Series.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really sad to lose a man like Lemon. Everybody liked him so much --
even the opposition," said the 90-year-old Harder. "He joked with everybody -- I
don't care who you were. He was one of my best friends."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesperson at Palmcrest North Convalescent Home said funeral
arrangements were being made by Lemon's family.
</P>
<P>
	   Lemon is survived by his wife, Jane, and two sons.

<HEADLINE> Sparky May Join Tony Perez in Hall  </HEADLINE>
    By JOE KAY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- In Sparky Anderson's estimation, nothing would be finer
than to go into baseball's Hall of Fame arm-in-arm with Tony Perez.
</P>
<P>
	   There's a good chance that Anderson, the former Cincinnati and Detroit
manager, could be inducted into the Hall this summer along with Perez, his
former first baseman with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh my goodness," Anderson said from his home in Thousand Oaks, Calif. "Yes,
that would be a great moment."
</P>
<P>
	   Perez was elected to the Hall on Tuesday, along with Carlton Fisk. They will
be inducted in Cooperstown, N.Y., on July 23.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson is a leading contender for selection by the veterans' committee,
which meets Feb. 29 in Tampa, Fla. He managed the Reds to World Series titles in
1975-76 and led the Tigers to one in 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Reds second baseman Joe Morgan and catcher Johnny Bench already are
enshrined. Anderson and Perez would make four members of the Big Red Machine.
Pete Rose is ineligible for the Hall of Fame because of his lifetime ban for
gambling.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be something to join my teammates," Perez said. "It's going
to be great to be there with Johnny and Joe. It would be something special to go
in with Sparky at the same time. That was something I was really looking at this
year when I saw his name."
</P>
<P>
	   The feeling is mutual. Anderson has a great fondness for Perez and his
family.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish every athlete in all of sports, not just baseball, could act like
this man," he said. "Never once in his career did I see him throw a helmet. He
never once threw a bat. He never once made an alibi. He never did much talking
to the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   "He wasn't in for all of that. He came to play. He loved to win, but he did
not make a big deal where people could find out. He had it inside him."
</P>
<P>
	   Perez's consistency at driving in runs got him into the Hall. Anderson's
credentials reflect the bottom line for a manager -- his 2,194 career victories
with the Reds and Tigers is the third-highest total in major league history.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson got emotional at the thought of induction.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the world that I lived in for all those years, there's nothing that ever
tops it," Anderson said. "You could hit five grand slams in a game and that
would never top being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a big difference going into something that will be there until the
world is destroyed. That's -- woo, it's kind of scary. That's the house where
all the great ones live."
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson has participated in two games at the Hall of Fame, but has never
gone through it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I always made myself a promise that I would never go inside the Hall of
Fame unless I made it," he said. "I'm not one of those people who likes to go in
and walk around and see everybody.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've always thought about it. I've always said this: If you go into this
game and start your career and you don't think about making that, you don't
belong in the game. To me, that's the greatest. Every young player who starts
his first year, that should be his goal."
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson hasn't thought about which team he would represent -- Cincinnati or
Detroit -- if he's chosen.
</P>
<P>
	   "That would be the hardest decision I have ever made in my life," he said.
"It's so unfair either way. I was in one place (Detroit) for 17 years and
another for nine years. But if I had not been at the first one with those guys,
I would never have gotten to the second one. So it's a very hard thing."
</P>
<P>
	   The Reds chose Anderson for induction into their Hall of Fame last season,
but the ceremony had to be postponed. Anderson, who turns 66 on Feb. 22,
required triple bypass surgery last July.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson walks for an hour each day, plays golf and said he feels better
than he had in years. He's looking forward to coming to Cincinnati for induction
in the Reds' Hall sometime.
</P>
<P>
	   "That would be nice," he said. "That's always coming home."

    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   While Texas got another left-handed pitcher, signing Darren Oliver to a $19
million, three-year contract, the Milwaukee Brewers decided they needed another
shakeup.
</P>
<P>
	   Milwaukee traded right-hander Cal Eldred and infielder Jose Valentin to the
Chicago White Sox on Wednesday for right-handers Jaime Navarro and John Snyder.
A few hours later, the Brewers agreed to an $11 million, three-year contract
with shortstop Mark Loretta, avoiding salary arbitration.
</P>
<P>
	   Another player in arbitration, Los Angeles outfielder Todd Hollandsworth,
agreed to a $1.45 million, one-year contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Pitcher Rudy Seanez, who became a free agent after the season and then
accepted a salary arbitration offer from Atlanta, agreed to a $1.65 million,
one-year deal with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
	   Another free agent, catcher Jorge Fabregas, agreed to a minor league
contract with the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
	   Oliver, traded to St. Louis by Texas two years ago for shortstop Royce
Clayton and Todd Stottlemyre, joins a rotation that has added left-handers Kenny
Rogers and Justin Thompson.
</P>
<P>
	   Rogers was signed Dec. 29 and Thompson was acquired in the November trade
that sent Juan Gonzalez to Detroit. Texas had only four games started by
left-handers last season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really don't think I could've imagined getting three left-handers with
their ability in the offseason," Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said. "I
think we're very fortunate."
</P>
<P>
	   The left-handed shift to the Rangers' rotation is an important part of their
attempt to dethrone the Yankees. New York, which has knocked Texas out of the
postseason three of the last four seasons, went just 19-14 against lefty
starters last season and hit 23 points lower against left-handers than righties.
</P>
<P>
	   The 29-year-old Oliver was 9-9 with a 4.26 ERA in 30 starts for St. Louis
last season.
</P>
<P>
	   An Eldred-for-Navarro swap had been rumored since last summer, when Eldred
was knocked out of the Brewers' starting rotation and Navarro fell into disfavor
with White Sox manager Jerry Manuel.
</P>
<P>
	   "Both will probably benefit from a change of scenery," Brewers general
manager Dean Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the Brewers' seventh consecutive losing season ended in October,
Taylor has acquired seven pitchers and catcher Henry Blanco. Chicago was anxious
to unload Navarro.
</P>
<P>
	   "He didn't get the job done," Manuel said. "He had a lot of opportunities, a
lot of starts. Anybody that doesn't want to wear the White Sox uniform and be
proud of it, I don't want him around."
</P>
<P>
	   Eldred was 2-8 with a 7.79 ERA in 20 games last year, while Navarro was 8-13
with a 6.09 ERA.
</P>
<P>
	   Loretta, who made $1,495,000 last year, gets annual salaries of $2.5
million, $3.5 million and $5 million. He played every infield position for the
Brewers in 1999 and hit .290 with five homers and 67 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think I'm the senior Brewer on the team," he said. "It's pretty amazing.
Having a mutual commitment from the team for the first time, that just makes me
want to go out and prove they were right about me."
</P>
<P>
	   Hollandsworth, the 1996 NL Rookie of the Year, hit .284 last year with nine
homers and 32 RBIs in 92 games and made $850,000. The 26-year-old outfielder
went on the disabled list twice last year after missing more than 100 games in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Seanez, 31, was 6-1 last season with three saves and a 3.35 ERA in 56 games.
The right-hander did not pitch after Aug. 20 and underwent surgery on Sept. 21
to remove a bone spur from his elbow.
</P>
<P>
	   Fabregas, in the majors since 1994, adds experience to a Royals catching
group that includes Sal Fasano and Brian Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   Fabregas has a .246 career average with the California Angels, Chicago White
Sox, Arizona Diamondbacks, New York Mets, Florida Marlins and Atlanta Braves. He
hit .206 last year in 82 games with the Marlins.

<HEADLINE> Offense Boom Makes Comparisons Hard  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Even the newest Hall of Famers know it: 30 homers and 100
RBIs aren't what they used to be.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Perez's career-high 129 RBIs would have placed him just sixth in the
National League last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Carlton Fisk's best, 107 RBIs, has already been topped four times by Mike
Piazza and once by Ivan Rodriguez, today's top offensive catchers.
</P>
<P>
	   "There might be something in the baseball, the ballparks. I even heard about
El Nino," Perez said Wednesday, a day after he and Fisk were elected to the Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
	   A record 45 players hit 30 or more homers last year. Fisk topped the mark
just once, in 1987, when there were 28 30-homer hitters. Perez topped it twice,
one of 17 players to do it 1969 and among 19 the following year.
</P>
<P>
	   The NL's batting average of .268 last season was its highest since 1939.
</P>
<P>
	   "Balls didn't go that far when we played, Tony," Fisk said, citing the
strength and conditioning programs almost all players are involved in these
days. "The strike zone is different."
</P>
<P>
	   Fans, they both agree, love the offense.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's good for the recognition of the game," Fisk said, "not so good for the
pitchers' earned run averages."
</P>
<P>
	   After traveling to New York for a news conference, both still seemed a
little overwhelmed at their election.
</P>
<P>
	   They kept thinking back to 1975, when Fisk hit his famous 12th-inning home
run at Fenway Park to win Game 6 of the World Series. The following night, Perez
hit a two-run homer as Cincinnati overcame a 3-0 deficit to win Game 7.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a certain alignment of the stars that evening," Fisk said, "and
there's an alignment of at least two stars this afternoon."
</P>
<P>
	   Because of travel delays from Puerto Rico, Perez didn't arrive in New York
until 4 a.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't want to sleep anyway," he said. "I didn't want to wake up and see
this is just a dream."
</P>
<P>
	   Perez's election was a dream of many Latin fans. He's the first Cuban
elected to the Hall by the Baseball Writers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
	   He joins Latins such as Luis Aparicio, Roberto Clemente, Juan Marichal and
Orlando Cepeda in the Hall, and there's sure to be many more in coming years.
Latins have won three of the last four AL MVPs and one of the last two in the
NL, and the percentage of Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Venezuelans, Cubans,
Nicaraguans and Mexicans is rising.
</P>
<P>
	   Teams have signed more Latins, and their success has caused teams to
increase their scouting efforts in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   Manny Ramirez (Dominican Republic) led the AL with 165 RBIs last season,
followed by Rafael Palmeiro (Cuba) with 148 and Carlos Delgado (Puerto Rico)
with 134. Sammy Sosa (Dominican) was third in the NL at 141, and Vladimir
Guerrero (Dominican) was fifth at 131.
</P>
<P>
	   "They put up tremendous numbers and they have great, great years," Perez
said. "You have to be proud of these kids."

<HEADLINE> Action Urged on IOC Drug Agency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The new World Anti-Doping Agency is ready to
get down to business, with governments looking for fast action to establish its
credentials as a watchdog curbing the threat of drug use in sports.
</P>
<P>
	At its first meeting today at the International Olympic Committee's Lausanne
headquarters, the new agency faces pressure to improve drug-testing procedures
and to prove its own independence.
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the United States, Australia and Canada stressed the urgency of
stepping up antidoping measures after they met Wednesday with IOC president Juan
Antonio Samaranch and WADA's provisional head Dick Pound, an IOC vice president.
</P>
<P>
	``We're on a very short run to the Sydney Olympics,'' U.S. drug czar Barry
McCaffrey said. ``I would hope that at each step we will have, in a transparent
manner, concrete results.''
</P>
<P>
	He called for ``transparent, accountable and effective new antidoping measures
beginning prior to the Sydney Games.''
</P>
<P>
	Australian Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said she would ``particularly like
to see a commitment toward certain steps being taken to guarantee that Sydney is
an Olympics where the test result management can be seen as being transparent,
accountable and consistent.''
</P>
<P>
	Today's meeting is a very important day for the IOC, Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
	Although McCaffrey and other ministers backed the IOC's and Pound's role in
getting the WADA going, the White House drugs adviser again said the agency
should move away from the IOC and its home city.
</P>
<P>
	``There is agreement, I think, among all of us that this agency must commit
itself to being outside of Lausanne, to being under new leadership (after) going
through an interim process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	A number of cities have expressed interest in hosting WADA on a permanent
basis, and the IOC plans a bidding process. Details of that process have yet to
be decided.
</P>
<P>
	WADA's tasks include establishing a list of banned substances, coordinating
unannounced out-of-competition drug testing, developing standards for collecting
and analyzing samples, pushing for unified drug sanctions and promoting
research.
</P>
<P>
	The agency, established in November, groups IOC representatives, sports
federations, athletes and governments.
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to learn from each other,'' Canadian sports minister Denis Coderre
said. ``I think we can.''
</P>
<P>
	Twelve members were initially appointed. The agency will be governed by a board
of at least 10 members and no more than 35.
</P>
<P>
	The United States, Australia and Canada, here as observers, are part of a
consultative group of governments on antidoping measures formed in November in
Sydney. Coderre emphasized that WADA must represent governments worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Leader Doesn't Want US Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chechnya does not want U.S. weapons and hopes for a
negotiated settlement with the Russian government to end the bloodshed in the
breakaway province, a Chechen official says.
</P>
<P>
	   Ilyas Akhmadov, who serves under Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov in
Grozny, said he is not seeking American assistance or mediation of the conflict
but only understanding for the Chechens' desire to stop Russian military
attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration on Wednesday ruled out a U.S. role in mediation
between Russia and the rebels in its province of Chechnya, and suggested
Europeans could take on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   But as Russian forces resumed an offensive in Chechnya on Wednesday, there
was no indication Moscow would heed Chechen appeals or U.S. advice that it seek
a political solution to the threatened secession. Accusing Chechen rebels of
terrorism elsewhere in Russia, the Kremlin repeatedly has said it will not talk
until the rebellion is wiped out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't believe that the result of the use of force is going to be the
melting away of resistance,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
``We believe that the Russians are in a cul-de-sac, that they cannot by their
current strategy come to the end of road because there is no end to this kind of
fighting.''
</P>
<P>
	   Akhmadov, speaking at an academic institute Wednesday evening before planned
meetings with members of Congress and others today, also said Russian soldiers
continue to sell weapons to Chechen fighters and claimed no knowledge of any
terrorist activity by Chechens.
</P>
<P>
	   He estimated 10,000 Chechen civilians and about 250 fighters have died in
the conflict, but he declined to estimate Russian casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``God forbid, I don't want the United States to bomb Russia or give us
weapons,'' Akhmadov said. His remarks were translated from Russian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only aim of our government is to stop the total destruction of our
people, and we are prepared to do anything,'' he said. ``We are prepared to
negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Russia tends to lament its mistakes but only stops aggression ``when
it is drowned in its own blood. It's a horrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the State Department is asking Russia for clarification of
reports that Chechen males between ages 18 and 60, would be detained to see
whether they had ties to rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is essential that Russia respect the fundamental human rights of
civilians in and around Chechnya, not endanger the lives of noncombatants, and
ensure freedom of movement for displaced persons,'' spokesman Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Akhmadov said he appreciated the American concern, but added, ``The issue
here is whether the State Department will be satisfied with the explanation of
the Russian government and what its reaction will be.''

<HEADLINE> Cos. Plan To Appeal Safety Breaches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Three companies plan to appeal fines of more than $500,000
for safety violations in the fatal collapse of a giant crane at the Milwaukee
Brewers' partially completed ballpark last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   The crane was lifting a piece of the stadium's retractable roof when it fell
July 14, killing three ironworkers.
</P>
<P>
	   In issuing citations Wednesday, government regulators said Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries of America, Danny's Construction Co. and Neil F. Lampson Inc. allowed
workers to lift a 400-ton roof section that was too heavy for the crane,
especially in the windy conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesmen for the three companies denied committing safety violations and
said they would seek to have the fines lifted.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitsubishi, the contractor building the roof, was fined $240,500, by the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Danny's Construction Co., which
employed the ironworkers, was fined $168,000. Lampson, which leased the 567-foot
crane to Mitsubishi, was fined $131,300.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel that if these companies had been in compliance with our
regulations, possibly this tragedy would not have occurred," OSHA Area Director
George Yoksas said.
</P>
<P>
	   When the accident happened, the National Weather Service said winds were
gusting at up to 26 mph. The accident caused $100 million in damage and delayed
the opening of Miller Park by a year, to April of 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators relied on a 78-second videotape, taken by OSHA employees who
were on the site looking into an earlier minor accident.
</P>
<P>
	   The dramatic video, released Wednesday, captures the entire collapse,
beginning with someone's routine discussion of the project. Suddenly, a
12-second grinding screech is heard, followed by two loud crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   "What's going on here?" asks one person, as a worker is seen bolting from
near the crane's base. "Watch it!" someone shouts as the blue crane collapses
into the stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   Yoksas declined to say exactly what the agency thought caused the accident.
OSHA has no plans to issue a report on it, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is only the first step," said Robert Donohoo, deputy district attorney
for Milwaukee County. He said there were months of work to be done in the
district attorney's investigation for possible criminal law violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Busalacchi, chairman of the stadium board's construction committee,
said the board did not plan any attempt to have the firms that got citations
taken off the project.
</P>
<P>
	   "The message we're going to send back to our contractors is that they're
going to have to adjust to make sure this work site is safe," Busalacchi said.
</P>
<P>
	   In its citation, OSHA said Mitsubishi loaded a section of the roof beyond
the crane's capacity. The agency also said Mitsubishi failed to keep employees
clear of the 400-ton block and allowed workers to be hoisted in excessively
windy conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The citation is a willful violation, meaning that the acts were done "with
an intentional disregard for or plain indifference to the requirements."
</P>
<P>
	   Mitsubishi also received a non-willful violation for not properly
considering the crane manufacturer's specifications for how much to lift in
winds of more than 20 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitsubishi's attorney, Franklyn Gimbel, said the company denies the claims
and will be requesting an informal conference with OSHA officials in an attempt
to erase or modify the tickets.
</P>
<P>
	   "To claim willfulness of these violations suggests that there was some
conscious misdeeds, and we just don't believe that's the fact," Gimbel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Danny's Construction was issued a willful citation for failing to keep its
workers clear of the 400-ton block of roof and a non-willful citation for
operating the crane in excessive winds and for using a platforms on the work
site when hoist, ladders or other scaffolding was possible.
</P>
<P>
	   "We deny the allegation, and will be proceeding through the established
channels," company president Willie Mizell said.
</P>
<P>
	   OSHA gave Lampson a willful violation for overloading the crane and a
serious violation for not keeping the area of the crane clear during the morning
lift. The company also received a citation because charts on when to use the
crane did not take into consideration the effects of wind on the load.
</P>
<P>
	   The company plans to appeal the citations, said Bill Lampson, president of
the Kennewick, Wash.-based company.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's absolutely inappropriate," Lampson said. "We leased the crane to
Mitsubishi and we're being cited for violations."

<HEADLINE> NHL Won't Promise Olympic Return  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Following a less than splendid debut during the 1998 Olympics
in Nagano, things need to be resolved before the NHL commits to the games in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to reports, the NHL has not yet agreed to participate,'' Bill Daly,
the NHL's executive vice president and chief legal officer, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	``There are still outstanding issues, not the least of which is that the matter
needs to be considered by the NHL Board of Governors. The board will not be
asked to consider the matter until all outstanding issues have been resolved,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	Logistics, timing and credentials need to be resolved before an agreement is
reached, with the league trying to minimize the disruption of its regular
season. An announcement is not expected until sometime after next month's NHL
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
	It is believed that the International Ice Hockey Federation and the NHL will
work out all details, paving the way for the league's participation.
</P>
<P>
	``The IIHF will dot the i's and cross all the t's,'' said Ted Saskin, the
director of business affairs for the NHL Players Association. ``Then I imagine
there'll be some sort of formal announcement. I can't see anything holding us up
from going.''
</P>
<P>
	Should the decision be made to send NHL players to the games, it would be met
favorably.
</P>
<P>
	``We welcome the opportunity to put our very best players on the ice in that
level of competition,'' USA Hockey spokesman Chuck Menke said.
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City planners echoed the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
	``We would be pleased to have them join the Olympics,'' said Mitt Romney,
president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
	Romney met with IIHF representatives in December and assembled a proposal
covering requests ranging from accommodations for the athletes in Salt Lake City
to injury liability.
</P>
<P>
	The Nagano Games marked the first time that the NHL interrupted its season to
allow its players to represent their countries at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
	Among the problems encountered in Japan were vandalism by U.S. players at the
athletes' village following their quarterfinal elimination by the Czech
Republic, and late-night starting times for U.S. television viewers.
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has said that despite the trouble, NHL players are welcome to return.

<HEADLINE> Woods, Duval Skipping Sony Open  </HEADLINE>
    By GORDON SAKAMOTO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONOLULU (AP) -- That sigh of relief you heard came from the 144 golfers who
will tee it up at the Sony Open.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because the world's best player, Tiger Woods, is kicking back for a
few days at his Florida home, and No. 2 David Duval is off on a skiing outing.
</P>
<P>
	   With those two skipping the PGA Tour's first full-field tournament of the
season, the event is considered wide open. But 20 of the 30 players who
participated in the Mercedes Championships for 1999 winners last week planned to
tee it up at the Waialae Country Club today.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the favorites will be defending champion Jeff Sluman and Ernie Els,
who lost a dramatic playoff to Woods at the Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope I do a little better later this week," said Sluman, who finished
14th at the Mercedes. "I feel pretty good about my game right now. I played
fairly well last week and look forward to coming out here and seeing how I do."
</P>
<P>
	   Sluman said winning the inaugural Sony was a confidence-builder for the 1999
season. He went on to finish 17th on the money list with $1.6 million. He made
the cut in 26 of 31 events and finished in the top 10 six times.
</P>
<P>
	   Traveling to this side of the Pacific Ocean this early in the year is a new
experience for Els, but he's already feeling good about his game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm looking forward to playing to see how it goes," he said of the Sony. "I
thought I hit the ball from tee to green better than Tiger did last week, but I
just missed a couple of putts I should have made.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maybe they'll fall this week."
</P>
<P>
	   Els' itinerary to get to Hawaii included traveling through 12 time zones.
After the Sony, he'll turn right around and head home before rejoining the PGA
Tour at the Nissan Open in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   "I arrived here last year, sounds like a long time ago doesn't it?" he said
jokingly shortly after arriving for the Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm on my way around the world at the moment. This is just a halfway stop.
Flying from South Africa to the West Coast, you can't believe how far it is if
you haven't done it."
</P>
<P>
	   Among those anxious to get started is Peter Jacobsen.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've all got to get ourselves in shape over here ad try to challenge him
(Woods)," Jacobsen said. "It's good he's not playing this week, so he gives
everybody a chance."
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobsen warmed up for the 72-hole event by winning the Johnny Bellinger
Shoot-Out, a prelude to the tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm looking forward to going out and seeing how I do," he said. "Winning
this event would give me some confidence that my game is in good shape.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll just have to tee it up and see how it goes."
</P>
<P>
	   The Sony will showcase Gary Nicklaus, 30-year-old son of golfing great Jack
Nicklaus. He received a sponsor's exemption for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm excited," Nicklaus said. "Now I get to see what I can do."

<HEADLINE> Seattle Expected To Trade Galloway  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM COUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Joey Galloway wants to play for the Seattle Seahawks
again because he believes they have a chance to win a Super Bowl under Mike
Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
	   He also knows he's likely to be traded because of his bitter 101-day
contract holdout that didn't turn out to be such a good idea.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think I did everything to try to win," the Seahawks wide receiver said
Wednesday. "I hope I did not cause a problem for my teammates."
</P>
<P>
	   Without Galloway, the Seahawks got off to a 6-2 start. With Galloway, they
finished 3-6.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he hopes his contract stalemate with Holmgren, Seattle's coach and
general manager, didn't hurt the Seahawks on the field.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really hope that was not the case," he said. "Whether it was or not, we
can never say."
</P>
<P>
	   Galloway's distinguished career with the Seahawks might have ended last
Sunday when Seattle lost to Miami 20-17 in the opening round of the playoffs.
Galloway wasn't a factor in that game, catching one pass for 22 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   He wasn't a factor for most of the season. After ending his holdout,
Galloway made a disappointing contribution to Holmgren's offense, catching 22
passes for 335 yards and a touchdown in the Seahawks' final eight regular-season
games.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Galloway had his third 1,000-yard season, making 65 receptions for
1,047 yards and 10 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
	   Galloway is likely to be declared an unrestricted free agent by the NFL. The
Seahawks then are expected to make him their franchise player, which means they
will give him a one-year contract with a salary equivalent to the average of the
top five highest-paid receivers in the league. Then, they're expected to trade
him.
</P>
<P>
	   "A player like Joey Galloway isn't going to just say goodbye and walk out
the door," Holmgren said Monday. "I'm not going to allow that to happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Galloway, the eighth overall selection by the Seahawks in the 1995 draft,
held out this season despite being under contract. He rejected Seattle's offer
of a $35 million contract for seven years, an offer Holmgren finally took off
the table.
</P>
<P>
	   His holdout cost him $837,117.
</P>
<P>
	   Galloway said he worked harder than he has ever worked after joining the
Seahawks after their Nov. 7 game against Cincinnati. He said he fought to
overcome a hamstring injury and a toe injury as well as the flu last week.
</P>
<P>
	   "The misperception has been that I haven't worked hard, I didn't want to be
here, I didn't play hard," Galloway said. "You guys know coach Holmgren well
enough to know that he doesn't put up with that."
</P>
<P>
	   Galloway went to the team's public relations department and asked to speak
to the media. He said he avoided the press after his return because he didn't
want to be a distraction to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it was misconstrued as: I didn't want to be here or I was unhappy
or I had a bad attitude," Galloway said.
</P>
<P>
	   Holmgren met with Galloway on Tuesday as part of the coach's exit meetings
with all his players. Galloway said Holmgren gave him no indication what his
future would be here.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Galloway said he asked for and got a special meeting with
Holmgren. He said he wanted to make sure Holmgren knew he would do anything he
could to help beat the Dolphins. He said he did not complain about being in a
role as Derrick Mayes' backup going into the Miami game.
</P>
<P>
	   Galloway, 28, said he would never again stage a contract holdout.
</P>
<P>
	   "I won't allow it to get to that situation again," he said. "I still don't
have any real leverage. I still don't call the shots about where I'll be or
whether I'm traded or whether I'm the franchise guy."

<HEADLINE> AP Names Faulk Top Offensive Player  </HEADLINE>
    By R.B. FALLSTROM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Beyond the record numbers and the dazzling footwork,
something Marshall Faulk did between snaps perhaps best describes his total
game.
</P>
<P>
	   With the clock running down at Tennessee in Game 7 and the St. Louis Rams
out of timeouts, wide receiver Az-Zahir Hakim was momentarily stunned and lay on
the turf. Faulk swooped in and guided Hakim to the line, avoiding a penalty and
keeping a game-tying drive alive.
</P>
<P>
	   The next day, coach Dick Vermeil said Faulk was the most alert player he'd
ever seen on the field. Everything that's happened with Faulk, the key to the
Rams' No. 1-rated offense and an overwhelming choice for The Associated Press
Offensive Player of the Year award, has confirmed that.
</P>
<P>
	   Faulk is the second player in NFL history to amass 1,000 yards rushing and
receiving in the same season. He broke Barry Sanders' 1997 total yardage record.
Along the way, he elevated the games of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   "He knows what everybody does on the field," tight end Roland Williams said
Wednesday. "Marshall's just the man. It's very obvious he understands the game
besides having great athletic ability."
</P>
<P>
	   Faulk ran for 1,381 yards, caught 87 passes for 1,048 yards and totaled 12
touchdowns for a total of 2,429, breaking the previous mark of 2,358. He helped
himself with patience, waiting for holes to open and plays to develop before
blasting through.
</P>
<P>
	   Fullback Robert Holcombe wasn't taking any credit for Faulk's numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Marshall, he does a lot of stuff on his own," Holcombe said. "He makes
everybody's job a little easier."
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil, an avid auto racing fan, likened Faulk to the ultimate turbo
charger.
</P>
<P>
	   "He adds a boost to your horsepower that goes beyond description," Vermeil
said. "You just don't know when he's going to put the pedal to the metal and go
to the end zone."
</P>
<P>
	   Faulk said he's blessed with a combination of instincts and awareness.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just want to absorb as much as I can when I'm sitting in the meetings to
know what exactly is going on around me, and where the danger is and the trouble
is," he said. "How can this play not be effective? What can stop this play? I
want to know exactly how it works."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams improved from the No. 27 offense to No. 1 in a single season due to
the prolific contributions from Faulk and quarterback Kurt Warner, who was named
the AP MVP last week. Since then, Faulk has won two awards, also being voted
team MVP.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's cool, that's great," Faulk said. "It's great to be recognized."
</P>
<P>
	   Faulk said his dual 1,000-yard season is a bigger accomplishment than
breaking Sanders' record because of the durability and versatility that's
required. The 49ers' Roger Craig is the only other 1,000-1,000 man, doing it in
1985.
</P>
<P>
	   He came close last season, with 1,319 yards rushing and 908 receiving. In
1998, he lined up behind another unusually talented first-year quarterback,
Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got to play every play, you've got to be in there," Faulk said. "And
you've got to catch some lucky breaks to make some things happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Acquiring Faulk for second- and fifth-round picks two days before the draft
was a big break for the Rams, and completed their offseason rebuilding job. The
Rams went from 4-12 to 13-3, the best record in the NFC, and scored 526 points
-- third highest in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
	   "From our perspective, it's monumental," Rams director of player personnel
Charley Armey said. "He makes things happen by his presence."
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil has often said there's more to the package, and Faulk isn't arguing.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's always more," Faulk said. "Do I know what? No. Does anybody? No.
The situation will have to present itself and I'll take advantage of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Faulk earned 26 votes from a nationwide panel of 50 media members, beating
Warner by eight votes. Manning and rookie running back Edgerrin James, who
replaced Faulk in Indianapolis and won Offensive Rookie of the Year honors, each
got three votes apiece.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Armstrong Chases the Ring  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVEN WINE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins defensive end Trace Armstrong will line
up Saturday against the Jacksonville Jaguars, chasing Mark Brunell and the dream
of a Super Bowl title.
</P>
<P>
	   The playoff game will be Armstrong's 11th in 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   "You start to develop this feeling of urgency," he says, "because you know
you're not going to be back too many more times."
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong is old by NFL standards, a thirty-something veteran admired by
Dolphins teammates for his dogged pursuit of a Super Bowl title. The story has a
familiar ring because Armstrong, like Dan Marino, is ring-less.
</P>
<P>
	   But that's not the only reason Armstrong, at 34, continues to butt heads
with 325-pound offensive tackles.
</P>
<P>
	   "I still love to play," Armstrong says. "I even like our preseason
scrimmages. The ultimate goal is the Super Bowl, but I just enjoy putting on my
uniform every day."
</P>
<P>
	   This week, he's being lauded for perhaps the best performance of his career.
Armstrong was named NFL defensive player of the week after his three sacks
helped Miami beat Seattle 20-17 in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong watches retirement speculation swirl around Marino and understands
his teammate's reluctance to quit. Armstrong is the same way.
</P>
<P>
	   The former Florida Gators star plans to go back to school for a law degree
eventually, but not yet. He expects to be with the Dolphins again next season.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're going to have to run me off," he says. "You have to realize -- I've
been a football player since I was 7.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's one of the strange things about this game. You're 34, and in regular
society that's still a fairly young man. But they're starting to tell you you're
too old to do what you've done your whole life."
</P>
<P>
	   As president of the NFL Players Association, Armstrong has occasionally
clashed with coach Jimmy Johnson on practice schedules and other issues
involving the union. And Armstrong wasn't happy that his playing time was
reduced when Johnson went to a four-man rotation at defensive end.
</P>
<P>
	   But the change might help Armstrong's longevity. He's no longer a starter
and plays primarily on passing downs, a role he filled beautifully at Seattle.
His three sacks were a career best and a team playoff record.
</P>
<P>
	   "Trace has always been an excellent player for us," Johnson said. "The role
we have him in probably utilizes his talent more than if we had him as an
every-down player. And it keeps him fresher and healthier and is going to extend
his career."
</P>
<P>
	   There are few signs that Armstrong is slowing down. Even with his playing
time limited, he had 7 1/2 sacks this season, increasing his total to 40 in five
years with the Dolphins. He's a trim 270 pounds, if that's possible, and hasn't
missed a game because of injury since 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   "That man ain't old," teammate Daryl Gardener says. "Don't let him fool
you."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, 177 NFL games have taken a toll on Armstrong's body. At this late
date in the season, not even a three-sack performance can make him feel 24
again.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel like about 54," he said with a laugh. "Lots of fires to put out, but
that's the playoffs. It's a grind. You really come in almost bankrupt
physically. This is a time when you've got to reach and dig and try to find
something to get out there and play with."

<HEADLINE> Colts' Bennett To Miss Playoff Game  </HEADLINE>
    By HANK LOWENKRON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Linebacker Cornelius Bennett, the team's leading
tackler in his first year with the Indianapolis Colts, will be inactive when
they face the Tennessee Titans in an AFC divisional playoff game on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors checked the condition of the left knee Bennett injured in the team's
regular-season finale this week and decided he needed more time to heal.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's out for this game," coach Jim Mora said. "Hopefully, he'll be healed
enough to play for the AFC championship if we advance."
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett suffered a torn medial collateral ligament and a stretched posterior
cruciate ligament in the knee when he was blocked on his first defensive play of
the game at Buffalo. He said last week that he was hopeful he could play against
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   The injury was not related to similar damage to the anterior cruciate
ligament that required surgery after Bennett played in last year's Super Bowl
with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any time you lose a player the caliber of Cornelius, it's tough on a
defense. But we have other guys who are expected to come in and play well," said
defensive end Chad Bratzke, who led the Colts with a career-high franchise
record of 12 as Indianapolis went 13-3 in 1999. "We have to rally behind each
other, and other guys are going to have to step up."
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett will be replaced in the starting lineup by Bertrand Berry, a
third-round draft pick out of Notre Dame in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a great opportunity for me. It's one that I've waited on my whole
career," Berry said. "To start in a playoff game, that's what every guy who ever
played football dreamed about, from a little kid up to an adult."
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett said he told Berry "he's just got to step up and be the man."
</P>
<P>
	   "No one expected me to come in and play the way I did this season, except
for myself. I came in and made an impact, and he can do the same thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett, 34, was drafted by Indianapolis in 1987, but went to Buffalo as
part of a three-team trade that brought Eric Dickerson from the Rams to the
Colts. With Buffalo, he played in four straight Super Bowls -- all losses -- and
last year with Atlanta became the only player in NFL history to be on the losing
team in five Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett signed with the Colts as an unrestricted free agent and led the
Colts this season with 114 tackles. Eighty of those were solo efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Mora also said that defensive tackle Ellis Johnson was expected to be in the
starting lineup against Tennessee on Sunday. Johnson, who like Bennett started
all 16 games on defense, missed the second half of the Buffalo game with a deep
bruise near his left knee. Johnson finished the season with 7 1/2 sacks, the
second highest total on the team, and was in on 76 tackles. He practiced
Wednesday for the first time since the injury.
</P>
<P>
	   "He did everything," Mora said. "He should be ready."

<HEADLINE> Vikes Playing Role of Underdog  </HEADLINE>
    By ARNIE STAPLETON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- The Minnesota Vikings are 9-2 since Jeff George
took over at quarterback. Their six losses were by a total of 22 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Their defense kept opponents out of the end zone in 30 of 46 trips inside
the 20, and they have one of the NFL's most dangerous return tandems in Robert
Tate and Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Vikings (11-6) find themselves in the unfamiliar role of underdog
as they prepare for their trip to the St. Louis to face the top-seeded Rams
(13-3) at the Trans World Dome on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams lost to the only team (Tennessee) on their schedule that finished
with a winning record. Their other 11 opponents were a combined 60-116.
</P>
<P>
	   So how can the Vikings be a touchdown underdog?
</P>
<P>
	   "I never look at it as though we're the underdog, but I never look at it as
if we're supposed to win by 14 points, either," Cris Carter said. "Whatever the
spread, it doesn't really matter to me."
</P>
<P>
	   What does matter, Carter insisted, is playoff experience.
</P>
<P>
	   And the Vikings have much more than the Rams even though none of them have a
Super Bowl ring like St. Louis lineman Adam Timmerman, who won a title in Green
Bay in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's far more pressure than you've been under and you do get nervous and
you do have anxiety and you do have concerns," Carter said. "The only teams that
say experience is not vital are the teams that don't have any."
</P>
<P>
	   As much as they hate to admit it, the Vikings are taking their cue from the
1998 Atlanta Falcons, the upstarts who derailed the Super Bowl favorites on the
road in a noisy dome a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vikings are planning to run the ball to keep the Rams' high-octane
offense on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
	   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
	   That's what the Falcons did last year in their stunning upset of the Vikings
in the conference championship at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams cruised through the regular season with a wide-open offense, an
opportunistic defense and solid special teams, exactly what the Vikings did a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "They could be the Vikings of '98," Moss said. "But some bad things happened
to the Vikings of '98."
</P>
<P>
	   Like slipping up in the playoffs despite being a big favorite.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vikings don't view themselves as inferior in any way to the well-rested
Rams, however.
</P>
<P>
	   "Both teams are fast," Robert Griffith said. "For lack of a better word,
it's going to be a track meet. We just match up really well."
</P>
<P>
	   With Moss, Carter, George and Robert Smith on one side and MVP Kurt Warner,
Isaac Bruce, Marshall Faulk and Az-Zahir Hakim on the other, "you're not ever
going to see any better talent on the football field," Carter said.
</P>
<P>
	   But, as topsy-turvy as the NFL has become, Carter would like to believe
there's still such a thing as paying your dues, especially in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a process that Dallas went through with San Francisco, it's a process
that Green Bay went through with Dallas," he said. "It's a process that we went
through with Green Bay and also that Denver went through. And all those teams,
they had experience. And if you look at last year's Super Bowl, I think that
Denver's experience outweighed Atlanta's."
</P>
<P>
	   But teammate Robert Smith isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of people are going to use that against St. Louis and I'm sure
they're tired of hearing about it," Smith said. "They're tired of hearing about
how they don't have experience, how they didn't play anybody in the regular
season, all those things. To me, they don't mean a whole lot.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a whole new season. They've got talented players. We've got talented
players."
</P>
<P>
	   Vikings coach Dennis Green noted that the Rams went from 4-12 to 13-3, "and
that's the best experience you can have as a football player."

<HEADLINE> Titans CB Walker Is on Probation  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans have made a habit of dealing
with problems off the field and not letting them become distractions. Coach Jeff
Fisher thinks nothing will stop them now.
</P>
<P>
	   The fact that starting cornerback Denard Walker is on probation for
assaulting the mother of his son last summer became known on Wednesday as the
Titans (14-3) prepared to visit the Indianapolis Colts (13-3) in the AFC
divisional playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Typically, I think these things come up at the worst possible time," Fisher
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not going to become a distraction. The timing's not good. Somewhere,
somehow there was some motivation on someone's behalf to draw attention to
themselves. That's out of our hands. We'll deal with it and go on."
</P>
<P>
	   Walker, the Titans' starting left cornerback the past three seasons, talked
briefly with Fisher at the end of practice. But he declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   His agent, John Hamilton, issued a release late Wednesday describing the
incident as a "minor altercation" with a "former friend." The statement said
Walker entered a "conditional plea," and Hamilton said that did not involve
pleading guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   Walker pleaded guilty on Aug. 11 to assault for an incident June 26 at his
apartment, according to Assistant District Attorney Carlton Drumwright.
</P>
<P>
	   According to police reports, Rhonda Lynn Chesser, the mother of Walker's
19-month-old son, said Walker threatened, punched and tried to strangle her.
Police reports said Chesser had bruises on her legs, arms and face with marks on
her neck and told police that Walker also threatened several times that "he
could kill her."
</P>
<P>
	   Two days later, Walker gave a statement to police that he and Chesser argued
and "basically wrestled on the floor, with some punches thrown not to be
harmful." He said he received "marks around my neck, with some minor scratches"
during the fight.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the plea agreement, Walker must stay away from Chesser, attend
weekly domestic abuse classes and stay out of trouble for 11 months, 29 days.
Drumwright said it was the standard agreement for a first-time offender, and the
incident can be expunged after he completes probation.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Fisher nor the NFL would comment on whether the league had punished
Walker. Any player who pleads guilty to assault faces mandatory counseling and
other discipline that can include fines and suspensions.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher said the NFL has provided courses, seminars and counseling the past
two years to try and prevent domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a serious issue. Domestic violence is an extremely serious issue in
our society today, and Denard's case, it was dealt with," Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   It's the fourth incident off the field that the Titans have dealt with since
training camp.
</P>
<P>
	   End Pratt Lyons broke a vertebra in his neck in a car accident the first
week of training camp and missed the entire season. Tackle Josh Evans missed the
first four games of the season under a substance abuse suspension, and safety
Marcus Robertson needed 150 stitches in his face after a motorcycle crash Dec.
27. He missed the regular-season finale.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Investment Incentives  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is road-testing some ideas he will
highlight during his State of the Union address at the end of this month,
including a plan to sweeten the incentives for businesses to invest in some of
America's hard-luck rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton travels to New York City today, where he will help launch a small
business development center at predominantly Hispanic Boricua College in
Brooklyn, and describe his proposal to more than double a tax credit for
investment in what the Clinton administration calls ``new markets.''
</P>
<P>
	   The incentive program, which Clinton first unveiled last year, is supposed
to make investment in poor regions of this country as attractive as investment
in less-developed countries abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   While many Republicans on Capitol Hill support the economic empowerment
agenda behind the new markets proposal, Clinton was unable to push the entire
package through Congress and is trying again this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the president's trying to do is inspire corporate America and
investors to take a second look in their own backyard,'' White House economic
adviser Gene Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed 25 percent tax credit would leverage $15 billion a year in
investment over five years, but cost the government just a third of that,
Sperling said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So this tax credit would now leverage $15 billion of equity investment in
lower income parts of America, both urban and rural,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
	   For much of the rest of the day, Clinton was participating in a separate
economic development project shepherded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jackson's
Wall Street Project is a 3-year-old effort to involve the titans of New York
City finance in minority business ventures.
</P>
<P>
	   The program, and a similar venture in Chicago, ``are set to partner major
venture capital partnerships in the country with minority vendors and minority
business, giving them better access to capital and strategies for economic
growth in the long term,'' said Barbara Proctor, media relations director for
Jackson's sponsoring Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   During a midday speech to the project's annual conference, Clinton is
expected to focus on the economic successes of his seven-year administration,
and his efforts to include everyone in America's current economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We ought to dedicate ourselves to bringing opportunity to the people and
places who have been left behind,'' Clinton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was attending a gala evening party honoring the project on the floor
of the New York Stock Exchange. The exchange is a co-sponsor of the Wall Street
Project, exchange spokesman Ray Pellecchia said.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the third year the exchange has opened its trading floor for the
party, although an ice storm canceled Clinton's scheduled visit last year,
Pellecchia said.
</P>
<P>
	   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton opened the Wall Street Project conference
on Wednesday. The three-day program also features address by four Clinton
administration Cabinet secretaries, top officials such as Sperling and Wall
Street leaders.

<HEADLINE> Johnson's Arms To Live in NFL Infamy  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSEPH WHITE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- In addition to his $50,000 fine and one-game suspension
for fighting and striking an official, Tre Johnson figures he's the NFL's new
poster boy for bad behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   "To hit an official is wrong," the Washington Redskins guard said Wednesday.
"There's no doubt. It's clearly stated in the rules. We get a book and video at
training camp, and I'm sure that incident will be added to it as a
what-not-to-do example."
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Johnson said he would appeal his punishment, handed down
Tuesday as part of a record $154,000 in fines issued to 23 Redskins and Lions
players for the fracas that broke out in the second half of Saturday's playoff
game. The one-week suspension, which takes effect the first week of next season,
will cost Johnson about $135,000 in salary.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one intentionally went after any referee," Johnson said. "The referee's
just doing his job. It's a matter of happenstance. It wasn't as malicious, I
guess, as it was made out to be. I stopped. It wasn't like I had to be stopped.
I stopped as soon as I realized the referee was involved. It was an accident.
It's a lot of circumstance surrounding a lot of emotional energy."
</P>
<P>
	   The Redskins can find two pieces of good news from the fight and its
fallout. One is that Johnson won't miss this Saturday's playoff game at Tampa
Bay. The other is a renewed sense of team togetherness and swagger.
</P>
<P>
	   "Looking back at it, it was a positive in a way," fullback Larry Centers
said. "It shows the mentality we have to have in order to stay alive in the
playoffs. It's going to be a fight every week."
</P>
<P>
	   Not literally, one would hope. But the way the players rushed to the defense
of quarterback Brad Johnson galvanized an all-for-one, one-for-all mindset that
has helped the Redskins break a six-year playoff drought. In past seasons, it
would have been hard to imagine players rushing onto the field in a similar way.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we have a definite sense of unity on the team," Tre Johnson said.
"We watch each other's backs. It's a shame everyone has to get fined over
something like that, but it makes its positive statements too."
</P>
<P>
	   The fight started when Detroit defensive end Robert Porcher threw a hard
block at Brad Johnson during an interception return. Brad Johnson, who later
said he was emulating his favorite WWF wrestlers, then threw Porcher to the
ground. A free-for-all ensued, and Tre Johnson was singled out because he kept
flailing his arms and struck the line judge after the other players had settled
down.
</P>
<P>
	   Many players were surprised by the amount and breadth of the fines. Tight
end James Jenkins, for example, was fined $1,500 for "unnecessarily entering a
fight area -- inactive," meaning essentially that he was guilty of being in the
wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had nothing to do with the fight," Jenkins said. "I wasn't involved with
it. I don't know what area they're talking about, the fighting area. I was in on
the play, the fight broke out, I turned around, and then I walked away.
Everybody on the field should be fined if they fine me."

<HEADLINE> Haitians Seek Immigration Equality  </HEADLINE>
   By MILDRADE CHERFILS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Haitian-American activists say the treatment of 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez highlights an unfair disparity in U.S. policy toward would-be
immigrants from Cuba and their island nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Haitian-Americans and others staged a mock funeral Wednesday for some of the
more than 400 Haitians whose boat ran aground in Florida during a New Year's Day
attempt to reach the United States. Survivors told the Coast Guard that as many
as six people died during the 600-mile voyage and were thrown overboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The ceremony was followed by a candlelight march attended by about 3,000
people.
</P>
<P>
	   The difference in how immigration officials treat Haitians and Cubans seemed
stark to protester Louisiane Valcourt, 60. ``They regard the Cubans as people
and the Haitians as animals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under U.S. immigration policy, Haitians and others who arrive illegally are
sent back to their country. The Cuban Readjustment Act of 1966 and the
application of a so-called ``wet foot, dry foot'' policy allows Cubans who walk
ashore to stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   But Haitians claim they are routinely sent back without being allowed to
request a hearing to determine whether they have a ``credible fear'' of
persecution in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Jocelyn McCalla, executive director of the New-York based National Coalition
for Haitian Rights, said the U.S. disposition is ``illegal'' and ``absolutely
unfair.''
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters contrasted the international custody battle over Gonzalez -- who
survived a Thanksgiving Day boat trip to the United States in which his mother,
stepfather and others drowned -- with the plight of a pregnant Haitian woman
whose children were returned to Haiti this month while she remained in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In the New Year's trip, Yvena Rhinvil, who is four months pregnant, was one
of four people brought to shore for medical reasons. But her children, ages 8
and 9, were among those sent back to Haiti, where they are living with an aunt.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said they weren't told Rhinvil's children were with her. ``If
we would have known that she had children on board, we would have brought the
children with her,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Luis Diaz.
</P>
<P>
	   The repatriation of the New Year's Day Haitian migrants is especially unfair
given the treatment of Gonzalez, many said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not asking the U.S. to open its borders indiscriminately,'' said
Leonie Hermantin, head of the Haitian-American Foundation. ``When people come
here making asylum claims, they should not be turned back without due process.''

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A year ago, stores couldn't give away St. Louis Rams
merchandise. Now, a replica blue and gold Kurt Warner No. 13 or Marshall Faulk
No. 28 jersey is harder to find than home run king Mark McGwire's No. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   Problem is, licensed merchandisers aren't the only ones taking advantage of
the hysteria that came with an NFC-best 13-3 record. And as the Rams prepare to
play host to Minnesota in this city's first-ever NFL playoff game on Sunday, the
NFL and local police will be on the lookout for counterfeit merchandise.
</P>
<P>
	   NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Wednesday that four teams of NFL
investigators will arrive in St. Louis on Saturday to seek out those peddling
counterfeit goods. One man, Ramanuel Kimble, 44, of Arlington, Texas, was
indicted last month for selling fake Rams merchandise near the Trans World Dome.
He faces felony charges. A trial date has not been set.
</P>
<P>
	   Police and league officials believe others are doing it, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know where counterfeit merchandise is right now," said Lt. Steve Harmon,
a St. Louis detective. "It is popping up everywhere. I've seen it in flea
markets. I've even seen it in shopping malls. It is prevalent."
</P>
<P>
	   The NFL, like other professional sports leagues, has licensing rights for
any merchandise bearing logos and names of its teams. The agreements cover
everything imaginable -- from jerseys and ball caps to pens, bumper stickers,
even mouse pads. More than 1,000 products are licensed by the league's marketing
arm, NFL Properties.
</P>
<P>
	   Since arriving in St. Louis in 1995, Rams goods have hardly been a hot item.
The team was a failure -- until this season, the Rams' last winning year since
1989. Locally, McGwire's home run feats and an attractive update to the St.
Louis Blues jerseys pushed Rams goods to the "50 percent off" racks.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationally, the Rams were barely a blip on the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
	   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're beginning to see fans here in New York wearing Warner jerseys,"
McCarthy said. "Fans like to associate with winners."
</P>
<P>
	   McCarthy would say only that the Rams ranked "safely in the bottom third" of
team merchandise sales until this year. They've moved up to No. 15 of the 31 NFL
teams -- a significant improvement in one year, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sales are definitely up," said Ryan Heavner, a salesman at Sports Avenue in
St. Louis Union Station. "Some stuff, we're having trouble keeping in stock,
like Warner jerseys." He estimated that sales of Rams items have doubled since
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the team's success caught the eye of Kimble while he was
peddling illegal Atlanta Braves merchandise during the World Series. When
officers caught up with Kimble in St. Louis, he had 128 Rams T-shirts, along
with dozens of other items.
</P>
<P>
	   Counterfeiting is a big concern for the NFL because the league gets a
percentage of each sale. But McCarthy said counterfeiters also give the league
and the teams a bad name.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a quality control issue," he said. "What happens is (consumers) will
buy a T-shirt from a counterfeiter for $5, go home and wash it, the colors bleed
and it's worthless. It leaves a sour taste in their mouth."
</P>
<P>
	   McCarthy said league investigators will focus primarily this weekend on the
area around the Trans World Dome, where the Vikings and Rams play in a
second-round game. The winner will play either Tampa Bay or Washington in the
NFC championship game Jan. 23, with the winner of that game going to the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers should find an NFL hologram on any Rams item, and a tag on any
clothing, McCarthy said. The league does not license any items with crude or
derogatory language, so if you see a T-shirt with vulgarity, it is unlicensed,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Democrats on Constituency Politics  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A look at how the Democratic presidential candidates are approaching
constituency politics and where they get their support.
</P>
<P>
	   BILL BRADLEY: Bradley has criticized Vice President Al Gore's targeting of
constituency groups, but what helped trigger that strategy was Bradley's
aggressive appeals to groups like gays with positions that were openly
supportive of their stance on issues, while Gore took a more centrist -- and
cautious -- approach. Bradley's health care plan also aims at key Democratic
groups, low-income people, blue-collar workers those in service jobs -- that
currently have trouble getting full health coverage. Bradley is most competitive
with Gore among wealthier Democrats, men and those with more education. Lawyers
were the biggest contributors to Bradley's campaign, followed by those in the
securities and investment business, according to campaign finance records.
</P>
<P>
	   AL GORE: Has aggressively pursued traditional Democratic constituency groups
such as blacks, women and the elderly as the nomination race grew tighter,
bringing a reminder from party moderates recently that aligning too closely with
liberal interest groups could be a formula for defeat. Gore campaign spokesman
Chris Lehane says Gore is offering the same broad message on areas like the
economy that he's offered for the last seven years and will appeal to a broad
audience. But Lehane also noted that it's essential to solidify support among
the core Democratic constituencies. Gore has stronger support than Bradley among
blacks, women and those with less education and lower incomes. Lawyers and law
firms also had contributed the most to the Gore campaign, followed by retirees
and those in the real estate business.

<HEADLINE> GOP on Constituency Politics  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A look at how the Republican presidential candidates are approaching
constituency politics and where they get their support.
</P>
<P>
	   GARY BAUER: Targets social conservatives with his anti-abortion stance and
admonitions for stronger morality in the country and tougher discipline in
schools. He is running as a Reagan Republican, calling for less government and
lower taxes. Aides say his work with local organizers of conservative groups
could pay off in Iowa, but the polls have not reflected that. The biggest groups
of financial contributors have been retirees and health professionals.
</P>
<P>
	   GEORGE W. BUSH: Focuses on a broad range of voters, getting support from
conservatives hungry for a winner and reaching out for moderates and even
traditionally Democratic groups. His support in the national polls has been
strong overall, usually in the 60s, and relatively strong across the board. His
biggest groups of contributors have been retirees and lawyers, followed by those
in the real estate business.
</P>
<P>
	   ORRIN HATCH: Targets a broad range of Republicans, not focusing as much on
specific groups. So far, the campaign has not been making much of a mark in the
polls. His biggest financial supporters have been lawyers, followed by
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
	   STEVE FORBES: Has identified key leaders in conservative groups, farmers,
home schoolers, property rights people, small business owners in Iowa. The
Forbes campaign has developed detailed databases of these leaders, and has had
more success courting them in Iowa, which has a more stable population than New
Hampshire. Forbes biggest group of contributors has been retirees, those in the
securities and investment business, followed by other types of financiers.
</P>
<P>
	   ALAN KEYES: Has been targeting social conservatives as well as conservatives
in general with a message of the nation's fading morality and less government
intervention. The biggest groups of Keyes contributors have been retirees and
health professionals.
</P>
<P>
	   JOHN MCCAIN: Focuses on reform-minded conservatives, independents, military
veterans and those fed up with Washington. His strongest support in the polls
has come from older people and men. His biggest groups of contributors have been
retirees and those in the securities and investment business.

<HEADLINE> American Indians Said Overlooked  </HEADLINE>
   By CHAKA FERGUSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush says during an Iowa campaign
stop that he's pumping thousands of dollars into an ad campaign to court
Hispanics, describing it as ``a fresh start for America.''
</P>
<P>
	   From the church pulpit where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his
``Mountaintop'' speech on the eve of his assassination, Vice President Al Gore
invokes the name of the slain civil rights leader to rally blacks in Memphis,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   As the presidential campaign heats up, the leading contenders are reaching
out to minority groups: women, blacks, Hispanics and Asian-Americans. But there
is one group that hasn't been wooed, stroked or courted.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's oldest inhabitants -- American Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not even getting a blip on the radar screen of major candidates,''
said JoAnn Chase, executive director of the National Congress of American
Indians, a nonpartisan Washington-based lobbying group that represents more than
250 tribes.
</P>
<P>
	   Political black-tie fund-raisers are almost nonexistent on the nation's 550
or so reservations. Buses filled with candidates and their entourages rarely
pull up to campaign rallies in Indian country.
</P>
<P>
	   And while some tribes have strengthened their political clout and gained
influence through the financial successes of tribal casinos, most American
Indians still remain largely outside of the political sphere.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, President Clinton's visit to the Pine Ridge reservation in South
Dakota last July was the first by a chief executive since Franklin Roosevelt
passed through Cherokee country in North Carolina on vacation in 1936.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was the only presidential candidate to speak at
the NCAI's national convention in October. And he is the only major candidate
who has taken his campaign to the Navajos, the country's largest tribe with
225,000 members and a reservation that spans three states.
</P>
<P>
	   Tribes have been wary of Bush, the Texas governor, especially after he was
quoted in The (Syracuse) Post-Standard in October as saying ``state law reigns
supreme when it comes to the Indians, whether it be gambling or any other
issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   The governor refused to elaborate on his comment at the time. But Bush
spokesman Scott McClellan repeatedly has said Bush respects the ``long-standing
tribal sovereignty and self-governance of Native Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has promised to run a ``positive, inclusive campaign'' that reaches out
to people across the United States, McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, Gore and Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, did not respond to several requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Most American Indian leaders cite demographics, economics and historical
disenchantment with the political process as major reasons why politicians make
so few overtures to their people.
</P>
<P>
	   American Indians make up 1 percent of the population, with 2.4 million
people, and are among the poorest. Also, many aren't registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you line up Indian dollars to other interests, it doesn't bode well in
a process that is dominated by dollars and numbers of votes,'' Chase said. ``The
perception is that you don't carry a lot of weight in determining the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
	   Times are changing, though, and both parties are beginning to take notice of
the growing political muscle some tribes have shown in important states like
California, where tribes won approval for gambling despite opposition from the
powerful gambling industry in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   In California, tribes are using their success with the gambling initiative
to broaden their political leverage to other issues such as tribal sovereignty,
taxes and dealings with labor unions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not a huge voting bloc like Hispanics and blacks, but in key
states, we matter,'' said Gwen Carr, former political director of American
Indians for the Democratic National Committee and former executive director of
the state party in Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Rejects Old Growth Protection  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California forestry officials have rejected a
demand by former tree-dweller Julia ``Butterfly'' Hill and dozens of other
environmentalists to immediately halt old-growth logging.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the move would affect half of California's private forests
and more than $30 billion worth of timber.
</P>
<P>
	   As expected, the state Board of Forestry rejected a petition brought by the
activists on Wednesday after a contentious day-long hearing. But it agreed to
set up a committee of environmentalists, timber owners and others to study the
issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill, part of a Northern California environmental coalition, said current
law allows the cutting of ancient trees, including redwoods, under loopholes and
exemptions abused by harvesters. The group filed the emergency petition with the
board calling for an immediate stop.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is all about protecting the trees, including the one I lived in,
which was more than 1,000 years old,'' Hill said during a crowded hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill, 25, lived for two years on a tarp-covered platform high up in a
redwood 250 miles north of San Francisco. She climbed down last month after the
Pacific Lumber Co. spared the tree from logging.
</P>
<P>
	   A state forestry review of the potential impact of the emergency order
sought by the environmentalists said the ban ``could apply to up to half of all
private forest land'' in California.
</P>
<P>
	   To order an immediate logging ban, the nine-member Board of Forestry would
have had to decide that old-growth harvesting represents a major public
emergency -- something that constitutes a direct threat to ``public peace,
health and safety or general welfare.''
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists contend old-growth logging has precipitated just such an
emergency because of its environmental impact.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is not the administration's view,'' said Stan Young, a spokesman for
Resources Secretary Mary Nichols, Gov. Gray Davis' top environmental adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   But Young and other administration officials said the governor opposes
``cutting down trees without getting an environmental review.'' The state will
develop a ``consensus-based'' inventory of California's old-growth timber to
come up with a plan to help protect critical habitats, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   In part, the inventory will determine which trees should be considered
old-growth.
</P>
<P>
	   There are several exemptions to the rules governing timber harvesting that
allow the cutting of trees that otherwise might be protected. The most
significant of the nine exemptions allows the taking of ``dead, dying or
diseased timber,'' a category environmentalists contend is too broad.

<HEADLINE> Senators, Pakistanis Talk Democracy  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto appealed
today to the United States to actively push for the return of democracy to her
homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   The request came hours before the first visit by U.S. legislators to
Pakistan since a bloodless coup three months ago put the army in charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Four Democratic senators -- Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Harry Reid of Nevada and Daniel Akaka
of Hawaii -- were scheduled to arrive later today on a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear if the senators would meet military leader Gen. Pervez
Musharraf. But U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark Wentworth said they will press in
meetings with the Pakistani leadership for a timetable for a return to
democracy, something Washington has been demanding since the coup.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to Daschle, Ms. Bhutto suggested Washington make a commitment to
democracy and a timetable, as well as the release of political prisoners,
conditions for fresh U.S. financial aid to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Such a message would clearly convey that in the 21st century democracy,
human rights and the rule of law are the values which are respected and upon
which lie the dignity of nations in the global community,'' Ms. Bhutto said in
her letter.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Bhutto, who was twice dismissed from power on allegations of widespread
corruption, has been convicted of corruption in Pakistan and sentenced in
absentia to five years in jail by the deposed government of Nawaz Sharif. From
her home in Britain, Ms. Bhutto initially welcomed the army's takeover and the
removal of her rival Sharif.
</P>
<P>
	   Musharraf, the man in charge in Pakistan, has refused to be tied to a
deadline to return civilian rule in Pakistan. Instead, Musharraf says he wants
to implement a series of reforms that would ensure democracy takes root.
</P>
<P>
	   Musharraf has accused previous governments, including Ms. Bhutto's, of
runaway corruption that has weakened most of the country's institutions and left
the economy in tatters.
</P>
<P>
	   Before setting a date for new elections, Musharraf said he wants new laws,
electoral reform, a revived economy and a clean sweep of the corrupt in
Pakistan, an ambitious agenda that even his supporters believe will take years.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Ms. Bhutto in her letter didn't name the political prisoners she
wanted released. But previously she has pressed for the release of her jailed
husband, Asif Ali Zardari, also convicted on corruption charges. Zardari has
been in jail since his wife's government was ousted in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   In Pakistan's rough and tumble politics, corruption and influence peddling
has become endemic.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of his first acts after taking power, Musharraf established a
National Accountability Bureau with sweeping powers and laws to arrest those
suspected of corruption as well as those who have not repaid bank loans, a
common practice among the wealthy in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Several of the country's wealthiest have been arrested under these new laws,
which Ms. Bhutto described as draconian and which Musharraf's officials describe
as ``desperate measures for desperate times.''
</P>
<P>
	   In her letter to Daschle, Ms. Bhutto also asked the legislators to use
financial pressure on Pakistan to pressure the country to become the ``first
South Asian nuclear power to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.'' The
United States has been appealing to both Pakistan and its nuclear neighbor,
India, to sign the global treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan already has indicated its willingness to sign, but says that it
wants to build a consensus at home and explain the treaty to Pakistanis before
signing it.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Gore Builds on National Lead  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An overwhelming majority of Americans say in a new poll
that they are better off now than they were eight years ago, but that hasn't
helped Vice President Al Gore in his bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Three-fourths of those questioned in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released
Wednesday said they were better off, and more than eight out of 10 said they
were satisfied with the state of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore leads Democratic challenger Bill Bradley 59 percent to 30 percent, a
wider lead than in December when Gore was ahead, 52 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The overall lead for Gore is reflected in other recent national polls that
show him with at least a 20-point lead over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore trails Republican front-runner George W. Bush by 9 points among
likely voters, while Bradley is running close to Bush among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
	   While it's difficult to say exactly why Gore isn't doing better with voters,
a quarter of Americans said his ties with Clinton made them view him less
favorably, while 10 percent said they viewed the vice president more favorably
because of the link.
</P>
<P>
	   In the race for the GOP nomination, Bush has edged ahead of Sen. John McCain
in a New Hampshire tracking poll of the Republican presidential candidates and
retains his commanding lead nationally in the CNN-USA Today poll.
</P>
<P>
	   The national poll has Bush at 63 percent, McCain at 18 percent and other
Republican candidates in single digits.
</P>
<P>
	   The tracking poll by the American Research Group suggests movement for Bush
over the last month. Bush has 36 percent support in the newest tracking poll, to
McCain's 31 percent. A poll in late December from ARG had McCain leading Bush by
9 points.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Basically, Bush advertised heavily over the Christmas holidays and McCain
wasn't in New Hampshire during that time and Bush got the benefit of that,''
explained American Research Group pollster Dick Bennett. ``The real key is going
to be what happens after McCain spends more time up here.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain campaign spokesman Howard Opinsky said: ``What Dr. Bennett has found
in the past is the more that voters see John McCain, the more they like him.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was in New Hampshire most of last week. ``We'll be there most of this
week and most of the days between now and the primary,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   The tracking poll is a three-day average of nightly polls of about 200
people nightly. The error margin for the sample of 620 taken Sunday through
Tuesday was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of 1,633 adults taken Friday through Monday
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points and the sample of 814
likely voters had an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other findings of the national poll:
</P>
<P>
	   --49 percent of likely voters favored Democrats and 45 percent chose
Republicans when asked which party's candidate they would vote for in their
congressional district. That difference was within the poll's error margin.
</P>
<P>
	   --President Clinton's job approval rate is at 63 percent, up slightly from
December.
</P>
<P>
	   --Just over half, 51 percent, approved of the way Congress is handling its
job -- the first time in a year that Congress has had a majority in its corner.
</P>
<P>
	   --Half said they want to see a continuation of Clinton's policies, while a
third said they wanted more conservative policies and one out of 10 wanted more
liberal policies.
</P>
<P>
	   --Three-fourths were dissatisfied with the state of the nation's moral
values.

show him with at least a 20-point lead over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore trails Republican front-runner George W. Bush by 9 points among
likely voters, while Bradley is running close to Bush among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
	   While it's difficult to say exactly why Gore isn't doing better with voters,
a quarter of Americans said his ties with Clinton made them view him less
favorably, while 10 percent said they viewed the vice president more favorably
because of the link.
</P>
<P>
	   In the race for the GOP nomination, Bush has edged ahead of Sen. John McCain
in a New Hampshire tracking poll of the Republican presidential candidates and
retains his commanding lead nationally in the CNN-USA Today poll.
</P>
<P>
	   The national poll has Bush at 63 percent, McCain at 18 percent and other
Republican candidates in single digits.
</P>
<P>
	   The tracking poll by the American Research Group suggests movement for Bush
over the last month. Bush has 36 percent support in the newest tracking poll, to
McCain's 31 percent. A poll in late December from ARG had McCain leading Bush by
9 points.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Basically, Bush advertised heavily over the Christmas holidays and McCain
wasn't in New Hampshire during that time and Bush got the benefit of that,''
explained American Research Group pollster Dick Bennett. ``The real key is going
to be what happens after McCain spends more time up here.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain campaign spokesman Howard Opinsky said: ``What Dr. Bennett has found
in the past is the more that voters see John McCain, the more they like him.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was in New Hampshire most of last week. ``We'll be there most of this
week and most of the days between now and the primary,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   The tracking poll is a three-day average of nightly polls of about 200
people nightly. The error margin for the sample of 620 taken Sunday through
Tuesday was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of 1,633 adults taken Friday through Monday
has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points and the sample of 814
likely voters had an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other findings of the national poll:
</P>
<P>
	   --49 percent of likely voters favored Democrats and 45 percent chose
Republicans when asked which party's candidate they would vote for in their
congressional district. That difference was within the poll's error margin.
</P>
<P>
	   --President Clinton's job approval rate is at 63 percent, up slightly from
December.
</P>
<P>
	   --Just over half, 51 percent, approved of the way Congress is handling its
job -- the first time in a year that Congress has had a majority in its corner.
</P>
<P>
	   --Half said they want to see a continuation of Clinton's policies, while a
third said they wanted more conservative policies and one out of 10 wanted more
liberal policies.
</P>
<P>
	   --Three-fourths were dissatisfied with the state of the nation's moral
values.

<HEADLINE> Some NYPD cars to be equipped with cameras  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Starting next week, 33 NYPD highway patrol cruisers will
hit the road equipped with small video cameras to record officers - as well as
the actions of people they stop.
<P>
	   The NYPD comes late to this bit of technology. Many other police departments
nationwide have had such devices in their patrol cars for more than 10 years.
Police Commissioner Howard Safir, head of the department since 1996, said
Wednesday he's not certain why it took so long for the NYPD to install cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I'm very committed to technology - this is something we ought to be
doing," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Meyers, director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, said the
cameras can't hurt. "It will be there as another reminder to the cops - like the
Miranda warning," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Meyers added: "There's no telling what can happen outside the range of
the camera."
</P>
<P>
	   Safir says he's certain the cameras will protect citizens and officers. A
field test begins next week.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will give good corroboration to violations and I think it will be very
protective of the officers," he said. "Let's face it. No one likes to get a
summons, and many people who get summonses make allegations against police
officers of being discourteous, of being abusive, of using excessive force. This
will be a video record of what actually took place."
</P>
<P>
	   The small cameras, which cost $4,500 each, are attached to the rear view
window. Officers wear a wireless microphone clipped to a recorder attached to
their belts to capture any words exchanged up to 500 feet from the car.
</P>
<P>
	   The camera is activated when the police car's lights and sirens go on. The
officer turns on the microphone and recorder while getting out of the car. A
button can be used to zoom in on a license plate.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers can also coordinate the videotape with the car's radar device,
which can record the speed of the car right on the tape, Safir added.
</P>
<P>
	   The videotape is in the locked trunk. The only person who has the key is the
officer's supervisor. At the end of every tour, the tape, able to record for six
hours, is retrieved. The NYPD's legal department is researching how long the
tapes should be kept before being destroyed.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, officers seem receptive to the cameras, Safir said. And, if the test
period proves successful, every highway patrol car will be equipped with
cameras. In the future, officials will evaluate whether the cameras should be in
other patrol vehicles.

<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices closed higher Thursday as investors bought
up biotechnology, chemical and other domestic-demand related issues. The dollar
dipped against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up 155.87 points, or
0.83 percent, to 18,833.29. On Wednesday, the average closed down 173.50 points,
or 0.92 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 105.64 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market at
3 p.m. (1 a.m. EST) Thursday, down 0.12 yen from late Wednesday, and below its
late New York level of 105.99 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, Wall Street's overnight gains boosted investor
confidence in Japanese shares. But market players focused more on stocks
centering on domestic demand such biotechnology and chemical companies than
globally-oriented high-tech and telecommunications issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is clear now that the market will not rise on the strength of
information technology shares alone, and investors are looking for their next
target," said Kazunori Shimono, manager of the equity trading section at
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the day's biggest gainers were Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. and Asahi
Chemical Industry Co.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.02, or 0.3 percent,
to close at 11,551.10 on gains by blue-chip industrial stocks such as 3M and
Merck.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-rich Nasdaq Composite index, however, fell 71.30 to 3,849.89.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section rose 1.05 points, or 0.06 percent, to close at 1,657.97. On Wednesday,
the TOPIX closed down 21.90 points, or 1.30 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, U.S. investors sold dollars to take profit from the
greenback's recent gains, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Although near-term dollar-bullish sentiment is unchanged, U.S. and European
investors sold dollars to square their positions in preparation for future
purchases," said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO
Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors are eyeing the upcoming meeting of senior financial officials from
the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Tokyo on Jan. 22 for further
clues on the greenback's moves in the longer term.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 108.72 yen, up from 108.48 yen
late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8050
percent from 1.7950 on Wednesday. Its price was down 0.09 point to 100.79.

Polls: Bush, Gore Build on Leads
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore leads Democratic challenger Bill
Bradley 59 percent to 30 percent in a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released
Wednesday, a wider lead than in December when Gore was ahead, 52 percent to 38
percent. The overall lead for Gore is reflected in other recent national polls
that show him with at least a 20-point lead over Bradley. But Gore trails
Republican front-runner George W. Bush by 9 points among likely voters, while
Bradley is running close to Bush among likely voters. While it's difficult to

Court: Flight Can Justify Police Searches
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave police broad
authority to stop and question people who run at the sight of an officer. The
5-4 ruling came short of giving police a blanket right to stop anyone who runs
after seeing the police. But it said such flight may indicate a crime is being
committed and therefore can help justify a police stop. The decision was a boost
for police but worried some civil libertarians. "Nervous, evasive behavior is a
pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion" to justify a stop, Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.

Chechen Borders Closed to Men, Ages 10-60

	   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- Men trying to escape the bloodshed of Chechnya
came to the border and were turned back by Russian soldiers for the same brusque
reason. "The problem is that you are not 60 yet," said the stern,
Kalashnikov-toting border guard. The men could do nothing but turn and walk
away. They were feeling the sting of a new Russian policy to crack down on
rebels who have shown recent signs of resurgence. A top Russian military
commander, Col. Gen. Viktor Kazantsev, on Tuesday ordered that all males between
10 and 60 years old be detained and checked for possible rebel ties.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A century from now there will be twice as many Americans
as today, the Census Bureau predicts. While no one knows what daily life will be
like in 100 years, the new population projections being issued Thursday conjure
images of twice as many cars jostling for position on the highways and twice as
many shoppers crowding the aisles at Wal-Mart. From an estimated 275 million
people today, the bureau projects a U.S. population of 571 million in the year
2100.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson were to agree to such a dramatic
solution, a mandated breakup of Bill Gates' Seattle-based empire in an
anti-trust case would carry enormous implications for the way consumers buy and
use software for their computers.

tremendous amount of credit for just showing up," Letterman told his "Late Show"

whether women prefer taller men or those men are simply more outgoing -- is up
for debate. But the numbers clearly stack up against shorter guys. Polish and
British scientists studied the medical records of about 3,200 Polish men ages 25

who had at least one child. Bachelors were about an inch shorter on average than
married men.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Avoiding S.C. Flag Flap  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEST COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Although they're eager to win South Carolina's
Republican presidential primary, George W. Bush and John McCain are trying hard
to steer clear of a controversy over the state's practice of flying the
Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, campaigning far away Wednesday in Dublin, N.H., read a statement
clarifying his position about the flag. He posted the same message on his
campaign Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As to how I view the flag, I understand both sides,'' the Arizona senator
said. ``Some view it as a symbol of slavery. Others view it as a symbol of
heritage,'' which is a phrase used by some white Republicans who want the flag
to continue flying over the South Carolina Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Personally, I see the battle flag as a symbol of heritage,'' explained
McCain, a Navy veteran who comes from a long line of military leaders. ``I have
ancestors who have fought for the Confederacy, none of whom owned slaves. I
believe they fought honorably.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, meanwhile, reiterated that any decision is up to South Carolina
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The flag has flown above the Statehouse since 1962. Five years ago,
legislators rebuffed then-Republican Gov. David Beasley's attempts to remove it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've answered that question all I'm going to answer it today,'' Bush said
testily after he again was asked about the flag during a news conference in
Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
	   He also was on the defensive Wednesday over his campaign's decision to stage
a rally the night before at a Charleston plantation that had been worked by
slaves.
</P>
<P>
	   In another matter involving race, Bush criticized the words of a Republican
South Carolina state senator who described the NAACP as the ``National
Association for Retarded People'' for its work against the flag -- but did not
call for an apology.
</P>
<P>
	   Reporters asked Bush, the Texas governor, about the race matters after he
said he wanted the Republican Party to reach out more to minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   In Texas, Bush has recorded growing support from minorities and women. In
his 1998 re-election, exit polls showed he got support from 49 percent of
Hispanics, 27 percent of blacks and 65 percent of women, nearly all double-digit
improvements from his first election in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   On another front Wednesday, Bush picked up the endorsements of Sens. John
Ashcroft of Missouri and Connie Mack of Florida, the 32nd and 33rd GOP senators
who have announced their support for him.
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to his campaign's selection of the Boone Hall Plantation for an
oyster roast and campaign rally Tuesday, Bush noted that the site had been used
by officials from both parties for political events.

<HEADLINE> Keyes: Panama Canal Treaty 'Stupid'  </HEADLINE>
   By GREG SMITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Alan Keyes says
the Panama Canal treaty was a ``stupid mistake'' and that he would take steps to
put the canal back under U.S. control if elected president.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the United States turned control of the canal over to Panama as
called for under a 1977 treaty, which Keyes said he did not support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought it was a stupid mistake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Skeptics, including Keyes, believe the Chinese may be seeking ways to gain
control of the strategic waterway.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we're in a situation now where it would be folly to wait until the
Communist Chinese get some kind of entrenched foothold in Panama,'' Keyes told
about 200 people Wednesday during a question-and-answer session after a speech
to the local chapter of the National Contract Management Association.

	   ``And so I would be inclined to look at that situation, make the assessment

technology with China that he said would allow the Chinese to more quickly close
the gap on U.S. military superiority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What happens when their technology neutralizes that technological
advantage?'' he asked. ``I'm a generous guy, but I think sharing with people
things they can use to blow you up and kill you maybe is going a little far.''
</P>
<P>
	   With its military technology upgraded and the flexing of its economic
muscle, Keyes said China could be the ``most implacable and formidable
adversary'' the country has ever faced.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not sure we're ready for it, partly because we don't understand their
complexity and partly because we're too arrogant,'' he said. ``We're too
satisfied with ourselves. At the moment of your arrogance and self-satisfaction,
that's the moment when somebody comes and takes you down.''

<HEADLINE> Iranians at Home in Southern Calif.  </HEADLINE>
   By TESSIE BORDEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As the popular singer Siavash took the stage at the foot
of the Hollywood Hills, tiny pinpoints illuminated a darkened concert hall
crowded with Iranian teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
	   They weren't holding up lighters -- they were cell phones.
</P>
<P>
	   Half a world away, dozens of relatives listened to the percussion-heavy
Eastern beats of an emerging Iranian music industry. Daring for conservative
Iran, the freewheeling sounds tied them to a city they have nicknamed
``Tehrangeles.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the generation since the Iranian revolution overthrew the U.S.-supported
Shah, hundreds of thousands of Iranians have settled in Southern California,
cobbling together a community as hardworking as it is eclectic. They are flexing
newfound power as they make Los Angeles their largest community outside Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   That community is in the spotlight as Iran's soccer team visits this week
for its first game against a U.S. team on U.S. soil since the 1979 revolution.
It plays the U.S. team Sunday at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have a word in Persian, 'do-hava','' said Sanam Ansari, president of
the Iranian Students Group at the University of California, Los Angeles. ``It
means 'two-weathered.' You're not completely American and not completely
Iranian.''
</P>
<P>
	   Along Westwood Boulevard and in the San Fernando Valley, signs in Farsi's
delicate, cursive script advertise Persian rug merchants, restaurants serving a
staple rice-and-meat dish called chello kebab and grocery stores stocking
biryani paste, lavash bread and halva, a nougat made with sesame seeds.
</P>
<P>
	   In Studio City, the young spend weekend nights dancing to Persian and
American pop at Cabaret Tehran. In Irvine, thousands gather to celebrate the
Persian new year.
</P>
<P>
	   The pull from Iran remains, though. Students here followed last July's
clashes in Tehran between student protesters and Islamic hard-liners through
e-mail and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
	   In Iran, youths get a taste of Los Angeles, Iranian-style, through music,
which makes its way from Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They love anything that's American,'' Ansari said.
</P>
<P>
	   The community in Southern California numbers as many as 600,000. While the
majority are Muslims, Jews and Bahai figure prominently in the community,
although their exact numbers are not known.
</P>
<P>
	   Soccer, known in Iran and elsewhere as football, brings them together.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iranian team, cheered on by thousands, defeated Ecuador, 2-1, late
Wednesday at the Coliseum. Tickets for the rematch against the United States are
selling briskly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the national team comes from your motherland, it touches you,'' said
Shayan Afshar, who works at the Ketab Bookstore in Westwood. ``You may not be
able to define it, but it's significant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Enthusiasm for the game grew out of the teams' 1998 World Cup meeting in
France, when players exchanged flowers and jerseys. After the Iranians' 2-1
victory, celebrations in Iran went on for days and signaled political defiance
of the Islamic regime as women took off head scarves and mingled with men.
Similar boisterous celebrations took place even earlier when Iran unexpectedly
qualified for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some people called it the Football Revolution,'' said Nayereh Tohidi, who
teaches at California State University-Northridge.
</P>
<P>
	   The soccer federation originally planned this week's game on the East Coast
to give Iranian players a shorter trip. But the response in Los Angeles was so
intense that officials changed their minds. Spokesman Jim Moorhouse said Iranian
media have flooded the federation with credential requests.
</P>
<P>
	   In politics, too, the community has begun to emerge, fielding its own
candidates for public office.
</P>
<P>
	   Maziar Mafi is a Democratic candidate for Congress in a district held by
powerful Republican Christopher Cox. In state government, Sara Amir is running
for a West Los Angeles district of the California Assembly under the Green
Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither candidate is expected to win. But Amir says she has moved Iranians
to action here and in her home country.
</P>
<P>
	   When she first entered politics two years ago as a Green Party candidate in
the lieutenant governor race, she organized voter registration drives, bringing
dozens of Iranian-Americans to the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Her campaign speeches, meanwhile, were broadcast to Iran by the BBC and the
Voice of America, inspiring activists there, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have heard so many comments from people there,'' Amir said. ``They were
saying, 'You're giving us hope. We know that you're one of us.' I'm running here
and I get all these nice e-mails from Iran.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration ruled out a role for the United
States in mediation between Russia and the rebels in Chechnya, and suggested
Europeans could take on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   But as Russian forces resumed an offensive in the republic Wednesday, there
was no indication Moscow would heed U.S. advice that it seek a political
solution to a threatened secession by negotiating with Chechen leaders,
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't believe that the result of the use of force is going to be the
melting away of resistance,'' the State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said. ``We believe that the Russians are in a cul-de-sac, that they cannot by
their current strategy come to the end of road because there is no end to this
kind of fighting.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the start of a visit to Washington Wednesday night, Ilyas Akhmadov, who
acts as foreign minister in the Chechen government, said he was not seeking U.S.
help or mediation, but only understanding of the Chechen cause. He planned
meetings with members of Congress and others.
</P>
<P>
	   ``God forbid, I don't want the United States to bomb Russia or give us

people, and we are prepared to do anything,'' he said. ``We are prepared to

reports that Chechen males between ages 10 and 60, would be detained to see
whether they had ties to rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is essential that Russia respect the fundamental human rights of
civilians in and around Chechnya., not endanger the lives of noncombatants, and
ensure freedom of movement for displaced persons,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Akhmadov said he appreciated the State Department's concern but more
important would be its reaction once it hears from Russia.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Leader Doesn't Want US Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chechnya does not want U.S. weapons and hopes for a
negotiated settlement with the Russian government to end the bloodshed in the
breakaway province, a Chechen official says.
</P>
<P>
	   Ilyas Akhmadov, who serves under Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov in
Grozny, said he is not seeking American assistance or mediation of the conflict
but only understanding for the Chechens' desire to stop Russian military
attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration on Wednesday ruled out a U.S. role in mediation
between Russia and the rebels in its province of Chechnya, and suggested
Europeans could take on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   But as Russian forces resumed an offensive in Chechnya on Wednesday, there
was no indication Moscow would heed Chechen appeals or U.S. advice that it seek
a political solution to the threatened secession. Accusing Chechen rebels of
terrorism elsewhere in Russia, the Kremlin repeatedly has said it will not talk
until the rebellion is wiped out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't believe that the result of the use of force is going to be the
melting away of resistance,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
``We believe that the Russians are in a cul-de-sac, that they cannot by their
current strategy come to the end of road because there is no end to this kind of
fighting.''
</P>
<P>
	   Akhmadov, speaking at an academic institute Wednesday evening before planned
meetings with members of Congress and others today, also said Russian soldiers
continue to sell weapons to Chechen fighters and claimed no knowledge of any
terrorist activity by Chechens.
</P>
<P>
	   He estimated 10,000 Chechen civilians and about 250 fighters have died in
the conflict, but he declined to estimate Russian casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``God forbid, I don't want the United States to bomb Russia or give us
weapons,'' Akhmadov said. His remarks were translated from Russian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only aim of our government is to stop the total destruction of our
people, and we are prepared to do anything,'' he said. ``We are prepared to
negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Russia tends to lament its mistakes but only stops aggression ``when
it is drowned in its own blood. It's a horrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the State Department is asking Russia for clarification of
reports that Chechen males between ages 10 and 60, would be detained to see

here is whether the State Department will be satisfied with the explanation of
the Russian government and what its reaction will be.''

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Approves Prime Minister  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The National Assembly approved an economics expert
Thursday as the new prime minister in President Kim Dae-jung's government.
</P>
<P>
	   The approval of Park Tae-joon set the stage for a partial Cabinet shakeup.
Kim planned to replace some Cabinet members after Park's approval to prepare for
parliamentary elections on April 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Park's approval had been expected, because the one-house National Assembly
is controlled by the two parties in the ruling coalition. Of the 279 votes cast,
174 were for the new prime minister and 100 were against. There were five
abstentions or invalid votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Park replaced Kim Jong-pil, who resigned to lead one of the coalition
parties, the United Liberal Democrats, in the April elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Park headed the party for two years until last week. An economics expert, he
founded Pohang Iron and Steel Co. in 1968 and headed it until 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim Dae-jung was a longtime democracy activist and foe of South Korea's
military-led governments years ago, and he has won praise for guiding the
nation's recovery from the Asian currency crisis. But his 2-year-old government
has lost popularity because of a string of corruption scandals.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Accuses U.S. of Cover-Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea accused the United States on Thursday
of trying to cover up alleged mass killings of refugees by American soldiers
during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
	   The North was commenting on statements by U.S. Army Secretary Louis Caldera
in Seoul this week that Washington will not investigate ``every firefight, every
battle'' of the 1950-53 war.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States is currently investigating allegations that U.S. troops
killed hundreds of refugees in the village of No Gun Ri in July 1950. Since the
No Gun Ri allegations arose, South Koreans have come forward with other cases of
alleged killing of civilians by U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera has not ruled out investigations of other incidents, but he has
emphasized the need to establish whether civilians were killed intentionally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Uncle Sam's jargon is the height of impudence,'' the North's official
ruling Workers' Party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said in a commentary carried by
the country's foreign news outlet, KCNA.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.S. imperialists should clearly know that the more they try to
conceal the crimes fully exposed to the world, the more they reveal their true
colors as wicked aggressors and murderers,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
	   The No Gun Ri investigation started after The Associated Press, citing
survivors and U.S. war veterans, reported in September that retreating U.S.
soldiers machine-gunned refugees at a railroad bridge in the early days of the
war.
</P>
<P>
	   According to declassified U.S. military documents, American ground
commanders feared that North Korean soldiers, dressed in civilian clothes, were
infiltrating refugee columns.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Korean War, the United States led a 16-nation U.N. force in defense
of South Korea against North Korea, which was backed by China and the Soviet
Union.

<HEADLINE> USDA: Meat Labeling Could Cost  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department says there's no evidence
consumers are willing to pay more for meat to have it labeled with the country
of origin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To the contrary, if consumers do distinguish goods depending on their
country of origin, strong incentive exists for industries to act without
government intervention,'' according to a study that USDA issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Some American producers have been pushing Congress to require such labeling
as a way to curb imports of Canadian cattle.
</P>
<P>
	   The USDA study, which was requested by Congress after meat processors
defeated a labeling bill in 1998, said that such a law could hurt U.S. meat
exports if foreign countries impose a similar requirement.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA did not put a price tag on a labeling system. The labels themselves
could cost anywhere from $500,000 to $8 million, depending on what cuts of meat
the law applied to.
</P>
<P>
	   Processors also would have to segregate meat that enters the country to make
sure it's labeled properly, and the cost of doing that ``is unknown, but could
be significant,'' the report said. There would be additional costs to USDA to
enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
	   Meatpackers claim that labeling meat could cost the industry $1 billion a
year. About 10 percent of the beef that Americans eat is imported.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore leads Democratic challenger Bill
Bradley 59 percent to 30 percent in a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released
Wednesday, a wider lead than in December when Gore was ahead, 52 percent to 38
percent. The overall lead for Gore is reflected in other recent national polls
that show him with at least a 20-point lead over Bradley. But Gore trails
Republican front-runner George W. Bush by 9 points among likely voters, while
Bradley is running close to Bush among likely voters. While it's difficult to
say exactly why Gore isn't doing better with voters, a quarter of Americans said
his ties with Clinton made them view him less favorably, while 10 percent said
they viewed the vice president more favorably because of the link.

Court: Flight Can Justify Police Searches

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave police broad
authority to stop and question people who run at the sight of an officer. The
5-4 ruling came short of giving police a blanket right to stop anyone who runs
after seeing the police. But it said such flight may indicate a crime is being
committed and therefore can help justify a police stop. The decision was a boost
for police but worried some civil libertarians. "Nervous, evasive behavior is a
pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion" to justify a stop, Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore leads Democratic challenger Bill
Bradley 59 percent to 30 percent in a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released
Wednesday, a wider lead than in December when Gore was ahead, 52 percent to 38
percent. The overall lead for Gore is reflected in other recent national polls
that show him with at least a 20-point lead over Bradley. But Gore trails
Republican front-runner George W. Bush by 9 points among likely voters, while
Bradley is running close to Bush among likely voters. While it's difficult to
say exactly why Gore isn't doing better with voters, a quarter of Americans said
his ties with Clinton made them view him less favorably, while 10 percent said
they viewed the vice president more favorably because of the link.

Court: Flight Can Justify Police Searches
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave police broad
authority to stop and question people who run at the sight of an officer. The
5-4 ruling came short of giving police a blanket right to stop anyone who runs
after seeing the police. But it said such flight may indicate a crime is being
committed and therefore can help justify a police stop. The decision was a boost
for police but worried some civil libertarians. "Nervous, evasive behavior is a
pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion" to justify a stop, Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.

Chechen Leader Doesn't Want U.S. Aid

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chechnya does not want U.S. weapons and hopes for a
negotiated settlement with the Russian government to end the bloodshed in the
breakaway province, a Chechen official says. Ilyas Akhmadov, who serves under
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov in Grozny, said he is not seeking American
assistance or mediation of the conflict but only understanding for the Chechens'
desire to stop Russian military attacks. The Clinton administration on Wednesday
ruled out a U.S. role in mediation between Russia and the rebels in its province
of Chechnya, and suggested Europeans could take on the job.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A century from now there will be twice as many Americans
as today, the Census Bureau predicts. While no one knows what daily life will be
like in 100 years, the new population projections being issued Thursday conjure
images of twice as many cars jostling for position on the highways and twice as
many shoppers crowding the aisles at Wal-Mart. From an estimated 275 million
people today, the bureau projects a U.S. population of 571 million in the year
2100.

solution, a mandated breakup of Bill Gates' Seattle-based empire in an
anti-trust case would carry enormous implications for the way consumers buy and

tremendous amount of credit for just showing up," Letterman told his "Late Show"

Tall Guys Get Girls, Have More Kids

whether women prefer taller men or those men are simply more outgoing -- is up
for debate. But the numbers clearly stack up against shorter guys. Polish and
British scientists studied the medical records of about 3,200 Polish men ages 25
to 60 and found that childless men were on average 1.2 inches shorter than men
who had at least one child. Bachelors were about an inch shorter on average than
married men.

<HEADLINE> Russia Closes Chechen Borders  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNA DOLGOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- Men trying to escape the bloodshed of Chechnya
came to the border and were turned back by Russian soldiers for the same brusque
reason.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem is that you are not 60 yet,'' said the stern,
Kalashnikov-toting border guard. The men could do nothing but turn and walk
away.
</P>
<P>
	   They were feeling the sting of a new Russian policy to crack down on rebels
who have shown recent signs of resurgence. A top Russian military commander,
Col. Gen. Viktor Kazantsev, on Tuesday ordered that all males between 10 and 60
years old be detained and checked for possible rebel ties.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the military's orders, all roads between Chechnya and the neighboring
Russian region of Ingushetia were closed Wednesday to such males.
</P>
<P>
	   The order also affected those who wanted to get back into Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Vakhid Ashakhanov, 41, said he left Chechnya on Tuesday to drive a friend's
daughter to a hospital in Ingushetia. The girl, 16-year-old Zarema Shishkhanova,
was suffering from an acute form of tuberculosis she developed after living for
several months in a cold basement.
</P>
<P>
	   After the unexpected tightening of border regulations, Ashakhanov was cut
off from his two teen-age sons, who remained in their home village of Gikaly,
just outside Grozny, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They can't leave (Chechnya), and I can't go back,'' Ashakhanov said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shishkhanova's father, Gilany Shishkhanov, showed his daughter's hospital
admission record to the Russian guards -- but with no success.
</P>
<P>
	   At 61, Shishkhanov was old enough to go back to Chechnya, where he had left
his 4- and 6-year-old granddaughters. But having no money to pay for a ride
home, Shishkhanov said he could not leave without his younger friend.
</P>
<P>
	   A straight-backed, dignified-looking man wearing a traditional sheepskin
hat, Shishkhanov was wiping away tears from his wrinkled face.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let God be their judge,'' Shishkhanov said, turning around to walk back to
Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
	   The new policy brought sharp criticism from the watchdog agency Human Rights
Watch.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Chechen males are now effectively trapped in a war zone where they face
grave threats to their lives,'' said Peter Bouckaert, an agency worker in
Ingushetia. ``The Russian authorities are deliberately violating their
international obligations.''
</P>
<P>
	   The orders to screen Chechen men came after rebel fighters launched
counterattacks in the key towns of Shali and Argun, driving back federal troops.
The rebel offensive caught the Russians by surprise, embarrassing senior
commanders who had been predicting imminent victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Kazantsev said Russian forces had been too lax in making sure that all
rebels had been driven out of the towns.

<HEADLINE> Astronaut Makes Rommel Remark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The commander of the next space shuttle mission
jokingly told a German astronaut ``Rommel would have been proud of you'' after
he drove an armored personnel carrier during training.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Kregel made the remark about the Nazi general Wednesday on a vacant
launch pad at Kennedy Space Center where crew members were practicing shuttle
escape maneuvers. Part of their training includes driving a M-113 armored
personnel carrier away from the launch pad.
</P>
<P>
	   Gerhard Thiele, who is part of Kregel's six-member crew on space shuttle
Endeavour, laughed when he heard the remark.
</P>
<P>
	   Endeavour is scheduled to launch Jan. 31 for an Earth-mapping mission.
</P>
<P>
	   Erwin Rommel was known as ``The Desert Fox'' during World War II and led
Germany's Afrika Korps against Allied forces in Libya in 1941.
</P>
<P>
	   He repeatedly outmaneuvered his opponents but was overcome by British forces
at El Alamein, Egypt, in 1942. In 1944, Rommel was implicated in a plot to kill
Adolf Hitler and chose to swallow a fatal dose of poison rather than face trial.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Investment Incentives  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is road-testing some ideas he will
highlight during his State of the Union address at the end of this month,
including a plan to sweeten the incentives for businesses to invest in some of
America's hard-luck rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton travels to New York City today, where he will help launch a
small-business development center at predominantly Hispanic Boricua College in
Brooklyn, and describe his proposal to more than double a tax credit for
investment in what the Clinton administration calls ``new markets.''
</P>
<P>
	   The incentive program, which Clinton first unveiled last year, is supposed
to make investment in poor regions of this country as attractive as investment
in less-developed countries abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the time for these kinds of initiatives because for the first time
in many, many years we have an economy where jobs are looking for people,''
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said today on CNN. ``That means we need to
make sure that that supply (of capital) is there and there in every part of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
	   While many Republicans on Capitol Hill support the economic empowerment
agenda behind the new markets proposal, Clinton was unable to push the entire
package through Congress and is trying again this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the president's trying to do is inspire corporate America and
investors to take a second look in their own backyard,'' White House economic
adviser Gene Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed 25 percent tax credit would leverage $15 billion a year in
investment over five years, but cost the government just a third of that,
Sperling said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So this tax credit would now leverage $15 billion of equity investment in
lower income parts of America, both urban and rural,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
	   For much of the rest of the day, Clinton was participating in a separate
economic development project shepherded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jackson's
Wall Street Project is a 3-year-old effort to involve the titans of New York
City finance in minority business ventures.
</P>
<P>
	   The program, and a similar venture in Chicago, ``are set to partner major
venture capital partnerships in the country with minority vendors and minority
business, giving them better access to capital and strategies for economic
growth in the long term,'' said Barbara Proctor, media relations director for
Jackson's sponsoring Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   During a midday speech to the project's annual conference, Clinton is
expected to focus on the economic successes of his seven-year administration,
and his efforts to include everyone in America's current economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We ought to dedicate ourselves to bringing opportunity to the people and
places who have been left behind,'' Clinton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was attending a gala evening party honoring the project on the floor
of the New York Stock Exchange. The exchange is a co-sponsor of the Wall Street
Project, exchange spokesman Ray Pellecchia said.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the third year the exchange has opened its trading floor for the
party, although an ice storm canceled Clinton's scheduled visit last year,
Pellecchia said.
</P>
<P>
	   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton opened the Wall Street Project conference
on Wednesday. The three-day program also features address by four Clinton
administration Cabinet secretaries, top officials such as Sperling and Wall
Street leaders.

<HEADLINE> Cameras May Stop Red-Light Runners  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fewer drivers run red lights at intersections when
automatic cameras stand poised to snap photos of their license plates, the
government reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Using a camera enforcement program should reduce red-light running between
20 and 60 percent, the Federal Highway Administration said in a report presented
at a conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that technology is key to making our highways safer,'' said
Virginia Miller, spokeswoman for the highway administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The report comes at a time when crashes are on the rise, with the number of
fatal intersection collisions increasing by 16 percent between 1992 and 1998.
All other types of crashes have increased only 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   There wasn't enough data on the relatively new technology to show if cameras
also reduced the number of intersection crashes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drivers who ran red lights caused 89,000 crashes in 1998, inflicting 82,000
injuries and causing nearly 1,000 deaths, according to the Transportation
Department. In 1997, more than 1.8 million intersection crashes occurred --
including those caused by red-light running -- resulting in more than 1.2
million injuries and more than 7,800 deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You see more violations in rush hours when people are in a hurry,'' said
David M. Smith, a highway administration transportation specialist.
</P>
<P>
	   The new report presents the preliminary results of red-light camera programs
in three areas: Los Angeles County, Polk County, Fla., and Howard Country, Md.
All three received federal grants to test the technology.
</P>
<P>
	   In California, the cameras were used at crossings for a light rail line
running between Los Angeles and Long Beach. Between 1990 and 1997, there were
353 crashes between trains and cars, resulting in 33 deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   At the initial three crossings using cameras the number of drivers running
red lights dropped 92 percent, 78 percent and 34 percent, respectively, the
report said. Warning signs alerted drivers to the presence of the cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on the positive results, the county transit authority decided to
install the cameras at 17 rail crossings.
</P>
<P>
	   Cameras in most states take photos from the rear of the intersection, so the
driver can't be seen, but the California program also used a picture of the
driver's face for identification.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland's highly reflective license plates often hindered the camera's
effectiveness by creating too much glare for clear photos, but the test program
did reduce the overall number of red light violations at selected intersections
by 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   While not receiving federal funds, a New York City program started in 1993
resulted in a 38 percent decrease in violations at 18 monitored intersections,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors allege links between Canadian woman, Algerians  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) - Federal officials say cellular telephone records
link a woman arrested last month in Vermont to two Algerians suspected of trying
to smuggle explosives into the United States.
<P>
	   In court documents filed Wednesday, federal prosecutors for the first time
tied Canadian Lucia Garofalo with Algerians Abdel Ghani and Ahmed Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   Their arrests stirred fears of terrorist attacks over the holiday season.
Ressam had a one-night reservation at a motel near Seattle's Space Needle, which
was cited as one reason for the cancellation of the New Year's bash there.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Garofalo was arrested trying to cross the border at Beecher Falls, Vt.,
on Dec. 19. Five days earlier, Ressam was arrested in Washington state allegedly
trying to carry bomb materials into the United States. And on Dec. 30, Ghani was
arrested in New York City and accused of attempting to meet up with Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a close and concerning link between Ms. Garofalo and the
investigations that are under way in New York and Seattle," Assistant U.S.
Attorney Tristram Coffin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Ms. Garofalo, a 35-year-old mother of three, have disputed the
government's allegations and say they do not prove she was part of a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Magistrate Judge Jerome Niedermeier agreed to continue holding Ms. Garofalo
without bail until her trial on immigration violations, tentatively scheduled
for Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   The alleged telephone links are circuitous, prosecutors said. But they said
that was how the terrorist organization that Ghani and Ressam belonged to
operated. Previously, Ressam and Ghani have been linked to the Algerian Armed
Islamic Group, known by its French acronym GIA.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Kirby said there were a series of telephone
calls between people who have ties to Ressam and Ms. Garofalo last month around
the time of both their arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   "The timing of the link is remarkable in that it occurs during the December
period when the defendant and Ressam were committing their crimes," Kirby wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam, who was arrested at Port Angeles, Wash., has pleaded innocent to
five charges related to bomb-making. Ghani, 31, was charged with being Ressam's
accomplice.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, federal agents also have arrested a man identified as Rachid
Haouari, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said today. The New York
Times said Haouari was one of the three men first detained with Ghani after a
Dec. 30 Brooklyn raid. He is being held on immigration charges. It was not clear
whether Haouari was believed to have knowledge of a terrorist plot.
</P>
<P>
	   The individual common to most of the players was a man named Raja Aslam,
prosecutors said. A telephone number registered to Aslam allegedly was in Ms.
Garofalo's pocket when she was arrested. Aslam denied knowing her.
</P>
<P>
	   Aslam, a New York City taxi driver from Queens who has not been arrested or
charged in the case, said he was questioned by FBI officials on Tuesday about
his links to the three. "I have no links to these people," he said. "The FBI
wanted to know about if I knew about Abdel Ghani and Lucia Garofalo and Ressam.
They showed me pictures and checked my bank records."
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very upset," he said. "I don't like people who blow up buildings. I'm
here for a good life. I'm cooperating with the FBI like a good American."
</P>
<P>
	   Aslam, who is originally from Pakistan, acknowledged receiving phone calls
from a former roommate who was having problems entering Vermont from Canada the
same night as Garofalo. He also told New York's Daily News that he had loaned
his phone to an unidentified friend during the times it was used to call the
number connected to Ghani.
</P>
<P>
	   "Records show that on Dec. 14, 1999, the date Ressam tried to bring
explosives into the United States, Garofalo called this cell phone," according
to court records.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Garofalo's attorney, Maryanne Kampmann, said that did not prove Ms.
Garofalo was part of a conspiracy. She said Ms. Garofalo did not know who made
the call.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Garofalo told Kampmann that someone else had used her phone, although
Coffin said that did not explain the telephone number in Garofalo's pocket.
</P>
<P>
	   "It may be the gentleman who used the phone left the scrap of paper in her
car. We are talking one phone call. There is no other contact," Kampmann said.
</P>
<P>
	   Additional calls were placed from a number assigned to Aslam to one that
prosecutors said was assigned to Abdel Ghani and to the cell phone belonging to
an unidentified person.
</P>
<P>
	   "Records disclose that over the period Dec. 11 to 19, this latter (person)
called a number belonging to Abdel Ghani over 20 times, including six times on
Dec. 19, the day that Garofalo was arrested," Kirby wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Other telephone records showed contacts between a cell phone belonging to
Aslam to a cell phone "somewhere in Vermont during the early morning hours of
Dec. 15, 1999."
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors have alleged that Ms. Garofalo was turned back on that date when
she tried to cross the border at Pittsburg, N.H. They allege that she later
crossed the border successfully but illegally. On a third attempt, they said,
she was arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Another Algerian linked to Ghani was indicted Wednesday by a federal grand
jury in Seattle. Abdel Hakim Tizegha, 29, was charged with illegally re-entering
the United States and eluding border officers at the Canadian border at Blaine,
about 100 miles north of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Tizegha was arrested Dec. 24 and had been held without bond. No link has
been made in court between Tizegha and Ressam, but newspaper reports have said
Tizegha and Ghani are longtime friends.

<HEADLINE> Pregnant Women Warned of Risky Food  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was only when Mary Lenkersdorf saw hospital records
months later that she learned the cause of her miscarriage: A bacterium called
listeria had spread through her body to her baby.
</P>
<P>
	   So when the Florida woman got pregnant again, she wanted a list of
listeria-prone foods so she could avoid the risk. However, two doctors she
consulted couldn't tell her anything.
</P>
<P>
	   "They didn't know themselves what it was," said Lenkersdorf, who searched
the Internet to discover that the Brie and cold cuts she loved actually can be
high-risk foods during pregnancy. "They should know about this. ... It's a
preventible thing if you're informed."
</P>
<P>
	   A consumer advocacy group today began a campaign to let more women know
there are precautions they need to take during pregnancy to avoid foods that
could harm or even kill their developing baby.
</P>
<P>
	   This information "is widely known within public health circles, but it isn't
widely known by physicians who treat pregnant women, or the women," said
Caroline Smith deWaal of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which is
distributing free brochures explaining "Healthy Eating for Pregnant Moms."
</P>
<P>
	   At issue actually are two infections:
</P>
<P>
	   --Listeria is a bacterium that just causes flu-like symptoms in most healthy
people, although it can be serious in the young, old or weak.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's of special concern for pregnant women because the bacterium can
cause miscarriage or stillbirth even if the mother feels no symptoms.
</P>
<P>
	   Listeria is estimated to sicken 2,500 Americans a year and kill 500 of them,
and experts estimate one-third of those cases involve pregnant women and their
babies.
</P>
<P>
	   It is most often found in soft cheese like Brie or feta, unpasteurized milk
products, undercooked meat, poultry or seafood -- or even ready-to-eat products
like deli meats and hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
	   --Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection that can cause miscarriage or birth
defects. Many women may know not to clean a cat's litter box during pregnancy
because it is commonly carried by cats, but the parasite also can be found in
undercooked meat, mostly pork, or unwashed fruits and vegetables that came into
contact with contaminated soil, CSPI said.
</P>
<P>
	   There are no good statistics, but the advocacy group cited government
estimates that anywhere from 400 to 6,000 infants are born infected with
toxoplasmosis each year.
</P>
<P>
	   Among CSPI's recommendations for pregnant women:
</P>
<P>
	   --Do not eat products made from unpasteurized milk, and avoid soft cheeses
like Brie. (Hard cheeses, yogurt, cream cheese and cottage cheese are all safe.)
</P>
<P>
	   --Reheat ready-to-eat foods -- even cold cuts -- until they are steaming or
do not eat them. Cook meat and poultry until well-done.
</P>
<P>
	   --Wash your hands before preparing foods and after handling raw meats and
avoid using the same utensils on raw and cooked foods.
</P>
<P>
	   CSPI also is urging government regulators to force more food manufacturers
to test products for listeria before selling them. The call comes a year after
Michigan's Bil Mar meat plant had to recall 30 million pounds of hot dogs and
deli meats because of a listeria outbreak that sickened 100 people and killed
21.
</P>
<P>
	   Listeria actually is fairly rare, but the government is hunting new ways to
better prevent it because it is such a threat during pregnancy, said Food and
Drug Administration food safety chief Robert Buchanon. The good news is recalls
of listeria-tainted food are declining each year, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Kaye Wachsmith, an Agriculture Department food safety expert, said
CSPI's new brochure "will go a long way" to educating women on ways to prevent
listeria.
</P>
<P>
	   But as a result of the Bil Mar outbreak, Agricultural Department officials
have urged ready-to-eat food manufacturers to take better steps to detect and
prevent listeria, and "we certainly haven't rule out" new regulations, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher in early trading today as
technology shares bounced back from a two-day slump and the broader market
gained strength from a report of relatively modest inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 29.47 at 11,580.57.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 4.58 at 1,436.83, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 37.94 at
3,887.96.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose after the Labor Department said that while prices at the
wholesale level shot up 3 percent in 1999, the biggest increase in nine years,
most of the increase came from the volatile energy sector. Excluding energy,
wholesale prices rose just 0.9 percent last year, a more modest showing than in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For December, the Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures
before they reach the consumer, was up 0.3 percent, right on target with many
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports boosted investors' confidence that inflation is not escalating
quickly enough to merit sharp interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
The Fed raised interest rates three times in 1999 in an effort to keep inflation
at bay, and in recent sessions, stocks have been pressured by fears that another
series of rate hikes are ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits as
it becomes more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the interest rate debate, Apple Computer rose 7 3/16 to 94 3/4 after
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its rating on the stock to "outperform" from
"neutral." An analyst said Apple shares should reach 120 in a year.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trust soared 31 1/8 to 110 after agreeing to be acquired by Charles
Schwab for $2.7 billion, or about $129 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-8 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 126.20 million shares, behind Wednesday's
early pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.39 to 494.43.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.8 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's Xetra DAX index was up 2.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
up 0.05 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Study: Centralize all police functions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A proposed restructuring of the city's troubled
police department would centralize command, replenish top jobs lost to
retirement and attrition and put brass on night and weekend shifts.
<P>
	   City Manager Saundra Kee Borges on Wednesday released a national
consultant's report and her recommendations to Mayor Mike Peters and the City
Council. The report, prepared by Carroll Buracker &AMP; Associates, was ordered in
October.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, the department would be headed by a chief, two assistant
chiefs and five deputies who would oversee five bureaus: field services,
investigative services, special operations, professional standards and
operations support.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, due in part to retirements and attrition, the department has only
one assistant chief and no deputy chiefs. Acting Chief Deborah Barrows said she
would like to see a return to captains supervising each shift.
</P>
<P>
	   Barrows, a 25-year veteran of the troubled force, took the helm when Joseph
F. Croughwell Jr. went on medical leave in June.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't go on with an acting chief for another six months as we try to
make changes," Peters said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Peters said publicly that he believed it was time for
Croughwell to retire. Croughwell, who is scheduled for open-heart surgery in a
few days, said at the time that he planned to return to his job once his doctors
gave him approval.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also recommended reassessing the police service area model, which
keeps officers in neighborhood stations from responding to calls in other parts
of the city. Kee Borges said she supports the idea of retaining the service
areas as mini-stations while moving all police functions to the Jennings Road
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Recommendations include assigning a deputy chief to work evenings Tuesday
through Saturday and assigning specialized personnel to work Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also recommended increasing the number of "community policing"
officers from 13 to 21, while reducing the total size of the department from 482
sworn officers to 424.
</P>
<P>
	   Implementing the proposed changes would require federal grant money as well
as money from the city's general fund, Kee Borges said. But, she said, cutting
back on overtime by establishing a limit for each police division could help
recoup some of the general fund costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's largest municipal police force, the Hartford department has been
criticized for repeated incidents of alleged corruption and mismanagement. A
separate consultant's report in October called the $36 million-a-year department
"dysfunctional," saying it has too many officers doing too little work and
making too much in overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 20 Hartford police officers have been arrested in on- and off-duty
incidents in the last six years. That includes five officers who were indicted
by a federal grand jury in the spring for allegedly assaulting prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The fatal shooting of 14-year-old mugging suspect Aquan Salmon, who was
black, by a white officer also has strained the department's public image. A
prosecutor's report on the shooting is due in a few weeks.

<HEADLINE> USDA: Meat Labeling Could Cost  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department says there's no evidence
consumers are willing to pay more for meat to have it labeled with the country
of origin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To the contrary, if consumers do distinguish goods depending on their
country of origin, strong incentive exists for industries to act without
government intervention,'' according to a study that USDA issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Some American producers have been pushing Congress to require such labeling
as a way to curb imports of Canadian cattle. In addition to lobbying for
legislation, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association has been working with the
grocery industry to come up with a voluntary system for labeling meat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Beef from foreign companies is coming into the United States and
essentially being laundered and sold as U.S. beef, and that's just not right,''
said Julie Quick, a spokeswoman for the producers group.
</P>
<P>
	   The USDA study, which was requested by Congress after meat processors
defeated a labeling bill in 1998, said such a law could hurt U.S. meat exports
if foreign countries impose a similar requirement.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA did not put a price tag on a labeling system. The labels themselves
could cost anywhere from $500,000 to $8 million, depending on what cuts of meat
the law applied to.
</P>
<P>
	   Processors also would have to segregate meat that enters the country to make
sure it's labeled properly, and the cost of doing that ``is unknown, but could
be significant,'' the report said. There would be additional costs to USDA to
enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
	   Meatpackers claim that labeling meat could cost the industry $1 billion a
year. About 10 percent of the beef that Americans eat is imported.

<HEADLINE> Jail guards plead guilty to fatal beating of Nassau Jail inmate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) - Their job was to guard prisoners, but this
morning two Long Island corrections officers are spending their first full day
in a federal lockup after pleading guilty to fatally beating a recovering heroin
addict in his cell at the county jail.
<P>
	   The Jan. 8, 1999, beating was the most severe of more than 100 alleged cases
of abuse at the Nassau County jail in the last eight years and has led to an
ongoing investigation by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The guards, Patrick Regnier and Edward Velazquez, entered their guilty pleas
Wednesday before U.S. District Court Judge Jacob Mishler after a third guard cut
a deal last week, admitting that he served as the lookout during the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line here is they all pleaded guilty, really, to causing Thomas
Pizzuto's death and vindicated everything that this family has said about how it
happened," said attorney Barry Scheck, who represents the family in a civil
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Pizzuto, a 38-year-old recovering heroin addict, was crying out for his
methadone treatment at the time of his fatal beating. The Hicksville resident
was serving a 90-day sentence for traffic violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Three days after the beating, he suffered a seizure and died. The Nassau
County medical examiner determined Pizzuto suffered a ruptured spleen and ruled
the death a homicide.
</P>
<P>
	   Velazquez, under questioning from the judge, admitted that he went to
Pizzuto's cell "to quiet him down and use unreasonable force if necessary."
Regnier admitted to Mishler: "I did land on him with my knees. I did punch him
in the back."
</P>
<P>
	   The courtroom was packed for the guilty pleas, with Pizzuto's mother, widow
and wheelchair-bound father weeping quietly during the 70-minute session.
Outside, dozens of corrections officers stood quietly in support of their
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
	   "I cried," said Pizzuto's mother, Carol, at the sight of the officers'
supporters. "I walked up here today and I cried, because I couldn't believe this
is the world that we live in. That these people are backing up murderers ... to
my face. How could they do that?"
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the officers attempted to block photographers from taking pictures
of Velazquez and Regnier as they entered the courthouse. A cameraman from News12
Long Island filed a police complaint, saying someone knocked his camera off his
shoulder, causing injuries to his back, neck and shoulder. None of the
corrections officers wanted to speak with reporters outside the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount of prison time Velazquez and Regnier face at their April 7
sentencing will be determined by Mishler after a hearing on whether their
conduct amounted to murder or manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   A determination of murder could bring each guard up to life in prison, while
a manslaughter ruling would yield a sentence of between 3 1/2 and 12 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Pizzuto, tears streaming down her face, said she hopes they receive the
maximum.
</P>
<P>
	   "They plead for mercy, they showed my son no mercy," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense case suffered a major setback last week when a third guard
charged in the case, Ivano Bavaro, pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy and
witness tampering charges and agreed to testify.
</P>
<P>
	   Bavaro admitted he acted as a lookout while Velazquez and Regnier went into
Pizzuto's cell and pounded the inmate into silence.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial against a fourth guard, Joseph Bergen, accused of filing a false
report indicating that Pizzuto had slipped in the shower, is scheduled to start
next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The East Meadow jail, which houses about 1,800 inmates and is patrolled by
approximately 1,100 guards, has been the subject of numerous allegations of
guard misconduct. Following Pizzuto's death and other allegations of abuse, the
U.S. Attorney's office began an investigation to see whether a "pattern and
practice" of civil rights violations exists at the jail. That investigation
remains open.
</P>
<P>
	   Last March, a Nassau County corrections officer was found liable in the 1993
beating of a mentally retarded jail inmate with a frying pan. County officials
agreed to a $500,000 settlement in the inmate's civil rights lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   "The truth of the matter is that this has been going on for a long time in
the Nassau County Jail and everybody knows it," said Scheck. "There have been
civil suits that have been successfully brought against these guards and yet
nothing is done about it. And there's a code of silence and this code of silence
has to be broken."

<HEADLINE> Lion King Tops British Nominations  </HEADLINE>
    By MATT WOLF Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- "The Lion King," director Julie Taymor's stage adaptation of
the animated Disney film, garnered eight nominations Thursday for the Laurence
Olivier Awards, London's equivalent to Broadway's Tony Awards.
</P>
<P>
	   Matching that number was an English show as small as "The Lion King" is huge
-- "Spend, Spend, Spend," a musical biography of Englishwoman Viv Nicholson, who
hit it big in the 1960s by winning football pools and then lost it all.
</P>
<P>
	   The two shows are competing for best musical, director, musical actress,
choreography, sets and lighting.
</P>
<P>
	   The winners will be announced Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Rounding out the nominees for best musical are "Mamma Mia!," the
ABBA-inspired songfest that has been the season's surprise smash, and "Honk! The
Ugly Duckling," a new version of the popular children's tale by the British
songwriting team of George Stiles and Anthony Drewe.
</P>
<P>
	   American dramatists snared three of the slots for best new play -- Martin
Sherman for "Rose," Richard Nelson for "Goodnight Children Everywhere" and
Richard Greenberg for "Three Days of Rain." Scottish writer Liz Lochhead's
"Perfect Days" and veteran English playwright Alan Bennett's "The Lady In the
Van" -- the odds-on favorite -- completed the category.
</P>
<P>
	   Dame Maggie Smith, the inimitable lead of Bennett's funny and moving play,
is up for best actress against Janie Dee for "Comic Potential," Alison Steadman
for "The Memory of Water" and Jennifer Ehle for "The Real Thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Dillane, Ehle's co-star in the Tom Stoppard revival -- which
transfers to Broadway at the end of March -- leads a strong list of best actor
hopefuls: Henry Goodman in "The Merchant of Venice," Roger Allam in
"Summerfolk," Michael Sheen in "Look Back In Anger" and Antony Sher in "The
Winter's Tale."
</P>
<P>
	   Sheen is currently winning plaudits in New York in his Broadway stage debut,
as Mozart in "Amadeus."
</P>
<P>
	   Allam, in turn, received an additional Olivier citation for supporting actor
in the revival of the little-known Victorian comedy-drama "Money."
</P>
<P>
	   Surprising omissions included Olympia Dukakis, the lone performer in the
demanding "Rose," as well as Vanessa Redgrave and her brother Corin, who
appeared together on stage for the first time in a revival of Noel Coward's
"Song At Twilight."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Investment Incentives  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton is road-testing some ideas he will
highlight during his State of the Union address at the end of this month,
including a plan to sweeten the incentives for businesses to invest in some of
America's hard-luck rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton traveled to New York City today, where he will help launch a
small-business development center at predominantly Hispanic Boricua College in
Brooklyn, and describe his proposal to more than double a tax credit for
investment in what the Clinton administration calls ``new markets.''
</P>
<P>
	   The incentive program, which Clinton first unveiled last year, is supposed
to make investment in poor regions of this country as attractive as investment
in less-developed countries abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the time for these kinds of initiatives because for the first time
in many, many years we have an economy where jobs are looking for people,''
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said today on CNN. ``That means we need to
make sure that that supply (of capital) is there and there in every part of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
	   While many Republicans on Capitol Hill support the economic empowerment
agenda behind the new markets proposal, Clinton was unable to push the entire
package through Congress and is trying again this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the president's trying to do is inspire corporate America and
investors to take a second look in their own backyard,'' White House economic
adviser Gene Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed 25 percent tax credit would leverage $15 billion a year in
investment over five years, but cost the government just a third of that,
Sperling said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So this tax credit would now leverage $15 billion of equity investment in
lower income parts of America, both urban and rural,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike most commuters, President Clinton breezed into New York today as
police cleared the highways for his motorcade and tollbooth operators waved him
by without charge.
</P>
<P>
	   A light morning snow forced the president to abandon plans to helicopter
from his new home in Chappaqua to Manhattan for speaking appearances. About an
hour late, his 14-car motorcade took to the highway. Police blocked all traffic
except for the president's cars, causing large backups.
</P>
<P>
	   For much of the rest of the day, Clinton was participating in a separate
economic development project shepherded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jackson's
Wall Street Project is a 3-year-old effort to involve the titans of New York
City finance in minority business ventures.
</P>
<P>
	   The program, and a similar venture in Chicago, ``are set to partner major
venture capital partnerships in the country with minority vendors and minority
business, giving them better access to capital and strategies for economic
growth in the long term,'' said Barbara Proctor, media relations director for
Jackson's sponsoring Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   During a midday speech to the project's annual conference, Clinton is
expected to focus on the economic successes of his seven-year administration,
and his efforts to include everyone in America's current economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We ought to dedicate ourselves to bringing opportunity to the people and
places who have been left behind,'' Clinton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was attending a gala evening party honoring the project on the floor
of the New York Stock Exchange. The exchange is a co-sponsor of the Wall Street
Project, exchange spokesman Ray Pellecchia said.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the third year the exchange has opened its trading floor for the
party, although an ice storm canceled Clinton's scheduled visit last year,
Pellecchia said.
</P>
<P>
	   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton opened the Wall Street Project conference
on Wednesday. The three-day program also features address by four Clinton
administration Cabinet secretaries, top officials such as Sperling and Wall
Street leaders.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Weighs $25 Billion Debt Buyback  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has completed work on
regulations needed to start buying back a portion of the $5.76 trillion national
debt, an administration official said today. About $25 billion could be bought
back this year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Treasury
Department had completed a review of proposed rules it put out for public
comment in August and that Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers would publicly
release the rules later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The official said that while the figures were still being discussed, one
plan was to buy back about $25 billion in publicly held debt this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The debt buybacks would be the first since 1972. The government is in a
position to make the purchases because of the huge projected budget surpluses
over the next decade. The surpluses have been the subject of intense debate
between the administration and Congress involving such politically charged
issues as protecting Social Security and providing tax relief.
</P>
<P>
	   The total national debt is $5.76 trillion. Of that amount about $3.6
trillion is held by the public in the form of Treasury securities. This is the
portion that would be bought back. The rest of the debt, some $2 trillion, is
held by the government's large trust funds, most significantly the Social
Security trust fund.

<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 5.49 at 1,437.74, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 35.71 at
3,885.73.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose after the Labor Department said that while prices at the
wholesale level shot up 3 percent in 1999, the biggest increase in nine years,
most of the increase came from the volatile energy sector. Excluding energy,
wholesale prices rose just 0.9 percent last year, a more modest showing than in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For December, the Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures
before they reach the consumer, was up 0.3 percent, right on target with many
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports boosted investors' confidence that inflation is not escalating
quickly enough to merit sharp interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
The Fed raised interest rates three times in 1999 in an effort to keep inflation
at bay, and in recent sessions, stocks have been pressured by fears that another
series of rate hikes are ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits as
it becomes more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was fairly volatile as investors waited for more evidence on the
Fed's likely course. Tonight, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan will discuss
technology and the economy in a speech before the Economic Club of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   And on Friday, the government will report on price pressures at the retail
level when it releases its Consumer Price Index. Analysts expect the index to
have risen 0.3 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the interest rate debate, Apple Computer rose 7 3/16 to 94 3/4 after
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its rating on the stock to "outperform" from
"neutral." An analyst said Apple shares should reach 120 in a year.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trust soared 31 1/8 to 110 after agreeing to be acquired by Charles

<P>
	   Yahoo! edged back from a steep loss on Wednesday, rising 5/16 to 357 7/8.
Several Wall Street analysts issued positive comments about the stock, which

unsustainable.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Investment Incentives  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton is road-testing some ideas he will
highlight during his State of the Union address at the end of this month,
including a plan to sweeten the incentives for businesses to invest in some of
America's hard-luck rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton traveled to New York City today, where he will help launch a
small-business development center at predominantly Hispanic Boricua College in
Brooklyn, and describe his proposal to more than double a tax credit for
investment in what the Clinton administration calls ``new markets.''
</P>
<P>
	   The incentive program, which Clinton first unveiled last year, is supposed
to make investment in poor regions of this country as attractive as investment
in less-developed countries abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the time for these kinds of initiatives because for the first time
in many, many years we have an economy where jobs are looking for people,''
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said today on CNN. ``That means we need to
make sure that that supply (of capital) is there and there in every part of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
	   While many Republicans on Capitol Hill support the economic empowerment
agenda behind the new markets proposal, Clinton was unable to push the entire
package through Congress and is trying again this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the president's trying to do is inspire corporate America and
investors to take a second look in their own backyard,'' White House economic
adviser Gene Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed 25 percent tax credit would leverage $15 billion a year in
investment over five years, but cost the government just a third of that,
Sperling said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So this tax credit would now leverage $15 billion of equity investment in
lower income parts of America, both urban and rural,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike most commuters, President Clinton breezed into New York today as
police cleared the highways for his motorcade and tollbooth operators waved him
by without charge.
</P>
<P>
	   A light morning snow forced the president to abandon plans to helicopter
from his new home in Chappaqua to Manhattan for speaking appearances. About an
hour late, his 14-car motorcade took to the highway. Police blocked all traffic
except for the president's cars, causing large backups.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House said Clinton's departure had been delayed by a telephone
call with Syrian President Hafez Assad about the status of the Syrian-Israeli
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   The two leaders talked at length, White House deputy press secretary Jake
Siewert said, about ``the status, and how we can make progress when the next
round commences.''
</P>
<P>
	   The talks, which began in Sheperdstown, W.Va., and recessed on Monday, are
to resume Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   For much of the rest of the day, Clinton was participating in a separate
economic development project shepherded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jackson's
Wall Street Project is a 3-year-old effort to involve the titans of New York
City finance in minority business ventures.
</P>
<P>
	   The program, and a similar venture in Chicago, ``are set to partner major
venture capital partnerships in the country with minority vendors and minority
business, giving them better access to capital and strategies for economic
growth in the long term,'' said Barbara Proctor, media relations director for
Jackson's sponsoring Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   During a midday speech to the project's annual conference, Clinton is
expected to focus on the economic successes of his seven-year administration,
and his efforts to include everyone in America's current economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We ought to dedicate ourselves to bringing opportunity to the people and
places who have been left behind,'' Clinton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was attending a gala evening party honoring the project on the floor
of the New York Stock Exchange. The exchange is a co-sponsor of the Wall Street
Project, exchange spokesman Ray Pellecchia said.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the third year the exchange has opened its trading floor for the
party, although an ice storm canceled Clinton's scheduled visit last year,
Pellecchia said.
</P>
<P>
	   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton opened the Wall Street Project conference
on Wednesday. The three-day program also features address by four Clinton
administration Cabinet secretaries, top officials such as Sperling and Wall
Street leaders.

<HEADLINE> Koch Industries Fined for Pollution  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency today slapped Koch
Industries with $35 million in fines and penalties as part of a settlement over
alleged contamination of lakes and streams in six states from Missouri to Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Based in Wichita, Kan., the company operates more than 35,000 miles of
pipeline in the United States and Canada, and has refineries in Texas and
Minnesota through its Koch Petroleum Group subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement, announced by the EPA and Justice Department, stems from
allegations that the company had more than 300 oil spills from its pipelines and
other oil operations, resulting in 3 million gallons of crude oil pouring into
lakes and streams in violation of the Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The spills polluted waterways in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Alabama, Louisiana
and Missouri, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today's landmark fine against Koch Industries for egregious violations of
the Clean Water Act sends a strong message that those who try to profit by
polluting our environment pay a price,'' said EPA Administrator Carol Browner.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch Industries officials in Wichita did not immediately return telephone
calls.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Weighs $25B Debt Buyback  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to the new era of budget surpluses, the
Clinton administration today announced rules that will allow the government to
buy back up to $30 billion of the national debt this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, in announcing the new procedures, said
the goal was to save taxpayers' money on interest payments while making sure the
huge Treasury securities market does not lose any of its appeal for investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government has already posted back-to-back budget surpluses for
the first time since Dwight Eisenhower was president. Current projections show
the $3.6 trillion total debt held by the public could be eliminated over the
next 15 years if surpluses currently projected materialize.
</P>
<P>
	   But economists have cautioned that such surpluses will be contingent on a
host of factors that can't be known at the present time. These include how well
the economy performs and how well the White House and Congress can resist the
temptation to use a portion of the projected surpluses to boost spending or cut
taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan Summers announced today will have the debt buybacks conducted in a
``reverse auction'' process in which holders of government securities who want
to sell their bonds back to the government will be given the chance to bid on
what price they would accept.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers said this process will ensure that the government will not pay more
than the going market price for the securities.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement of final rules for the procedure followed an August release
of preliminary rules, which were modified after Treasury reviewed public
comments.
</P>
<P>
	   The debt buybacks would be the first since 1972. The government is in a
position to make the purchases because of the huge projected budget surpluses
over the next decade. The surpluses have been the subject of intense debate
between the administration and Congress involving such politically charged
issues as protecting Social Security and providing tax relief.
</P>
<P>
	   The total national debt is $5.76 trillion. Of that amount about $3.6
trillion is held by the public in the form of Treasury securities. This is the
portion that would be bought back. The rest of the debt, some $2 trillion, is
held by the government's large trust funds, most significantly the Social
Security trust fund.

<HEADLINE> Twice As Many Americans By 2100  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America will be a bit older and much more diverse a
century from now, and there will be twice as many of us.
</P>
<P>
	   New population projections from the Census Bureau today call for the
population to jump from the current 275 million to 571 million in 2100, with a
median age rising above 40 and larger proportions of minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   An older America could mean profound social and economic changes, such as an
increased demand for nursing home care, prescription drugs, and greater demands
on the country's Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even though childbearing levels in the United States remain quite close to
the level needed only to replace the population, the increasing number of
potential parents and continued migration from abroad would be sufficient to add
nearly 300 million people during the next century,'' said Census Bureau analyst
Frederick W. Hollmann.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because the Hispanic and Asian and Pacific Islander populations in the
U.S. are younger than the nation as a whole and because they continue to receive
international migrants, these populations will become increasingly prominent,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Census projection calls for the nation's population to probably reach
300 million in 2011, 400 million in 2049 and 500 million in 2081.
</P>
<P>
	   By comparison, the U.S. population was 5.3 million in 1800 and 75.9 million
in 1900. The United Nations projects the world's population to rise from the
current 6 billion to about 9.4 billion in 2100.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, the Baby Boom generation creates a bulge in the U.S. population
at ages 35 to 39 and 40 to 44, the only two segments making up more than 8
percent of the total. And today's population includes just 65,000 people aged
100 and over, 0.02 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
	   By 2100 the over-100 crowd is expected to grow to 5.3 million, 0.9 percent
of the total, and no five-year age group will even reach 7 percent of all
Americans. The largest age group is expected to be those aged 15 to 19, at 6.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The projections show an especially rapid surge in the elderly population as
the surviving baby boomers pass age 65. In the year 2011, baby boomers -- those
born between 1946 and 1964 -- will begin turning 65.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 2011 and 2030, the number of elderly would rise from 40.4 million,
13 percent of the population, to 70.3 million, 20 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
	   The median age in 2100 is expected to be 40.3, compared to the current 35.8.
Median means half of all Americans will be older than that and half younger.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hispanic population is expected to triple from 31.4 million in 1999 to
98.2 million in 2050. Hispanics could become the nation's largest minority group
with their percentage rising from 12 percent in 1999 to 24 percent in 2050.
</P>
<P>
	   The Asian and Pacific Islander population, meanwhile, would more than
triple, from 10.9 million in 1999 to 37.6 million in 2050. Its percentage of the
total population would rise from 4 percent now to 9 percent in 2050.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the projections, the non-Hispanic White and African American
populations would increase more slowly than the other groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The non-Hispanic White population would rise from 196.1 million in 1999 to
213.0 million in 2050, a 9 percent increase. Its share of the total population
would decline, however, from 72 percent in 1999 to 53 percent in 2050.
</P>
<P>
	   The black population would rise from 34.9 million in 1999 to 59.2 million in
2050, a 70-percent increase; under this projection, the black share of the total
population would increase slightly, from 13 percent to 15 percent.
</P>

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher today as technology shares
recovered from a two-day slump and the broader market gained strength from a
report of relatively modest inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
12.33 at 11,563.43.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also slightly higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 4.24 at 1,436.49, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 19.61
at 3,869.63.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose after the Labor Department said that while prices at the
wholesale level shot up 3 percent in 1999, the biggest increase in nine years,
most of the increase came from the volatile energy sector. Excluding energy,
wholesale prices rose just 0.9 percent last year, a more modest showing than in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For December, the Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures
before they reach the consumer, was up 0.3 percent, right on target with many
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports boosted investors' confidence that inflation is not escalating
quickly enough to merit sharp interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits as it
becomes more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed raised interest rates three times in 1999 in an effort to keep
inflation at bay, and in recent sessions, stocks have been pressured by fears
that another series of rate hikes are ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's report eased some of those fears, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Fed is not behind the curve on inflation," said David Orr, chief
economist at First Union Securities Inc. While most analysts remain convinced
that the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points, or a quarter percentage point,
at its next meeting on Feb. 1 and 2, today's report suggested the Fed won't
increase rates beyond that amount, Orr said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was fairly volatile as investors waited for more evidence on the
Fed's likely course. Tonight, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan will discuss
technology and the economy in a speech before the Economic Club of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   And on Friday, the government will report on price pressures at the retail
level when it releases its Consumer Price Index. Analysts expect the index to
have risen 0.3 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the interest rate debate, Apple Computer rose 7 3/16 to 94 3/4 after
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its rating on the stock to "outperform" from
"neutral." An analyst said Apple shares should reach 120 in a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Computer maker Dell rose 1 1/8 to 42 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trust soared 39 7/8 to 118 3/4 after agreeing to be acquired by Charles
Schwab for $2.7 billion, or about $129 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Yahoo!, which rose in early trading, slumped for a second straight session
and was down 14 9/16 at 343. Several Wall Street analysts issued positive
comments about the stock, which tumbled after company officials warned that
Yahoo!'s spectacular growth rate is unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-8 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 441.11 million shares, behind Wednesday's
early pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.77 to 493.81.

<HEADLINE> Koch Industries Fined for Pollution  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency today slapped Koch
Industries with $35 million in fines and penalties as part of a settlement over
alleged contamination of lakes and streams in six states from Missouri to Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Based in Wichita, Kan., the company operates more than 35,000 miles of
pipeline in the United States and Canada, and has refineries in Texas and
Minnesota through its Koch Petroleum Group subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement, announced by the EPA and Justice Department, stems from
allegations that the company had more than 300 oil spills from its pipelines and
other oil operations, resulting in 3 million gallons of crude oil pouring into
lakes and streams in violation of the Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The spills polluted waterways in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Alabama, Louisiana
and Missouri, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today's landmark fine against Koch Industries for egregious violations of
the Clean Water Act sends a strong message that those who try to profit by
polluting our environment pay a price,'' said EPA Administrator Carol Browner.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch Pipeline Co. said in a statement that pipeline leaks had been reduced
by 90 percent since 1990 and when leaks occur the company is committed ``to
clean them up quickly and completely.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that the settlement is fair and reasonable and will avoid even
more years of litigation,'' Pat McCann, Koch Pipeline senior vice president,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The $30 million in fines and a commitment to make $5 million in
environmental restitution represents the largest civil penalty ever levied
against a single company in connection with violation of an environmental law,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The much larger fines against Exxon for the 1989 tanker disaster in Alaska
involved criminal penalties.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil spills cited by the EPA in its case against Koch stretched across
the company's pipeline system. It included a case in which 221,000 gallons of
oil spilled near Payne, Okla., contaminating Keystone Lake, a popular recreation
area 25 miles away.
</P>
<P>
	   In another case, the public water supply system near Wichita, Kan., was
polluted by a spill from one of the company's pipelines, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The spills that dumped 3 million gallons of oil into waterways occurred over
a seven-year period from 1990 to 1997, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
	   On its Internet Web page, Koch Industries touts its environmental record,
saying it has spent $980 million for environmental protection at refineries and
other facilities since 1990. It claims to have reduced pipeline leaks by more
than 90 percent over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, which employs 13,000 people worldwide in businesses ranging
from oil refining and chemical production to cattle ranching, has had its share
of turmoil over the years, much of it stemming from a 20-year feud among the
three Koch brothers who once shared in operating the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month a federal jury in Oklahoma found Koch Industries had cheated the
government on oil purchases, a ruling that could end up costing the company as
much as $214 million in penalties and claims, depending on appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit that led to that ruling accused the company of filing 31,000
false claims on oil from federal and Indian-held leases. The jury found that the
company had inflated the amount of oil it was taking by adjusting measurements
in its favor. In the 1980s, a Senate subcommittee investigated the company's
oil-measuring policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch argued in its defense that the yearly oil overages were less than 1
percent and were designed to make up for oil shrinkage and sediment in tanks.
Ironically, the charges stemmed from a whistle-blower lawsuit filed by Bill
Koch, against his family's company.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Koch claimed in an unsuccessful court action last year that his
brothers cheated him of $1 billion when he sold his stake in Koch Industries in
1983. He lost the case.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Investment Incentives  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investment in America's hard-luck urban and rural areas
makes bottom-line economic sense, since it represents an easy way to expand the
economy without increasing inflation, President Clinton declared today.
</P>
<P>
	   Road-testing some ideas he will highlight during his State of the Union
address at the end of this month, Clinton made a dollars-and-cents pitch for his
proposal to more than double a tax credit for investment in what the Clinton
administration calls ``new markets.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``How do you keep it going?'' Clinton said of America's current economic
boom. ``You have to find new markets, create new businesses in places where they
didn't exist before.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president spoke at Boricua College in Brooklyn, a predominantly Hispanic
community college, where he helped launch a small-business development center
that will deliver business counseling, training and other help for minority
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
	   Every American should be supporting this,'' Clinton said, not only because
it is ``morally right'' to help those left out of expanding economic prosperity,
but because ``it is in our self-interest as a nation, if we want to keep this
astonishing economic revival going.''
</P>
<P>
	   A tax incentive program, which Clinton first unveiled last year, is supposed
to make investment in poor regions of this country as attractive as investment
in less-developed countries abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the time for these kinds of initiatives because for the first time
in many, many years we have an economy where jobs are looking for people,''
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said today on CNN. ``That means we need to
make sure that that supply (of capital) is there and there in every part of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
	   While many Republicans on Capitol Hill support the economic empowerment
agenda behind the new markets proposal, Clinton was unable to push the entire
package through Congress and is trying again this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the president's trying to do is inspire corporate America and
investors to take a second look in their own backyard,'' White House economic
adviser Gene Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed 25 percent tax credit would leverage $15 billion a year in
investment over five years, but cost the government just a third of that,
Sperling said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So this tax credit would now leverage $15 billion of equity investment in
lower income parts of America, both urban and rural,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike most commuters, President Clinton breezed into New York today as
police cleared the highways for his motorcade and tollbooth operators waved him
by without charge.
</P>
<P>
	   A light morning snow forced the president to abandon plans to helicopter
from his new home in Chappaqua to Manhattan for speaking appearances. About an
hour late, his 14-car motorcade took to the highway. Police blocked all traffic
except for the president's cars, causing large backups.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House said Clinton's departure had been delayed by a telephone
call with Syrian President Hafez Assad about the status of the Syrian-Israeli
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   The two leaders talked at length, White House deputy press secretary Jake
Siewert said, about ``the status, and how we can make progress when the next
round commences.''
</P>
<P>
	   The talks, which began in Sheperdstown, W.Va., and recessed on Monday, are
to resume Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   For much of the rest of the day, Clinton was participating in a separate
economic development project shepherded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jackson's
Wall Street Project is a 3-year-old effort to involve the titans of New York
City finance in minority business ventures.
</P>
<P>
	   The program, and a similar venture in Chicago, ``are set to partner major
venture capital partnerships in the country with minority vendors and minority
business, giving them better access to capital and strategies for economic
growth in the long term,'' said Barbara Proctor, media relations director for
Jackson's sponsoring Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.

<HEADLINE> Warner-Lambert reverses course, begins talks to merge with Pfizer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Warner-Lambert Co. today said it would hold merger talks
with Pfizer Inc, reversing its November decision to be acquired by American Home
Products.
<P>
	   Either combination would create the world's largest drugmaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors had pressured Warner-Lambert executives to re-evaluate its
decision to unite with Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products, especially in
light of the rising value of Pfizer's offer. Pfizer made a bid for
Warner-Lambert on Nov. 4, just hours after American Home and Warner-Lambert
announced plans to combine.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer's offer is now worth about $77 billion. American Home's bid is valued
at about $57 billion. The difference between the offers has widened in recent
weeks due to Pfizer's rising stock price and American Home's falling stock
price.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Warner-Lambert rose 68 3/4 cents to $82.50 in afternoon trading on
the New York Stock Exchange, where Pfizer rose 75 cents to $35.87 1/2 and
American Home rose $2.25 to $44.43 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert, the fastest growing major drugmaker, is the world's
15th-largest prescription drug company. The Morris Plains N.J.-based company
makes the blockbuster cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, which it co-markets
with Pfizer and which is expected to have $3.3 billion in sales this year and
upwards of $6 billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement this morning, Warner-Lambert's board said that "in light of
changing circumstances" it had concluded Pfizer's offer "is better financially
for Warner-Lambert shareholders than the proposed merger with American Home
Products."
</P>
<P>
	   Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, chairman, president and chief executive officer of
Warner-Lambert, said talks would be held with Pfizer. Warner-Lambert said it
could not guarantee that an agreement could be reached with Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear how much Warner-Lambert would have to pay American Home if
Warner-Lambert walks away from its deal. The American Home-Warner-Lambert deal
called for either company to pay the other $2 billion if it wanted to walk away
from the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
	   If American Home Products is rejected, it would be its third failed merger
attempt in less than two years. In 1998, negotiations broke down with Monsanto
Co. and SmithKline Beecham PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle for Warner-Lambert has escalated into some nasty exchanges
between the companies' top officials and several lawsuits have been filed.
Warner-Lambert has even sought to terminate Pfizer's rights to co-market and
share profits from Lipitor.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the cases has yet to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer, which was preparing a hostile takeover of Warner-Lambert, said today
it was pleased with Warner-Lambert's move.
</P>
<P>
	   "We look forward to an expeditious completion of the transaction combining
the two fastest-growing companies in our industry and creating the best
pharmaceutical company in the world," Pfizer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home officials did not immediately respond for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert has hired Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. and Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. to act
as its financial advisers in dealing with Pfizer.

<HEADLINE> APA panel moves to expand wilderness; full-agency vote next  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) - Little Tupper Lake and the surrounding forest
should be declared wilderness, a committee of the Adirondack Park Agency has
recommended.
<P>
	   The Adirondack Park Agency's State Land Committee voted unanimously
Wednesday to recommend that Little Tupper Lake and 14,700 acres of surrounding
land known as the William C. Whitney tract be designated as wilderness, the most
restrictive land use designation. Under the wilderness designation, the land
would essentially remain untouched, and motorized vehicles would be prohibited.
The land is open to the public and canoes will be allowed on Little Tupper Lake.
</P>
<P>
	   The Adirondack Park Agency was expected to vote on the recommendation
Friday. Gov. George Pataki will then be called upon to give final approval.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the tract is Little Tupper Lake, a shallow, pristine lake
with 20 miles of shoreline, surrounded by small mountains and forests of beech,
maple, birch and scattered pine trees.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is a unique piece of property for a wilderness classification
in that you can literally drive right up to it," said committee member William
Kissel, adding that the area is readily accessible to the disabled.
</P>
<P>
	   Little Tupper Lake provides one of the best canoeing lakes in the United
States, according to Greg Caito, the Department of Economic Development's
representative to the APA.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the only place in the United States where you can drop a canoe in
on the shore and paddle into the middle of the wilderness in seven minutes,"
said Caito.
</P>
<P>
	   The APA regulates development and preservation of the 6 million-acre state
park, which is a mixture of public and privately owned land.
</P>
<P>
	   The land was purchased by the state from Whitney Industries on May 29, 1998,
for $17.1 million and has been managed by the state Department of Environmental
Conservation as a wilderness area, pending the final decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchase renewed a debate over land use in the Adirondacks with
environmental groups calling for the wilderness designation as local officials
argue the limitations will deprive their communities of a badly needed economic
boost. The latter group argues for a "wild forest" classification that would
open the lands to motorized vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Local businessmen say the mountains that attract throngs of vacationers from
around the country every summer don't provide many year-round jobs. Unemployment
has been traditionally high in the area, and businessmen blame much of it on the
myriad state environmental regulations governing development.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists argued that the land should be protected for future
generations.
</P>
<P>
	   The APA received more than 1,200 letters from the public since August, said
James C. Frenette, chairman of the APA land committee.
</P>
<P>
	   In related action, the committee recommended a state administrative
designation for the 80-acre DEC property, where its Little Tupper Lake
headquarters building is situated. The property provides the only public access
to the lake. After a lengthy discussion, the committee recommended that 4,000
acres of land adjacent to the Whitney tract be designated wilderness. The area
includes Lake Lila and is south and west of the Whitney tract, sharing a
one-mile border.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel hesitated to recommend a wilderness designation for the entire
Lake Lila tract, which totals 7,215 acres, until the status of a historic - but
abandoned - two-story house connected to the railroad is determined.
</P>
<P>
	   In other action, the committee recommended:
</P>
<P>
	   - A 23,000-acre parcel known as the Watson's East/Lassiter tract be
classified part wilderness and part wild forest. A wild-forest designation
allows for uses such as temporary hunting camps and, in certain cases,
snowmobiles and bicycles.
</P>
<P>
	   - The reclassification of the 2,000-acre Alice Brook tract from wilderness
to wild forest.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the wilderness designation, the land must remain essentially
untouched, and motorized vehicles are prohibited. The land is open to the
public, and canoes will be allowed on Little Tupper Lake.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmental groups complained about the committee's recommended "wild
forest" classifications of parts of the Watson's East tract and the Alice Brook
tract. They urged the Adirondack Park Agency to reject the "wild forest"
classifications.
</P>
<P>
	   "Are we protecting public lands and wildlife habitat from development just
so they can be torn to shreds by motorized traffic?" asked Timothy Burke,
executive director of the Adirondack Council.

<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Hartford police officer accused of stealing
license plates and using his badge to escape arrest has been suspended from the
city force.
<P>
	   Officer Greg Thompson, of West Hartford, was charged Wednesday with four
counts of misdemeanor larceny, criminal trespass, breach of peace and
interfering with police.
</P>
<P>
	   The larceny charges carry an automatic suspension without pay until the case
is disposed of in court. If convicted, Thompson would be fired. He has been a
police officer for two years.

<P>
	   Thompson is the third Hartford officer in a month to face charges. One
officer was forced to resign amid allegations he fraudulently obtained a
driver's license, and the other was fired over charges that he beat two
prisoners in the city lockup.
</P>
<P>
	   Thompson turned himself in at the same time Hartford officials were holding
a news conference to recommend a proposed restructuring of the troubled police
department. The report, which recommends centralizing command, replenishing top
jobs lost to retirement and attrition and putting brass on night and weekend
shifts, follows another consultant's report that described the department as
"dysfunctional."
</P>
<P>
	   The state's largest municipal police force, the Hartford department has been
criticized for repeated incidents of alleged corruption and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 20 Hartford police officers have been arrested in on- and off-duty
incidents in the last six years. That includes five officers who were indicted
by a federal grand jury in the spring for allegedly assaulting prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest case, police say Thompson used license plates stolen from two
cars that had been involved in crashes in Hartford, an emissions sticker taken
from a car belonging to one of his neighbors and a registration sticker reported
stolen from a fourth vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court documents, Thompson put the stolen plates and stickers on
his 1995 Mitsubishi and drove it. He was stopped several times in West Hartford
for driving an unregistered car, but was not arrested. In one instance, he
flashed his badge and sped away, leaving the officer with the impression he was
working undercover, West Hartford police officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other occasions, officers gave him a break after Thompson identified
himself as a Hartford police officer, according to arrest documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Thompson declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> State dismisses harassment complaint against Hartford mayor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The state Commission on Human Rights and
Opportunities dismissed a sexual harassment complaint against Hartford Mayor
Michael Peters, saying a former city employee's allegations were too vague and
may have come too late.
<P>
	   Andrea Buglione-Corbett, a former council aide, claimed she had been the
target of "constant sexual harassment" while employed as an aide from September
1996 through January 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Buglione-Corbett, 36, said Peters passed around pornographic magazines in
his office and made inappropriate jokes and comments in her presence. She also
accused Peters of placing his hand on her thigh during a June 1998 office
get-together.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission, whose proceedings are confidential, closed the case on Dec.
30 after finding that the allegations were "overly vague, nonspecific and - for
the most part - untimely."
</P>
<P>
	   Peters could not be reached for comment. A message was left at his office
Thursday, but a member of his staff said he was out of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Buglione-Corbett's lawyer, Lee Kennedy Tiernan, said the decision merely
clears the way for her client to include a charge of sexual harassment in a
civil lawsuit she has filed against Peters, former Councilman Steven D. Park and
the city of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
	   State law generally requires that any complaints of sexual harassment go
first to the commission, said Philip A. Murphy Jr., the CHRO's general counsel.
Only after the commission investigates or dismisses a case can the charge be
considered in a civil lawsuit, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the lawsuit, Buglione-Corbett claims she was unfairly fired in January
1998. Park accused her of incompetence and told her to leave her job, but she
was asked to return a month later when he failed to drum up enough City Council
votes to fire her.
</P>
<P>
	   She did not return, citing a stressful work environment, and was dropped
from the payroll May 3.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit also accuses Park of asking Buglione-Corbett to baby-sit his
children and to perform personal business on city time. Park denies the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   It remains unclear whether Buglione-Corbett will pursue the sexual
harassment allegation in her civil suit. Her lawyers have consistently
emphasized other parts of her complaint.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're the ones making a big deal about it," Tiernan said. "The really
relevant issue is that they tried to remove my client from her job for no
reason."
</P>
<P>
	   Hartford Corporation Counsel Kevin G. Dubay said the city expects a similar
victory in the civil case.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe her civil action has every bit as much merit as her CHRO
complaint," he said.

<HEADLINE> 'City of Angels' Set for CBS Start  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In "City of Angels," attractive doctors wrangle over
power, tryst in dark hospital corners and labor valiantly to save lives. All the
elements of an "ER"-style, contemporary medical drama are in the new CBS series
-- with a twist.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a black thing," two bemused African American physicians inform a white
doctor in one scene after he misdiagnosis a common black skin ailment as
life-threatening. So, it would seem, is "City of Angels" -- a bold effort to put
minority characters center stage.
</P>
<P>
	   The staff is mostly black, and so are the patients at Angel of Mercy
Hospital, an inner-city Los Angeles hospital run on a shoestring by the county.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair Underwood ("L.A. Law") stars as the acting chief of surgery, Vivica A.
Fox (the movies "Independence Day," "Soul Food") portrays the new director
brought in to resuscitate the failing hospital and Michael Warren ("Hill Street
Blues") is a smarmy executive.
</P>
<P>
	   Black writers and directors are key members of the production, including
co-executive producer and co-creator Paris Barclay. A piercing gospel number,
from composer Mike Post, trumpets the drama's opening credits.
</P>
<P>
	   But while "City of Angels" mines ethnicity as a rich, freshly approached
source of drama, it also transcends it. The cast is attractive, the characters
are compelling, the stories sharply written -- all the elements that give a
program universal appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   At a time when broadcasters are under fire for underrepresenting minorities,
the show is a badge of honor for CBS, which began developing it with producer
Steven Bochco ("L.A. Law," "NYPD Blue") before the NAACP and others protested a
fall slate of mostly white shows.
</P>
<P>
	   It's inevitable that "City of Angels" will be seen as a test of the TV
audience's openness to diversity that could influence future efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   The handful of critically acclaimed dramas that have focused on black
characters failed to draw viewers. These included the family saga "Under One
Roof," which starred James Earl Jones, and the award-winning civil rights-era
series "I'll Fly Away," with Sam Waterston and Regina Taylor.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS has made a 13-episode commitment to "City of Angels," and is on the
record as saying its ratings expectations are modest.
</P>
<P>
	   The cast and producers of "City of Angels," which debuts 8 p.m. EST Sunday
and moves to its regular 8 p.m. Wednesday time slot Jan. 18, know even that
standard is a challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of the reasons I think that shows haven't worked in the past is because
they've been too specific to the black experience every minute of every hour,"
Underwood said when the series was announced. "And I love those shows. I relate
to them. But I think it helps to marginalize ourselves if we're looking to a
broader audience."
</P>
<P>
	   In a recent interview, Bochco suggested image may be as important as
content.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right or wrong, people tended to perceive those shows about being black in
America," Bochco said. "People didn't want to sort of be taken to school. I'm
not saying that's what they were doing, but it could have been the perception of
those shows.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want to be a compelling hospital melodrama. It is about black characters
and I don't think you can completely eliminate that as one of the elements that
gives the show a somewhat different sense or sensibility."
</P>
<P>
	   There are other aspects that distinguish it from "ER" or "Chicago Hope." The
machinations that swirl around a county facility are on prominent display, with
Robert Morse playing a politico who is a dubious friend to the beleaguered
hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The kind of outrageous humor featured in other Bochco series is here as
well; there are misplaced patients and a couple whose sexual hijinx go awry. One
over-the-top sequence that opens the show, however, has been toned down.
</P>
<P>
	   The scene, which sets the stage for the firing of the hospital's
administrator and hiring of Dr. Lillian Price (Fox), shows the drunken
administrator (Garrett Morris) snapping a photo of himself with a dead celebrity
in a bit that almost looks like a "Saturday Night Live" skit. A shot of Morris
ogling the nude corpse was edited out.
</P>
<P>
	   Bochco acknowledged the sequence drew mixed reactions when he previewed it
for friends, some of whom criticized it as stereotypical. Just how carefully
will this series have to tread?
</P>
<P>
	   "The truth is, I can't do this show the way I want to do this show if I'm
worrying about whose toes I'm stepping on," he said. "I don't think you can put
out a product for a mass audience that isn't going to offend somebody.
</P>
<P>
	   "But for me, this show flies its colors quickly and with a big heart. ...
The fact of the matter is the show is overwhelmingly populated by wonderful,
competent, caring black professionals who are heroic in the face of enormously
difficult odds."
</P>
<P>
	   The show's timing is a double-edged sword for Bochco: The show gains
visibility because of the diversity debate but risks being perceived as dogma
rather than drama.
</P>
<P>
	   "What I have to hope is that people will watch a couple of these episodes,
that the first is good enough to make them want to watch the second," he said.
"I think by the end of the second one, I've got 'em."

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwab, which owns the nation's largest discount and online brokerage, is
buying U.S. Trust for $2.7 billion in stock, or about $129 per share. U.S. Trust
provides investment management services primarily for wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it expects fiscal third-quarter earnings between 58 cents a
share and 64 cents a share, below analysts' forecasts of 73 cents a share.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch lowered their ratings on the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   The parent company of United Airlines said it expects to earn between $7 and
$9 per share in the coming year. Analysts had estimated UAL would earn $9.82 a
share. The company cited rising fuel and labor costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The boutique investment bank said it expects to report net income of 18
cents to 21 cents a share for the fourth quarter. Analysts had anticipated a
loss of 2 cents per share. Friedman Billings Ramsey officials cited strength in
its venture capital business.
</P>
<P>
	   The company could be forced to break into three parts to dilute its
competitive advantage, according to sources close to the government's antitrust
trial. A breakup would dismantle the software empire built by Bill Gates.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Electronic Tax Credit Proposed  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress this year to create a
tax credit of up to $10 for people who file federal income taxes electronically.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said today that Clinton will include in
his fiscal 2001 budget request to Congress next month a $10 tax credit for
taxpayers filing online and a $5 credit for people who file over the telephone
using the IRS' Telefile.
</P>
<P>
	   The credit, Summers said, ``will provide an incentive for filing online and
reward individual taxpayers'' while simultaneously helping the IRS become more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the reasons millions of people cite in continuing to file tax returns
on paper is the fee that often accompanies electronic filing compared with the
low cost of a 33-cent postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1998 Internal Revenue Service reform law set a goal of 80 percent e-filing
by 2007, but right now only about one in four tax returns reach the IRS that
way. About 29 million taxpayers filed returns electronically last year, a 19
percent increase over the year before but far from a pace that would reach the
80 percent goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest IRS projection is for about half of all returns to be filed
electronically by 2007.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax credit would add a concrete incentive for more people to e-file
their taxes, adding to current advantages that include greater accuracy, swifter
refunds and a specific IRS confirmation that a taxpayer's return was received.
</P>
<P>
	   Manufacturers of tax preparation software often sell versions that provide
free electronic filing, sometimes through a rebate. Some software makers also
are offering taxpayers Internet sites where they can prepare tax returns and
ship them directly to the IRS, sometimes for free.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier today, IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti told a conference on
modernizing the tax agency that improved technology -- including more electronic
filing -- is critical to improving the IRS's ability to respond to taxpayer
problems and questions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our purpose is not to move some imaginary pendulum back or forth a few
degrees,'' Rossotti said. ``Our purpose is to improve the entire way the IRS
works.''
</P>
<P>
	   As part of its modernization effort, the IRS is remaking its structure into
four major operating divisions: one each for individual taxpayers, large
businesses, small businesses and tax-exempt organizations. The new structure is
expected to be in place by October.
</P>
<P>
	   John Dalrymple, who will head the new Wage and Investment Division that
includes the vast majority of taxpayers, said the IRS hopes within five years to
be able to communicate directly with taxpayers via secure e-mail. That would
allow completely paperless filing with PIN numbers in place of physical
signatures and provide tax refunds within two days, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to position ourselves to make full use of the Internet,''
Dalrymple said.

<HEADLINE> Joel Steinberg denied parole again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Joel Steinberg, serving a prison sentence for the
highly-publicized 1987 beating death of his adopted daughter Lisa, has been
denied parole again.
<P>
	   A statement from the Division of Parole Thursday said the nature of
Steinberg's crime and his failure to quickly seek medical help for Lisa were
main factors in denial of parole.
</P>
<P>
	   "During your interview with this panel you minimized your responsibility and
role in this criminal behavior, only acknowledging that you should have sought
medical help sooner," according to the parole decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Parole officials credited Steinberg, 58, for taking part in prison programs
and counseling, but said those factors were outweighed by the "severity of your
criminal behavior and limited signs of remorse."
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the former Manhattan lawyer underwent his third parole hearing
at Southport state prison near Elmira, where he is serving 8 1/3 to 25 years for
first-degree manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Steinberg was found unconscious in Steinberg's Greenwich Village
apartment and died later at a nearby hospital. The 6-year-old girl's death - and
the jarring appearance at his trial of his companion Hedda Nussbaum due to
beatings by Steinberg - focused national attention on domestic abuse and review
procedures for prospective adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Transcripts of Tuesday's parole hearing will not be released for several
weeks. Steinberg told a parole panel in 1998 that he never abused Lisa and had a
"loving relationship" with her.
</P>
<P>
	   Steinberg has been denied parole twice before, in January 1996 and January
1998. But a state Supreme Court justice in November 1999 threw out the results
of the 1998 hearing, citing concerns that the board in that case may have been
unduly influenced by public opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing this week, for legal purposes, is considered his second hearing.
Under a legal quirk related to that, even though the board determined Steinberg
is not eligible for a parole hearing again for two years, that two-year "hold"
is retroactive to January 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Steinberg is scheduled to appear again before the parole board early next
month.

<HEADLINE> IBP Sued on Environmental Charges  </HEADLINE>
   By JESSICA FARGEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- The federal government has sued the meatpacker IBP Inc.,
accusing it of polluting the air and water surrounding its Dakota City plant.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court on behalf of the
Environmental Protection Agency, seeks fines up to $241 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The complaint alleges the plant violated federal clean air and water laws
and hazardous waste management regulations at its slaughter and tannery
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   IBP's six uncovered waste lagoons at the site emitted largely uncontrolled
amounts of hydrogen sulfide into the air, and the company discharged ammonia
into the Missouri River in quantities toxic to aquatic life, the Justice
Department said in the complaint.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department is asking the court to order IBP to cover or close
its waste lagoons, capture emissions from uncontrolled sources, install
additional treatment for its discharges to the Missouri River, and take other
steps to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This case presents a pattern of activity for which the common thread is
IBP's avoidance of environmental regulation,'' U.S. District Attorney Tom
Monaghan said.
</P>
<P>
	   IBP officials rebutted the charges, said the suit will benefit no one and
will delay further its planned $13 million in improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have been trying to do the right thing, but aren't being given the
green light,'' said Gary Mickelson, spokesman for IBP at its headquarters in
Dakota Dunes, S.D.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dakota City plant employs about 4,000 people. IBP is the world's largest
producer of fresh beef, pork and related products.
</P>
<P>
	   IBP planned to break ground this spring on environmental improvements
including construction of three covered wastewater lagoons and installation of
equipment to clean air released from the tannery, Mickelson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in the project is money to expand tannery production by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian McManus, state Department of Environmental Quality spokesman, said the
department supports IBP's lagoon project, but needs more information to issue
permits for the tannery expansion. IBP has consistently presented the two
projects together, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They can move forward with lagoon improvements right away,'' McManus said.
``It's been their choice to link the two.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson said the two projects are intertwined and can't be proposed
separately.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department wants the court to order IBP to cover or close its
waste lagoons, capture emissions from uncontrolled sources, install additional
treatment for its discharges to the Missouri River, and take other steps to
protect the environment.

<HEADLINE> The First Couple Commutes  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- On their first day as real New York commuters on Thursday,
President Clinton left home in the suburbs and headed off to work with help from
a phalanx of police, while his wife enjoyed the morning paper's favorable review
of her Letterman debut.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons are feeling their way in the uncharted territory of a commuter
White House, with the president making drop-by visits to the family's new home
in the tony New York suburb of Chappaqua. Hillary Rodham Clinton is living there
pretty much full-time now, using the handsome, $1.7 million house as home base
for her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The First Commuters left home in the morning for what are now two very
different jobs. The president, who is road-testing some themes for his final
State of the Union address later this month, had a barrage of economic incentive
ideas to discuss during stops in Brooklyn and Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   There were also a party on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, a
swank, $5,000-a-couple Democratic fund-raising reception and a few opportunities
for the modern helpmate husband to boost his wife's nascent political career.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I always like to come to New York and give my wife a plug,'' Clinton joked
during a morning appearance at a Brooklyn community college.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton campaigned nearby on Long Island and basked in good press after
Wednesday's star turn on the Manhattan-based Late Show with David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
	   Of course the Clintons are not exactly straphangers. Clinton was supposed to
whisk from Westchester County to Brooklyn by helicopter, but bad weather forced
him to drive in a 14-car, heavily protected motorcade. Police blocked all
traffic as the president passed, causing large backups, and the toll booth
operators waved him by without charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton travels lighter, but still with the Secret Service.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Number of black, Hispanic men with AIDS passes whites for  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTA (AP) - For the first time since AIDS captured the nation's
attention in the early 1980s, more black and Hispanic gay men are living with
the disease than are white gay men.
<P>
	   New York City had the highest number of both black and white gay men with
AIDS in 1998, while the Los Angeles-Long Beach, Calif., metro area had the most
cases of Hispanic gay men with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday that
minorities represent 52 percent of 18,153 gay and bisexual men who were
diagnosed with AIDS in 1998. By contrast, minorities represented 31 percent in
1989.
</P>
<P>
	   Black men made up one-third of the cases, while Hispanics represented 18
percent. Asian and Pacific Islanders made up 1 percent of the cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers at the CDC said the report suggests that the stigma of
homosexuality plays a role in spreading the disease among minority groups.
Blacks and Hispanics are less likely than whites to identify themselves as gay
or seek AIDS prevention and treatment services, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly, all the evidence suggests that it's harder to be a gay man of
color in this society than it is to be a white gay man," said Dr. Helene Gayle,
director of the CDC's national center for prevention of HIV, sexually
transmitted diseases and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
	   The report found that many black and Hispanic men who have sex with men do
not identify themselves as gay.
</P>
<P>
	   In a survey of 8,780 HIV-infected men who had sex with other men,
researchers asked, "Do you think of yourself as: heterosexual, homosexual,
bisexual or other?" Nearly one quarter - 24 percent - of black men and 18
percent of Hispanics considered themselves heterosexual. Only 6 percent of white
men in the survey identified themselves as heterosexual.
</P>
<P>
	   Gayle said trends identified several years ago led researchers to project
that the number of nonwhite gay men with AIDS would surpass whites, but the
increase happened faster than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   "The tendency to equate gay and white has persisted," she said. "People have
totally ignored the consistent fact that gay men of color have always been the
largest single risk category for men ... and this issue is never talked about."
</P>
<P>
	   The report found that 85 percent of the black and Hispanic gay men with AIDS
lived in metropolitan areas with populations more than 500,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews for the report, done as part of a CDC HIV-AIDS surveillance
project, were conducted in Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida,
Georgia, Los Angeles County, New Jersey, New Mexico, Michigan, South Carolina
and Washington state.

<HEADLINE> Last temporary sales tax exemption begins Saturday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) - Rudnick's main street storefront has been front
row for dancing in the streets at the end of World War II, for industrial
America's heyday when 40,000 people worked downtown and for New York's
post-industrial decline.
<P>
	   But it hasn't seen anything like knocking $2.10 cents in sales tax off a $30
shirt.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's amazing how many people come down that week," said Linda Tolokonsky,
owner of the time-frozen clothing shop which has been in her family since 1909.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a chaotic week," she said. "It's very, very busy."
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning Saturday, the state once again will eliminate sales tax on
clothing and shoes for a week. The taxes return on Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Retailers are poised for a rush of business that rivals Christmas and
back-to-school sales during what have traditionally been lull periods.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty cities and 58 of 62 counties will also drop their local sales taxes
for the state's seventh tax-free week, resulting in a 7 percent to 8 percent tax
break to move winter inventories and prompt the cashing in of holiday gift
certificates.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax-free weeks on the sale of clothing and shoes up to $500 per item are
aimed at jump-starting retail sales and keeping New Yorkers home to shop instead
of at malls strategically placed just over the state lines in Massachusetts, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have seen many of our customers go to Lee, Mass.," Tolokonsky said. "Now
they stay in the state of New York to spend."
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, about seven miles from the New York line, is home to a new complex of
factory outlet stores.
</P>
<P>
	   Tolokonsky's son works across the border at a popular shoe and boot outlet
in Vermont and she said, "Our tax-free weeks have a devastating effect on them."
</P>
<P>
	   The tax-free week is estimated by proponents as saving consumers $25 million
or more.
</P>
<P>
	   Marc Carey of the state Department of Taxation and Finance emphasized that
the sales tax break applies only to clothing and footwear - what he called
necessities - rather than luxury items.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. Thomas Libous, R-Binghamton, represents one of the border areas
where business operators have long sought an end to the sales tax. After 12
years in office, the idea that he said wasn't thought possible by most during
his initial campaign has flourished in Broome County along the Pennsylvania
border.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 1988, the Southern Tier was losing business to Pennsylvania because of
our sales tax," Libous said. "So the sales tax became a hot issue. The merchants
are really excited about it."
</P>
<P>
	   The state will permanently drop its 4 percent tax beginning March 1 for
clothing and shoes costing less than $110. Business operators said that makes
this last temporary tax-free week the last shot at a break on items that cost up
to $500.
</P>
<P>
	   Most counties and cities, however, won't follow the state's lead and
permanently give up the local sales taxes on March 1. Most argue that they
simply can't afford to do without the millions in revenue their portion of the
sales tax provides them with.
</P>
<P>
	   They include rural Schoharie County, which depends on sales tax revenue to
avoid higher property taxes and Orange County, which relies on growing sales tax
revenue thanks to huge malls like the Galleria Mall in Wallkill and the Woodbury
Common factory outlet mall in Monroe.
</P>
<P>
	   But lopping off the sales tax is more than a matter of dollars and cents.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a symbolic value," said Matthew Maguire of the state Business
Council. "Historically, New York state taxation was above and beyond other
states. Now you're telling the world we're trying to do something about that.
And that has a value."
</P>
<P>
	   Ashley Lounsbury of the Retail Council of New York State said previous
tax-free weeks have been "incredibly successful."
</P>
<P>
	   Counties not participating in the tax-free week are Nassau, Putnam and
Columbia. Westchester County will not charge a local sales tax except the cities
of Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, White Plains and Yonkers. The city of Rome in
Oneida County will charge a local sales tax.

<HEADLINE> Warner-Lambert reverses course, begins talks to merge with Pfizer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Warner-Lambert Co. today said it would hold merger talks
with hostile suitor Pfizer Inc, walking away from its November decision to be
acquired by American Home Products.
<P>
	   Either combination would create the world's largest drugmaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors had pressured Warner-Lambert executives to re-evaluate its
decision to unite with Madison, N.J-based American Home Products, especially in
light of the rising value of Pfizer's offer. Pfizer made a bid for
Warner-Lambert on Nov. 4, just hours after American Home and Warner-Lambert
announced plans to combine.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer's offer is now worth about $77 billion. American Home's bid is valued
at about $57 billion. The difference between the offers has widened in recent
weeks due to Pfizer's rising stock price and American Home's falling stock
price.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Warner-Lambert rose $4.43 3/4 cents to $91.25 in afternoon trading
on the New York Stock Exchange after Warner Lambert's announcement. Pfizer rose
$1.12 1/2 cents to $36.25 and American Home rose $1.62 1/2 to $43.81 1/4, also
on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert, the fastest growing major drugmaker, is the world's
15th-largest prescription drug company. The Morris Plains N.J.-based company
makes the blockbuster cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, which it co-markets
with Pfizer and which is expected to have $3.3 billion in sales this year and
upwards of $6 billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement this morning, Warner-Lambert's board said that "in light of
changing circumstances" it had concluded Pfizer's offer "is better financially
for Warner-Lambert shareholders than the proposed merger with American Home
Products."
</P>
<P>
	   Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, chairman, president and chief executive officer of
Warner-Lambert, said talks would be held with Pfizer. Warner-Lambert said it
could not guarantee that an agreement could be reached with Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was inevitable," said Hemant Shah, a drug analyst with HKS&AMP; Co. in
Warren, N.J. He said Warner-Lambert had to reverse course because the gap
between Pfizer's offer and American Home's offer had expanded to nearly $20
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Warner-Lambert had concerns about American Home's liability associated
with the fen-phen diet drug cocktail, which has resurfaced as a financial
concern because of lawsuits in Mississippi and other states seeking damages for
thousands of people who claim injury. Those claims are jeopardizing a national
settlement earlier negotiated by American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear how much Warner-Lambert would have to pay American Home if
Warner-Lambert walks away from its deal. The American Home-Warner-Lambert deal
called for either company to pay the other $2 billion if it wanted to walk away
from the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
	   If American Home Products is rejected, it would be its third failed merger
attempt in less than two years. In 1998, negotiations broke down with Monsanto
Co. and SmithKline Beecham PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle for Warner-Lambert has escalated into some nasty exchanges
between the companies' top officials and several lawsuits have been filed.
Warner-Lambert has even sought to terminate Pfizer's rights to co-market and
share profits from Lipitor.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the cases has yet to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer, which was preparing a hostile takeover of Warner-Lambert, said today
it was pleased with Warner-Lambert's move.
</P>
<P>
	   "We look forward to an expeditious completion of the transaction combining
the two fastest-growing companies in our industry and creating the best
pharmaceutical company in the world," Pfizer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home officials did not immediately respond for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert has hired Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. and Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. to act
as its financial advisers in dealing with Pfizer.

<HEADLINE> Koch Industries Fined for Pollution  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency today slapped Koch
Industries with $35 million in fines and penalties as part of a settlement over
alleged contamination of lakes and streams in six states from Missouri to Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Based in Wichita, Kan., the company operates more than 35,000 miles of
pipeline in the United States and Canada, and has refineries in Texas and
Minnesota through its Koch Petroleum Group subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement, announced by the EPA and Justice Department, stems from
allegations that the company had more than 300 oil spills from its pipelines and
other oil operations, resulting in 3 million gallons of crude oil pouring into
lakes and streams in violation of the Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The spills polluted waterways in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Alabama, Louisiana
and Missouri, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today's landmark fine against Koch Industries for egregious violations of
the Clean Water Act sends a strong message that those who try to profit by
polluting our environment pay a price,'' said EPA Administrator Carol Browner.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch Pipeline Co. said in a statement that pipeline leaks had been reduced
by 90 percent since 1990 and when leaks occur the company is committed ``to
clean them up quickly and completely.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that the settlement is fair and reasonable and will avoid even
more years of litigation,'' Pat McCann, Koch Pipeline senior vice president,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The $30 million in fines and a commitment to make $5 million in
environmental restitution are the largest civil penalty ever levied against a
single company under the Clean Water Act, Browner said. Previously the largest
was a $12.6 million fine against Smithfield Foods Inc., for dumping hog wastes
into Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Much larger settlements, including those involving the 1989 Exxon tanker
disaster in Alaska and last year's $150 million settlement with General Electric
Co., over toxic chemical pollution of a river in Massachusetts, included cleanup
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   While not facing specific cleanup costs, Koch under the settlement must
assess the condition of 2,500 miles of pipeline and repair any defects, and
begin an improved leak-detection program. Most of the spills were caused by
pipeline corrosion and the government alleged the corrosion could have been
prevented with property maintenance and operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil spills cited by the EPA in its case against Loch stretched across
the company's pipeline system but were concentrated in Oklahoma, Texas and
Kansas. It included a case in which 221,000 gallons of oil spilled near Payne
County, Okla., contaminating Keystone Lake, a popular recreation area 25 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
	   In another case, the public water supply system near Wichita, Kan., was
polluted by a spill from one of the company's pipelines, officials said. And in
a third, 100,000 gallons of spilled oil caused a 12-mile slick on Nueces and
Corpus Christ bays in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The spills that dumped 3 million gallons of oil into waterways occurred over
a seven-year period from 1990 to 1997, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
	   On its Internet Web page, Koch Industries touts its environmental record,
saying it has spent $980 million for environmental protection at refineries and
other facilities since 1990. It claims to have reduced pipeline leaks by more
than 90 percent over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, which employs 13,000 people worldwide in businesses ranging
from oil refining and chemical production to cattle ranching, has had its share
of turmoil over the years, much of it stemming from a 20-year feud among the
three Koch brothers who once shared in operating the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month a federal jury in Oklahoma found Koch Industries had cheated the
government on oil purchases, a ruling that could end up costing the company as
much as $214 million in penalties and claims, depending on appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit that led to that ruling accused the company of filing 31,000
false claims on oil from federal and Indian-held leases. The jury found that the
company had inflated the amount of oil it was taking by adjusting measurements
in its favor. In the 1980s, a Senate subcommittee investigated the company's
oil-measuring policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch argued in its defense that the yearly oil overages were less than 1
percent and were designed to make up for oil shrinkage and sediment in tanks.
Ironically, the charges stemmed from a whistle-blower lawsuit filed by Bill
Koch, against his family's company.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Koch claimed in an unsuccessful court action last year that his
brothers cheated him of $1 billion when he sold his stake in Koch Industries in
1983. He lost the case.

<HEADLINE> State treasurer will present Legislature with reform proposals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The Connecticut General Assembly will be asked to
consider at least 11 proposals from the treasurer's office to reform the way
state employee pension funds are invested in wake of last year's scandal
involving former Treasurer Paul Silvester.
<P>
	   Denise L. Nappier, Silvester's successor, said her ideas include requiring
mandatory disclosure of finders fees paid to third-party agents by investment
firms and their subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
	   Silvester has pleaded guilty to money laundering and racketeering charges.
He has admitted accepting kickbacks from intermediaries who received finders
fees from private firms for helping set up investment deals with the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "In my view, these proposals are not merely a response to a scandal,"
Nappier said this week said after clearing her plans with the state Investment
Advisory Council. "They represent an attempt to turn a scandal into an
opportunity by using the public focus on pension fund management to make
meaningful, constructive changes."
</P>
<P>
	   Nappier said her reforms would impose professional standards on investment
firms' marketing agents and, thereby, exclude well-connected political
intermediaries from influence-peddling.
</P>
<P>
	   Among her other ideas:
</P>
<P>
	   -Prohibiting treasurers from directing the payment of fees, as Silvester has
been accused of.
</P>
<P>
	   -Extending the current prohibition on campaign contributions by those doing
business with the treasurer's office. Now, such vendors cannot contribute to
campaigns for treasurer, but Nappier wants the ban extended to all statewide
candidates. Although Silvester, a Republican appointed by Gov. John G. Rowland,
could not raise money for his own campaign from financial firms he did business
with, he helped raise more than $100,000 for the governor.
</P>
<P>
	   -Requiring a special election, not a gubernatorial appointment, when a
treasurer quits, as Silvester's predecessor did in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   House Republican leader Robert M. Ward of North Branford called Nappier's
proposals "a weak reform package that does little more than maintain the status
quo."
</P>
<P>
	   He said they leave a "huge loophole which fails to end the unsavory practice
of finder's fees paid to people simply by arranging meetings with the
treasurer."

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher today as technology shares
recovered from a two-day slump and the broader market gained strength from a
report of relatively modest inflation. Investors remained fairly cautious in the
hours ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
48.63 at 11,599.73.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also slightly higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 10.68 at 1,442.93, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 33.11
at 3,883.13.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose after the Labor Department said that while prices at the
wholesale level shot up 3 percent in 1999, the biggest increase in nine years,
most of the increase came from the volatile energy sector. Excluding energy,
wholesale prices rose just 0.9 percent last year, a more modest showing than in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For December, the Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures
before they reach the consumer, was up 0.3 percent, right on target with many
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports boosted investors' confidence that inflation is not escalating
quickly enough to merit sharp interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits as it
becomes more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed raised interest rates three times in 1999 in an effort to keep
inflation at bay, and in recent sessions, stocks have been pressured by fears
that another series of rate hikes are ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's report eased some of those fears, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Fed is not behind the curve on inflation," said David Orr, chief
economist at First Union Securities Inc. While most analysts remain convinced
that the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points, or a quarter percentage point,
at its next meeting on Feb. 1 and 2, today's report suggested the Fed won't
increase rates beyond that amount, Orr said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was fairly volatile as investors waited for more evidence on the
Fed's likely course. Tonight, Greenspan was discussing technology and the
economy in a speech before the Economic Club of New York. Greenspan has
occasionally used his public speeches as an occasion to telegraph the Fed's
sentiment about the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   And Friday, the government will report on price pressures at the retail
level when it releases its Consumer Price Index. Analysts expect the index to
have risen 0.3 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the interest rate debate, Apple Computer rose 9 3/16 to 96 3/8 after
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its rating on the stock to "outperform" from
"neutral." An analyst said Apple shares should reach 120 in a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Computer maker Dell rose 1 1/16 to 42 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trust soared 45 1/2 to 124 3/8 after agreeing to be acquired by Charles
Schwab for $2.7 billion, or about $129 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   The pharmaceutical sector drew investors as Warner-Lambert said it would
hold merger talks with hostile suitor Pfizer, abandoning its November decision
to be acquired by American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading, Warner-Lambert was up 5 3/16 to 92, Pfizer was up 1
5/16 to 36 7/16 and American Home Products was up 1 to 43 3/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-8 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 673.90 million shares, ahead of Wednesday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.58 to 496.62.

<HEADLINE> Long-awaited first snowfall of the season blankets New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A strangely snowless landscape was finally swathed
in white on Thursday as the long-overdue first snowstorm of winter swept across
upstate New York, bringing bitter cold and wind in its wake.
<P>
	   Dozens of schools were closed or delayed and morning commuters faced a
white-knuckle drive on highways slickened by fast-falling snow. By noon, there
was as much as 10 inches of snow on the ground in parts of eastern New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had a bunch of minor accidents and vehicles off the road needing a
tow," said Sheriff John Bates in Schoharie County, about 25 miles west of
Albany. "It's the usual stuff you get with the first snow. The only difference
is, it usually happens long before January."
</P>
<P>
	   Before tapering off to flurries, the storm was expected to dump six to 10
inches of snow on a region that so far has had an unusually snowless winter.
Albany has had the least snowy winter in 50 years, with only 1.6 inches before
Thursday's storm.
</P>
<P>
	   In Seneca and Tompkins counties in central New York, authorities declared
snow emergencies and told drivers to stay off the roads. In Baldwinsville, north
of Syracuse, a car spun off a snow-packed road and crashed into a house, but
police said nobody was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Wind gusts of up to 35 mph compounded driving difficulties and produced
bone-penetrating windchills as low as minus 25 degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew we were going to pay for all that nice warm weather we had," said
Karl Madsen of the Syracuse suburb of Liverpool as he trudged to lunch, battling
the blowing snow that kept him from looking up.
</P>
<P>
	   Syracuse, reputed to be America's snowiest big city, was 30 inches below its
normal snowfall before Thursday's storm moved in.
</P>
<P>
	   "My fear is it's going to catch up all at once," said Madsen.
</P>
<P>
	   Slick conditions slowed traffic to below 30 mph on the Adirondack Northway
and other major arterials around Albany. AAA Hudson Valley had received 85
reports of cars off the road or other trouble by 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is the first significant accumulation of the year, so people tend to
forget how to drive under these conditions," said George Zeller, manager of
member services for AAA Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
	   In Rochester, Alan Whitcomb, a self-employed businessman, stomped his feet
in a 16-degree chill while waiting for a bus Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've gotten spoiled here for the last couple of weeks," he said, tucking
his chin into his coat as snow whipped down Main Street. "This is just getting
back to normal. If you want to live in Rochester, you really can't complain."
</P>
<P>
	   The National Weather Service said eight to 10 inches of snow fell in Wyoming
and Livingston counties in western New York, south of Rochester and southeast of
Buffalo. Police reported numerous minor accidents, including two jack-knifed
tractor-trailers on the Thruway near Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   Bitterly cold weather was expected Thursday night and Friday, with
temperatures plummeting into the single digits or below zero, according to the
National Weather Service. Blustery winds were expected to drive the windchill
temperature as low as 40 below zero in some places.
</P>
<P>
	   The heaviest snow fell in a band across the central section of eastern New
York, including Albany and westward through the Mohawk Valley.
</P>
<P>
	   While the snow bedeviled commuters, it delighted some people.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the first time my little girl has seen snow," said Christine
Carpenter of the Albany suburb of Altamont, who bundled up her 20-month-old
daughter and 4-year-old son to play in fresh powder. "She's not quite sure what
to make of it."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is good weather for us," said Sean Golden, manager of Robinson Ace
Hardware. The store in the Albany suburb of Guilderland has for months kept a
full complement of snow shovels, blowers, brushes and rock salt. But Golden has
seen few buyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden said he was preparing for customers to make a run on winter supplies
on their way home from work Thursday. "Because we haven't had any snow, not too
many people think ahead," he said. "Then when it snows, people start stocking
up."
</P>
<P>
	   In Lake Placid, in the heart of the Adirondacks, there was three to five
inches of snow on the ground on Thursday. Greg Fisher, marketing manager at the
Whiteface Mountain ski center, said he wasn't worried about the season's scant
snowfall. Whiteface has a 16 to 34-inch base, and conditions were excellent for
mechanical snowmaking with temperatures dropping to zero and below.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every winter is different," Fisher said. "Winter's a long season that
doesn't end sometimes until June. We're just getting started."

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Sean "Puffy" Combs has hired two top lawyers -- Johnnie
Cochran and Benjamin Brafman -- to help him beat charges of fleeing a nightclub
shooting with an illegal weapon, newspapers report.
</P>
<P>
	   Cochran, O.J. Simpson's ex-lawyer, and Brafman, who defended Mob killer
Salvatore "Sammy the Bull" Gravano, reportedly joins Harvey Slovis on the

<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- Super Bowl fans won't get an early listen of Madonna's
"American Pie" after all.
</P>
<P>
	   The pop star canceled plans to perform in the pregame show, saying she was
too busy, according to her manager. She had announced last week that she would
debut her new single, a rendition of Don McLean's classic "American Pie."
</P>
<P>
	   "We agreed that due to her recording schedule there is simply not sufficient
time to put all the elements in place that are required to deliver a performance
on the level of Super Bowl excellence," manager Caresse Norman said in a
statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Madonna was quoted as saying: "I am sorry that I will not be able to join
all the great entertainers who will be performing Super Bowl Sunday. My sincere
apologies to the NFL, ABC-TV, as well as my fans. I look forward to the
possibility of doing something with the NFL in the future."
</P>
<P>
	   The Super Bowl will be played in Atlanta on Jan. 30.

<HEADLINE> Consultants' bill: $108,000 to help SUNY 'find' King  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - It apparently cost about $27,000 per block to find
the State University of New York's new chancellor.
<P>
	   That's what a Los Angeles consulting firm wants - $108,667 in all - for
helping SUNY run a national search to find its new chancellor, documents
obtained by The Associated Press show.
</P>
<P>
	   That search ended with last month's hiring of former Pataki state Budget
Director Robert King, who worked four blocks away from SUNY's central
administration building the entire time.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a payment to management firm Korn/Ferry International makes no sense,
especially when SUNY already is having money problems, Assembly Majority Leader
Michael Bragman of Onondaga County said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all know that Bob King has always had the inside track for this job and
such a huge payment to an outside consultant is outrageous," Bragman said. "As
far as I know ... I think there was only one other candidate besides Bob King. I
question if a national search was necessary to identify a candidate from within
our state government who works just a few blocks away."
</P>
<P>
	   The SUNY system is controlled by Gov. George Pataki through his appointments
to the SUNY Board of Trustees.
</P>
<P>
	   A trustees' search committee unanimously recommended King - a former
prosecutor, colleague of Pataki's in the Legislature and bureaucrat in Pataki's
administration - to be chancellor over Stanley Koplick, chancellor of the
Massachusetts state university system.
</P>
<P>
	   Koplick died Jan. 3, two days after King officially started as SUNY
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   King's hiring in December culminated a long search which began in January
1999 when former SUNY Chancellor John Ryan said he wanted to retire. Korn/Ferry
was hired in July.
</P>
<P>
	   SUNY spokesman Jon Sorensen said King was not preordained to be chancellor
because of his relationship with the Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
	   "He went through the process like everyone else," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sorensen also said Korn/Ferry deserves its money.
</P>
<P>
	   "They put together quite a long roster of people, many of whom were
interviewed and explored," he said. "They presented a list of traditional and
nontraditional candidates and it's wrong to accuse these people of not working
hard because they did. They earned their money with a lot of time and the result
of this search turned out well."
</P>
<P>
	   Sorensen said six candidates were interviewed for the chancellor's job.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the complaints by Bragman, a Democrat,
about the Korn/Ferry search is "just partisan politics."
</P>
<P>
	   Korn/Ferry hasn't been paid yet because state Comptroller H. Carl McCall has
yet to approve the firm's contract with SUNY.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have the contract, it's under review and we have questions we have asked
the state university," McCall spokesman Dennis Tompkins said. "We have some
procedural and some substantive questions."
</P>
<P>
	   Tompkins would not say what questions the comptroller, who is also a
Democrat, has about the contract. SUNY cannot pay Korn/Ferry until the
comptroller approves the contract.
</P>
<P>
	   A call to Korn/Ferry's offices in New York City was not immediately returned
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers like Bragman said they know what questions they would like to ask
to SUNY.
</P>
<P>
	   The university system's teaching hospitals have to transfer $116 million of
its state government funds to the SUNY system every year because of a
legislative mandate. However, it is unlikely the hospitals will be able to come
up with the money this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The teaching hospitals in Stony Brook, Syracuse and Brooklyn were only able
to transfer $39 million last year and had to borrow the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Democrats have complained about the university system hiring
high-priced consultants while it has this money problem. For example, SUNY is
paying nationally-recognized health care consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers
$1.1 million to investigate SUNY's teaching hospital finances and recommend ways
to make the hospitals fiscally viable again.
</P>
<P>
	   However, that report is not due until February, a month after Pataki has
submitted his state budget to the Legislature. Therefore, Pataki and King did
not offer any suggestions on how to end the hospitals' fiscal crisis during the
executive budget message, Bragman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just appears to me that it's a continuing pattern of fiscal
irresponsibility," Bragman said.

<HEADLINE> Schwab To Acquire U.S. Trust Corp.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Charles Schwab Corp., which owns the nation's largest
discount and online brokerage, is buying an investment firm that caters to the
rich for $2.7 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwab said today it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire U.S. Trust
Corp. in a bid to create a business serving investors "at every stage of their
financial growth." On the news, shares of U.S. Trust shot up 61 percent by this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company would have annual revenue of $4.5 billion and earnings
of $663 million and about $800 billion in assets under management.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've long held a goal of building an organization that can serve investors
completely -- from those taking their first steps towards becoming lifelong
investors, to those looking to manage their accumulated wealth for themselves
and their families," said Charles R. Schwab, the chairman, co-chief executive
and founder of the company that bears his name. "U.S. Trust represents for us a
piece of the puzzle that had been missing in our offering to affluent
investors."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trust was founded in 1853 and is based in New York, with 1,900
employees and offices in nine states and Washington, D.C. The company provides
investment management and consulting services, financial and estate planning and
private banking and has $86 billion in assets under management.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwab, through its main business, Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. Inc., is the
nation's fourth-largest financial services company with 340 branch offices. It
has 6.4 million customers with active accounts representing a total of $725
billion in assets. There are 5,600 independent advisers who manage some of the
Schwab accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   "Schwab will be able to offer affluent clients access to U.S. Trust's wealth
management expertise, while Schwab's vast technological resources will enable
U.S. Trust to combine our traditional high-touch approach with high-tech to
better serve our clients," said H. Marshall Schwarz, chairman and CEO of U.S.
Trust.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies said there are more than 6 million U.S. households each with a
net worth of over $1 million and that the numbers of Americans with large
investment portfolios is expected to grow at a double-digit pace in the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
	   "The baby boomers are emerging as a dominant wealth segment in the United
States," said Schwab president and co-CEO David Pottruck.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies will retain their separate brand identities.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the agreement, U.S. Trust shareholders will receive 3.427 shares of
Schwab stock for each share of U.S. Trust stock, or $129 in stock for each U.S.
Trust share, based on Wednesday's closing stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of U.S. Trust surged $48 to $126.87 1/2 in midafternoon trading on
the New York Stock Exchange, where Schwab was up 87 1/2 cents at $38.50.
</P>
<P>
	   The transaction is subject to approval by the Federal Reserve Board and
other regulators and to a vote by U.S. Trust shareholders. The companies said
they expect to complete the deal by July.

    SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Zions Bancorporation and First Security Corp. plans
to lay off more than 700 workers as a result of the companies' merger.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies want to reduce their combined 17,000-employee work force by
about 10 percent and hoped to do it primarily through attrition.
</P>
<P>

merge in June helped reduce employment by about 900 people, said Clark Hinckley,
Zions' human resources manager. He confirmed the number of planned layoffs
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Warner-Lambert reverses course, begins talks to merge with Pfizer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Warner-Lambert Co. today said it would hold merger talks
with hostile suitor Pfizer Inc, walking away from its November decision to be
acquired by American Home Products.
<P>
	   Either combination would create the world's largest drugmaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors had pressured Warner-Lambert executives to re-evaluate its
decision to unite with Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products, especially in
light of the rising value of Pfizer's offer. Pfizer made a bid for
Warner-Lambert on Nov. 4, just hours after American Home and Warner-Lambert
announced plans to combine.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer's offer is now worth about $77 billion. American Home's bid is valued
at about $57 billion. The difference between the offers has widened in recent
weeks due to Pfizer's rising stock price and American Home's falling stock
price.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Warner-Lambert rose $4.31 1/4 to $91.12 1/2 in afternoon trading
on the New York Stock Exchange after Warner Lambert's announcement. Pfizer rose
93 3/4 cents to $36.06 1/4 and American Home rose 87 1/2 cents to $43.06 1/4,
also on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert, the fastest growing major drugmaker, is the world's
15th-largest prescription drug company. The Morris Plains N.J.-based company
makes the blockbuster cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, which it co-markets
with Pfizer and which is expected to have $3.3 billion in sales this year and
upwards of $6 billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement this morning, Warner-Lambert's board said that "in light of
changing circumstances" it had concluded Pfizer's offer "is better financially
for Warner-Lambert shareholders than the proposed merger with American Home
Products."
</P>
<P>
	   Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, chairman, president and chief executive officer of
Warner-Lambert, said talks would be held with Pfizer. Warner-Lambert said it
could not guarantee that an agreement could be reached with Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was inevitable," said Hemant Shah, a drug analyst with HKS&AMP; Co. in
Warren, N.J. He said Warner-Lambert had to reverse course because the gap
between Pfizer's offer and American Home's offer had expanded to nearly $20
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Warner-Lambert had concerns about American Home's liability associated
with the phen-fen diet drug cocktail, which has resurfaced as a financial
concern because of lawsuits in Mississippi and other states seeking damages for
thousands of people who claim injury. Those claims are jeopardizing a national
settlement earlier negotiated by American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear how much Warner-Lambert would have to pay American Home if
Warner-Lambert walks away from its deal. The American Home-Warner-Lambert deal
called for either company to pay the other $2 billion if it wanted to walk away
from the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
	   If American Home Products is rejected, it would be its third failed merger
attempt in less than two years. In 1998, negotiations broke down with Monsanto
Co. and SmithKline Beecham PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle for Warner-Lambert has escalated into some nasty exchanges
between the companies' top officials and several lawsuits have been filed.
Warner-Lambert has even sought to terminate Pfizer's rights to co-market and
share profits from Lipitor.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the cases has yet to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer, which was preparing a hostile takeover of Warner-Lambert, said today
it was pleased with Warner-Lambert's move.
</P>
<P>
	   "We look forward to an expeditious completion of the transaction combining
the two fastest-growing companies in our industry and creating the best
pharmaceutical company in the world," Pfizer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>

	   Wholesale Prices Up 3 Percent in '99
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices at the wholesale level had their
biggest increase in nine years last year, rising 3 percent. But the
Labor Department said today that the rise was largely due to an
18.4 percent rebound in energy costs. Without the energy and food
sectors, wholesale prices rose just 0.9 percent, well below the
1998 rise of 2.5 percent. Last month, the Producer Price Index was
up 0.3 percent, matching many analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Retail Sales Rise 1.2 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retail sales rose 1.2 percent in December,
according to figures released today by the Commerce Department.
That was stronger than the 0.9 percent increase many analysts were
anticipating, and up from 1.1 percent in November.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher today as technology
shares recovered from a two-day slump and the broader market gained
strength from a report of relatively modest inflation. Investors
remained fairly cautious in the hours ahead of a speech by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Just before 3 p.m. EST, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 72.91 at 11,624.01. Broader stock

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rewards may be waiting for U.S. taxpayers who
file their federal income taxes online or over the telephone using
the IRS' Telefile. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said today
that Clinton will include in his fiscal 2001 budget request to
Congress next month a $10 refundable tax credit for taxpayers
filing online and a $5 credit for those using Telefile. Summers
said the credit ``will provide an incentive for filing online and
reward individual taxpayers'' while simultaneously helping the IRS
become more efficient.

<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Shares of United Airlines' parent company fell
today after UAL, the world's largest airline, warned that its
earnings this year will be well below expectations because of
higher fuel and labor costs. UAL Corp. stock was down 10 7/16 at 64
5/16. UAL, issuing its revised outlook before chairman and chief
executive James Goodwin met with analysts in New York, forecast
earnings for the year at between $7 and $9 a share. Analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had pegged earnings for
the year at $9.76 a share.

	   Warner-Lambert To Hold Pfizer Talks
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Warner-Lambert Co. today reversed course and
said it would hold merger talks with Pfizer Inc. The decision came
two months after Warner-Lambert agreed to be acquired by American
Home Products. Either combination would create the world's largest
drugmaker. Investors had pressured Warner-Lambert executives to
re-evaluate its decision to unite with American Home Product,
especially in light of the rising value of Pfizer's offer. Pfizer's
offer is now worth about $77 billion. American Home's bid is valued
at about $57 billion. The difference between the offers has widened
in recent weeks as Pfizer's stocks rise and American Home's fall.
Pfizer stock was trading at 36 5/16 Up 1 3/16 this afternoon;
Warner-Lambert was up 4 1/2 at 91 5/8; American Home Products was up
13/16 at 43.

	   Roche Sales Rise 12 Percent

<P>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Pumped up by strong sales of its new
diet drug, Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche Holding AG's 1999 sales
jumped 12 percent, the company said today. Sales for the company's
flagship drug division gained 15 percent to $10.6 billion. Overall,
the company's 1999 sales were $17.7 billion. The company did not
release profit results for 1999. Roche said sales of its Xenical
obesity drug, which was launched in the United States in May,
totaled nearly $640 million. Roche's beleaguered vitamins and fine
chemicals division picked up 1 percent to $2.3 billion. Roche is
still reeling from a $500 million fine from the U.S. Justice
Department for its involvement in a worldwide price-fixing
conspiracy over vitamins.

today it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire U.S. Trust
Corp. in a bid to create a business serving investors ``at every

	   Koch Industries Fined for Pollution
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency today
slapped Koch Industries with $35 million in fines and penalties as
part of a settlement over alleged contamination of lakes and
streams in six states from Missouri to Texas. Based in Wichita,
Kan., the company operates more than 35,000 miles of pipeline in
the United States and Canada, and has refineries in Texas and
Minnesota through its Koch Petroleum Group subsidiary. The
settlement, announced by the EPA and Justice Department, stems from
allegations that the company had more than 300 oil spills from its
pipelines and other oil operations, resulting in 3 million gallons
of crude oil pouring into lakes and streams in Texas, Oklahoma,
Kansas, Alabana, Louisiana and Missouri. Koch Pipeline Co. said in
a statement that pipeline leaks had been reduced by 90 percent
since 1990.

</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fannie Mae said today that its profits rose to
a record $3.9 billion last year from $3.4 billion in 1998, boosted
by continued growth in its mortgage business and a reduction of
credit-related losses. The nation's largest mortgage-market company
said it earned $3.72 a share on a diluted basis in 1999, up 15.2
percent from $3.23 a year earlier. Chairman and CEO Franklin Raines
called 1999's financial results ``extraordinary'' and called the
outlook ``extremely bright' despite the possibility of further
interest rate increases.

<P>
	   LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Brunswick Corp. said today it will
close its North American bicycle plants, lay off 80 percent of its
bicycle-division work force and move the unit's manufacturing
business to Asia to cope with rising imports and falling prices.
About 750 people at Brunswick's two Mexican plants and 325
employees at its Olney plant will be affected by the closings, said
Kathryn Chieger, spokeswoman for the Lake Forest-based company.	   ``We would
plan to be out of manufacturing by the end of June,''
Chieger said. Olney will remain the company's distribution and
warehousing center for the Roadmaster brand, she said.

<P>
    SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Zions Bancorporation and First Security Corp. plan to
lay off more than 700 workers as a result of the companies' merger.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies want to reduce their combined 17,000-employee work force by
about 10 percent and hoped to do it primarily through attrition.
</P>
<P>
	   A companywide hiring freeze in effect since they announced their plans to
merge in June helped reduce employment by about 900 people, said Clark Hinckley,
Zions' human resources manager. He confirmed the number of planned layoffs
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who will lose their jobs are receiving letters telling them when they
will be terminated. The workers are in the banks' accounting, information
technology, auditing, payroll, human resources, budgeting and other
administrative departments.
</P>
<P>
	   The consolidation of Utah's largest financial institutions will create the
nation's 20th-largest bank with about $40 billion in assets. The combined
company will do business under the First Security name.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal received final regulatory approval from the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board on Dec. 13, shortly after the U.S. Justice Department gave its blessing on
the condition the companies sell 64 branches in Utah and Idaho.

<HEADLINE> The First Couple Commutes in Style  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- On their first day as real New York commuters on Thursday,
President Clinton left home in the suburbs and headed off to work with help from
a phalanx of police, while his wife enjoyed the morning paper's favorable review
of her Letterman debut.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clintons are feeling their way in the uncharted territory of a commuter
White House, with the president making drop-by visits to the family's new home
in the tony New York suburb of Chappaqua. Hillary Rodham Clinton is living there
pretty much full-time now, using the handsome, $1.7 million house as home base
for her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   They left that home in the morning for what are now two very different jobs.
The president, road-testing some themes for his State of the Union address later
this month, had a barrage of economic incentive ideas to discuss during stops in
Brooklyn and Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   There were also a party on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, a
swank, $5,000-a-couple Democratic fund-raising reception and a few opportunities
for the modern helpmate husband to boost his wife's nascent political career.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I always like to come to New York and give my wife a plug,'' Clinton joked
during a morning appearance at a Brooklyn community college.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Clinton got a laugh after performing butler duty at a luncheon speech
-- helping one speaker to the podium and picking up another's dropped
eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm just practicing for my role as a Senate spouse,'' Clinton deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton campaigned nearby on Long Island and basked in good press after
Wednesday's star turn on the Manhattan-based Late Show with David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
	   Her husband marveled admiringly that her performance dealt him a double dose
of humility -- not only did it underscore the fact that he will soon leave his
post as president, ``but now I have to give up my role as the funny one in the
family, too.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although they commuted to their Thursday appointments, the Clintons are not
exactly straphangers. Clinton was supposed to whisk from Westchester County to
Brooklyn by helicopter, but bad weather forced him to drive in a 14-car, heavily
protected motorcade. Police blocked all traffic as the president passed, causing
large backups, and the toll booth operators waved him by without charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton travels lighter, but still with the Secret Service.

<HEADLINE> Chevron Paying $95M To Settle Claim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chevron Corp. agreed Thursday to pay $95 million to
resolve claims that it and affiliated companies underpaid royalties for
producing oil from federal and Indian land for 11 years, the Justice Department
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The department said the payment would resolve complaints under the False
Claims Act that Chevron systematically underreported the value of oil it pumped
from the leased property from Jan. 1, 1988 through Dec. 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The leases, administered by the Interior Department, were scattered
throughout the West and the Gulf of Mexico. Chevron pays royalties based upon
its monthly reports of the value of the oil it produces from federal and Indian
land.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives of several Indian tribes signed the agreement, as well as
the federal government and Chevron, which is based in Richmond, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Under provisions of the False Claims Act, J. Benjamin Johnson Jr. and John
Martineck, former employees of another oil company, Arco, will share $14.5
million of the settlement because they filed suit in Lufkin, Texas, against
Chevron on behalf of the U.S. government.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Grows for Manufacturers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Inflation pressures are beginning to mount for U.S.
manufacturers, according to a recent Dun &AMP; Bradstreet survey that found
executives a bit more upbeat about business prospects in the first quarter of
this year than they were in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   A companion survey for the construction industry, also conducted in
December, reported executives anticipate a gradual slowdown following what
appeared to be a record-setting performance by builders last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey of 1,000 manufacturing executives reported prices remained low
and stable at the end of 1999 but suggested manufacturing prices may start to
climb in the new year, Dun &AMP; Bradstreet said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over one in five manufacturers expect to see their costs go up in the next
three months. About that same proportion plan to increase their selling prices
over that same period," said David T. Kresge, chief economist for Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet, a private business-information service.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey of 200 U.S. construction executives also reported expectations of
rising prices. In addition, the survey said growth of construction orders slowed
for a second straight month in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Construction companies also reported employment levels decreasing more
rapidly than usual for this time of year.

</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose after the Labor Department said that while prices at the

	   For December, the Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures
before they reach the consumer, was up 0.3 percent, right on target with many
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>

quickly enough to merit sharp interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits as it
becomes more expensive to borrow money.

increase rates beyond that amount, Orr said.

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Dayton Hudson Corp. is aiming for a bull's-eye with the
decision to change its name to Target Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Target is the biggest division and the fastest-growing arm of
Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson, accounting for more than 75 percent of the
company's revenues and profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Target has been the company's top moneymaker since 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a move to demonstrate to the world that they finally acknowledge
that Target is the crown jewel of the Dayton Hudson empire," said Kurt Barnard,
president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, a retail consulting firm in Upper
Montclair, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question that it is the one (part) that will ultimately
determine what the rest of the company does,"
</P>
<P>
	   Dayton Hudson, which announced the decision Thursday, said the name change
will take effect Jan. 30 when the company begins its new fiscal year. The
company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TGT.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has been prominently advertising Target -- the No. 3 U.S.
discount chain behind Wal-Mart and Kmart -- trying to make the red bull's-eye
logo as recognizable as symbols such as the Nike swoosh.
</P>
<P>
	   While the company's name will now focus on Target, the change won't affect
any of the company's other store brands. Mervyn's, Dayton's, Marshall Field's
and Hudson's will all be part of Target Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   But Barnard said that the name change may signal that the company is
thinking of restructuring its business.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a strong possibility," Barnard said, "that sooner or later, and
probably more sooner rather than later, they will divest themselves of Mervyn's,
which has really been lagging badly, and also their department stores."
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Ulrich, Dayton Hudson chairman and chief executive officer, said the
company's main goal continues to be delivering annual earnings per share growth
of 15 percent or more over time.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, Target plans to add about 70 new Target Stores, including 15
larger SuperTargets, which are grocery and discount stores combined.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's stock has been publicly traded since 1967, when the Dayton
Company went public. In 1969, Dayton's merged with J.L. Hudson Co. to form
Dayton Hudson Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong sales at Target stores fueled a 32 percent third-quarter earnings
increase for the period ending Oct. 30. For the first nine months of 1999,
Dayton Hudson earnings rose 27 percent, to $650 million, or $1.39 a share, from
$512 million, or $1.08 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 10 percent to $22.98
billion, from $20.81 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Dayton Hudson operates 1,245 stores in 44 states, including 914 Target
stores, 267 Mervyn's stores and 64 department stores.

<HEADLINE> Court-appointed monitor for IBF hires forensic accountant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The court-appointed overseer of the troubled IBF has
hired a forensic accountant to review the organization's books, monitor Joseph
A. Hayden Jr. said Thursday, a day after being named to the post.
<P>
	   "We certainly got fast out of the block," Hayden said after leaving a closed
two-hour meeting with federal prosecutors, indicted International Boxing
Federation founder Robert W. Lee Sr. and lawyers for Lee and the IBF.
</P>
<P>
	   Hayden's appointment represents the first time a U.S. sports organization
has been subject to a remedy usually applied to mob-riddled labor unions.
</P>
<P>
	   During a short interview as he left the courthouse here, Hayden said he had
no special expertise in boxing, but said he has attended prizefights.
</P>
<P>
	   A criminal defense lawyer for 30 years and well-known in New Jersey legal
circles, Hayden was praised both by prosecutors and the IBF's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Hayden said, "It is my belief that all parties will be
cooperative with the role of the monitor." His mandate is to ensure the
integrity of the IBF's finances and its ranking system, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The monitorship was set in motion when Lee and other IBF officials were
indicted in November on charges they accepted $338,000 to rig its rankings of
boxers.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. attorney's office also sued Lee and the others, seeking to bar them
from boxing and requesting a monitor.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge John W. Bissell on Wednesday granted that request,
giving Hayden full access to IBF meetings and records, but not the subpoena
power suggested by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee took a leave last month as president of the East Orange-based IBF, which
he founded in 1983. Lawyers for Lee and the IBF argued that a monitor was not
needed.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bissell found "ample evidence presented to demonstrate a pattern of
illegal activity through the solicitation and receipt of payoffs allegedly for
the purpose of fixing rankings or scheduling boxing matches."
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, 65, of Fanwood, has pleaded innocent and is to stand trial in the
spring on racketeering, conspiracy, money laundering and tax evasion charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Longtime IBF vice president Hiawatha Knight of Detroit is now serving as IBF
president.
</P>
<P>
	   Rankings play a big role in determining opponents and purses for boxers.
Years of questionable rankings by all three major sanctioning bodies have
spurred efforts on Capitol Hill for legislation to regulate them. Only the IBF
is based in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment said seven promoters and managers were involved in payoffs to
the IBF to alter rankings or give favorable treatment to 23 boxers. They have
not been charged, and the indictment refers to them only by number.

<HEADLINE> 30-Yr. Mortgage Rates Climb  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mortgage rates hit their highest level since April 1997
amid fears that the Federal Reserve will boost interest rates higher next month.
</P>
<P>
	   The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages climbed to 8.18
percent for the week ending Jan. 14, up from 8.15 percent last week, according
to a weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. It
matched the rate for April 4, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time rates were higher than 8.18 percent was Sept. 13, 1996, when
rates on the 30-year mortgage hit 8.28 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, also were up this
week with an average rate of 7.78 percent this week, up from the average rate of
7.73 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
	   On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average
initial rate of 6.61 percent this week, up from 6.60 percent the previous week.
</P>
<P>
	   The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which averaged at or
just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three types of mortgages.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mortgage rates did not move as much as expected and that is surprising
considering that the economy is showing no signs of slowing yet, which keeps
alive the threat of inflation," said said Robert Van Order, Freddie Mac's chief
economist. Many economists believe the Fed will boost rates to slow the red-hot
economy. The central bank boosted rates three times last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said that mortgage
loan applications for the week ending Jan. 7 increased 39.9 percent from the
previous week and were down 43.4 percent compared with the same week last year.

<HEADLINE> Biotech Rice Could Solve Problem  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have genetically engineered a type of rice
that could end vitamin A deficiency in the developing world, a problem that is a
common cause of blindness and other health problems in millions of children.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers at a Swiss laboratory spliced three genes into the rice to
make it rich in beta carotene, the source of vitamin A, according to a report on
their findings appearing Friday in Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   The new crop, dubbed "golden rice" because of the hue the beta carotene
gives it, is not expected to be available to farmers for several years. Also,
scientists still have to determine if the altered rice loses any of the original
rice's nutritional value.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the International Rice Research Institute already is working on
breeding the new trait into popular varieties.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. biologist, in a Science commentary on the findings, hailed the
research as a "technical tour de force" because of its complexity and said it
"exemplifies the best that agricultural biotechnology has to offer."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rockefeller Foundation, the lead sponsor of the rice research, views
biotechnology as a solution to world hunger, and also wants to develop crops
that would be resistant to drought, pests and soil toxins. Scientists believe it
eventually will be possible to put iron and other nutrients in plants once the
genetic pathways are known.
</P>
<P>
	   Rice is a relatively poor source of many essential nutrients, including
vitamin A, but is the staple for half the world. An estimated 124 million
children worldwide are deficient in vitamin A, including a quarter million in
Southeast Asia who go blind each year because of the problem. Improved nutrition
could prevent 1 million to 2 million deaths a year, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
	   Rice naturally produces its own beta carotene, but it is lost in the milling
process. The biotech variety would have the beta carotene right in the
endosperm, the part people eat.
</P>
<P>
	   The rice is unlikely to be sold in the United States or Europe, but it has
public relations value for proponents of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
	   Most biotech crops developed so far are either tolerant of herbicides or
toxic to insects, traits of little benefit to consumers, and the seed companies
are struggling to overcome consumer resistance in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   The biotech rice could improve the industry's image because it was developed
without commercial funding and will be easily available to farmers, said Mary
Lou Guerinot, the Dartmouth College biologist who wrote the Science commentary.
</P>
<P>
	   "One can only hope that this application of plant genetic engineering to
ameliorate human misery without regard to short-term profit will restore this
technology to political acceptability," she wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of biotech crops say not enough is known about their safety or
effect on the environment. While acknowledging the potential benefit of the
rice, they say that should not be used to block efforts to require stricter
regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I certainly agree that certain applications of biotechnology can have great
social value, but that in no way obviates other concerns," said Rebecca
Goldburg, senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   It will take more testing to determine whether the biotech rice will meet a
person's daily needs for vitamin A. Although the laboratory rice may have
sufficient beta carotene, levels could vary in the varieties that are bred from
it, Guerinot said.
</P>
<P>
	   Getting consumers to accept the yellowish rice also could be a challenge.
They will have to be convinced the rice will prevent blindness and other health
problems, said Per Pinstrup-Anderson, director general of the International Food
Policy Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're changing the color of a very basic food staple for millions of
people, and that's never easy. But I think it can be done," he said.

<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures enjoyed a second straight day of
strong price increases Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans pushed to their highest price in two months on reports of crop
losses in Brazil due to the long drought there.
</P>
<P>
	   The soybean rally spread to grains, where corn reached a new high despite
unexpectedly low weekly export sales as reported by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat prices benefited from the soybean gains and reached their highest
level in two months after forecasts called for record warm temperatures this
weekend in the U.S. southern and central Plains.

<HEADLINE> Consultants' bill: $108,000 to help SUNY 'find' King  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - It apparently cost about $27,000 per block to find
the State University of New York's new chancellor.
<P>
	   That's what a Los Angeles consulting firm wants - $108,667 in all - for
helping SUNY run a national search to find its new chancellor, documents
obtained by The Associated Press show.
</P>
<P>
	   That search ended with last month's hiring of former Pataki state Budget
Director Robert King, who worked four blocks away from SUNY's central
administration building the entire time.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a payment to management firm Korn/Ferry International makes no sense,
especially when SUNY already is having money problems, Assembly Majority Leader
Michael Bragman of Onondaga County said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all know that Bob King has always had the inside track for this job and
such a huge payment to an outside consultant is outrageous," Bragman said. "As
far as I know ... I think there was only one other candidate besides Bob King. I
question if a national search was necessary to identify a candidate from within
our state government who works just a few blocks away."
</P>
<P>
	   The SUNY system is controlled by Gov. George Pataki through his appointments
to the SUNY Board of Trustees.
</P>
<P>
	   A trustees' search committee unanimously recommended King - a former
prosecutor, colleague of Pataki's in the Legislature and bureaucrat in Pataki's
administration - to be chancellor over Stanley Koplick, chancellor of the
Massachusetts state university system.
</P>
<P>
	   Koplick died Jan. 3, two days after King officially started as SUNY
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   King's hiring in December culminated a long search which began in January
1999 when former SUNY Chancellor John Ryan said he wanted to retire. Korn/Ferry
was hired in July.
</P>
<P>
	   SUNY spokesman Jon Sorensen said King was not preordained to be chancellor
because of his relationship with the Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
	   "He went through the process like everyone else," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sorensen also said Korn/Ferry deserves its money because it did a true
national search.
</P>
<P>
	   "They put together quite a long roster of people, many of whom were
interviewed and explored," he said. "They presented a list of traditional and
nontraditional candidates and it's wrong to accuse these people of not working
hard because they did. They earned their money with a lot of time and the result
of this search turned out well."
</P>
<P>
	   Sorensen said six candidates were interviewed for the chancellor's job.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the complaints by Bragman, a Democrat,
about the Korn/Ferry search is "just partisan politics."
</P>
<P>
	   Korn/Ferry hasn't been paid yet because state Comptroller H. Carl McCall has
yet to approve the firm's contract with SUNY.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have the contract, it's under review and we have questions we have asked
the state university," McCall spokesman Dennis Tompkins said. "We have some
procedural and some substantive questions."
</P>
<P>
	   Tompkins would not say what questions the comptroller, who is also a
Democrat, has about the contract. SUNY cannot pay Korn/Ferry until the
comptroller approves the contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Sorensen said one of the questions that SUNY is refusing to answer is who
the other four finalists for chancellor were. "We insured our finalists privacy
because they have jobs in higher education that could be jeopardized," he said.
"We find (the questions) highly irregular and inappropriate. We made commitments
to these finalists."
</P>
<P>
	   A call to Korn/Ferry's offices in New York City was not immediately returned
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers like Bragman said they know what questions they would like to ask
to SUNY.
</P>
<P>
	   The university system's teaching hospitals have to transfer $116 million of
its state government funds to the SUNY system every year because of a
legislative mandate. However, it is unlikely the hospitals will be able to come
up with the money this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The teaching hospitals in Stony Brook, Syracuse and Brooklyn were only able
to transfer $39 million last year and had to borrow the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Democrats have complained about the university system hiring
high-priced consultants while it has this money problem. For example, SUNY is
paying nationally-recognized health care consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers
$1.1 million to investigate SUNY's teaching hospital finances and recommend ways
to make the hospitals fiscally viable again.
</P>
<P>
	   However, that report is not due until February, a month after Pataki has
submitted his state budget to the Legislature. Therefore, Pataki and King did
not offer any suggestions on how to end the hospitals' fiscal crisis during the
executive budget message, Bragman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just appears to me that it's a continuing pattern of fiscal
irresponsibility," Bragman said.

<HEADLINE> Whitman announces $6.3 million revitalization project for Camden  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman on Thursday announced a $6.3
million plan to restore 65 abandoned homes in an East Camden neighborhood
frequented by drug dealers and prostitutes.
<P>
	   The project is an extension of the plan launched last year to beautify
Admiral Wilson Boulevard, a tawdry gateway into New Jersey dotted with seedy
motels, a strip club and liquor stores.
</P>
<P>
	   The homes are located just off the infamous boulevard and the neighborhood
has been infected with crime from the 2-mile strip. Vacant lots are filled with
debris, the sidewalks are crumbling and the streets need repair.
</P>
<P>
	   "Believe me when I tell you it's very bad," said resident Emma Graham, 65,
who lives on Baird Boulevard. "Any help we're going to get will be appreciated."
</P>
<P>
	   Graham, who stood next to Whitman on a dilapidated sidewalk strewn with
broken glass, appealed to the governor for help ridding the neighborhood of
prostitutes who stroll the street and drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The boulevard is entrenched with prostitutes. We put up with it," said
Graham, a retired business owner who has lived here since 1970. "Sometimes it's
overbearing."
</P>
<P>
	   Graham said she had to chase away a prostitute who was sitting on her stoop
with a rubber band around her arm shooting up drugs. The hardest part, she said,
is trying to field questions from her granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   "My granddaughter asked me 'what are those ladies doing,"' she recalled.
"What are you going to tell a 5-year-old?"
</P>
<P>
	   State Transportation Commissioner James Weinstein said the revitalization
project announced Thursday is an attempt to "help make Camden a better place to
live, work and raise a family."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said the project should help stabilize the neighborhood and clean up
crime. The state is also providing $200,000 for new lighting, which should deter
criminals, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state has been criticized by some for the Admiral Wilson Boulevard
project, which is expected to cost up to $90 million. Businesses - legitimate
and shady - will be replaced with a scenic view for motorists.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman's goal is to spruce the area up in time for this summer's Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia. Many delegates have already booked rooms in
New Jersey hotels and will likely travel along the boulevard.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor said the state is not ignoring neighborhoods in the
9-square-mile city of 87,000. The state pumps millions of dollars annually into
Camden, the poorest city in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "As we move ahead with our Gateway Project to fix up the boulevard, we're
building on our commitment to fix up the neighborhoods of Camden," Whitman said.
"The boulevard may be one of the city's major arteries, but the neighborhoods
are its heart and soul."
</P>
<P>
	   The neighborhood is just a few blocks from The Alley, a notorious drug area
allegedly run by the largest cocaine cartel in Camden's history. Two accused
drug lords are on trial in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   The project calls for about 65 homes to be repaired over a three-year
period, according to state Department of Community Affairs Commissioner Jane
Kenny. The first group of homes should be completed by this summer, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The abandoned properties, scattered throughout the neighborhood in the
city's Marlton section, will be rebuilt by St. Joseph's Carpenter's Society, a
nonprofit church affiliated group that has redeveloped more than 200 Camden
houses.
</P>
<P>
	   The renovated houses will cost between $45,000 and $55,000 and will be sold
to low- and moderate-income families who will be offered low-interest mortgages,
officials said. Whitman said the goal is to keep residents in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not a yuppie-fying of a neighborhood," Whitman said. "We are making
it affordable to people."

	   Sorensen said six candidates were interviewed for the chancellor's job.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the complaints by Bragman, a Democrat,
about the Korn/Ferry search is "just partisan politics."
</P>
<P>
	   Korn/Ferry hasn't been paid yet because state Comptroller H. Carl McCall has
yet to approve the firm's contract with SUNY.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have the contract, it's under review and we have questions we have asked
the state university," McCall spokesman Dennis Tompkins said. "We have some
procedural and some substantive questions."
</P>
<P>
	   Tompkins would not say what questions the comptroller, who is also a
Democrat, has about the contract. SUNY cannot pay Korn/Ferry until the
comptroller approves the contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Sorensen said one of the questions that SUNY is refusing to answer is who
the other four finalists for chancellor were. "We insured our finalists privacy
because they have jobs in higher education that could be jeopardized," he said.
"We find (the questions) highly irregular and inappropriate. We made commitments
to these finalists."
</P>
<P>
	   A call to Korn/Ferry's offices in New York City was not immediately returned
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers like Bragman said they know what questions they would like to ask
to SUNY.
</P>
<P>
	   The university system's teaching hospitals have to transfer $116 million of
its state government funds to the SUNY system every year because of a
legislative mandate. However, it is unlikely the hospitals will be able to come
up with the money this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The teaching hospitals in Stony Brook, Syracuse and Brooklyn were only able
to transfer $39 million last year and had to borrow the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Democrats have complained about the university system hiring
high-priced consultants while it has this money problem. For example, SUNY is
paying nationally-recognized health care consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers
$1.1 million to investigate SUNY's teaching hospital finances and recommend ways
to make the hospitals fiscally viable again.
</P>
<P>
	   However, that report is not due until February, a month after Pataki has
submitted his state budget to the Legislature. Therefore, Pataki and King did
not offer any suggestions on how to end the hospitals' fiscal crisis during the
executive budget message, Bragman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just appears to me that it's a continuing pattern of fiscal
irresponsibility," Bragman said.

<HEADLINE> McCain wants Bush to intercede in New York ballot fight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Texas Gov. George W. Bush should use his
considerable influence to convince top New York Republicans to halt their
attempts to knock John McCain off the state's presidential primary ballot, the
senator from Arizona said Thursday.
<P>
	   Lawyers working for the New York GOP, which is backing Bush's candidacy,
have challenged McCain's petitions for the March 7 primary ballot in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Look, the Berlin Wall came down. Let's not have the kind of Stalinist
politics that the state of New York and the Republican Party have been
practicing," McCain said after a speech to the state Legislature in Concord,
N.H. "Let us be on the ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   Calling himself a "legitimate candidate," McCain said, "don't try to use the
muscle of the New York Republican Party and its apparatchiks to knock us off the
ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   "I know that George W. Bush is committed to having all Republican candidates
on the ballot, and that he does not support efforts by his campaign or
supporters to short-circuit the democratic process," McCain added in a statement
issued by his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bush indicated he wasn't about to help McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   After a speech in Portsmouth, N.H., the Texas governor said, "it's important
for all of us to play by the same rules." Bush defended the complex New York
requirements as "a process to encourage grassroots participation."
</P>
<P>
	   "What's fair is we all play by the same rules," Bush added.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said a decision on whether to pursue such
challenges was up to New York party leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   A top lawyer for New York's Republican hierarchy said the petition challenge
effort was going ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do what we feel is right," lawyer Jeffrey Buley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Buley said the Bush campaign was aware of the New York party's move.
</P>
<P>
	   "They said, 'It's your prerogative,"' Buley said.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Bush candidacy has the backing of Gov. George Pataki and
state GOP Chairman William Powers, as well as most of the state's top
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of New York's demanding ballot access rules, only Bush, McCain and
millionaire publisher Steve Forbes are contesting the New York primary.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush and Forbes filed petitions seemingly qualifying themselves for
the GOP primary ballot in all of the state's 31 congressional districts, the
McCain camp has conceded its petitions are probably only adequate to qualify for
the ballot in 25 or 26 of the state's 31 districts.
</P>
<P>
	   That could leave McCain on the GOP ballot in only part of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Buley said his review of the McCain petitions indicates McCain lacks
sufficient signatures from party members in at least six of the state's
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Buley said lawyers are also checking the other McCain petitions to make sure
those signing them are really registered to vote, are enrolled Republicans and
live in the congressional district where they signed the petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, the Bush supporters in New York filed general objections
with the state Board of Elections to the McCain petitions. They have until
Tuesday to follow that up with specific objections that would then be ruled on
by the state board.
</P>
<P>
	   The board plans to certify the primary ballot Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has also filed a federal lawsuit seeking to place his convention
delegate slates on the ballot in all of the state's 31 congressional districts.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Prices Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- European stocks rose Thursday, but London shares were
slightly dampened by the Bank of England's interest rate increase, which did
nothing to alleviate global fears of inflation and expectations for European
rate rises this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 313 shares in companies in
countries that joined the single currency, rose 3.61 points to 401.88. The Dow
Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index rose 39.1 points to 4688.4.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 606 shares in European companies was 1.91
points, or 0.6 percent, higher at 354.83, while the Dow Jones Stoxx 50 Index
rose 30.9 points to 4494.3.
</P>
<P>
	   In domestic markets, London's FTSE-100 Share Index closed almost flat, down
1.3 points at 6531.5; Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index rose 43.17 points or 0.6
percent to 6955.98; the Paris CAC-40 Index gained 50.74 points or 0.9 percent to
5633.24; and Milan's MIBTEL Index was 208 points or 0.8 percent higher at
27,711.
</P>
<P>
	   In Germany, a sharp gain in Siemens shares along with selected financial
stocks lifted the index. Investors scrambled for Siemens shares before the
stock-market listing of its semiconductor subsidiary Infineon.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in Frankfurt, automaker BMW closed down 2.8 percent after a board
member told a German newspaper that its British unit Rover may post losses for
1999 of 1.8 billion marks (about $1 billion).
</P>
<P>
	   In London, the Bank of England's decision to raise interest rates by a
quarter percentage point to 5.75 percent had little downward effect on shares.
The announcement had been expected and had been written into trading already.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares in Cable &AMP; Wireless gained after the company said it had bought eight
independent European internet companies.
</P>
<P>
	   In France, the long-awaited signing of defense-to-media group Lagardere with
pay-TV channel Canal Plus lifted shares. Lagardere shares rose 7.1 percent on
heavy trade, while Canal Plus shares closed up 9.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Consultants' bill: $108,000 to help SUNY 'find' King  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - It apparently cost about $27,000 per block to find
the State University of New York's new chancellor.
<P>
	   That's what a Los Angeles consulting firm wants - $108,667 in all - for
helping SUNY run a national search to find its new chancellor, documents
obtained by The Associated Press show.
</P>
<P>
	   That search ended with last month's hiring of former Pataki state Budget
Director Robert King, who worked four blocks away from SUNY's central
administration building the entire time.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a payment to management firm Korn/Ferry International makes no sense,
especially when SUNY already is having money problems, Assembly Majority Leader
Michael Bragman of Onondaga County said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all know that Bob King has always had the inside track for this job and
such a huge payment to an outside consultant is outrageous," Bragman said. "As
far as I know ... I think there was only one other candidate besides Bob King. I
question if a national search was necessary to identify a candidate from within
our state government who works just a few blocks away."
</P>
<P>
	   The SUNY system is controlled by Gov. George Pataki through his appointments
to the SUNY Board of Trustees.
</P>
<P>
	   A trustees' search committee unanimously recommended King - a former
prosecutor, colleague of Pataki's in the Legislature and bureaucrat in Pataki's
administration - to be chancellor over Stanley Koplick, chancellor of the
Massachusetts state university system.
</P>
<P>
	   Koplick died Jan. 3, two days after King officially started as SUNY
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   King's hiring in December culminated a long search which began in January
1999 when former SUNY Chancellor John Ryan said he wanted to retire. Korn/Ferry
was hired in July.
</P>
<P>
	   SUNY spokesman Jon Sorensen said King was not preordained to be chancellor
because of his relationship with the Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
	   "He went through the process like everyone else," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sorensen also said Korn/Ferry deserves its money because it did a true
national search.
</P>
<P>
	   "They put together quite a long roster of people, many of whom were
interviewed and explored," he said. "They presented a list of traditional and
nontraditional candidates and it's wrong to accuse these people of not working
hard because they did. They earned their money with a lot of time and the result
of this search turned out well."
</P>
<P>
	   Sorensen said six candidates were interviewed for the chancellor's job.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the complaints by Bragman, a Democrat,
about the Korn/Ferry search is "just partisan politics."
</P>
<P>
	   Korn/Ferry hasn't been paid yet because state Comptroller H. Carl McCall has

<HEADLINE> BP Puts Pressure on FTC on Arco  </HEADLINE>
    By MAUREEN CLARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield Co. said Thursday
they were moving ahead with their merger plans, putting pressure on the Federal
Trade Commission to approve the deal or go to court to block it.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies said in a news release that they were ready to trigger a
federal law that would force the FTC to decide within 20 days whether the $26.8
billion deal should be allowed to proceed. At the same time, they said they
would continue their talks with the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   "During this 20-day period, there is still always the option of continued
discussions with the FTC so we haven't ruled out the possibility of some
agreement with the FTC," BP Amoco spokesman Thomas Koch said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Company officials would meet with the agency Friday, Koch said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to greater control of retail gas stations and refineries on the
West Coast, the deal would give BP Amoco control of 70 percent of oil production
on Alaska's North Slope and 72 percent of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline.
</P>
<P>
	   FTC staffers have reportedly recommended that the commission block the deal
because it would consolidate Alaska oil production and could affect oil prices
on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   But BP Amoco and Arco executives say those concerns are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   "While the companies firmly believe the combination would enlarge rather
than adversely affect competition, they have offered but failed to get FTC
acceptance for a range of measures designed to meet the FTC's expressed
concerns," the news release said.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco officials say they think they've made enough concessions to
maintain competition, including divestiture of some of the North Slope holdings.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've reached agreement with the state of Alaska, we've reached an
agreement with the governor of California, we've had approval by the
shareholders of both corporations," Koch said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ed Maran, an oil industry analyst with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.
Louis, said the companies' decision to proceed with the merger is an
acknowledgement that they can't reach an agreement with the FTC.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think things could become more contentious and I think that's the
only reason the company has moved to this point. It's a recognition that things
were as bad as they were going to be and they couldn't make them worse," Maran
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Trade Commission declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   But typically, once a company triggers the 20-day notice, the staff of the
FTC have to start preparing for litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco first triggered the 20-day deadline last November, but quickly
reversed itself after Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles accused the company of not
bargaining in good faith and urged the FTC to block the deal. Company officials
then dismissed their move as a procedural detail and said they wanted to
continue negotiations with the state and the FTC.
</P>
<P>
	   The company signed an agreement with the state in December, agreeing to give
up majority ownership of the Kuparuk oil field, the nation's second largest
field, as part of an agreement to win the state's support for the buyout.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement with the state also requires BP Amoco to sell undeveloped
acreage on the North Slope to another major oil producer, make North Slope
natural gas available to developers, donate $6 million a year to the state
university system and hire Alaskans.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor is disappointed that discussion between BP Amoco and the FTC
haven't resolved all the federal concerns," Knowles' spokesman Bob King said
Thursday. "The governor still strongly believes that the merger is in the best
interests of the state."

<HEADLINE> Colleges, casinos gear up for congressional fight over sports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Two senators plan to introduce legislation that would
outlaw betting on intercollegiate sports, a practice critics say has contributed
to the growing number of gambling scandals on campuses nationwide.
<P>
	   The National Collegiate Athletic Association is urging its 1,031 member
colleges and universities to lobby members of Congress to support the bill,
which Sens. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., plan to introduce
Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think the kids are very vulnerable," said Doris Dixon, NCAA director of
federal relations. "They're young people; they don't have professional contracts
or careers - $500 or $5,000 to miss that shot or stumble on that finish line
doesn't mean their team won't win, just that they won't win by the point
spread."
</P>
<P>
	   The NCAA says illegal attempts to influence collegiate sports are
increasing. In recent years, gambling scandals have surfaced at Arizona State
University, Northwestern University, the University of Maryland and Boston
College, among others.
</P>
<P>
	   "There have been more point-shaving scandals at our colleges and
universities in the 1990s than in every other decade before it, combined,"
Brownback said in a statement. "These scandals are a direct result of an
increase in gambling on college sports."
</P>
<P>
	   The National Gambling Impact Study Commission last year recommended banning
wagering on collegiate and amateur athletic events. The Brownback-Leahy bill
would bar wagering on college sports, and high school and Olympic competitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevada is the only state that allows betting on college sports, but its
casinos and sports books do not take bets on high school sports and do only a
very limited business on the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevada's gambling industry took in $2.3 billion in sports wagers in fiscal
1999, earning nearly $99 million, according to the state Gaming Control Board.
Jason Been, an oddsmaker at Las Vegas Sports Consultants, estimated 40 percent
of the betting is on college sports.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming Association, said
banning legal college sports wagering will increase business for illegal bookies
and do nothing to stop gambling scandals on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
	   "We agree, totally, that illegal gambling activities on college campuses in
this country is a serious problem," said Fahrenkopf, who has consulted with his
Nevada casino members on how to fight the proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the NCAA should not expect the government to police its member
schools.
</P>
<P>
	   "The NCAA admits that on every major college campus in this country, there's
an illegal student bookie taking bets from students on NCAA events. Now, my
question is, who is best positioned in this country to do something about it?
It's the NCAA," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're talking about activities taking place on their campuses, with their
students and their games, and they're trying to point a finger at the legal
sports books in Nevada, where in order to place a bet you have to be physically
present in the state of Nevada, and 21 years of age."
</P>
<P>
	   Congress last considered sports betting legislation nine years ago. The
result was a law signed by President George Bush banning sports wagering in the
47 states where it was not then legal. In addition to Nevada, the exemptions
were for Oregon, which allows betting on pro football through a lottery, and
Delaware, which has not adopted sports betting despite a 1976 public vote
approving it.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey was given a one-year window to decide whether to sanction sports
gambling in Atlantic City, but the state Legislature did not muster enough votes
to hold a public referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., believes New Jersey casinos should be
allowed to offer such wagering, but supports Nevada's practice of banning bets
on games taking place within the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sports betting is a reality in our country," Torricelli said. "There isn't
a high school locker room or local bar where people do not bet sports."

<HEADLINE> NU, utility regulators discuss sale of nuclear plants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) - Northeast Utilities and state regulators
Thursday hashed out the details of how to sell NU's nuclear power plants as
foreseen in the electric deregulation law.
<P>
	   Leaders of NU and consumer advocates agreed that the state should try to get
the highest possible price for the plants, but differed on the best way to do
it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Public Utility Control is scheduled to set the ground
rules for the sale of the plants on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale of plants is meant to divorce Connecticut from a regulated power
system to a system where the price for power is subject to the free market and
competition. The deregulation law is intended to lower electricity prices and
bring better service.
</P>
<P>
	   The law requires the plants to be auctioned by the end of 2003, if NU wants
to collect "stranded costs," or future payments from customers to cover debts
the utility incurred under decades of regulation. The higher price the plants
get, the lower the stranded costs will be.
</P>
<P>
	   NU wants to sell the plants sooner, maybe as soon as this summer, since at
least four companies are interested in the plants and interest rates are low.
</P>
<P>
	   NU thinks it can get the highest price if the three Millstone plants in
Waterford are auctioned off as a group, including Millstone Unit 1, which is
being decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
	   The company hopes to start the auction in March and have a winning bidder by
August, pending regulatory approvals, said Bruce Kenyon, the head of NU's
nuclear operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seabrook Station plant in New Hampshire should be considered separately
and sold at a later time, when New Hampshire leaders approve a settlement
agreement with the company, said Michael Morris, the president, chairman and
chief executive of NU.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Johnson from the Office of Consumer Counsel questioned whether it
would be better to wait to include Seabrook in the auction, since that plant
combined with Millstone Unit 3 account for about 20 percent of the electric
power capacity in New England.
</P>
<P>
	   NU also had said when it bought the Seabrook plant that it could save $61
million in operation and maintenance costs by operating the two big plants
together, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   NU's leaders responded that the savings have not been nearly as great as
anticipated and that Connecticut should not wait on the sale of the Millstone
plants until New Hampshire leaders to decide what to do.
</P>
<P>
	   "Delaying the auction six months, we believe, would disserve customers in
Connecticut," Morris said.
</P>
<P>
	   Likewise, Kenyon said that companies interested in buying the Millstone
plants would want to buy all three plants at once, even though Millstone Unit 1
is no longer generating power and must go through the lengthy decommissioning
process.
</P>
<P>
	   "A buyer would prefer to control the entire site," Kenyon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenyon said one company interested in buying the Millstone plants is AmerGen
Energy Co., a consortium of a British company and PECO Energy Co. of
Philadelphia, which recently bought the operating reactor at Three Mile Island
and plans to buy Vermont Yankee.
</P>
<P>
	   Other interested companies are: Entergy Corp. of New Orleans, which operates
four nuclear power plants and is decommissioning Millstone 1; PECO and Virginia
Power, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Connecticut Coalition Against Millstone, which was allowed to
participate in some of Thursday's hearing, argued that the DPUC should require
bidders for the NU plants to demonstrate that they can operate the plants
safely. The group's lawyer, Nancy Burton, also said an escrow account should be
set up for decommissioning funds to ensure the money is not misused.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for NU said these issues will be addressed when the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission reviews plans to transfer the plants' operating licenses
once a bid is awarded.

<HEADLINE> Rescuers Reach S. Africa Miners  </HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL J. WAKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Rescuers, clawing with shovels and their
bare hands, broke through a wall of rock Thursday night to reach nine miners
entombed for four days below more than a mile of earth and rock.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors were examining the first of the rescued miners in an underground
area before bringing him to the surface, mine officials said. All were expected
to reach the surface Thursday night and would be taken to a hospital, mine
spokeswoman Merle Gouws said.
</P>
<P>
	   A short crawl away from where the miners had awaited rescue, four comrades
lay dead from Monday's rock fall at the African Rainbow Minerals gold mine in
Orkney, about 110 miles southwest of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
	   Hopes were fading that two severely injured miners were still alive.
Rescuers were moving toward them, Ms. Gouws said.
</P>
<P>
	   The rescue effort, progressing inch by agonizing inch, captured national
attention in a country built on mining, where hundreds die every year deep in
the earth's recesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Gold accounts for one-fifth of South Africa's export earnings. Pulling it
from the nation's shafts remains grueling and deadly work for the mainly black
employees despite safety improvements since the end of white minority rule in
1994. South African gold mines are particularly dangerous because they are among
the deepest in the world, and more subject to earth tremors like the one that
caused Monday's rock fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 200 rescuers, many from other mining companies, joined the effort in
Orkney, working in eight-hour shifts. They have dug through 300 tons of dirt and
rock, clearing a path through a 60-foot upward-sloping tunnel, said Peter
Steenkamp, the mine manager. At times, the passage was only 18 inches high,
forcing the rescuers to wriggle forward on elbows and knees.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Thursday, rescuers were able to speak to the main group of trapped
miners, Steenkamp said.
</P>
<P>
	   The rescuers used hand drills to bust up debris, winches to pull out
boulders and shovels and their hands to scoop away dirt and gravel, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rescuers were able to establish contact through the air pipe Tuesday
evening, after the miners spent 30 hours in isolation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first thing they wanted was water,'' mine spokeswoman Charmane Russell
said. ``They have since been in relatively good spirits, working with the
rescuers and quite calm, which is important.''
</P>
<P>
	   Through the tube, they were being sent water, a nutritional drink and
fluorescent tubes that throw off light when broken, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two workers were lying about 100 feet away from the main group. They had
been too severely hurt to move when the others made their way toward the main
shaft after the rock fall, Steenkamp said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two severely injured miners have been without food or water since
Monday, as it was too difficult for the other workers to get back to them. ``The
chances are not good'' that they would survive, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident victims were a cross-section of the South African mining
industry's workers, who number 430,000, more than half in gold mines. Eight were
from Lesotho, two from Mozambique, one from Swaziland and four from South
Africa. The migrant miners often support large extended families on average
salaries of $430 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, 312 workers died in mining accidents, according to the minerals and
energy ministry. The fatality rate has declined since 1993, from 1.08 per 1,000
minors in 1993 to 0.86 five years later. Serious accidents -- meaning four or
more dead -- have dropped from 14 in 1992 to one last year, the industry says.
</P>
<P>
	   The Orkney mine, which dates from the 1950s, was the scene of one of the
nation's worst mining accidents. In 1995, a mine train fell into an elevator
shaft on a carriage full of men, killing 104.
</P>
<P>
	   The mine was then owned by Anglo-American. The mining giant sold it in
January 1998 to black investors. Five miners have died there since, Ms. Russell
said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at New High 11,582.43  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today after a report of relatively modest
inflation boosted the bond market and calmed jittery stock investors. Financial
shares led the Dow Jones industrials to a new closing record.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow rose 31.33 to close at 11,582.43, just past its previous record of
11,572.20.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators also closed higher. The Nasdaq composite index
broke out of a two-day slump to finish up 107.24 at 3,957.26.
</P>
<P>
	   Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 17.46 to 1,449.71.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,861 up, 1,219 down and 427 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.02 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 968.78 million in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 11.15 to 501.19.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose after the Labor Department said inflation remained under control
in 1999. The department's Producer Price Index, which measures inflation
pressures before they reach the consumer, shot up 3 percent in 1999, the biggest
increase in nine years.
</P>
<P>
	   But most of the increase came from the volatile energy sector. Excluding
energy, wholesale prices rose just 0.9 percent last year. For December, the
index rose 0.3 percent, right on target with many analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports boosted investors' confidence that inflation is not escalating
quickly enough to merit sharp interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits as it
becomes more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed raised interest rates three times in 1999 in an effort to keep
inflation under control, and in recent sessions, stocks have been pressured by
fears that another series of rate hikes are ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's report eased some of those fears, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Fed is not behind the curve on inflation," said David Orr, chief
economist at First Union Securities Inc. While most analysts remain convinced
that the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points, or a quarter percentage point,
at its next meeting on Feb. 1 and 2, today's report suggested the Fed won't
increase rates beyond that amount, Orr said.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dipped to 6.65 percent from 6.71
percent late Wednesday, benefiting bank and brokerage stocks that often suffer
when rates are rising. J.P. Morgan and Citigroup rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Merger activity also enlivened the sector. U.S. Trust, an investment firm
that caters to wealthy clients, soared after agreeing to be acquired by online
and discount broker Charles Schwab for $2.7 billion, or about $129 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   "That deal has prompted many investors to look at this sector in a new light
and consider other possible combinations," said Ned Riley, chief investment
strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest development in the consolidating drug industry also sparked
buying. Warner-Lambert said today it would hold merger talks with hostile suitor
Pfizer, abandoning its November decision to be acquired by American Home
Products.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of all three companies rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks reversed two days of steep losses. Apple Computer rose
after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its rating on the stock to "outperform"
from "neutral." Analyst Gillian Munson applauded the company's strong product
pipeline and said Apple shares should reach 120 in a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Despite some weakness so far this year, there is still a strong conviction
that the money to be made in this market is in technology stocks," Riley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was fairly volatile as investors waited for more evidence on the
Fed's likely course. Tonight, Greenspan was to discuss technology and the
economy in a speech before the Economic Club of New York. Greenspan has
occasionally used his public speeches as an occasion to telegraph the Fed's
sentiment about the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   And Friday, the government will report on price pressures at the retail
level when it releases its Consumer Price Index. Analysts expect the index to
have risen 0.3 percent in December.

<HEADLINE> Credit Bureaus To Settle Charges  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's three major credit bureaus have agreed to
pay $2.5 million total to settle charges that consumers calling their toll-free
lines could not reach personnel to discuss credit reports, regulators said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Trade Commission alleged that the national consumer reporting
agencies -- Equifax Credit Information Services Inc., Experian Inc. and Trans
Union LLC -- blocked millions of calls from consumers during business hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers who wanted to talk about the contents of their credit report or
possible errors were met with busy signals or a message indicating that they
should call back because all representatives were occupied, the commission said.
Others were kept on hold for long amounts of time, the FTC said.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators charged that these practices constituted violations of the Fair
Credit Reporting Act. That law was amended in 1997 to require the major credit
bureaus to give consumers who receive copies of their credit report toll-free
telephone numbers to reach employees during business hours.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The reality is that consumers never got the access to the consumer
reporting agencies that the law guarantees,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of
the FTC's bureau of consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the FTC's complaint, more than a million callers trying to
reach Trans Union and Experian received a busy signal or a call back message.
The complaint against Equifax contains similar charges impacting hundreds of
thousands of customers.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of consumers were kept on hold for what the commission called
``unreasonable'' amounts of time, waiting to speak to personnel. The FTC also
charged that Equifax and Trans Union blocked incoming telephone calls from
certain area codes because they assumed those consumers should only be handled
by their affiliates.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC said the bureaus have to permit such calls to go through.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the terms of the consent agreement, the three companies must answer
consumers' calls within three minutes and thirty seconds on average. In
addition, 90 percent of consumers who call the bureaus must be connected to
personnel without getting a busy signal.
</P>
<P>
	   Experian, which receives about 1 million phone calls to its consumer
assistance center each month, pledged that representatives would be available to
consumers who have a copy of a credit report from the bureau. Automated systems
would be used when appropriate, said the Ohio corporation which operates out of
Orange, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Experian and Trans Union will pay $1 million, while Equifax has agreed to
pay $500,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlanta-based Equifax asserted that the commission's allegations only
referred to a very small percentage of its customers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We handle 99.9 percent with a high degree of accuracy,'' said Alan Boyer,
the company's vice president of communications. Boyer said his credit bureau has
already instituted the standards required by the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Trans Union, based in Chicago, has made additional investments by installing
new phone systems and expanding its staffing to enhance its service, said the
company's consumer relations vice president Dave Wolff. He said the company
would work to exceed the standards set by the FTC.
</P>
<P>
	   The bureaus also have agreed to conduct internal audits to ensure they are
complying with guidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed settlements were filed Thursday in U.S. District Courts in
Illinois, Georgia and Texas by the Justice Department, on behalf of the FTC.

<HEADLINE> Koch Industries Fined for Pollution  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the country's largest oil pipeline operators, Koch
Industries, agreed Thursday to pay $35 million in penalties for leaking 3
million gallons of oil into lakes and streams in six states.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said it was the biggest civil fine ever levied under the
Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement resolved two lawsuits charging that for years Koch's pipeline
subsidiary had left thousands of miles of pipeline in disrepair, leading to
hundreds of oil leaks. The settlement singled out 300 leaks 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch, based in Wichita, Kan., is a privately held company that operates more
than 35,000 miles of oil and gas pipeline in the United States and Canada. Koch
has refineries in Texas and Minnesota through its Koch Petroleum Group
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
	   The spills polluted waterways in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Alabama, Louisiana
and Missouri, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
	   EPA Administrator Carol Browner called Koch's actions ``egregious
violations'' and said the fine ``sends a strong message that those who try to
profit by polluting our environment pay a price.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This record civil penalty puts those who transport hazardous materials on
notice,'' added Attorney General Janet Reno in a statement. ``We will not let
you foul our water and spoil our land by breaking the law.''
</P>
<P>
	   Koch Industries, through its pipeline subsidiary, said the settlement was
``fair and reasonable'' and that it will avoid any additional litigation. The
government originally had sought between $71 million and $214 million in
penalties, the maximum under the Clean Water Act, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have always sought to operate our pipelines with the highest safety and
environmental standards,'' said Pat McCann, the Koch pipeline subsidiary's
senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   The government, in the complaints filed in 1995 and 1997, claimed Koch could
have prevented most of the spills, caused mainly by corrosion, through prompt
maintenance and safe operations. Under the settlement, Koch must examine 2,500
miles of pipeline and repair defects.
</P>
<P>
	   As a privately held company, Koch Industries does not have to report annual
profits and revenues. It has been estimated the company's had $30 billion in
revenue last year from an array of businesses from oil refining and transporting
to chemical production and cattle ranching.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the settlement, Koch pays $30 million in fines, half of which will go
into the federal trust fund for cleaning up oil spills; the other half goes to
the state of Texas, which had joined in the lawsuits. An additional $5 million
goes to preserve wetlands in Kansas and Oklahoma, conduct a pipeline safety
study, and aid environmental programs in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Browner said the fine was the largest ever against a single company under
the Clean Water Act, surpassing a $12.6 million fine against Smithfield Foods
Inc. in 1997 for dumping hog waste into Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been much larger settlements, involving air or water pollution,
but they generally have focused all or largely on cleanup costs. These include
the 1989 Exxon tanker disaster in Alaska and last year's $150 million settlement
-- all cleanup expenditures -- with General Electric Co., over toxic chemical
pollution of a river in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years ago the EPA reached a $1 billion settlement -- including $100
million in penalties -- with seven diesel engine manufacturer accused of
tampering with air pollution control devices.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil spills cited by the EPA in its case against Koch stretched across
six states, but were concentrated in Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the cases cited by the EPA:
</P>
<P>
	   --221,000 gallons of oil spilled into a creek in Payne County, Okla., in
1992 also contaminating Keystone Lake, a popular recreation area 25 miles away.	
  --Rupture of a 47-year-old pipeline in 1994 on the Texas Gulf coast sending
90,300 gallons of oil into a creek, causing a 12-mile slick that contaminated
wetlands and ecologically sensitive areas along Nueces Bay and Corpus Christi
Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   --A spill of 79,000 gallons of gasoline from a pipeline near Wichita, Kan.,
in 1994, causing the evacuation of homes and the shutting down of a public water
supply system.
</P>
<P>
	   --Rupture of a pipeline north of Tulsa, Okla., in 1996 that spilled 103,950
gallons of oil into a creek, contaminating a lake that provides drinking water.
</P>
<P>
	   --Release of 62,790 gallons of oil from a corroded pipeline near Dallas-Fort
Worth in 1996, polluting the Hagerman National Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
	   On its Internet Web page, Koch Industries touts its environmental record,
saying it has spent $980 million for environmental protection at refineries and
other facilities since 1990. It claims to have reduced pipeline leaks by more
than 90 percent over the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Buying Hughes Satellite Unit  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hughes Electronics Corp., one-time maker of airplanes
and spy satellites, put a big bet on the New Economy Thursday with a $3.75
billion cash deal to sell its satellite-building unit business to Boeing Co. and
focus on entertainment and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
	   The pact turns Boeing into the world's biggest commercial satellite maker,
and allows Hughes executives to pursue their goal of becoming a dominant player
in the world of high-speed wireless communications.
</P>
<P>
	   "Boeing intends to be No. 1 in space. This acquisition is a significant step
forward in executing our goal of becoming the industry leader in integrated,
space-based information and communications," said Phil Condit, Boeing chairman
and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Analsyts found little to criticize in the deal, which meshes Hughes'
expertise in satellite hardware with Boeing's Delta and SeaLaunch rocket
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   In the deal, Boeing also gets Hughes' Electron Dynamics and Spectrolab,
which make satellite components. The three businesses being acquired by Boeing
have a combined workforce of about 9,000 employees, primarily in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes is expected to use proceeds from the sale to expand DirecTV, the
satellite-to-home TV service, and develop Skywave, a wireless broadband system
that will target the Internet and other communications systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Both ventures promise to make Hughes, already the leader in wireless TV
services, a key player in the rapidly meshing entertainment and communications
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   "Broadband communications, Internet access is really the wave of the future,
and Hughes is in a position to move into that really quickly," said Marco
Caceres, an analyst with Teal Group in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is a trend in the whole satellite market. Companies that
traditionally have built hardware are getting into satellite services, because
that's where the real money is being made," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes executives had said in the past they wanted to keep their commercial
satellite operations as a compliment to DirecTV, which has with more than 8
million subscribers. That was before Hughes ran through more than $5 billion
promoting DirecTV, buying up its competitors and developing Starwave.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes spent more than $2 billion made from the sale of Hughes Aircraft to
Raytheon in 1997. In addition, the company piled up an estimated $3.3 billion in
long-term debt, said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, Hughes executives decided the potential of those ventures
outweighed the advantages of hanging onto satellite manufacturing, an industry
that has been chilled by launch failures and allegations of unauthorized
technology transfers by U.S. companies to China.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they wanted to grow that investment intensive part of their business,
they had to get some cash. I think they came to a conclusion that the satellite
manufacturing business was expendable," Nisbet said.

<HEADLINE> Authorities in New Jersey arrest suspect in Holyoke shootings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HOLYOKE, Mass. (AP) - A man suspected of fatally shooting two Holyoke
men and wounding a 4-year-old child has been arrested in New Jersey.
<P>
	   Ramon Santana, 25, was captured in Jersey City, N.J., on Wednesday
afternoon, police said. He was held without bail pending arraignment in Hudson
County Superior Court in New Jersey on fugitive charges.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for the Hampden County District Attorney's office said
Thursday it was not immediately clear when Santana might be returned to
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   Arrest warrants were issued for Santana last Friday on two counts of murder
and one count of attempted murder in connection with the Jan. 3 fatal shootings
of Gregory Cantela, 23, and Abraham Candelario, 27, and the wounding of
Cantela's 4-year-old son, who has not been identified.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy, who was shot in the chest, was released from Baystate Medical
Center in Springfield on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Massachusetts law enforcement officials tipped off Jersey City police that
Santana, who previously lived in New Jersey, might be in their area, the
Springfield Union-News reported. Officials said Santana had a relative living
there.
</P>
<P>
	   The shootings come on the heels of a difficult time for Holyoke.
</P>
<P>
	   Police officer John DiNapoli was shot to death Dec. 22. In August, a church
and much of a city block burned in a downtown fire. Two juveniles were later
charged with arson in connection with the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Two rallies have been planned to unite the community and spread an
anti-violence message.
</P>
<P>
	   One was to be held Friday, and the second on Monday, Martin Luther King Day.

<HEADLINE> SCI To Lay Off 1,141 Workers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HOUSTON (AP) -- Service Corp. International said it will lay off 1,141
employees and take a $273 million restructuring charge, causing the world's
largest funeral and cemetery company to miss its earnings estimate for the
current quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston-based SCI said it will fall short of its previous earnings estimate
of 14 to 18 cents per share for its fiscal fourth quarter. Quarterly and fiscal
year-end results are due out in February.
</P>
<P>
	   SCI's stock has lost about four-fifths of its value in the past 12 months
after a series of earnings warnings and shortfalls. Analysts say SCI and other
funeral companies expanded too aggressively by buying up independent operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The layoffs, announced Wednesday night, will cost SCI $151 million in
severance pay.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the workers to be fired, 385 are based in North America. Many of them are
former owners of independent funeral homes and cemeteries bought out by the
company. They had been kept on as employees, hired as consultants or signed to
noncompete contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Another 715 international operations employees will be released, many of

<HEADLINE> Antisocial Behavior in Boys Studied  </HEADLINE>
    By ERIC FIDLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Very aggressive boys have been found to have
lower-than-expected levels of a stress hormone in their saliva, suggesting that
their behavior might be biologically based and hard to treat with counseling,
researchers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers reported in the January issue of the Archives of General
Psychiatry that extreme antisocial behavior in boys ages 7 to 12 appears to be
related to low cortisol levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Cortisol is typically released in response to fear, such as fear of
punishment for misbehaving. Its low levels in the antisocial boys might indicate
that they do not fear the possible consequences of their actions, said Keith
McBurnett, a child psychologist at the University of Chicago medical school who
led the study.
</P>
<P>
	   "Perhaps what we're dealing with here is a biological propensity that's
resistant to treatment, which is very troubling," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The implication is that we may need to discard our traditional notions of
treatment with these kids in favor of trying to help them fit in and find a
niche in society where their aggressiveness and lack of a sense of danger is an
asset."
</P>
<P>
	   McBurnett said a more appropriate treatment might include drugs similar to
those given to hyperactive children.
</P>
<P>
	   The four-year project studied such symptoms as starting fights, using
weapons, stealing and forcing sexual acts. McBurnett acknowledged that the
sample was small -- just 38 boys -- but said the correlation between cortisol
and "childhood-onset conduct disorder" was very strong.
</P>
<P>
	   The disorder is characterized by severely antisocial behavior such as animal
cruelty and weapon use that shows up before age 10. Children with the disorder
often grow up to account for a disproportionate percentage of crimes, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a third of the boys with low cortisol were labeled by peers as the
meanest in their class. The 12 children with the lowest levels of cortisol
averaged 5.2 symptoms of conduct disorder, while the 26 with higher levels
averaged 1.5 symptoms. And 11 of the 12 with low cortisol developed aggressive
symptoms before age 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. James M. Dabbs, a Georgia State University psychologist who has studied
hormones in saliva, said he found the report somewhat surprising but saw no
reason to doubt its findings.
</P>
<P>
	   "Low cortisol would make you bold," he said. In youngsters with low levels
of the hormone, "it doesn't bother them when you do things to them. It's hard to
make them behave."

<HEADLINE> Schwab To Acquire U.S. Trust Corp.  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- While most large brokerage firms are reaching out to small,
individual investors, the Charles Schwab Corp., which has already captured that
market, reached out to wealthy investors Thursday through an agreement to buy
U.S. Trust Corp. for $2.9 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
	   In a move reminiscent of America Online's proposed acquisition earlier this
week of old line media company Time Warner, discount and online brokerage firm
Schwab -- founded just 25 years ago -- has acquired one of the nation's oldest
and most respected investment firms in U.S. Trust.
</P>
<P>
	   New York-based U.S. Trust has provided investment advice and private banking
services to some of America's wealthiest families since 1853.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were enthusiastic about the deal, snatching up shares of U.S.
Trust and sending its stock price soaring $54.12 1/2, or by 69 percent, to $133.
Schwab shares rose 2.62 1/2, or by 7 percent, to 40.25 as of the 4 p.m. EST
close of the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wealthy Americans have traditionally used a significant amount of
handholding when it came to their investments. But they, along with the rest of
the U.S. population, want to have more of a say in managing their financial
affairs. This combination allows them to do that," said Tim Butler, a research
analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
	   The move was designed to fill existing gaps in both Schwab's and U.S.
Trust's current array of services, company officials said during a news
conference in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwab, based in San Francisco, is the largest U.S. online brokerage and
biggest discount brokerage.
</P>
<P>
	   But it was unable to meet the needs of its wealthiest clients, said company
founder and co-chief executive Charles R. Schwab. "Our customers are saying they
need more wealth management," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wealthy investors, meanwhile, have shown an increased desire to participate
in the online investing revolution sweeping Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies said there are more than 6 million U.S. households with a net
worth of over $1 million, and that the numbers of Americans with large
investment portfolios is expected to grow at a double-digit pace in the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
	   "The affluent market is the growth engine of investable assets in the U.S.,"
added Schwab president and co-CEO David Pottruck.
</P>
<P>
	   Millionaires currently comprise just 5 percent of Schwab's 6.4 million
customers, while U.S. Trust's core customers have more than $5 million each to
invest.
</P>
<P>
	   Pottruck said he decided to court U.S. Trust shortly after he became a U.S.
Trust customer in 1998. Noting the irony, Pottruck said Schwab "couldn't provide
my private banking services so I went to U.S. Trust."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to such private banking services as checking accounts, credit
lines and mortgage loans, New York-based U.S. Trust also helps clients create
trust funds to assist in passing on their considerable wealth to the next
generation.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwab will now be able to offer those services through its U.S. Trust unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the agreement, U.S. Trust shareholders will receive 3.427 shares of
Schwab stock for each share of U.S. Trust stock, or $137.94 in stock for each
U.S. Trust share, based on Thursday's stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies will retain their separate brand identities.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal is subject to approval by the Federal Reserve Board and other
regulators and to a vote by U.S. Trust shareholders. The companies said they
expect to complete the sale by July.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Miffed at Venezuelan Refusal  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials expressed dismay Thursday at Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez's refusal to accept two shiploads of U.S. troops and
equipment to help recovery from devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
	   One ship en route was slowed down and another held back at a North Carolina
port while officials sought clarification of remarks by Chavez, who said he does
not want U.S. soldiers in his country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, we were surprised by the reported comments,'' said Pentagon
spokesman Ken Bacon, indicating that U.S. officials had not heard directly from
Chavez's government on the matter. The Pentagon had started deployment of 450
U.S. Marine and Navy engineers to help rebuild a coastal road damaged by Dec. 15
flooding that killed thousands of Venezuelans.
</P>
<P>
	   They were expected to work in Venezuela for two months or more.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly, if they don't want the help, we won't provide it,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
	   At the State Department, spokesman James P. Rubin said, ``We're asking the
government of Venezuela for clarification.'' He cited a Dec. 24 letter in which
Venezuela's defense minister ``specifically requested the assistance of U.S.
military engineers to open up a humanitarian corridor for flood-ravaged coastal
communities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said the deployment was authorized after close coordination with
Venezuelan authorities and as part of a $25 million U.S. aid package.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez's government earlier welcomed U.S. help, including about 120 soldiers
operating water purification facilities, Blackhawk helicopters, C-130 cargo
planes and a C-5 Galaxy cargo plane. Their continued deployment remained in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   The USS Tortuga and the USS Nashville were to transport bulldozers, tractors
and engineering equipment along with the troops to operate and maintain them.
The Tortuga was being slowed down in its trip and the Nashville was held at
Moorhead City, N.C., until the Venezuelan position is clarified, Pentagon
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Chavez told reporters that while Venezuela still needs more
money, equipment and other materials, additional relief workers are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to clarify before Venezuela and the world that North American
troops are not going to come to Venezuela,'' Chavez said. ``If they want to send
machines or other types of equipment we are open to that, and we are very
thankful for the intention to help.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bacon said U.S. equipment cannot be supplied without people to run it,
maintain it and bring it back home after the work is done.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez, a former army paratrooper elected a year ago, has been accused by
opponents of using the floods and killer mudslides to consolidate his power,
eliminating Congress, replacing the Supreme Court and hand-picking top judicial
officials. Chavez's backers say he is merely taking steps mandated in his
election victory to crush a corrupt oligarchy and help the nation's poor.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez has bolstered relations with communist Cuba and has been critical of
U.S. global influence. He earlier refused to allow U.S. planes to fly over
Venezuela in anti-narcotics operations.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Tax Credit Proposed  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Put away those postage stamps. President Clinton wants to
give taxpayers a credit of up to $10 if they file their income tax returns
electronically instead of using old-fashioned snail mail.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Thursday, is to
simultaneously encourage more people to file returns via either the Internet or
the telephone and improve efficiency at the much-maligned Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's good for them. It's good for the IRS. It's good for the system,''
Summers said in announcing the proposed credit at a conference on modernizing
the nation's tax collector.
</P>
<P>
	   The president will ask Congress in his fiscal 2001 budget to approve a $10
credit for people who file returns electronically, either on their home
computers or through a tax professional. For people who use the IRS telephone
filing system called Telefile, the credit would be $5. Cost estimates to the
government were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
	   Using money as an incentive marks a departure from the IRS campaign that is
selling e-filing as more accurate, as a quicker route to a refund -- an average
of 20 days instead of 40 -- and as the only way to get a specific confirmation
that the return was received by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With anything that involves changing people's habits, you need a little
push,'' said IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti. ``It's really designed to
accelerate what was happening anyway.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, electronic tax filing has grown dramatically over the past few
years, including a 19 percent increase last year. About 34 million returns -- a
little over one in four -- will be filed by computer or telephone this year, up
from 29.3 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   But the pace is not swift enough to meet a goal set by Congress in the 1998
IRS reform law for 80 percent e-filing by 2007. Indeed, the most recent IRS
projection is for about half of all returns to be e-filed by that date.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is, to be sure, more that needs to be done,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some people remain reluctant to put their sensitive tax data on line, while
others fear they could be more easily targeted for an audit if they file
electronically -- a fear the IRS says is unfounded. Many people, however, won't
file electronically because the fees are usually many times the cost of a
33-cent postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed tax credit would eliminate the cost factor, said Bob
Weinberger, government relations vice president at H&AMP;R Block Inc., the nation's
largest tax preparer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are comfortable doing it a certain way,'' he said. ``This is likely
to push a lot of people across the line who might have been saying, 'What's in
it for me?'''
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means
Committee, poked fun at the proposal. ``What's next -- a tax credit for good
penmanship?'' said the Texas Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossotti also told the conference Thursday that improved technology --
including more electronic filing -- is critical to improving the IRS's ability
to respond to taxpayer problems and questions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our purpose is not to move some imaginary pendulum back or forth a few
degrees,'' Rossotti said. ``Our purpose is to improve the entire way the IRS
works.''
</P>
<P>
	   As part of its modernization effort, the IRS is remaking its structure into
four operating divisions: one each for individual taxpayers, large businesses,
small businesses and tax-exempt organizations. The new structure is expected to
be in place by October.
</P>
<P>
	   John Dalrymple, who will head the new Wage and Investment Division that
includes the vast majority of taxpayers, said the IRS hopes within five years to
be able to communicate directly with taxpayers via secure e-mail. That would
allow completely paperless filing with PIN numbers in place of physical
signatures and provide tax refunds within two days, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to position ourselves to make full use of the Internet,''
Dalrymple said.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers said the president would ask Congress for a substantial increase in
the IRS budget for fiscal 2001 to continue an ongoing replacement of the
agency's antiquated, tape-driven taxpayer computer records and to prevent any
further reduction in employees. The job cutbacks are frequently cited as one
reason -- along with fallout from the IRS reform law -- that the agency is doing
fewer audits and enforcement actions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To have effective tax administration, there must be both compliance and
high-quality customer service,'' Summers said.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Says it Erred in Y2K Fix  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon acknowledged Thursday that it had erred in
its approach to testing a Y2K correction for one of its key
intelligence-processing computers prior to New Year's Eve. The computer system
broke down that night, interrupting the flow of spy satellite data for several
hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the Pentagon would have had
to shut down temporarily the intelligence computer system in order to make an
``end-to-end'' test of its Y2K fix. Instead, the decision was to test the fix
piecemeal, allowing the system to keep running, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They tested it in sections, and it turned out that it was a mistake
because the sections didn't fit together -- the sections of the fix,'' Bacon
said. He said this was the only significant Y2K breakdown among the several
thousand Pentagon computer systems that were fixed at a cost of $3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The computer system with the glitch is operated by the Pentagon's highly
secretive National Reconnaissance Office.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Bacon said some aspects of the problem could not be discussed
publicly because of the sensitivity of U.S. spy satellite operations, the
Chicago Tribune reported Thursday that the computer system that broke down was
at a satellite ground station at Fort Belvoir, Va., south of Washington, D.C.
The Tribune reported that the satellite signals were redirected to a receiving
station in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tribune also reported that U.S. photo reconnaissance satellites were all
but blinded by the Y2K breakdown for nearly three days.
</P>
<P>
	   Bacon denied this. He said the outage lasted only a few hours before a
backup system was in place. The backup gave the Pentagon only 50 percent of its
normal capacity initially, but that rose to about 90 percent by the time the
regular system was fully fixed Sunday night, Jan. 2, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We lost a little corner of part of our total intelligence take for several
hours. That's what happened,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tribune's Washington bureau chief, James Warren, said in response to
Bacon's comments: ``We understand that ultimately there can be honest debate
about how serious this problem was, but we unequivocally stand behind what
multiple sources told us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other Pentagon officials previously acknowledged that a portion of the
satellite imagery was lost due to the computer breakdown, and they have insisted
that this did not jeopardize national security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At no time were we blinded,'' Bacon said. ``This has been a canard that's
been thrown around in the press from day one. At no time were our intelligence
collection systems blinded. That is because we have redundant systems designed
precisely to deal with a variety of situations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bacon said the several-hour outage on New Year's Eve was not more
troublesome than interruptions that sometimes occur due to weather or other
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was well within the type of temporary interruption that we experience
on a fairly regular basis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bacon said Vice Adm. Thomas Wilson, director of the Defense Intelligence
Agency, told him the New Year's Eve computer problem had only a ``very, very,
very marginal'' impact on the nation's defense readiness.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Search for Rebels  </HEADLINE>
   By LYOMA TURPALOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHALI, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops, battered by surprise rebel
counterattacks in Chechnya, were placed on alert Thursday and dug deep trenches
in vulnerable villages to fend off new attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   After making steady progress against Chechen rebels since ground troops
entered the republic in September, the Russian offensive stalled this week:
Rebels attacked towns that Russian forces claimed to control and put up fierce
resistance in Grozny, the capital, where fighters are entrenched in the center.
</P>
<P>
	   The Interfax news agency, citing sources in the federal command for
Chechnya, said 33 Russian soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours in
Chechnya. Until recent days, Russian forces had claimed losses of no more than
one or two soldiers a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia claimed to have retaken control of the towns of Argun and Shali this
week. But fighting continued on the outskirts of Gudermes, Chechnya's
second-largest city, said Lt. Col. Anatoly Yurasov, the deputy head of an
Interior Ministry mobile unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian forces continued heavily shelling Grozny and troops were fighting
rebels from trenches in some of the city's neighborhoods, Interfax reported,
citing military sources. The report described the situation in Grozny as
essentially unchanged from recent days.
</P>
<P>
	   In Shali and Argun, Russian troops dug deep trenches in preparation for
possibly having to fend off rebels again, the NTV television channel reported.
Other units surrounded rebel formations in four other towns in the Shali region,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the rebels' weekend counterattacks, all military checkpoints and
stations in Russian-controlled areas of Chechnya have been placed on alert and
provided with additional ammunition and armored vehicles, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In another move to weaken the rebels, Russia this week declared that all
males in Chechnya between ages 10 and 60 would be investigated for possible
involvement with the rebels, and be barred from entering or leaving Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Russians are barbarians,'' said Lyoma Gibishev, a Grozny resident who
was refused entry to Chechnya at a crossing point in Ingushetia. ``They're
demonstrating their helplessness, vulnerability and also their inhumanity.''
</P>
<P>
	   New York-based Human Rights Watch protested the Russian measure and the U.S.
State Department asked Russia for clarification of the new regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is essential that Russia respect the fundamental human rights of
civilians in and around Chechnya, not endanger the lives of noncombatants and
ensure freedom of movement for displaced persons,'' State Department spokesman
James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, the head of Russia's Federal Migration Service, Vladimir
Kalamanov, said the new restriction was justified.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is better to double-check than to start a bloody massacre on the
territory of Chechnya and (neighboring) Ingushetia,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian soldiers complain that many Chechens disguise their rebel ties with
sympathetic behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They come up to us in daytime and offer cigarettes and biscuits. And at
night they shoot at us,'' said Capt. Aleksei Samoshkin at an Interior Ministry
unit based in neighboring Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian airplanes and helicopters flew more than 70 combat missions over
Chechnya in the past 24 hours, the military said Thursday. Targets included
Argun and Shali, as well as the center of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent ground troops into Chechnya in late September after weeks of
airstrikes. The offensive aims at wiping out Chechnya-based rebels who twice
invaded the neighboring republic of Dagestan last summer and who are blamed for
apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia that killed about 300 people.

<HEADLINE> Golan Residents Await Peace  </HEADLINE>
   By RON KAMPEAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAJDAL SHAMS, Golan Heights (AP) -- Nayef Guzardin remembers his earliest
lesson in land mine detection.
</P>
<P>
	   He was 8, and his teacher told the class to bring in any lethal device they
could find -- in their backyards, in the apple orchards surrounding the village,
in the sheep meadows where their fathers worked.
</P>
<P>
	   His classmates collected an arsenal: anti-tank mines, anti-personnel mines,
hand grenades, bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   The teacher then delivered the lesson. He beat each child with a stick until
he promised never to touch military hardware again.
</P>
<P>
	   All except Guzardin. He knew better.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years earlier, Guzardin had picked up a curious device lying next to his
balcony. It blew off his forearm and scattered shrapnel throughout his body.
</P>
<P>
	   The International Campaign to Ban Landmines estimates there are 76
minefields planted across the Golan Heights, most by Israel and some by the
Syrian army.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents hope that after three decades of casualties -- 16 deaths and 200
injuries -- the mines will be cleared once there is peace between the hostile
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   The 18,000 Druse Arabs who live in four villages along the mountainous
demarcation line -- where most of the minefields lie -- have despaired of an
Israeli government they say cares more for its soldiers than the civilians who
live in the Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Druse -- members of a sect that broke with Islam in the 12th century --
say the army refuses to remove the mines and the Education Ministry has done
nothing to warn residents of their danger.
</P>
<P>
	   The army says minefields -- some planted as recently as two years ago -- are
the result of a hostile border. In all cases, the army insists, the fields are
clearly marked.
</P>
<P>
	   But the barbed-wire fence surrounding a two-acre minefield on the frontier
is broken in many places, and only two ``Danger, Mines'' signs have survived the
elements and brushfires set by troops seeking to prevent cross-border
incursions.
</P>
<P>
	   The fence borders on an orchard where village children help pick apples each
autumn. In November, four teen-agers working the orchard were wounded when an
anti-personnel mine exploded while they examined it at home. One lost a leg.
</P>
<P>
	   It was an all too familiar story to Saleh Baarar, who lost his right leg,
right hand and right eye in 1982, when he was 14.

	   He was playing in a sheep meadow his family owned, when his cousin handed
him what looked like a green jar -- a hand grenade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How was I to know what warfare looked like?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
	   Teaching children how to detect land mines and other lethal devices is
virtually unknown in Israel. Education Ministry spokesman David Gorali listed a
few informal courses -- none aimed at the Druse children in the Golan.
London-based Save the Children, which operates courses in other land
mine-intensive areas, has no Golan program.
</P>
<P>
	   The Druse do not blame discrimination for the laissez-faire attitude. They
note that Jewish settlers and tourists -- including Jerry White, now director of
the Washington, D.C.-based Landmine Survivors Network -- have also fallen
victims to mines.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is just pure thick headedness,'' said Salman Saharadeen, a Druse
activist who campaigns for the Golan's return to Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Such ignorance can be lethal in this terraced village near the
Israeli-Syrian demarcation line, where land mines loosened by winter snows
tumble into backyards.
</P>
<P>
	   That was what took the life of Amir Abu Jabel, a 4-year-old killed in his
front yard as he picked flowers in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   The risk to civilians is outweighed by the risk to troops, the army says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In certain cases, the security danger to soldiers in working in an area
that is mined or highly suspected of being mined is higher than the danger that
citizens will be harmed from them,'' the army spokesman's office said.
</P>
<P>
	   That enrages local Druse, who note that the army lends its de-mining skills
to countries such as Cambodia and Africa, while ignoring the Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Am I a resident or just paying taxes?'' asks Baarar, who rebuilt his life
and now owns two businesses inside Israel. ``Clean up your house and then go
elsewhere.''

<HEADLINE> Wholesale Level Inflation Up 3 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A big jump in gasoline prices helped pushed inflation at
the wholesale level up 3 percent last year, the largest gain since 1990 when
Iraq invaded Kuwait and drove up energy costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices were tame otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department's Producer Price Index, released Thursday, showed
inflation in most other areas was relatively well-behaved. A second government
report said consumer spending roared ahead, boosting retail sales 8.9 percent
last year, the fastest pace since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding energy and food, wholesale prices rose just 0.9 percent last year,
even better than a 2.5 percent increase in 1998 and evidence inflation remains
under control, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We got kicked by energy prices last year but if you threw energy out it was
a good year. Inflation was contained," said Donald Ratajczak, director of
Georgia State University's economic forecasting project.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy prices, which fell steeply in 1998 as the Asian currency crisis
depressed global demand, rose 18.4 percent last year. Gasoline prices surged
76.4 percent, the biggest gain in more than 19 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Production limits by oil-producing nations and increase demand from
recovering economies in Asia accounted for the increase in energy costs last
year, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   For December, the PPI, which measures inflation pressures before they reach
the consumer, was up 0.3 percent, reflecting sharp increases in gasoline and
other energy prices. Some economists believe energy costs will moderate this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The 3 percent advance in last year's wholesale prices was the largest annual
gain since a 5.7 percent rise in 1990. In 1998, overall wholesale prices were
flat.
</P>
<P>
	   The government was reporting Friday on price pressures at the retail level
with the release of the Consumer Price Index. Analysts were expecting prices to
rise 0.3 percent in December and in the range of 2.8 percent for the year. In
1998, consumer prices rose 1.6 percent. But the "core" rate of inflation, which
excludes energy and food, was expected to be lower than 1998's core rate of 2.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a burst of holiday shopping pushed retailers' sales up by a
bigger-than-expected 1.2 percent in December, capping a year where robust
consumer spending fueled economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   "The consumer engine is still pulling the economic train and doing so very
strongly," said Tim O"Neill, chief economist for the Bank of Montreal and Harris
Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times last year to slow the
economy and keep inflation from escalating. With projections for continuing
strong economic growth, most economists believe Fed policy-makers will bump up
interest rates again, probably by a quarter of a percentage point, when they
meet next on Feb. 1-2. The strong retail sales report would justify such a move,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial markets ignored the strong retail sales report, focusing instead
on the market-friendly news of benign inflation. The Dow Jones industrial
average reached a new record, closing up 31.33 points at 11,582.43. The Nasdaq
composite index broke out of a two-day slump to finish up 107.24 at 3,957.26,
according to preliminary calculations. Bond prices rose as yields on the 30-year
Treasury bonds dipped to 6.65 percent from 6.71 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the inflation front, energy prices rose 1.2 percent in December, led by a
8.5 percent jump in gasoline prices, the biggest gain since August.
</P>
<P>
	   Food costs rose 0.4 percent in December, pushing the total increase for 1999
to 0.9 percent, compared with a 0.1 percent gain for all of 1998. Sharp
increases in the prices of beef, pork, and vegetables in December offset
decreases in the prices of eggs, turkeys and fish.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside food and energy, wholesale prices rose a scant 0.1 percent in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment
benefits was unchanged at 309,000 for the week that ended Saturday. But the
four-week moving average, which smoothes out week-to-week volatility, was
294,000, a level economists said indicates that employers continue to scramble
to find scarce workers.

<HEADLINE> Retirees' HMOs Said Overpaid  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- HMOs that enroll senior citizens get billions of dollars
too much from Medicare because their fees are based on overblown cost estimates,
government investigators say.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report released Thursday, Health and Human Services Department
Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said investigators found ``compelling
information that managed care companies are financially benefitting from the
present process used to calculate the Medicare monthly capitation payments.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 6 million of Medicare's 39 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries
are enrolled in HMOs -- private health plans that accept a flat monthly fee from
the government to provide all needed care.
</P>
<P>
	   Current HMO fees are based on a formula set by Congress in 1997, which
predicted retirees' medical costs in that year to be 4.2 percent higher than
they actually turned out to be, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because HMO payment increases in subsequent years have been added to the
1997 base rate, the 4.2 percent overpayments persist from year to year. The
report said if that continues, it would mean $11 billion in overpayments over
the next five years and $34 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Medicare administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle said in a letter responding to the
report that President Clinton has proposed legislation to change the way HMO
fees are calculated, eliminating the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   That legislation, however, has not been approved by Congress. Lawmakers
voted last fall to give HMOs a raise after many pulled out of the Medicare
business in 1999 complaining that they are not paid enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the American Association of Health Plans,
noted that even taking into account the new report's conclusions -- which the
group disagrees with -- HMOs get paid less per Medicare patient than the average
amount the government spends for those not enrolled in an HMO.
</P>
<P>
	   HHS investigators, however, have concluded that the health plans are
overpaid in other ways as well. In a report last year, Brown noted that
Medicare's 11 percent overall rate of overpayments due to fraud and errors is
also built into the formula for HMO fees, for example.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Would Boost Spending Limits  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose boosting stringent
spending limits enacted three years ago by billions of dollars, Democrats say,
bowing to pressures generated by this fall's elections and the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Eager to join congressional Democrats in showering their districts with
campaign-year federal dollars, many Republicans seem open to raising the limits.
But since GOP lawmakers also want to preserve the bulk of the surplus for tax
cuts, they have not decided what, if anything, to do.
</P>
<P>
	   There is no doubt that by either ignoring the limits or changing them, the
limits will be surpassed this year by tens of billions of dollars. They were
breached last year by $32 billion and the year before too, as both parties
indulged in a spending splurge and budget gimmickry, like declaring the census
an emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, formally raising the spending caps would have the symbolic
significance of bidding a bipartisan farewell to tight restraints envisioned in
1997, when federal deficits prevailed. It would also underline that with
swelling annual surpluses, politicians believe the voters have little taste for
such spending restrictions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A big yawn,'' former Congressional Budget Office Director Robert
Reischauer said of public reaction if the limits are raised. Reischauer is
senior fellow at the liberal Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
	   Boosting the limits could give Clinton a political edge over Republicans.
Since surplus projections are based partly on assumptions about future spending,
higher spending means less money left for the tax cuts many Republicans want,
including GOP presidential front runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, the strong economy is producing so much federal revenue that many
Republicans feel there could be enough money for both extra spending and tax
cuts. And with the GOP eager to end this year's session of Congress early for
the fall campaign, a deal to raise the limits might limit time-consuming fights
over spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will propose letting spending rise somewhat below the inflation
rate, said Democratic officials speaking on condition of anonymity, but other
details were not available. The plan will be in the fiscal 2001 budget the
president presents Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Potentially, it could allow tens of billions of dollars to be spent next
year -- and hundreds of billions over the next decade -- beyond what the limits
would permit.
</P>
<P>
	   The spending caps, aimed at restraining one-third of the $1.7 trillion
federal budget, were set in the 1997 bipartisan pact to eliminate annual
deficits by 2002. The budget was balanced in 1998, thanks to the surprisingly
robust economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The limits affect all spending except automatically paid benefits like
Social Security and payments to holders of federal debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Under current law, the caps would force such spending downward from $613
billion in fiscal 2000 -- which runs through Sept. 30 -- to $579 billion in 2001
and $570 billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The limits are due to expire after that. Some officials said Clinton might
propose extending the spending caps for several more years.
</P>
<P>
	   White House economic adviser Gene Sperling declined to say if Clinton will
propose raising the limits, but said Republicans ``shredded the caps'' last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our goal this year will be to have a tough but straightforward path'' for
paying off the $3.3 trillion debt the government owes the public, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Republicans abandoned the spending caps after finding they lacked
the votes to support them. Only a few conservatives complained.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the GOP promised to not spend the two-thirds of the $3 trillion
federal surplus projected through 2009 coming from Social Security, a pledge
they believe the public more readily understands.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., called last month
for raising the limits. Neither House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., nor Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., have ruled it out.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, Republicans might propose raising the limits in exchange for
reserving parts of the surplus for tax cuts or debt reduction, aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to establish a new reality that restrains spending in an era of
surpluses'' and would ``leave room for a Bush tax-cut plan,'' said Terry Holt,
spokesman for House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office will try evading the issue by
producing three surplus estimates later this month: One assuming the spending
caps hold, and two assuming the limits are breached by varying degrees.

<HEADLINE> Feds Finalize New Crash Dummy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency said Thursday it has finalized
specifications for a new crash dummy representing a 6-year-old child that will
be used in testing to help protect young children from being killed or injured
by car air bags.
</P>
<P>
	   Until now, the government has required automakers to pass crash tests for
air bags using only adult male dummies. But the 146 people killed by inflating
air bags have been mostly young, unbelted children and small women, the very
people automakers have not been required to design for in meeting government
regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed new federal
air bag tests using a ``family'' of test dummies aimed at preventing children
and small adults from being harmed by the next generation of advanced air bags.
</P>
<P>
	   The government proposal to regulate air bags in future cars is scheduled to
become final by March 1, a deadline imposed by Congress. By then, agency
officials said they would have the specifications for all the dummies, including
a slender female and a 3-year-old child and an infant.
</P>
<P>
	   But for now, the 6-year-old so-called Hybrid III dummy is the first to be
certified for compliance tests since the male dummy was adopted in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These specifications for a child crash dummy will improve highway safety
by helping to clear the way for the introduction of advanced air bags,'' said
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater.
</P>
<P>
	   Hybrid III test dummies representing 6-year-olds have been used in research
for several years. But government officials say the new 6-year-old dummy has a
highly instrumented neck that better simulates human neck responses. That is
important, officials say, because neck injuries are one of the main causes of
child fatalities due to air bags.
</P>
<P>
	   However, some industry groups have expressed concern the air bag might get
caught during testing in a cavity between the dummy's chin and neck that doesn't
exist in humans, leading to false readings of potentially serious neck injuries.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks Resume in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
   By CESAR GARCIA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- Peace talks resumed outside this
town in southern Colombia on Thursday after guerrilla clashes punctuated the end
of a temporary holiday truce.
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiations were held before a planned visit Friday by U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright to discuss a new $1.3 billion aid proposal for
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's visit, the first by a chief U.S. diplomat to Colombia since 1990,
underscored Washington's growing concern about the linked threats of drug
trafficking and a powerful leftist insurgency.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton this week proposed the anti-narcotics aid package, with
most of the money earmarked for military helicopters and new army battalions
that would push into southern jungles where the guerrilla presence has limited
anti-drug operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels draw money from the drug trade and protect the flow of drugs out of
the world's top cocaine-exporting nation. U.S. officials are trying to
strengthen Colombia's police and military without getting drawn into the
country's 35-year civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   The guerrillas -- and some U.S. lawmakers -- are calling the two-year plan a
counterinsurgency policy in disguise. They warn that it could undermine the
peace process without denting the flow of drugs to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   However, as government and rebel delegates convened for peace talks, their
tone was positive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm optimistic because this process is now into its substantive phase,
which means negotiations and discussions of the issues,'' said Fabio Valencia,
one of the five government delegates to the talks with the 15,000-member
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks with the country's largest rebel group have plodded along since they
began in San Vicente del Caguan's main plaza one year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   With no cease-fire in effect, the FARC has carried out several bloody
offensives seen as attempts to bolster its negotiating position. Rival
right-wing paramilitary groups also have continued to kill civilians they accuse
of being rebel sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
	   A 20-day rebel truce, called to give Colombians a Christmas and New Year
reprieve, expired on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, guerrillas attacked police barracks in three neighboring
villages in southern Narino State, killing three officers and one civilian,
authorities said. There were also unconfirmed reports of heavy rebel casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   In a village near San Vicente del Caguan on Thursday, rebel and government
negotiators discussed a plan to hold town meetings to encourage public input
into the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   They also were expected to discuss what topic to debate first on a
negotiating agenda that would include sweeping reforms to combat poverty,
political corruption and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiations are taking place in a poor region controlled by the FARC
since last November, when President Andres Pastrana evacuated his troops as a
gesture toward peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Included in the Clinton aid proposal, which now goes to Congress, is $145
million to bring economic development and legal alternatives to poor peasants
who subsist by growing coca and opium plants.

<HEADLINE> Dayton Hudson Changing Name  </HEADLINE>
    By KARREN MILLS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Dayton Hudson Corp. is aiming for a bull's-eye with the
decision to change its name to Target Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Target is the biggest division and the fastest-growing arm of
Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson, accounting for more than 75 percent of the
company's revenues and profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Target has been the company's top moneymaker since 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a move to demonstrate to the world that they finally acknowledge
that Target is the crown jewel of the Dayton Hudson empire," said Kurt Barnard,
president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, a retail consulting firm in Upper
Montclair, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question that it is the one (part) that will ultimately
determine what the rest of the company does,"
</P>
<P>
	   Dayton Hudson, which announced the decision Thursday, said the name change
will take effect Jan. 30 when the company begins its new fiscal year. The
company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TGT.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has been prominently advertising Target -- the No. 3 U.S.
discount chain behind Wal-Mart and Kmart -- trying to make the red bull's-eye
logo as recognizable as symbols such as the Nike swoosh.
</P>
<P>
	   While the corporate name will now focus on Target, the change won't affect
any of the company's other store brands and the company said it remains
committed to its Mervyn's chain as well as its Dayton's, Marshall Field's and
Hudson's department stores.
</P>
<P>
	   But Barnard said that the name change may signal that the company is
thinking of restructuring its business.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a strong possibility," Barnard said, "that sooner or later, and
probably more sooner rather than later, they will divest themselves of Mervyn's,
which has really been lagging badly, and also their department stores."
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Ulrich, Dayton Hudson chairman and chief executive officer, said the
company's main goal continues to be delivering annual earnings per share growth
of 15 percent or more over time.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, Target plans to add about 70 new Target Stores, including 15
larger SuperTargets, which are grocery and discount stores combined.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's stock has been publicly traded since 1967, when the Dayton
Company went public. In 1969, Dayton's merged with J.L. Hudson Co. to form
Dayton Hudson Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong sales at Target stores fueled a 32 percent third-quarter earnings
increase for the period ending Oct. 30. For the first nine months of 1999,
Dayton Hudson earnings rose 27 percent, to $650 million, or $1.39 a share, from
$512 million, or $1.08 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 10 percent to $22.98
billion, from $20.81 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Dayton Hudson operates 1,245 stores in 44 states, including 914 Target
stores, 267 Mervyn's stores and 64 department stores.
</P>
<P>
	   Dayton Hudson shares rose $1.56 1/4 to $69 as of 4 p.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Oil Worker Plane Crashes in Libya  </HEADLINE>
   By BALZ BRUPPACHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- A twin-engine plane carrying employees of a Libyan
oil company to a refinery crashed in the Mediterranean Sea on Thursday with 41
people aboard. There were unconfirmed reports of fatalities.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighteen of the people on board the Swiss plane were rescued, according to
state-run Libyan television, monitored in Cairo, and search and rescue efforts
were continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The plane hit the water just off the Libyan coast and sank,'' said Hugo
Schittenhelm of the Swiss Transportation Ministry. ``A search for survivors and
for the aircraft is under way. Nothing can yet be said about the exact number of
victims.''
</P>
<P>
	   All 38 passengers on board were employees of a Libyan oil company, said
Franz Fassbind, chairman of Avisto AG air services company, which is based near
Zurich and owns the plane. There were also three crew members, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schiltenhelm earlier said the ministry had unconfirmed reports that 15
people were killed. Fassbind told a Zurich television station that he had
information there were up to 15 dead, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen people on board were Libyans and the others were foreigners, the
Libyan television report said. It did not give their nationalities, but Fassbind
told a Zurich television they were citizens of four different countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was headed east from Tripoli to an oil refinery at Marsa el-Brega,
halfway along Libya's Mediterranean Coast, when it ran into trouble Thursday
afternoon. About six miles before the airport, the pilot reported that both

	   Aviation officials from Libya and Switzerland are investigating. The Swiss
investigator is flying from Canada, where he has been working on the probe into
the 1998 crash of a Swissair plane off the Canadian coast in which 229 people
died, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fassbind said his company has been working in Libya for the past 15 years
and had never had an accident before. The pilots were trained in Switzerland and
were very experienced, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second air crash involving a Swiss-owned plane this week. Crash
investigators had closed their office to work on the site of the first crash, in
which 10 people died when their Crossair Saab 340 came down shortly after
takeoff from Zurich airport.

<HEADLINE> France Approves Shorter Work Week  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- France's constitutional watchdog gave its approval Thursday to
a shortened work week, clearing the final hurdle for the controversial law.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortening the work week from 39 hours to 35 has been a key project of the
Socialists since they came to power in June 1997. They hope it will help reduce
France's 11 percent jobless rate by forcing companies to hire more people.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative lawmakers asked the Constitutional Council to toss out the law
passed last month, saying it creates unequal work conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The council rejected their arguments but said four minor provisions did not
conform to the constitution, including a 10 percent tax on overtime of employees
on the 35-hour plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The law begins Feb. 1. Companies with more than 20 employees must implement
it by the end of 2000. Smaller companies have an extra year.
</P>
<P>
	   Trucking bosses blockaded France's borders for two days this week to protest
the plan, worried it would affect their competitiveness in Europe. The blockades
ended after officials agreed to let truckers work longer hours if they are paid
overtime.

<HEADLINE> In annual address, Giuliani announces new initiatives, tax cuts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In a 99-minute state of the city speech in which he
sounded like a candidate aspiring for higher office, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
promised Thursday that the city would sell the Board of Education building,
seize the cars of reckless drivers and cut taxes by $2 billion.
<P>
	   Standing before a backdrop of a huge color photograph of the New Year's
celebration at Times Square two weeks ago, Giuliani called the event the high
point of his six years in office.
</P>
<P>
	   "This represents the culmination of all the work I've done, all the work
we've done," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani - expected to run for the U.S. Senate against Hillary Rodham
Clinton - told the audience in the packed City Council chamber at City Hall that
his seventh annual address might be his last and devoted much of his speech to
topics he never tires of discussing: His administration's success in reducing
crime and welfare rates and expanding the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor's most provocative remarks, however, were about education - an
issue for which he has been criticized in the past for spending too little money
and for hounding successive school chancellors out of office.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, he continued his years-long verbal assault on the Board of
Education, saying the structure of the system guarantees failure because
administrators are more focused on preserving jobs than on educating children.
The solution, he said, is widespread privatization of the school system.
</P>
<P>
	   But acknowledging that he lacks the power to overhaul the bureaucracy
himself, Giuliani said the city will instead sell the board's Brooklyn
headquarters, and in return, give the board a much smaller facility in order to
force it to reduce the size of its bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Seriously, we're going to sell it," he said. "The system doesn't work. It
hasn't worked in a long time, and it's about time we moved on to a more
accountable system."
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear how serious the mayor is because the Board of Education, which
would have to approve such a move, is highly unlikely to do so. Last year,
Giuliani called for the Board of Education to be "blown up."
</P>
<P>
	   As an example of the sorry state of the city's schools, Giuliani said the
reading scores of students had actually dropped last year after they had
completed remedial summer school courses. He called on summer school classes
this year to be privatized.
</P>
<P>
	   "They can't do the job," he said, before shouting in what appeared to be
theatrical anger. "It's a tragedy. It's a tragedy ... It isn't a joke, it isn't
politics. You only get one chance to educate a child."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman from the Board of Education did not immediately return a call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   In a new crime initiative, Giuliani said the city would embark on a program
next week to seize the vehicles of reckless drivers. The program is a follow-up
to the city's policy of taking the vehicles of drunk drivers. Among the
misdemeanor charges under which a person's car could be taken are illegal lane
changes and speeding.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani also proposed eliminating the city's commercial rent tax, trimming
the unincorporated business and hotel occupancy taxes and providing for tax
abatements for commercial areas in sections of Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   The $2 billion in cuts would occur over a four year period - meaning that at
least half of the savings would come after Giuliani is out of office.
</P>
<P>
	   Among his other plans, Giuliani said he would create a new city home
ownership program; seek to build a state-of-the-art DNA laboratory to test the
genetic data of criminal suspects; push for they city to host the Olympics in
2012 with a new stadium on the West Side as the centerpiece; create a new park
along the East River; and rename homeless shelters "New Start Centers."
</P>
<P>
	   After the talk, Public Advocate Mark Green, who often serves as Giuliani's
chief foil, said he liked much of the speech - with the exception of the mayor's
ignoring the promise of the city's Internet firms and the mayor's "scape-goating
of teachers."
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, City Council Speaker Peter Vallone was also critical.
</P>
<P>
	   "The mayor made it clear that that when it comes to education, the needs of
our children and teachers are an afterthought," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Investment Incentives  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- With a booming stock market and robust economy, President
Clinton said Thursday that Americans ``have a moral obligation'' to bring
prosperity to the nation's neediest urban and rural areas. On the Republican
side, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said it was important that ``no community be
left behind.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks before his State of the Union address, Clinton opened an
election-year drive to win congressional approval of $5 billion worth of tax
incentives over 10 years to encourage investment in depressed areas under a
program he calls ``New Markets.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Economic opportunity should not be the political province of any
particular party,'' Clinton said. ``Economic opportunity should be the
birthright of every American.''
</P>
<P>
	   After a night in his new, $1.7 million home in Chappaqua, the president
followed the path of countless commuters into New York. In Clinton's case,
police cleared the highways for his 14-car motorcade and toll booth operators
waved him by without charge. Long lines of motorists wound up stalled behind
police barricades.
</P>
<P>
	   The president spoke at Boricua College, a largely Hispanic school in an
ethnic neighborhood in Brooklyn. A custodian was shot to death at the college
Monday, and Clinton and other members of the audience observed a moment of
silence.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, the president went to midtown Manhattan for an economic development
program led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jackson's Wall Street Project is intended
to persuade New York's financial leaders to invest capital in minority
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton won accolades from Citigroup's chairman, Sanford Weill, for the
stock market's performance. ``I want to thank you for my net worth,'' Weill
declared, saying Citigroup's stock had climbed from $5 a share when Clinton took
office to $55 now.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, deeply in debt with legal bills, replied, ``I'm glad one of us made
money out of this administration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Clinton was speaking at the New York Stock Exchange at a reception
for the Wall Street Project and then attending a $250,000 fund-raising event on
the Upper East Side for the Democratic National Committee. Clinton was to return
to Chappaqua for the night before heading to Washington on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Programs for economic revival of urban and rural areas are drawing rare
bipartisan agreement between Clinton and House Republicans. Hastert, in a
statement from his office, said, ``I look forward to working with the president
on creating a bipartisan package that will address the needs of these
communities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Removing tax and regulatory barriers that prevent private sector
investment in these areas is a hallmark of compassionate conservatism,'' Hastert
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his initiatives were aimed at giving American companies the
same incentives to invest in U.S. communities as they have for investing in
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we can't do this now, we will never do this,'' the president said. ``We
will never get around to doing this if we don't do it now. So, point number one,
we have a moral obligation to use our prosperity at this moment, especially, to
lift up the areas'' that have been left behind.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he would resubmit his New Markets initiative to Congress,
seeking more than twice the funding he requested last year. He said the tax
credits would leverage $15 billion in investments.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said he also would propose expanding the New Markets agenda
with programs geared toward helping small and first-time entrepreneurs and
private investment companies, modeled after the Overseas Private Investment
Corp. that offers loan guarantees and risk insurance for foreign ventures.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal attends college dedication in his honor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Cardinal John O'Connor on Thursday attended the
dedication of a South Bronx campus of the College of New Rochelle that is being
named in his honor.
<P>
	   But while his spirits were up and his voice was strong, O'Connor sat
throughout the ceremony, walked with a cane and asked someone else to blow out
the candles on a cake in honor of his 80th birthday, which is Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   After the dedication of the newly renovated building in the Morrisania
section of the Bronx, O'Connor told reporters: "I came from a relatively poor
family of a bunch of kids in Philadelphia. I never dreamed that anything of this
sort would happen, that I would be given the honor of having my name attached to
any college or any university. I'm deeply grateful."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Bishop Patrick Sheridan read a letter O'Connor wrote in which the
cardinal noted that he had "repeatedly refused to accept offers to name this or
that institution or building after me."
</P>
<P>
	   But he added: "There is no way I could resist such a kind offer. Education
has been one of my key concerns since coming to New York."
</P>
<P>
	   The cardinal had a brain tumor removed in August and has curtailed his
public schedule in recent months. Because cardinals lose their power to vote for
a new pope when they turn 80, it is likely that the Vatican will replace him in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
	   But College of New Rochelle President Stephen Sweeney asserted that the
dedication of the building in his name was not "connected with his health
challenges or his age, which the cardinal reminds us will surely be acknowledged
by the pope sooner rather than later. Rather ours is a genuine esteem and
admiration for the cardinal."
</P>
<P>
	   He said O'Connor provides "the example of a man of faith whose devotion to
the sacredness of life at all stages, to the poor, to racial harmony, to
religious tolerance and ecumenism and to justice is legendary."
</P>
<P>
	   The College of New Rochelle was founded in 1904 by the Ursuline Order of
nuns and was the first Catholic college for women in New York State. The campus
named for the cardinal is in a newly renovated building in Morrisania.
</P>
<P>
	   As the cardinal left, he was asked his thoughts on turning 80.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm getting old," he said with a laugh. As for his birthday wish, he said:
"To live among you New Yorkers for the next 100 years."

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen on Thursday said he is
recommending that Bernard Rostker, the point man on the Pentagon's long-running
investigation into Gulf War illnesses, be promoted to undersecretary of defense
for personnel.
</P>
<P>
	   Rostker would replace Rudy de Leon, whom Cohen has recommended for promotion
to deputy secretary of defense. The current deputy secretary, John Hamre,
announced Monday he is leaving the Pentagon on March 31 to become president of
the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said he recommended to President Clinton that Rostker take de Leon's
slot. Rostker has been undersecretary of the Army -- the No. 2 civilian post in
the Army -- since October 1998. Since November 1996 he has been a special
assistant to Hamre for Gulf War illnesses. He will continue with that
assignment.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Tax Credit Proposed  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Put away those postage stamps. President Clinton wants to
give taxpayers a credit of up to $10 if they file their income tax returns
electronically instead of using old-fashioned snail mail.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Thursday, is to
simultaneously encourage more people to file returns via either the Internet or
the telephone and improve efficiency at the much-maligned Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's good for them. It's good for the IRS. It's good for the system,''
Summers said in announcing the proposed credit at a conference on modernizing
the nation's tax collector.
</P>
<P>
	   The president will ask Congress in his fiscal 2001 budget to approve a $10
credit for people who file returns electronically, either on their home
computers or through a tax professional. For people who use the IRS telephone
filing system called Telefile, the credit would be $5. Had it been in place in
1999, the credit would have cost the government about $264.5 million, according
to congressional estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Using money as an incentive marks a departure from the IRS campaign that is
selling e-filing as more accurate, as a quicker route to a refund -- an average
of 20 days instead of 40 -- and as the only way to get a specific confirmation
that the return was received by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With anything that involves changing people's habits, you need a little
push,'' said IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti. ``It's really designed to
accelerate what was happening anyway.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, electronic tax filing has grown dramatically over the past few
years, including a 19 percent increase last year. About 34 million returns -- a
little over one in four -- will be filed by computer or telephone this year, up
from 29.3 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   But the pace is not swift enough to meet a goal set by Congress in the 1998
IRS reform law for 80 percent e-filing by 2007. Indeed, the most recent IRS
projection is for about half of all returns to be e-filed by that date.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is, to be sure, more that needs to be done,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some people remain reluctant to put their sensitive tax data on line, while
others fear they could be more easily targeted for an audit if they file
electronically -- a fear the IRS says is unfounded. Many people, however, won't
file electronically because the fees are usually many times the cost of a
33-cent postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed tax credit would eliminate the cost factor, said Bob
Weinberger, government relations vice president at H&AMP;R Block Inc., the nation's
largest tax preparer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are comfortable doing it a certain way,'' he said. ``This is likely
to push a lot of people across the line who might have been saying, 'What's in
it for me?'''
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means
Committee, poked fun at the proposal. ``What's next -- a tax credit for good
penmanship?'' said the Texas Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossotti also told the conference Thursday that improved technology --
including more electronic filing -- is critical to improving the IRS's ability
to respond to taxpayer problems and questions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our purpose is not to move some imaginary pendulum back or forth a few
degrees,'' Rossotti said. ``Our purpose is to improve the entire way the IRS
works.''
</P>
<P>
	   As part of its modernization effort, the IRS is remaking its structure into
four operating divisions: one each for individual taxpayers, large businesses,
small businesses and tax-exempt organizations. The new structure is expected to
be in place by October.
</P>
<P>
	   John Dalrymple, who will head the new Wage and Investment Division that
includes the vast majority of taxpayers, said the IRS hopes within five years to
be able to communicate directly with taxpayers via secure e-mail. That would
allow completely paperless filing with PIN numbers in place of physical
signatures and provide tax refunds within two days, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to position ourselves to make full use of the Internet,''
Dalrymple said.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers said the president would ask Congress for a substantial increase in
the IRS budget for fiscal 2001 to continue an ongoing replacement of the
agency's antiquated, tape-driven taxpayer computer records and to prevent any
further reduction in employees. The job cutbacks are frequently cited as one
reason -- along with fallout from the IRS reform law -- that the agency is doing
fewer audits and enforcement actions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To have effective tax administration, there must be both compliance and
high-quality customer service,'' Summers said.

<HEADLINE> Russians Receive Money for Mir  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian space officials said Thursday that they have received
$7 million from a British company to carry out a scientific experiment on the
Mir space station -- a desperately needed cash infusion that will extend its
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
	   Mir has been flying unmanned since its last crew left in August, and the
cash-strapped Russian government had decided to abandon the nearly 14-year-old
station around March unless private investors came up with funds.
</P>
<P>
	   The state-controlled RKK Energia company, which built and has run Mir since
its launch in February 1986, repeatedly tried to attract foreign investments.
Until Thursday, no major foreign investments had been reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Energia deputy chief Valery Ryumin said the British company Golden Apple had
transferred $7 million to Energia's account with another installment to follow
after a cargo ship to Mir is launched on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The cargo ship is to carry supplies for a crew set to blast off on March 30
for a Mir mission that would last at least 45 days. The Russian Space Agency
approved the mission Wednesday, but it still needs final endorsement by the
Cabinet, which plans to take up the issue next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the ITAR-Tass news agency, a Golden Apple representative in
London said the company plans to spend $20 million on the Mir mission. The
representative, Walt Anderson, was quoted as saying that Golden Apple intends to
eventually sublet Mir from Energia and overhaul the station.
</P>
<P>
	   Ryumin said Energia and Golden Apple are planning to set up a joint venture
that would sell the station's resources.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden Apple is registered in the British Virgin Islands and focuses on
high-technology investments, ITAR-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
	   No telephone number for Golden Apple could be found in Britain. The British
Virgin Islands company registration office said nine offshore investment funds
including the name ``Golden Apple'' were recorded there.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking on the Echo of Moscow radio, Ryumin said Golden Apple had delivered
the money to carry out a pioneering scientific experiment. He wouldn't
elaborate, but Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin said that it would
involve a five-mile-long tether supposed to help maneuver the station fuel-free.
Further details were not available.
</P>
<P>
	   NASA has long urged Russian space officials to abandon the aging Mir and
commit their scarce resources to the International Space Station, a 16-nation
project that has been behind schedule due to Russia's failure to provide a
crucial crew compartment.
</P>
<P>
	   Ryumin said the segment won't be launched until mid-August at the earliest
because officials need to fix flaws in a booster rocket that is supposed to
carry it into space.

<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Once upon a time in America, mobs dragged people out of
jails or off the streets and hanged them from the nearest tree - in some
particularly shocking cases, burned them alive. Then, often as not, members of
the mob lined up to be photographed with the deceased.
<P>
	   Dozens of these pictures- some of them turned into postcards - go on public
display Friday at a Manhattan gallery. "It's clear to me that this is a piece of
history that demands an audience," said Andrew Roth, co-owner of the Roth
Horowitz Gallery, which is presenting the sobering exhibit.
</P>
<P>
	   Visitors may browse before photos of corpses of young black men hanging from
branches, telephone poles and, in one case, a bridge. There is a shot of a man
being incinerated, and another of "the half-burned head of James" on a pole.
</P>
<P>
	   The gruesome material was gathered over the past decade by James Allen, a
Georgia-based dealer in antiques and memorabilia, and are now part of the
Allen-Littlefield Collection at Emory University in Atlanta. The New York

3,436 people lynched between 1889 and 1922, and one photo in the collection is
dated 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   During the peak years, most victims were black men accused of offenses
ranging from murder and rape to not stepping off the sidewalk to let a white
person pass. But it was not a strictly Southern practice, and whether in
Gadsden, Alabama, Duluth, Minn., or the "Hanging Tree" in Helena, Mont., someone
with a camera always seemed to be present.
</P>
<P>
	   Picture after picture shows local citizens gathered around the dangling
bodies - some undoubtedly perpetrators of the crime, others simply bystanders
agape with curiosity.
</P>
<P>
	   The amateurish snapshots reveal a sameness about the southern racist mobs
and western posses carrying out vigilante justice - rawboned, angular-faced men
wearing hats. In some, small children watch the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the photos were turned into souvenir postcards, some colorized and
inscribed with such notations as "Down in Old Kentucky," or "Negro who shot J.H.
Rogers at Ten Mile, Miss., 5-21-19."
</P>
<P>
	   At least one series of photos, from a double lynching in Okeman, Okla., in
1911, was copyrighted by the photographer. Another picture, taken after dark in
1900, is stamped, "Flash light by Dabbs."
</P>
<P>
	   The postcards with one-cent stamps could be sent legally through the mail
until about 1908, when they were banned. "I bought this in Hopkinsville for 15
cents. It's not on sale openly (the law forbids it)," an anonymous correspondent
wrote on the back of one postcard.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth said the postcards are not only curious but "insightful into the nature
of the medium and how it was disseminated in the public domain."
</P>
<P>
	   Pictures aside, perhaps the exhibit's most chilling entry is a 1921 pamphlet
issued by the National Association of Colored People. It reproduced the Jan. 26
and 27 front pages of the Memphis (Tenn.) Press that provided an account of a
white mob seizing a black youth from a jail in Georgia and transporting him to
Arkansas, where he was burned at the stake.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper duly reported how the kidnappers stopped off in Memphis and were
seen "laughing and talking" in the lobby of the Hotel Peabody, and how police
formed up to guard the roads, but did nothing to interfere - more than a decade
before the FBI won the power to take charge of interstate crime.
</P>
<P>
	   "Questions," Roth said when asked what people should take away from the
exhibit. "Questions about our culture, our history, our times. People aren't
being lynched today, that we know about, but there certainly are references ...
that we hear on the news, morning noon and night, that connect back to this
history."

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Port Area Evacuated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Authorities ordered about 70 families to leave a
port area Thursday after detecting a dangerous mix of toxic chemicals spilled
when killer mudslides damaged cargo containers.
</P>
<P>
	   The containers were smashed and tossed around at the La Guaira port in the
Caribbean coastal state of Vargas, the worst-hit area in the Dec. 15 floods.
Some of the containers apparently had been used for years to illegally store
toxic wastes.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Coast Guard officials who traveled
to Venezuela identified chemicals leaking from some containers and said they
pose a threat to public health, Venezuelan Environmental Minister Jesus Perez
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the chemicals could contaminate the ground and sea, emit
dangerous gases and cause an explosion. They said they would evacuate families
who live near the port and restrict access to the area.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a cocktail of products that could cause serious damage,'' Perez
said. He said technicians assisted by U.N. environmental experts would be
assigned to clean up the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
	   In the days following the mudslides, thousands of hungry flood survivors
swarmed through the port to take food, bicycles and other items out of the
broken containers. Health officials have issued public warnings that any
survivors suffering from skin rashes, respiratory ailments or other health
problems should seek medical attention.
</P>
<P>
	   The flooding killed between 5,000 and 30,000 people, making it the worst
natural disaster in Venezuela this century.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Weighs Debt Buyback  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, seeking to operate in the new
world of budget surpluses, adopted rules Thursday that will allow the government
to buy back up to $30 billion of the national debt this year,something that
hasn't happened for at least a century.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, in making the announcement, called the
debt buyback program ``an important new tool'' for the government to use in
managing the $5.76 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reducing the supply of Treasury debt held by the public brings enormous
benefits to our economy,'' Summers said. ``It means that there will be less
pressure on interest rates than there would otherwise have been and therefore
lower borrowing costs for businesses and lower interest payments for American
families.''
</P>
<P>
	   The administration, which first proposed the idea of debt buybacks last
August, has sought to portray its proposal as the responsible way to utilize the
government's burgeoning surpluses, the product of the current economic boom, in
contrast to Republican calls for large tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton said the debt buyback plan was a ``dramatic reminder'' of
how much the government's economic fortunes have improved after decades of
rising budget deficits and would allow the government to ``refinance old debt
and pay it down on the best terms possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the rules the government adopted, Treasury will conduct what is known
as a ``reverse auction,'' in which the government will offer cash to bond
holders who indicate their willingness to sell government bonds back to the
government.
</P>
<P>
	   The price will be set in a bidding process designed to make sure the
government pays prevailing market rates for the bonds it buys.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Under Secretary Gary Gensler, who oversees the debt operations,
said Treasury records show it has been at least a century since the federal
government has offered cash to buy securities that have not yet matured.
</P>
<P>
	   Gensler said the Treasury conducted limited swap operations in the 1960s and
as late as 1972, swapping new bonds for older bonds held by the public in an
effort to reorganize the types of bonds outstanding.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers said the debt buyback program would be launched in the coming weeks
with several operations conducted in the next 12 months, totaling up to $30
billion. Officials said the exact timing of the program and the size of each
buyback program had yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   The national debt now stands at $5.76 trillion, with the amount of that debt
held by the public totaling $3.6 trillion. The rest of the debt, some $2
trillion, is held by the government's large trust funds, primarily the Social
Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers noted that under current surplus forecasts, the entire $3.6 trillion
in debt held by the public could be eliminated over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   However, private economists caution that those long-range projections are
based on assumptions that the current good economic times, which have triggered
the swelling revenues, continue and that Democrats and Republicans resist the
urge to spend the surplus on new government programs or in tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Elimination of the $3.6 trillion of publicly-held debt would mark the first
time that the debt held by the public has been eliminated since President Andrew
Johnson accomplished the feat in 1835.
</P>
<P>
	   However, even if that goal is accomplished, it would still leave the sizable
$2 trillion in debt the government owes to the Social Security trust fund, money
that will be needed to finance the Baby Boomers' retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Participants in financial markets offered general support for the debt
buyback approach.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The $30 billion was on the high side of market expectations and the
initial market reaction has been positive,'' said David Jones, chief economist
at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co., a government securities dealer in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount of the national debt held by the public has been reduced over the
past two years by $140 billion, reflecting the fact that the government has
posted back-to-back surpluses over the last two years for the first time since
Dwight Eisenhower was president.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra cash allowed the Treasury to reduce outstanding debt simply by
selling fewer new bonds at its regularly scheduled auctions than the amount of
old bonds coming due.
</P>
<P>
	   That procedure will be employed again this year. But officials said the new
buyback procedure will allow them to better control the government's interest
costs by buying back longer maturities and substituting shorter-term maturities
with lower interest payments.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Buying Hughes Satellite Unit  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hughes Electronics Corp. is getting out of the aerospace
industry to focus on entertainment and Internet services, striking a $3.75
billion deal with Boeing Co. on Thursday to sell its satellite-building
business.
</P>
<P>
	   The pact turns Boeing into the world's biggest commercial satellite maker
and allows Hughes executives to pursue their goal of becoming a dominant player
in the world of high-speed wireless communications.
</P>
<P>
	   "These strategic moves accelerate the transformation of Hughes into a highly
focused entertainment and data information services and distribution company,"
said Michael T. Smith, chairman and CEO of Hughes.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal will boost revenues and earnings from Boeing's space and
communications operations about one-third. The Hughes operations being acquired
were believed to have generated sales of $2.3 billion during 1999, Boeing said
in a news release.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes has a backlog of 36 satellites on order worth an estimated $4
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   "Boeing intends to be No. 1 in space. This acquisition is a significant step
forward in executing our goal of becoming the industry leader in integrated,
space-based information and communications," said Phil Condit, Boeing chairman
and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes is owned by General Motors Corp., but its shares trade separately
from regular GM shares.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Hughes' space and communications unit, Boeing gets Hughes'
Electron Dynamics and Spectrolab, which make satellite components. The three
businesses have a combined workforce of about 9,000 employees, primarily in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts found little to criticize in the deal, which meshes Hughes'
expertise in satellite hardware with Boeing's Delta and SeaLaunch rocket
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes is expected to use proceeds from the sale to expand DirecTV, the
satellite-to-home TV service, and develop Skywave, a wireless broadband system
that will target the Internet and other communications systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Both ventures promise to make Hughes, already the leader in wireless TV
services, a key player in the rapidly meshing entertainment and communications
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   "Broadband communications, Internet access is really the wave of the future,
and Hughes is in a position to move into that really quickly," said Marco
Caceres, an analyst with Teal Group in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is a trend in the whole satellite market. Companies that
traditionally have built hardware are getting into satellite services, because
that's where the real money is being made," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes was founded as Hughes Aircraft in 1932 by Howard Hughes. During World
War II, the company built the Spruce Goose, a wooden transport military plant
that never flew except for a brief test run over Long Beach harbor.
</P>
<P>
	   After the war, Hughes branched out into defense electronics. The company
began to move into commercial ventures, such as DirecTV, after the Cold War
ended.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes executives said in the past they wanted to keep their commercial
satellite operations as a complement to DirecTV, which has with more than 8
million subscribers. That was before Hughes ran through more than $5 billion
promoting DirecTV, buying up its competitors and developing Starwave.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes spent more than $2 billion made from the sale of Hughes Aircraft to
Raytheon in 1997. In addition, the company piled up an estimated $3.3 billion in
long-term debt, said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, Hughes executives decided the potential of those ventures
outweighed the advantages of hanging onto satellite manufacturing, an industry
that has been chilled by launch failures and allegations of unauthorized
technology transfers by U.S. companies to China.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they wanted to grow that investment intensive part of their business,
they had to get some cash. I think they came to a conclusion that the satellite
manufacturing business was expendable," Nisbet said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Biofuel Production  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER LOVEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aiming to replace fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable
energy sources, President Clinton is proposing to more than double federal
spending on efforts to turn corn husks, chicken droppings and other waste into
power for cars and buildings, White House officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In his fiscal 2001 budget request to Congress next month, Clinton will ask
for $439 million to fund research and grants to aid the production of
``bioenergy'' and other products such as plastics and chemicals created from
agricultural waste.
</P>
<P>
	   That is $243 million more than the $196 million Congress approved for
similar efforts in the current year, said Paul Bledsoe, spokesman for the White
House Climate Change Task Force.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration hopes to boost the commercial viability of alternative
fuels such as ethanol toward the president's goal, set in August, of tripling
bio-based energy use by 2010. The key is producing the fuel from agricultural
waste or specialty crops such as switchgrass in addition to using grain, such as
the corn kernels from which ethanol is primarily made now.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration also envisions the use of such waste as an energy source
itself, without conversion into a liquid gasoline additive.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters say there are four key benefits: reducing dirty emissions that
contribute to global warming; turning waste into marketable products; lowering
American dependence on foreign oil; and boosting the struggling farm economy
with a new income stream.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These technologies allow us to use the whole plant, and that is the huge
breakthrough,'' Bledsoe said. ``What were formerly known as waste products now
have significant market value.''
</P>
<P>
	   Biomass energy, generated mostly from lumberyard waste, is currently about 3
percent of the total U.S. energy supply.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for GOP Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, said new congressional authority may be needed for some
of what Clinton wants to do. Still, he welcomed the president's commitment to
the promotion of bioenergy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There have been major breakthroughs in the technology,'' Andy Fisher said.
``So this is sort of the right time to strike.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lugar has his own legislation promoting ``biomass'' development that would
authorize $300 million over six years for research. Approved in the Senate, it
has received a cooler reception in the House.

Thursday on fresh evidence that the U.S. economy's growth is not accompanied by
a resurgence in inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   But trading was subdued in advance of a speech scheduled for Thursday night
by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
	   A one-quarter percentage point increase in British interest rates by the
Bank of England, which was widely expected, had little impact on currency
markets, said Ed Stapleton, chief foreign exchange dealer at Fortis (USA)
Financial Markets in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0254, down from $1.0311
Wednesday, and the British pound slipped to $1.6466 from $1.6477. The dollar
also was quoted at 106.13 Japanese yen, up from 105.98.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar picked up support with a Labor Department report Thursday morning
that inflation at the wholesale level was tame in December, with the exception
of the volatile food and energy components. A separate report showed continued
strength in consumer spending, the engine of the economy's long expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   It is widely expected that the Fed, which raised rates three times in 1999
to keep the economy from overheating, will increase rates again at a meeting
Feb. 1-2. But Thursday's report reduced the likelihood of an increase of more
than one-quarter percentage point, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, traders were reluctant to take major positions in advance of
Greenspan's remarks Thursday night to a meeting of economists in New York,
Stapleton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.5720 Swiss francs, up from 1.5627 Wednesday,
and 1.4500 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4541.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Thursday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9073 German marks, up from 1.8969; 6.3968
French francs, up from 6.3614; and 1,888.21 Italian lire, up from 1,877.78.

<HEADLINE> Crude at 2-Mo. High; Cocoa Climbs  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Crude oil futures rose to a two-month high Thursday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, extending a week-long rally that got its latest impetus
from comments by Saudi Arabia's oil minister.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, corn prices extended their gains to nearly 7 percent over
two days and cocoa climbed.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil prices had been sliding since hitting a nine-year high of $27.15 in
November. But a new push began this week as expectations rose of extended oil
price cuts among OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Ali al-Naimi, oil minister of the world's No. 1 producer, said
global inventories must be reduced still further and that the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries should extend the lowered production levels
that have chipped away at supplies. The production agreement is due to expire at
the end of March.
</P>
<P>
	   "When he starts to talk, the market really listens hard," said Tim Evans,
senior energy analyst for the Pegasus Econometrics Group in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Evans said the latest rally has served notice to anyone who doubted the
bullish market that they should "stand back and get out of the way" as prices
rise relentlessly upward.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of oil has more than doubled in the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude for February delivery rose 41 cents to $26.69 a barrel. February
heating oil rose 0.81 cent to 69.28 cents a gallon; February gasoline was
unchanged at 71.27 cents a gallon; February natural gas rose 0.8 cent to $2.252
per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, February Brent crude rose 17 cents to $24.98 a barrel on the
International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn prices powered over the $2.20-a-bushel mark on the Chicago Board of
Trade as traders shrugged off unexpectedly low weekly export sales reported by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
	   Other grains and soybeans also advanced sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat prices reached their highest level in two months after forecasts
called for record warm temperatures this weekend in the U.S. southern and
central Plains. And soybeans also pushed to their highest price in eight weeks
on rumors, later said to be false, that Brazil had confirmed drought damage to
its crop.
</P>
<P>
	   March wheat rose 4 3/4 cents to $2.63 1/2 a bushel; March corn rose 5 1/4
cents to $2.20 3/4 a bushel; March oats rose 1 1/2 cents to $1.11 3/4 a bushel;
March soybeans rose 8 3/4 cents to $4.89 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa prices rose due in part to instability in Ivory Coast, the world's
leading producer. March cocoa settled up $17 at $871 per ton on New York's
Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange.

<HEADLINE> 'Puffy' Indicted on Weapons Charge  </HEADLINE>
    By SAMUEL MAULL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Grammy-winning rap mogul Sean "Puffy" Combs was indicted
Thursday on charges that he had two stolen guns in his sport utility vehicle as
he fled a nightclub shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   One gun was found by police in the vehicle, and the other was thrown out of
the vehicle, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of Combs' associates were also named in the indictment: his rapping
protege, Jamal "Shyne" Barrow, on attempted murder charges, and bodyguard
Anthony Jones on a weapons charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs, 30, could get up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence since his arrest after three
people were wounded Dec. 27 inside the crowded Club NY. He was taken into
custody, along with his girlfriend Jennifer Lopez, as they drove away from the
club after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the vehicle carrying Combs and Ms. Lopez, the singer-actress who
starred in the films "Selena" and "Out of Sight," had run at least one red light
while fleeing the club. A driver and bodyguard were in the front; the couple
were in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs was charged with possession of a 9 mm pistol found in the front of the
car, and with possession of another stolen 9 mm that was thrown from the
vehicle, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both guns had been fired, but the district attorney could not say where or
when the weapons had been fired.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs was charged with second-degree possession of a weapon, meaning he had
a loaded gun with intent to use it. He was also charged with third-degree, which
is simple possession of a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs, who earned an estimated $53 million through his rap empire in 1998,
has been free on $10,000 bail since his arrest. He is due back in court Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   He scheduled a Thursday evening news conference to respond to the charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs' lawyer, Harvey Slovis, has said that the couple were fleeing the
nightclub in fear of their lives and that Combs did not own the weapon found in
the vehicle. Until Thursday, prosecutors had not accused Combs of having a gun
that was thrown from the car.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs was also arrested last April for allegedly beating a fellow music
executive, leaving the victim with a broken arm and jaw. Combs pleaded guilty to
harassment and was ordered to undergo counseling.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Creates Emergency Teams  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is establishing an additional 17 National
Guard teams to help states respond quickly in the event of attacks involving
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. An initial 10 teams were created last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Each team of 22 full-time members of the Army or Air National Guard will
receive 15 months of training before being certified to respond to such
emergencies, officials said Thursday. They are to provide medical and technical
advice to local emergency officials under state, rather than federal, control.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams will be available to the governors of 17 states: Alaska, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine,
Minnesota, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10 teams established last year are for Colorado, Georgia, Illinois,
California, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and
Washington. California is the only state to be assigned two teams. These 10
teams are expected to receive their certification by March.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Cragin, the assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs, said
the Pentagon spent $60 million on this initiative last year and the current
fiscal 2000 budget has $75 million for the program, including $58 million to add
another 17 response teams.
</P>
<P>
	   The 17 additional teams are to be established by July, Cragin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Department will consult with the states to decide the specific
communities in which the teams will be based.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Weizman Probed  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK LAVIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Already under pressure to resign, Israel's president got
more bad news Thursday when police were called in to investigate whether he
illegally accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts.
</P>
<P>
	   President Ezer Weizman, who has so far rejected calls to step down, said he
welcomed the decision by the nation's top law enforcement officials to ask
police to look into a gift he received from French industrialist Edouard
Sarousi.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman has acknowledged receiving money from Sarousi between 1988 and 1993,
but says it was less than the $430,000 figure quoted in reports here.
</P>
<P>
	   After investigating for two days, Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein and
State Attorney Edna Arbel summoned reporters to their office at night on short
notice, saying they are turning the matter over to the police.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubinstein said he is not ordering a criminal investigation and that he had
hoped to wrap up the inquiry himself, but found that his office ``does not have
the tools'' to check bank records and other aspects of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubinstein denied reports that a deal was in the works to let Weizman step
down in exchange for calling off the inquiry. Arbel said if Weizman resigns, her
staff ``will consider and decide what to do,'' but emphasized that she draws a
distinction between the investigation and the issue of whether Weizman remains
in office.
</P>
<P>
	   She did not rule out the possibility that Weizman might be called on to
answer police questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman issued a statement saying the decision to involve the police to
``help find the truth'' is ``natural (and) wise.'' The statement did not mention
the issue of resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman, a controversial, outspoken figure in the ceremonial role of
president, riled opponents of Prime Minister Ehud Barak by coming out strongly
in favor of Barak's policy of compromise for peace with Syria -- just as the
money scandal broke Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Pressure has been building on Weizman to step down because of the appearance
of improper behavior. Cabinet Minister Yitzhak Levy called on him to resign
regardless of whether his actions were technically legal.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman has claimed that he did nothing wrong, receiving a large gift from a
personal friend and not reporting it either to tax authorities or state
officials, though he was a member of parliament and later a Cabinet minister at
the time the money was coming in.
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman said he consulted his personal attorney and followed his advice. A
file apparently stolen from the attorney's office and handed to a reporter set
off the scandal. An ex-employee in the attorney's office was ordered held by
police for six days Thursday on suspicion of stealing documents.
</P>
<P>
	   The charismatic, unpredictable Weizman, 75, was a founder of Israel's air
force and continued to fly fighter planes until recent years. Entering politics,
he helped right-wing Prime Minister Menahem Begin make peace with Egypt in 1979,
then jumped to the moderate Labor party. Always controversial, he met with
Palestinian leaders while such meetings were still illegal under Israeli law.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent months, after suffering from ill health, Weizman has hinted he
might step down before his term expires in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Some Say Drug War Being Lost  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With victory in the war against drugs still not in sight,
the Clinton administration is preparing for another escalation that includes a
$1.6 billion package to assist Colombia's counternarcotics efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was traveling to the
Colombian coastal city of Cartagena, the site of an antidrug summit a decade
earlier where President Bush said the United States was ready to join forces
with Colombia, Bolivia and Peru to battle drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Virtually no one is happy with what has occurred on the drug front since
that summit.
</P>
<P>
	   Of all the figures relating to the drug war, perhaps none is more
discouraging than the 140 percent increase in coca leaf production in Colombia
-- 81,400 tons in 1998 compared with 33,900 tons in 1989. Estimates last year
indicated a continuing explosion despite record levels of eradication. The
cocaine glut means a decline in prices -- 55 percent since 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   As for opium poppy, the raw material for heroin, production in Colombia was
zero in 1989. By last year, it had skyrocketed to 61 tons, much of it earmarked
for U.S. markets, where illegal drug use remains high among teen-agers and young
adults.
</P>
<P>
	   A government report last year indicated 10 percent of U.S. teen-agers use
illegal drugs -- down from 1997 but still nearly double 1992's level.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Albright planned to confer with Colombian President Andres
Pastrana about the administration's two-year package for Colombia. Among other
components, the package will provide training for special counternarcotics
battalions and 30 Blackhawk and 33 Huey helicopters for counterdrug activities.
Funds also will be used for radar, aircraft and airfield upgrades, and improved
intelligence gathering.
</P>
<P>
	   When Bush met in February 1990 with the presidents of Colombia, Bolivia and
Peru, he hailed the session as ``having forged an unprecedented alliance against
the drug trade.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush promised economic aid to help the three countries wage the drug battle
and to persuade their farmers to switch to legal crops. A joint communque called
for tougher enforcement of drug laws, better exchanges of information and
increased restrictions on the movement of firearms.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of U.S. policy abound.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The drug war is futile,'' says Tim Lynch of the libertarian Cato
Institute. ``Progress is not being made and we need to look at alternatives,
including legalization.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lynch says U.S. territory is simply too vast to prevent illicit drugs from
entering the country, particularly in view of the increasingly high-tech devices
used by drug kingpins. To confuse U.S. law enforcement, drug cartels sometimes
resort to fake transactions, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.
Use of encryption devices also impairs antidrug efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   John Walsh of Drug Strategies, a private group, says $26 billion has been
spent over the past 20 years on interdiction and international supply control
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By key measures with which we can gauge drug availability, they are all
going in the wrong direction,'' Walsh said, arguing that the answer is to halt
interdiction and eradication efforts and instead focus on treatment of drug
users.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know chapter and verse that treatment works to reduce drug use and
reduce crime related to drug use,'' he said. The problem, he says, is that
treatment programs are underfunded.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking aim at the planned increase in military assistance for Colombia
counternarcotics efforts, the liberal Washington Office on Latin America says
the proposal threatens to implicate the United States in Colombia's brutal civil
war.
</P>
<P>
	   But the plan appears to have substantial congressional support, especially
among Republican lawmakers. The proposal is in line with a $1.6 billion program
outlined last fall by three GOP senators: Paul Coverdell of Georgia, Mike DeWine
of Ohio and Charles Grassley of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Coverdell said the administration proposal ``is good news for Colombia and
good news for our nation's ability to stem the flow of illegal drugs across our
borders.''

<HEADLINE> DMV feverishly putting old test in, but it won't save much time  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - In an effort to attack chronically long lines,
workers this week retooled auto inspection stations across New Jersey to bring
back old auto emissions tailpipe tests.
<P>
	   But how much time will this move actually save motorists?
</P>
<P>
	   The old tests will be used when waiting times reach at least 45 minutes at
centralized inspection stations, according to an agreement reached last week by
the Whitman administration and federal environmental officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan began at several stations earlier this week and was expanded to all
DMV stations on Thursday. Division of Motor Vehicles spokesman Dana Sullivan
said four inspection stations switched to the old tailpipe test on Wednesday.
This option will continue through June 30.
</P>
<P>
	   But while the move was pitched last week as a big time-saver for motorists,
switching to the old test doesn't mean motorists will speed through the
inspection line.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because the new inspection tests, which were launched Dec. 13,
feature three parts: the enhanced emissions test, a brake test, and a suspension
test, which also tests for gas tank pressure. When waiting times exceed 45
minutes, the old tailpipe test will be substituted for the enhanced emissions
test. But Parsons Infrastructure and Technology, the private company that runs
the stations, will continue to administer the other two tests.
</P>
<P>
	   That means the time savings will be only about two to three minutes per car,
according to Division of Motor Vehicles estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly, this option does not solve the line situation at any particular
station," said DMV director Richard Kamin. "It's an option that might help, but
is not going to solve the very severe problems Parsons is having with this
contract."
</P>
<P>
	   Carl Golden, spokesman for Parsons, said the modest per-car time-savings
will add up for motorists at the end of the line.
</P>
<P>
	   "The amount of time saved per car is not significant in itself, but if you
take it and multiply it across six lanes, it's going to cut down on the lines,"
Golden said.
</P>
<P>
	   Long lines for the new inspection tests have angered drivers and frustrated
the Whitman administration. The state has removed $369,000 from Parsons'
payments because of the waiting time, and the firm has promised to hire 300 more
workers to speed the process. This week, Parsons conceded computer glitches with
the brake tests have caused some cars to be flunked when their brakes were fine.
The company has vowed to clear up the problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman has said she does not want to shut down any of the
safety aspects of the inspection process. Senate President Donald DiFrancesco
last week offered a bill to give Whitman several options to cut the lines,
including exempting cars five years old or newer from the emissions and safety
tests. However, Whitman may not need the Legislature to take such action.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal Environmental Protection Agency is allowing New Jersey to return
to the old tailpipe test when waiting times exceed 45 minutes as a stopgap
measure. The old test basically looks for carbon monoxide. The new test, a
treadmill-like device that attempts to simulate road conditions, also looks for
compounds that create asthma-causing smog.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan said four stations used the old tailpipe test on Wednesday, but he
didn't know how many switched on Thursday. He said overall, lines were shorter
on Thursday: only eight stations had waits exceeding 30 minutes at the peak
time.
</P>
<P>
	   "We won't know for sure how much an effect this will have, because we're
hoping that as operators become more and more experienced, that will save time
too," Sullivan said. "This is an emergency, interim measure. This was one of our
better days."
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan said those at the end of long lines are still being offered the
option to return for an inspection at another time. The state offers a waiver of
up to 45 days to these motorists.

<HEADLINE> Latest city crackdown targets reckless drivers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Next week, police will start seizing the cars of
motorists who drive double the speed limit or commit other reckless driving
violations, Police Commissioner Howard Safir and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
announced Thursday.
<P>
	   This new crackdown on reckless driving - instituted because of an increase
in traffic-related fatalities - is similar to the NYPD's zero tolerance on
drunken driving, and has civil libertarians frustrated.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't hang the person first and give them the trial later," said Norman
Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
	   It's also the latest in a long line of crackdowns Giuliani has enacted in
his time as mayor, and the NYPD has been christened to enforce. Several of those
initiatives, such as jaywalking and double parking, have been for the most part
ignored by New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   But the DWI crackdown has apparently worked, according to Safir. The goal of
this crackdown was to lower the DWI-related fatality rate. In 1999, there were
23 such fatalities in the city, compared with 31 in 1998, according to police
statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   And he thinks the same success can be achieved with the reckless driving
campaign. Including drunken driving fatalities, 416 people were killed in
traffic-related accidents in the city last year, compared with 367 in 1998,
police statistics show.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there's a place that I've been where people are drinking
alcohol where I don't here someone mention the fact that they 'can't go drive my
car because the police are going to seize it,"' Safir said. "And that's the kind
of public awareness we want for reckless driving as well."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new guidelines regarding reckless driving citations on city
highways, a motorist will be slapped with reckless driving, a misdemeanor
charge, when caught driving double the speed limit, Safir said. The driver will
also be charged with speeding.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, if a motorist is seen by an officer committing three hazardous driving
violations - such as following too closely, unsafe lane changing and driving in
unauthorized lanes - he or she will be slapped with reckless driving and other
traffic violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Now for the car seizure part. Just like the DWI crackdown, if you own the
car, it will be seized, and a person must be acquitted of the charges to get
their car back. However, if you were driving someone else's car, the car will be
given back to the rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
	   Siegel said it will be interesting to see if the reckless driving campaign
holds up in court. Currently, the DWI seizure program is under the scrutiny of
the New York Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the city has the legal authority to do this," Siegel said.
"This is just another example of the increasingly authoritarian policies of
Giuliani's."
</P>
<P>
	   Siegel said in an article he wrote last year about the DWI seizure program,
he wondered how far the city would try to stretch its authority.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wondered in the article if they would start seizing cars from motorists
who were speeding," he said. "And here we are."

<HEADLINE> United Air Warns of Lower Earnings  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines, the world's largest airline, warned that
its earnings this year will be well below expectations because of higher fuel
and labor costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The news sent shares in UAL Corp., the carrier's parent company, plummeting
13 percent, or $9.87 1/2, to $64.87 1/2 in trading at 5:15 p.m. Thursday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   UAL, issuing its revised outlook before chairman and chief executive James
Goodwin met with analysts in New York, forecast earnings for the year at between
$7 and $9 a share. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had pegged
earnings for the year at $9.76 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   United said it anticipates a 2 percent to 4 percent increase in total
revenue, which will be outweighed by an expected 6 percent rise in costs.
</P>
<P>
	   It blamed the higher costs on fuel prices anticipated to average 25 percent
more than 1999 levels as well as contract negotiations with its pilots and
mechanics which are expected to result in higher wages
</P>
<P>
	   "If we were only dealing with the challenge of higher labor costs in 2000,
unit cost growth would actually be consistent with recent trends," Goodwin said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   United's costs this year also will be hit by investments in its Economy Plus
program, in which aircraft are being overhauled to provide more leg room for
full-fare passengers and the most frequent fliers.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline company expects the investments to ultimately pay off by drawing
more of the highest-paying passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, UAL announced it is creating an e-commerce subsidiary enabling
it to better sell travel products over the Internet. The new company will be
charged with managing the company's partnerships and relationships with online
travel sites.
</P>
<P>
	   The subsidiary is to be set up in the second quarter of this year with
headquarters in the Chicago area, UAL said. It will be headed by Scott Praven,
currently United's vice president for revenue management.
</P>
<P>
	   UAL is due to report fourth-quarter 1999 earnings next Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> TV Anti-Drug Messages Encouraged  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The federal government used financial incentives to
get television networks to work anti-drug messages into the scripts of popular
TV shows, and would review scripts to determine whether the point was getting
across clearly.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement, first disclosed Wednesday by the online news service
Salon.com, raised questions about the independence of networks and their
willingness to let others influence what goes on the air.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the shows reviewed by the government were NBC's top-rated "ER," CBS's
"Chicago Hope" and "Cosby," ABC's "The Drew Carey Show" and "The Practice," and
Fox's "Beverly Hills 90210," according to Salon.com.
</P>
<P>
	   The complicated arrangement stemmed from Congress' 1997 approval of a
program to buy anti-drug ads on TV. Networks were asked to match each commercial
spot bought by the government with a free one. Since the program started,
however, commercial time has become more valuable with the rising demand for ads
by Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has since agreed to give up some of its ad time -- as long as
the networks demonstrate that some of their programs convey anti-drug messages,
said Rich Hamilton, CEO of Zenith Media, the ad buying firm that helped develop
the idea as a go-between for the networks and the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   This freed up advertising time that the networks could then sell to other
clients at steeper prices, Hamilton said. The White House drug office valued the
programming messages it had approved at $22 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm fairly amazed that there has been any concern expressed about this,"
Hamilton said. "It has been so above board and clearly voluntary on the part of
everyone involved."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet an expert on media ethics said it raises questions about the motives of
the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "What it can do for the networks is make it seem that they are only going to
run those messages or shows that have prior government approval," said Aly
Colon, a professor at the Poynter Institute. "That may not be reality, but at
least it can become a perception."
</P>
<P>
	   Networks submitted scripts or tapes of completed shows for the government
drug office's review, said Alan Levitt, director of the national youth media
campaign at the White House drug office. At no time did the office suggest
changes or rewrite the scripts, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "All we said was, if you believe that a certain program that you intend to
broadcast delivers our message -- essentially that drugs can kill you -- submit
it to us for an evaluation and we may decide that we can credit you for a pro
bono match," Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Salon.com, quoting an unidentified source, said that in an episode of the
WB's "Smart Guy" series, two substance-abusing teen-agers were originally
depicted as being popular, but the script was changed after government review to
show them as "losers" hidden away in a utility room taking drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the WB had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
	   In at least 24 instances over the past few years, networks or producers have
come to the federal drug office for advice in how to portray substance abuse
situations, Levitt said. This was independent of the program offering financial
credit, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, producers and writers of "ER" have frequently contacted the
office. One recent storyline about a youth coming into the emergency room after
having abused alcohol was likely included after the office told producers that
alcohol is the most frequently abused drug among young people, said Donald
Vereen, deputy director of the White House drug policy office.
</P>
<P>
	   "We plead guilty to using every lawful means to saving the lives of
children," said another member of the drug office, Bob Weiner.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC has given scripts or completed shows to the drug office to review, but
has not accepted any financial credits for anti-drug messages, a network
representative said.
</P>
<P>
	   "NBC never ceded content control of any of our programs to the ONDCP or any
other department of the government," said Rosalyn Weinman, executive vice
president of broadcast content policy. "At no time did NBC turn over scripts for
approval by the ONDCP."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said the network submitted scripts to the drug
office, but received no financial credit because it had already used enough free
commercials. ABC does not plan to seek credit in the future, Hoover said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked why ABC had submitted scripts, Hoover said: "Why not? We don't hate
the ONDCP. We approve of what they're doing."
</P>
<P>
	   Said Steve Dnistrian, executive vice president of the Partnership For a
Drug-Free America, which has created anti-drug commercials: "The government is
not rejecting scripts or controlling creative direction here. That's absurd. You
can't buy networks that cheap."

<HEADLINE> Italian Leftist Promotes Economics  </HEADLINE>
   By VANIA GRANDI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME (AP) -- The leader of Italy's largest governing party warned Thursday
that his party would self-destruct if it failed to accept globalization and
fully embrace economic and social reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter Veltroni of the Democratic Left implored some 3,000 delegates
gathered in an old Fiat car factory for a party convention to support more open
economic policies, such as privatization and flexible work contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   He also pushed for reforms in the country's pension and health care system,
which is among the most generous in Europe. The system is currently strained by
the imbalance between the growing number of retirees and shrinking number of
contributors. Italy is also plagued by an 11 percent jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Veltroni's push for reforms is a clear sign of the party's transformation.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the largest Communist party in the West, the Democratic Left has shed
everything from its red hammer and sickle symbol to its Marxist policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Veltroni has tried to model the Democratic Left after the British Labor
Party, going so far as to adopt the English slogan ``I Care'' for the convention
and bringing in British rock star Sting for a live performance. The meetings,
which run through Sunday, kicked off to the beat of John Lennon's ``Imagine.''
</P>
<P>
	   The major force in Premier Massimo D'Alema's center-left coalition
government, the Democratic Left was expected to use the convention in part to
formulate government policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The gathering comes less than a month after D'Alema -- a former leader of
the Democratic Left -- briefly resigned under pressure from a disgruntled
centrist ally in his coalition. The premier came back four days later with a
reshuffled Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   The centrist and hardline leftist parties that the governing coalition is
courting to strengthen its position for upcoming regional elections said
Veltroni's speech did not entirely convince them. But they did not rule out a
future alliance.

<HEADLINE> Warner-Lambert spurns American Home merger offer for Pfizer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Pfizer Inc. emerged Thursday as the likely winner in the
high stakes battle for rival drugmaker Warner-Lambert Co.
<P>
	   Two months after agreeing to merge with American Home Products Corp.,
Warner-Lambert executives bowed to investor pressure and said they would
negotiate a buyout from Pfizer instead.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer has been trying to break up the marriage of its two competitors since
the day they announced their stock swap deal on Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer's counter-offer for Warner-Lambert was higher from start and the gap
has widened because American Home's share price has steadily declined.
</P>
<P>
	   As of late Thursday, Pfizer's bid was worth $79.4 billion - about the same
as it was when the fight began - while American Home's original $70.5 billion
offer had fallen to $54.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert's decision leaves American Home Products facing its third
failed merger attempt in less than two years. American Home, maker of Robitussin
cough syrup and the best-selling estrogen replacement pill Premarin, is expected
to sweeten its takeover offer. But analysts have little doubt that a
Pfizer-Warner-Lambert marriage will be consummated.
</P>
<P>
	   Either suitor in the fight for Warner-Lambert would become the world's
largest drugmaker, and gain a significant edge in discovering new medicines and
selling existing ones. Pfizer makes the blockbuster impotence drug Viagra.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors have been urging Warner-Lambert executives to re-evaluate their
decision to unite with American Home, so Thursday's decision wasn't a big
surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was inevitable," said Hemant Shah, a drug analyst in Warren, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street applauded Warner-Lambert's move, sending its shares up $5.06 1/4
to $91.87 1/2 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Pfizer rose $1.75
to $36.87 1/2 and American Home rose 43 3/4 cents to $42.62 1/2, also on the
NYSE.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the price differential, Warner-Lambert has grown increasingly
concerned about American Home's legal liability associated with health problems
tied to the fen-phen diet drug cocktail, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home thought it had put these concerns aside in September when it
negotiated a national legal settlement, but that deal is in danger of falling
through because many customers may reject it and file suits on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Thursday, Warner-Lambert's board said that "in light of
changing circumstances" it had concluded Pfizer's offer "is better financially
for Warner-Lambert shareholders than the proposed merger with American Home
Products."
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert, the fastest growing major drugmaker, is the world's
15th-largest prescription drug company. The Morris Plains N.J.-based company
makes the blockbuster cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, which it co-markets
with New York-based Pfizer, with estimated 1999 sale of $3.3 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer has been aggressively pursing a hostile takeover by seeking the
ouster of Warner-Lambert's board of directors. Pfizer also sued Warner-Lambert
for allegedly failing to properly consider its bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Up until Thursday, Warner-Lambert defended its original merger plan, saying
American Home had a superior research pipeline of new medicines.
</P>
<P>
	   As the fight has grown nastier, Warner-Lambert countersued Pfizer and has
even sought to terminate Pfizer's rights to co-market and share profits from
Lipitor. The first trial was scheduled to start Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sooner or later Warner had to address Pfizer's offer, and it was better to
do it across the table than in a courtroom," said Bob Kirby, an analyst with
Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the bickering, Kirby said Pfizer and Warner-Lambert officials should
be able to strike a deal soon. But he suspected that Warner Chairman Lodewijk
J.R. de Vink won't have a role at Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer applauded Warner-Lambert's move.
</P>
<P>
	   "We look forward to an expeditious completion of the transaction combining
the two fastest-growing companies in our industry and creating the best
pharmaceutical company in the world," Pfizer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Madison, N.J.-based American Home indicated it was not ready to give up the
fight.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to support the strategic merger of equals of Warner-Lambert and
American Home Products under our existing merger agreement, the terms of which
remain in full force and effect."
</P>
<P>
	   The American Home-Warner-Lambert deal requires that if either side walks
away from the deal it must pay a $1.8 billion breakup fee.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home's efforts to find a merger partner have been frustrated
repeatedly. In 1998, attempts to link with Monsanto Co. and SmithKline Beecham
PLC both failed.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said American Home has enough new drugs remain competitive in the
short term, but still needs to find a partner to keep up with the world's top
tier firms. A merger is unlikely until the company can satisfy Wall Street that
it has solved its diet drug liability problem.

<HEADLINE> Wholesale Level Inflation Up 3 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A big jump in gasoline prices helped push inflation at
the wholesale level up 3 percent last year, the largest gain since 1990 when
Iraq invaded Kuwait and drove up energy costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices were tame otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department's Producer Price Index, released Thursday, showed
inflation in most other areas was relatively well-behaved. A second government
report said consumer spending roared ahead, boosting retail sales 8.9 percent
last year, the fastest pace since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding energy and food, wholesale prices rose just 0.9 percent last year,
even better than a 2.5 percent increase in 1998 and evidence inflation remains
under control, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We got kicked by energy prices last year but if you threw energy out it was
a good year. Inflation was contained," said Donald Ratajczak, director of
Georgia State University's economic forecasting project.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy prices, which fell steeply in 1998 as the Asian currency crisis
depressed global demand, rose 18.4 percent last year. Gasoline prices surged
76.4 percent, the biggest gain in more than 19 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Production limits by oil-producing nations and increased demand from
recovering economies in Asia accounted for the increase in energy costs last
year, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   For December, the PPI, which measures inflation pressures before they reach
the consumer, was up 0.3 percent, reflecting sharp increases in gasoline and
other energy prices. Some economists believe energy costs will moderate this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The 3 percent advance in last year's wholesale prices was the largest annual
gain since a 5.7 percent rise in 1990. In 1998, overall wholesale prices were
flat.
</P>
<P>
	   The government was reporting Friday on price pressures at the retail level
with the release of the Consumer Price Index. Analysts were expecting prices to
rise 0.3 percent in December and in the range of 2.8 percent for the year. In
1998, consumer prices rose 1.6 percent. But the "core" rate of inflation, which
excludes energy and food, was expected to be lower than 1998's core rate of 2.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a burst of holiday shopping pushed retailers' sales up by a
bigger-than-expected 1.2 percent in December, capping a year where robust
consumer spending fueled economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   "The consumer engine is still pulling the economic train and doing so very
strongly," said Tim O'Neill, chief economist for the Bank of Montreal and Harris
Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times last year to slow the
economy and keep inflation from escalating. With projections for continuing
strong economic growth, most economists believe Fed policy-makers will bump up
interest rates again, probably by a quarter of a percentage point, when they
meet next on Feb. 1-2. The strong retail sales report would justify such a move,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial markets ignored the strong retail sales report, focusing instead
on the market-friendly news of benign inflation. The Dow Jones industrial
average reached a new record, closing up 31.33 points at 11,582.43. The Nasdaq
composite index broke out of a two-day slump to finish up 107.19 at 3,957.21.
Bond prices rose as yields on the 30-year Treasury bonds dipped to 6.65 percent
from 6.71 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the inflation front, energy prices rose 1.2 percent in December, led by a
8.5 percent jump in gasoline prices, the biggest gain since August.
</P>
<P>
	   Food costs rose 0.4 percent in December, pushing the total increase for 1999
to 0.9 percent, compared with a 0.1 percent gain for all of 1998. Sharp
increases in the prices of beef, pork, and vegetables in December offset
decreases in the prices of eggs, turkeys and fish.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside food and energy, wholesale prices rose a scant 0.1 percent in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment
benefits was unchanged at 309,000 for the week that ended Saturday. But the
four-week moving average, which smoothes out week-to-week volatility, was
294,000, a level economists said indicates that employers continue to scramble
to find scarce workers.

<HEADLINE> Fannie Mae Reports Record Profits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fannie Mae reported Thursday that its profits rose to a
record $3.9 billion last year from $3.4 billion in 1998, boosted by continued
growth in its mortgage business and a reduction of credit-related losses.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's largest mortgage-market company said it earned $3.72 a share on
a diluted basis in 1999, up 15.2 percent from $3.23 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Franklin Raines, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, called
1999's financial results "extraordinary."
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to this year, Raines said the outlook for Fannie Mae "is
extremely bright ... (despite) the possibility of further increases in interest
rates."
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve raised interest rates three times last year to slow the
red-hot economy and keep inflation from escalating. With projections for
continuing strong economic growth, many analysts believe Fed policy-makers will
bump up interest rates again, by at least a quarter of a percentage point, when
they meet early next month.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said its portfolio of mortgages grew to $523 billion as of Dec.
31 from $415 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Credit-related expenses from defaults and foreclosed property expenses fell

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Likely To Win Warner-Lambert  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. emerged Thursday as the likely winner in the
high stakes battle for rival drugmaker Warner-Lambert Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Two months after agreeing to merge with American Home Products Corp.,
Warner-Lambert executives bowed to investor pressure and said they would
negotiate a buyout from Pfizer instead.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer has been trying to break up the marriage of its two competitors since
the day they announced their stock swap deal on Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer's counter-offer for Warner-Lambert was higher from start and the gap
has widened because American Home's share price has steadily declined.
</P>
<P>
	   As of late Thursday, Pfizer's bid was worth $79.4 billion -- about the same
as it was when the fight began -- while American Home's original $70.5 billion
offer had fallen to $54.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert's decision leaves American Home Products facing its third
failed merger attempt in less than two years. American Home, maker of Robitussin
cough syrup and the best-selling estrogen replacement pill Premarin, is expected
to sweeten its takeover offer. But analysts have little doubt that a
Pfizer-Warner-Lambert marriage will be consummated.
</P>
<P>
	   Either suitor in the fight for Warner-Lambert would become the world's
largest drugmaker, and gain a significant edge in discovering new medicines and
selling existing ones. Pfizer makes the blockbuster impotence drug Viagra.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors have been urging Warner-Lambert executives to re-evaluate their
decision to unite with American Home, so Thursday's decision wasn't a big
surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was inevitable," said Hemant Shah, a drug analyst in Warren, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street applauded Warner-Lambert's move, sending its shares up $5.06 1/4
to $91.87 1/2 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Pfizer rose $1.75
to $36.87 1/2 and American Home rose 43 3/4 cents to $42.62 1/2, also on the
NYSE.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the price differential, Warner-Lambert has grown increasingly
concerned about American Home's legal liability associated with health problems
tied to the fen-phen diet drug cocktail, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home thought it had put these concerns aside in September when it
negotiated a national legal settlement, but that deal is in danger of falling
through because many customers may reject it and file suits on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Thursday, Warner-Lambert's board said that "in light of
changing circumstances" it had concluded Pfizer's offer "is better financially
for Warner-Lambert shareholders than the proposed merger with American Home
Products."
</P>
<P>
	   Warner-Lambert, the fastest growing major drugmaker, is the world's
15th-largest prescription drug company. The Morris Plains N.J.-based company
makes the blockbuster cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, which it co-markets
with New York-based Pfizer, with estimated 1999 sale of $3.3 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer has been aggressively pursing a hostile takeover by seeking the
ouster of Warner-Lambert's board of directors. Pfizer also sued Warner-Lambert
for allegedly failing to properly consider its bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Up until Thursday, Warner-Lambert defended its original merger plan, saying
American Home had a superior research pipeline of new medicines.
</P>
<P>
	   As the fight has grown nastier, Warner-Lambert countersued Pfizer and has
even sought to terminate Pfizer's rights to co-market and share profits from
Lipitor. The first trial was scheduled to start Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sooner or later Warner had to address Pfizer's offer and it was better to
do it across the table than in a courtroom," said Bob Kirby, an analyst with
Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the bickering, Kirby said Pfizer and Warner-Lambert officials should
be able to strike a deal soon. But he suspected that Warner Chairman Lodewijk
J.R. de Vink won't have a role at Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer applauded Warner-Lambert's move.
</P>
<P>
	   "We look forward to an expeditious completion of the transaction combining
the two fastest-growing companies in our industry and creating the best
pharmaceutical company in the world," Pfizer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Madison, N.J.-based American Home indicated it was not ready to give up the
fight.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to support the strategic merger of equals of Warner-Lambert and
American Home Products under our existing merger agreement, the terms of which
remain in full force and effect."
</P>
<P>
	   The American Home-Warner-Lambert deal requires that if either side walks
away from the deal it must pay a $1.8 billion breakup fee.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home's efforts to find a merger partner have been frustrated
repeatedly. In 1998, attempts to link with Monsanto Co. and SmithKline Beecham
PLC both failed.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said American Home has enough new drugs remain competitive in the
short term, but still needs to find a partner to keep up with the world's top
tier firms. A merger is unlikely until the company can satisfy Wall Street that
it has solved its diet drug liability problem.

<HEADLINE> Feds Likely To Get Cuban Boy Case  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno implored those battling for
custody of Elian Gonzalez to return the 6-year-old boy to his Cuban father, but
the protracted dispute appeared headed for federal court first.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The issue is a father who wants his son home and grandparents who want
their grandson home and these are bonds that should be honored,'' Reno told her
weekly news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   An attorney for Elian's Florida relatives, who are caring for him now, said
they would go to federal court next week to challenge the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's ruling that he must be returned to his father in Cuba,
who wants him back.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, it was expected that INS would reject on Thursday a second asylum
petition filed this week on behalf of Elian by his Florida relatives. The
government was expected to tell their Miami lawyers by letter, as it did in
rejecting their first petition, that only his father could request asylum for
him.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic off Florida on
Thanksgiving. His mother and others fleeing Cuba with him had drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno voiced concern about the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My hope is that people will look at this little boy and get him into a
situation where he can live a normal life without television cameras and the
world in his face,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do you remember when you were 6? There were some days I wanted to run away
from home and there were other days when I wanted my mommy so bad I couldn't
stand it. ... I certainly think the experience of most people is that a
6-year-old is too young to speak for himself.''
</P>
<P>
	   To allow time for a federal court challenge, Reno said Wednesday the INS
indefinitely would extend its Friday deadline for turning the boy over. She
brushed aside a state court ruling delaying the boy's return and said any
challenge to the INS would have to come in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   She explained Thursday that the boy's status is an immigration matter,
solely in the jurisdiction of federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that the people involved in this situation care about the little
boy and want to do what's right by him and I think they have also indicated a
faith in the legal process. Let's let that happen,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno refused to spell out precisely the department's options.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice officials, requesting anonymity, said they could go to federal court
on their own for a ruling that the state court order does not overrule the INS
decision or for an enforcement order to carry out the INS decision. But they
said they wanted to choose the least provocative course, and, though they would
not say so directly, that course appeared to be waiting to respond to any
federal court action filed by the Florida relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer Eig, attorney for the boy's Florida relatives, said they would ask a
federal court for relief next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government should have respected the temporary protective order of the
Florida family court, as it was based on preventing imminent and irreparable
harm to the child,'' Eig said. ``Now we will take the case to a court they
cannot ignore.''
</P>
<P>
	   University of Miami immigration law professor David Abraham predicted the
Florida relatives would not succeed in federal court. But because no application
for asylum has been filed by Elian's legal custodian -- his father -- a federal
judge likely will say there is nothing to rule on, Abraham said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The judge will say there is no decision for me to make because Elian has
not been admitted to the United States,'' Abraham said. ``His father has
withdrawn the application for asylum.''
</P>
<P>
	   Eig said, ``We continue to invite Juan Miguel Gonzalez (Elian's father) and
his entire family to come here from Cuba and participate in the process.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, Raquel Rodriguez, Elian's maternal grandmother, told MSNBC: ``I
lost my only daughter and he's my only grandson. He's the only thing I have. I
feel horrible.''
</P>
<P>
	   After a meeting of Cuban exile leaders Thursday in Miami, Ramon Saul
Sanchez, leader of the Democracy Movement, an anti-Castro group, urged people to
remain home and said, ``Thank God because things are taking the road of the
court system.''
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney general bristled when asked if federal marshals would be sent
to seize the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The wonderful media ... (should) stop doing what-ifs and stop setting up
dramatic confrontations,'' she said. ``Let's say that the court process should
take its course. ... Don't go in and pick up little boys like that.''

<HEADLINE> Schwab To Purchase U.S. Trust Corp.  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- While most large brokerage firms are reaching out to small,
individual investors, the Charles Schwab Corp., which has already captured that
market, reached out to wealthy investors Thursday through an agreement to buy
U.S. Trust Corp. for $2.94 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
	   In a move reminiscent of America Online's proposed acquisition earlier this
week of old line media company Time Warner, discount and online brokerage firm
Schwab -- founded just 25 years ago -- has acquired one of the nation's oldest
and most respected investment firms in U.S. Trust.
</P>
<P>
	   New York-based U.S. Trust has provided investment advice and private banking
services to some of America's wealthiest families since 1853.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were enthusiastic about the deal, snatching up shares of U.S.
Trust and sending its stock price soaring $54.12 1/2, or by 69 percent, to $133.
Schwab shares rose $3.37 1/2, or by 9 percent, to $41 as of 5:15 p.m. EST on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wealthy Americans have traditionally used a significant amount of
handholding when it came to their investments. But they, along with the rest of
the U.S. population, want to have more of a say in managing their financial
affairs. This combination allows them to do that," said Tim Butler, a research
analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
	   The move was designed to fill existing gaps in both Schwab's and U.S.
Trust's current array of services, company officials said during a news
conference in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwab, based in San Francisco, is the largest U.S. online brokerage and
biggest discount brokerage.
</P>
<P>
	   But it was unable to meet the needs of its wealthiest clients, said company
founder and co-chief executive Charles R. Schwab. "Our customers are saying they
need more wealth management," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wealthy investors, meanwhile, have shown an increased desire to participate
in the online investing revolution sweeping Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies said there are more than 6 million U.S. households with a net
worth of over $1 million, and that the numbers of Americans with large
investment portfolios is expected to grow at a double-digit pace in the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
	   "The affluent market is the growth engine of investable assets in the U.S.,"
added Schwab president and co-CEO David Pottruck.
</P>
<P>
	   Millionaires currently comprise just 5 percent of Schwab's 6.4 million
customers, while U.S. Trust's core customers have more than $5 million each to
invest.
</P>
<P>
	   Pottruck said he decided to court U.S. Trust shortly after he became a U.S.
Trust customer in 1998. Noting the irony, Pottruck said Schwab "couldn't provide
my private banking services so I went to U.S. Trust."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to such private banking services as checking accounts, credit
lines and mortgage loans, New York-based U.S. Trust also helps clients create
trust funds to assist in passing on their considerable wealth to the next
generation.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwab will now be able to offer those services through its U.S. Trust unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the agreement, U.S. Trust shareholders will receive 3.427 shares of
Schwab stock for each share of U.S. Trust stock, or $140.51 in stock for each
U.S. Trust share, based on Thursday's stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies will retain their separate brand identities.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal is subject to approval by the Federal Reserve Board and other
regulators and to a vote by U.S. Trust shareholders. The companies said they
expect to complete the sale by July.

<HEADLINE> Rescuers Reach S. Africa Miners  </HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL J. WAKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Rescuers, clawing with shovels and their
bare hands, broke through a wall of rock Thursday night to reach nine miners
entombed for four days below more than a mile of earth and rock.
</P>
<P>
	   The miners emerged from the shaft on stretchers, rescuers holding their
intravenous drips as a precaution. They were in good condition but headed to a
nearby hospital for examination, said mine spokeswoman Charmane Russell.
</P>
<P>
	   A short crawl away from where the miners had awaited rescue deep in the
mine, four comrades lay dead from Monday's rock fall at the African Rainbow
Minerals gold mine in Orkney, about 110 miles southwest of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
	   Hopes were fading that two severely injured miners near the decomposing
bodies were still alive. Rescuers were expected to work through the night to
reach them, Ms. Russell said.
</P>
<P>
	   The rescue effort, progressing inch by agonizing inch, captured national
attention in a country built on mining, where hundreds die every year deep in
the earth's recesses. State radio broadcast regular live updates on the saga,
which has been front-page news all week.
</P>
<P>
	   Gold accounts for one-fifth of South Africa's export earnings. Pulling it
from the nation's shafts remains grueling and deadly work for the mainly black
employees despite safety improvements since the end of white minority rule in
1994.
</P>
<P>
	   South African gold mines are particularly dangerous because they are among
the deepest in the world, and more subject to earth tremors like the one that
caused Monday's rock fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 200 rescuers, many from other mining companies, joined the effort in
Orkney, working in eight-hour shifts. They have dug through 300 tons of dirt and
rock, clearing a path through a 60-foot upward-sloping tunnel, said Peter
Steenkamp, the mine manager. At times, the passage was only 18 inches high,
forcing the rescuers to wriggle forward on elbows and knees.
</P>
<P>
	   The rescuers used hand drills to bust up debris, winches to pull out
boulders and shovels and their hands to scoop away dirt and gravel, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rescuers were able to establish contact through the air pipe Tuesday
evening, after the miners spent 30 hours in isolation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first thing they wanted was water,'' mine spokeswoman Charmane Russell
said. ``They have since been in relatively good spirits, working with the
rescuers and quite calm, which is important.''
</P>
<P>
	   Through the tube, they were being sent water, a nutritional drink and
fluorescent tubes that throw off light when broken, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two workers were lying about 100 feet away from the main group. They had
been too severely hurt to move when the others made their way toward the main
shaft after the rock fall, Steenkamp said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two severely injured miners have been without food or water since
Monday, as it was too difficult for the other workers to get back to them. ``The
chances are not good'' that they would survive, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident victims were a cross-section of the South African mining
industry's workers, who number 430,000, more than half in gold mines. Eight were
from Lesotho, two from Mozambique, one from Swaziland and four from South
Africa. The migrant miners often support large extended families on average
salaries of $430 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, 312 workers died in mining accidents, according to the Minerals and
Energy Ministry. The fatality rate has declined since 1993, from 1.08 per 1,000
minors in 1993 to 0.86 five years later. Serious accidents -- meaning four or
more dead -- have dropped from 14 in 1992 to one last year, the industry says.
</P>
<P>
	   The Orkney mine, which dates from the 1950s, was the scene of one of the
nation's worst mining accidents. In 1995, a mine train fell into an elevator
shaft on a carriage full of men, killing 104.

<HEADLINE> 'Puffy' Indicted on Weapons Charge  </HEADLINE>
    By SAMUEL MAULL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Grammy-winning rap mogul Sean "Puffy" Combs was indicted
Thursday on charges that he had two stolen guns in his sport utility vehicle as
he fled a nightclub shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   One gun was found by police in the vehicle, and the other was thrown out of
the vehicle, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of Combs' associates were also named in the indictment: his rapping
protege Jamal "Shyne" Barrow on attempted murder charges, and bodyguard Anthony
Jones on a weapons charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs, 30, could get up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   "The decision to indict me is wrong," Combs said in a statement. "I'm
innocent and we will prove it. I am putting my faith in God and I know my name
will be cleared."
</P>
<P>
	   Three people were wounded in the shooting inside the crowded Club NY on Dec.
27. Combs and girlfriend Jennifer Lopez were arrested after they drove away from
the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the vehicle carrying Combs and Ms. Lopez, the singer-actress who
starred in the films "Selena" and "Out of Sight," had run at least one red light
while fleeing the club. A driver and bodyguard were in the front; the couple
were in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs was charged with possession of a 9 mm pistol found in the front of the
car, and with possession of another stolen 9 mm that was thrown from the
vehicle, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both guns had been fired, but the district attorney could not say where or
when the weapons had been fired. Until Thursday, prosecutors had not accused
Combs of having a gun that was thrown from the car.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs was charged with second-degree possession of a weapon, meaning he had
a loaded gun with intent to use it. He was also charged with third-degree, which
is simple possession of a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs has hired former O.J. Simpson lawyer Johnnie Cochran, who said Combs'
fingerprints were on neither weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs, who earned an estimated $53 million through his rap empire in 1998,
has been free on $10,000 bail since his arrest. He is due back in court Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Lopez, who testified before the grand jury, released a statement saying
she never saw Combs with a weapon on the night of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am surprised and saddened to learn of the indictment against Sean Combs,"
she said. "I support him wholeheartedly throughout this difficult time."
</P>
<P>
	   Combs was also arrested last April for allegedly beating a fellow music
executive, leaving the victim with a broken arm and jaw. Combs pleaded guilty to
harassment and was ordered to undergo counseling.

<HEADLINE> Administration Promotes Air Safety  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aiming to promote air safety, the Clinton administration
has forged a deal granting airline personnel immunity from punishment if they
report operational and procedural errors to the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement, which barring a last-minute snag could be announced at the
White House as early as Friday, is the culmination of more than a year of
discussions among the airline industry, the pilots and administration officials.
</P>
<P>
	   It aims to improve understanding of the errors that cause accidents --
errors that might go unreported by pilots or crew members who fear reprisals or
even punishment for violating FAA regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a reporting system that allows pilots to report safety discrepancies
and have them addressed by the FAA, the union and the airline in a nonpunitive
environment,'' said one person familiar with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Three people familiar with the deal said they expected the announcement to
be made Friday at the White House. All spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots at American Airlines and ground crew members of the Transport Workers
Union already are experimenting with safety committees that share information
among workers, airline officials and government regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the expanded deal, unionized pilots from American Airlines,
Continental Airlines and members of the Air Line Pilots Association, which
represents 50,000 pilots at 51 airlines, and others would participate in the
``Aviation Safety Advancement Partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots, mechanics and other airline personnel could go to committees
established by the program with problems they observe or even errors they
themselves commit. The aim is to increase the pool of safety information to try
to stop accidents from happening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you self-disclose, you can track trend information,'' said another
person familiar with the details of the program, who likened it to whistleblower
protection for airline pilots and other personnel. ``The thought is, let's talk
about it.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Leader Says New HMO Bill Coming  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress will deliver a managed care bill to President
Clinton, including a limited right-to-sue option, by mid April, said Rep. Dick
Armey, R-Tex.
</P>
<P>
	   Returning to an issue that deeply divided House and Senate Republicans last
fall, Armey, House majority leader, said that he believes a patient protection
bill should allow lawsuits, but only in federal courts and only after a patient
goes through the health plan's review process.
</P>
<P>
	   That's similar to a plan that House Republican leaders rallied behind as
they tried to defeat a broader HMO bill that included an unfettered right to
sue.
</P>
<P>
	   But some House Republicans joined with Democrats to pass a stronger bill.
Senate Republicans stuck together and passed a bill without right-to-sue
provisions.
</P>
<P>
	   It's now up to a Senate-House conference committee to hammer out a
compromise bill. Speaking at a conference on uninsured Americans Thursday, Armey
said that he and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., would urge the committee
to get to work so the bill can be sent to Clinton by Easter, which falls on
April 23.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to pull the conference together,'' said Armey.
</P>
<P>
	   He acknowledged that there may be a tough road ahead working out a
compromise with Senate Republicans who oppose giving patients a right to sue.
But Armey contended that greater public interest in reigning in HMOs has changed
the political landscape.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a lot of change in public awareness,'' said Armey.
</P>
<P>
	   HMO reform is a a hot political issue and it's likely that Republicans want
to get the issue out of the way before the November election.
</P>
<P>
	   The House bill ``is a plan that we ought to be able to get to,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texan also said that the bill Congress gives to Clinton will include
measures to make health coverage more affordable for millions of Americans,
including a new tax deduction for people who pay at least 50 percent of their
own health insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration is expected to include in its 2001 budget
proposal tax credits for people who purchase health insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Armey said the White House should give people a 100 percent tax credit, not
a 25 percent subsidy, as Vice President Al Gore has proposed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What good is it to offer a subsidy on one-fourth of a person's costs, if
that person can't afford the three-fourths that isn't subsidized?'' said Armey.

<HEADLINE> USDA Announces Trade Assistance  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sheep producers will get $100 million in government
subsidies, loans and other aid over the next three years to help them cope with
imports from Australia and New Zealand, the Agriculture Department said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Some $30 million will go for direct cash payments tied to production
practices and other steps producers take to improve their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This administration is committed to helping American sheep and lamb
farmers who are threatened by a surge of low-priced, imported lamb meat,'' said
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton pledged the assistance in July at the same time he
announced he was imposing tariffs ranging from 9 percent to 40 percent on
imported lamb in an effort to protect American producers.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past five months of 1999, imports dropped 38 percent and prices for
live lambs have risen 10 cents to 15 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the direct payments, USDA will provide:
</P>
<P>
	   --$35 million to guarantee loans for improving farms and processing
facilities and to cover ranchers' operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   --$15 million to eradicate scrapie, a brain disease in sheep.
</P>
<P>
	   --$15 million to purchase lamb for government nutrition programs.
</P>
<P>
	   --$5 million for marketing programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheep producers wanted more of the money for direct payments. But they said
Thursday were pleased with the funds. ``They're desperately needed,'' said Cindy
Siddoway, president of the American Sheep Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
	   There are about 69,000 sheep producers in the country. The leading
sheep-producing states, in order of production, are Texas, California, Wyoming,
Colorado, South Dakota, Utah, Montana, Idaho and Iowa.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Asks for Peace Positions  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK LAVIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The United States has asked Israel and the Palestinians to
draw up position papers explaining their stances on a peace treaty, a
Palestinian official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior U.S. diplomat, Aaron Miller, met with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Arafat
was asked to take the Palestinian paper with him to Washington, where he is to
meet President Clinton on Jan. 20 during U.S.-Syria negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel and the Palestinians began intensive negotiations toward a peace
treaty on Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat and Prime Minister Ehud Barak have set a target date of February for
reaching a framework agreement, including solutions in principle for touchy
issues such as Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees and the future of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat asked the United States to play an active role in the talks, said
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
	   Adviser Tayyeb Abdel Rahim said Arafat would to go Washington ready to
explain the Palestinian positions. But, he added: ``Israel has to be equally
ready.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat told Miller -- a member of the State Department's Middle East
negotiating team -- that the Palestinians insist on implementation of U.N.
resolutions that call for Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and allow
refugees to return to their homes in Israel, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinian negotiator said Arafat also made clear that the Palestinians
insist on establishing a state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel hopes to keep parts of the West Bank where most Israeli settlers
live. It also opposes allowing large numbers of refugees to return, and claims
all of Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
	   No progress has been reported in the negotiations. Teams headed by Israeli
diplomat Oded Eran and Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo have
been meeting once or twice a week to discuss the issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides assume that major decisions are to be made by Barak and Arafat.
While in the United States last week for talks with Syria, Barak called Arafat
to reassure him that Israel-Syria negotiations would not overshadow talks with
the Palestinians, and that he would meet Arafat soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, said the two leaders might meet in
Washington. Barak is to leave for the United States on Tuesday for another round
of talks with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 20, the day Arafat is to meet Clinton, Israel is scheduled to turn
over another 6.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian civilian control, under
terms of an interim peace agreement signed last September in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Palestinians complained Thursday that Israel is misrepresenting
the total size of the West Bank, allowing it to turn over less territory than it
should. In the past, Palestinian objections have delayed scheduled handovers of
territory.

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Unveils Debt Buyback Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, seeking to operate in the new
world of budget surpluses, adopted rules Thursday that will allow the government
to buy back up to $30 billion of the national debt this year, something that
hasn't happened for at least a century.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, in making the announcement, called the
debt buyback program ``an important new tool'' for the government to use in
managing the $5.76 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reducing the supply of Treasury debt held by the public brings enormous
benefits to our economy,'' Summers said. ``It means that there will be less
pressure on interest rates than there would otherwise have been and therefore
lower borrowing costs for businesses and lower interest payments for American
families.''
</P>
<P>
	   The administration, which first proposed the idea of debt buybacks last
August, has sought to portray its proposal as the responsible way to utilize the
government's burgeoning surpluses, the product of the current economic boom, in
contrast to Republican calls for large tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton said the debt buyback plan was a ``dramatic reminder'' of
how much the government's economic fortunes have improved after decades of
rising budget deficits and would allow the government to ``refinance old debt
and pay it down on the best terms possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the rules the government adopted, Treasury will conduct what is known
as a ``reverse auction,'' in which the government will offer cash to bond
holders who indicate their willingness to sell government bonds back to the
government.
</P>
<P>
	   The price will be set in a bidding process designed to make sure the
government pays prevailing market rates for the bonds it buys.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Under Secretary Gary Gensler, who oversees the debt operations,
said Treasury records show it has been at least a century since the federal
government has offered cash to buy securities that have not yet matured.
</P>
<P>
	   Gensler said the Treasury conducted limited swap operations in the 1960s and
as late as 1972, swapping new bonds for older bonds held by the public in an
effort to reorganize the types of bonds outstanding.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers said the debt buyback program would be launched in the coming weeks
with several operations conducted in the next 12 months, totaling up to $30
billion. Officials said the exact timing of the program and the size of each
buyback program had yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   The national debt now stands at $5.76 trillion, with the amount of that debt
held by the public totaling $3.6 trillion. The rest of the debt, some $2
trillion, is held by the government's large trust funds, primarily the Social
Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers noted that under current surplus forecasts, the entire $3.6 trillion
in debt held by the public could be eliminated over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   However, private economists caution that those long-range projections are
based on assumptions that the current good economic times, which have triggered
the swelling revenues, continue and that Democrats and Republicans resist the
urge to spend the surplus on new government programs or in tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Elimination of the $3.6 trillion of publicly-held debt would mark the first
time that the debt held by the public has been eliminated since President Andrew
Jackson accomplished the feat in 1835.
</P>
<P>
	   However, even if that goal is accomplished, it would still leave the sizable
$2 trillion in debt the government owes to the Social Security trust fund, money
that will be needed to finance the Baby Boomers' retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Participants in financial markets offered general support for the debt
buyback approach.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The $30 billion was on the high side of market expectations and the
initial market reaction has been positive,'' said David Jones, chief economist
at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co., a government securities dealer in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount of the national debt held by the public has been reduced over the
past two years by $140 billion, reflecting the fact that the government has
posted back-to-back surpluses over the last two years for the first time since
Dwight Eisenhower was president.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra cash allowed the Treasury to reduce outstanding debt simply by
selling fewer new bonds at its regularly scheduled auctions than the amount of
old bonds coming due.
</P>
<P>
	   That procedure will be employed again this year. But officials said the new
buyback procedure will allow them to better control the government's interest
costs by buying back longer maturities and substituting shorter-term maturities
with lower interest payments.

<HEADLINE> TV Anti-Drug Messages Encouraged  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The federal government used financial incentives to
get television networks to work anti-drug messages into the scripts of some
popular TV shows. The White House drug office even got the opportunity to review
scripts before the shows aired.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement, first disclosed Wednesday by the online news service
Salon.com, raised questions about the independence of networks and their
willingness to let others influence what goes on the air.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the shows reviewed by the government were NBC's top-rated "ER," CBS's
"Chicago Hope" and "Cosby," ABC's "The Drew Carey Show" and "The Practice," and
Fox's "Beverly Hills 90210," according to Salon.com.
</P>
<P>
	   The complicated arrangement stemmed from Congress' 1997 approval of a
program to buy anti-drug ads on TV. Networks were asked to match each commercial
spot bought by the government with a free one. Since the program started,
however, commercial time has become more valuable with the rising demand for ads
by Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has since agreed to give up some of its ad time -- as long as
the networks demonstrate that some of their programs convey anti-drug messages,
said Rich Hamilton, CEO of Zenith Media, the ad buying firm that helped develop
the idea as a go-between for the networks and the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   This freed up advertising time that the networks could then sell to other
clients at steeper prices, Hamilton said. The White House drug office valued the
programming messages it had approved at $22 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm fairly amazed that there has been any concern expressed about this,"
Hamilton said. "It has been so above board and clearly voluntary on the part of
everyone involved."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet an expert on media ethics said it raises questions about the motives of
the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "What it can do for the networks is make it seem that they are only going to
run those messages or shows that have prior government approval," said Aly
Colon, a professor at the Poynter Institute. "That may not be reality, but at
least it can become a perception."
</P>
<P>
	   Networks submitted scripts or tapes of completed shows for the government
drug office's review, said Alan Levitt, director of the national youth media
campaign at the White House drug office. At no time did the office suggest
changes or rewrite the scripts, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "All we said was, if you believe that a certain program that you intend to
broadcast delivers our message -- essentially that drugs can kill you -- submit
it to us for an evaluation and we may decide that we can credit you for a pro
bono match," Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Salon.com, quoting an unidentified source, said that in an episode of the
WB's "Smart Guy" series, two substance-abusing teen-agers were originally
depicted as being popular, but the script was changed after government review to
show them as "losers" hidden away in a utility room taking drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   A WB spokesman had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
	   In at least 24 instances over the past few years, networks or producers have
come to the federal drug office for advice in how to portray substance abuse
situations, Levitt said. This was independent of the program offering financial
credit, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, producers and writers of "ER" have frequently contacted the
office. One recent storyline about a youth coming into the emergency room after
having abused alcohol was likely included after the office told producers that
alcohol is the most frequently abused drug among young people, said Donald
Vereen, deputy director of the White House drug policy office.
</P>
<P>
	   "We plead guilty to using every lawful means to saving the lives of
children," said another member of the drug office, Bob Weiner.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC has given scripts or completed shows to the drug office to review, but
has not accepted any financial credits for anti-drug messages, a network
representative said.
</P>
<P>
	   "NBC never ceded content control of any of our programs to the ONDCP or any
other department of the government," said Rosalyn Weinman, executive vice
president of broadcast content policy. "At no time did NBC turn over scripts for
approval by the ONDCP."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said the network submitted scripts to the drug
office, but received no financial credit because it had already used enough free
commercials. ABC does not plan to seek credit in the future, Hoover said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked why ABC had submitted scripts, Hoover said: "Why not? We don't hate
the ONDCP. We approve of what they're doing."
</P>
<P>
	   Said Steve Dnistrian, executive vice president of the Partnership For a
Drug-Free America, which has created anti-drug commercials: "The government is
not rejecting scripts or controlling creative direction here. That's absurd. You
can't buy networks that cheap."

<HEADLINE> Hang him, then smile for the camera  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Once upon a time in America, mobs dragged people out of
jails or off the streets and hanged them from the nearest tree - in some
particularly shocking cases, burned them alive. Then, often as not, members of
the mob lined up to be photographed with the deceased.
<P>
	   Dozens of these pictures- some of them turned into postcards - go on public
display Friday at a Manhattan gallery. "It's clear to me that this is a piece of
history that demands an audience," said Andrew Roth, co-owner of the Roth
Horowitz Gallery, which is presenting the sobering exhibit.
</P>
<P>
	   Visitors may browse before photos of corpses of young black men hanging from
branches, telephone poles and, in one case, a bridge. There is a shot of a man
being incinerated, and another of "the half-burned head of James" on a pole. But
not all are black - there also are white bank robbers and other criminals, done
in by frontier justice.
</P>
<P>
	   The gruesome material was gathered over the past decade by James Allen, a
Georgia-based dealer in antiques and memorabilia, and is now part of the
Allen-Littlefield Collection at Emory University in Atlanta. The New York
exhibit is timed to the release of a book, "Without Sanctuary: Lynching
Photography in America."
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People reported
3,436 people lynched between 1889 and 1922, and one photo in the collection is
dated 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   During the peak years, most victims were black men accused of offenses
ranging from murder and rape to not stepping off the sidewalk to let a white
person pass. But it was not a strictly Southern practice, and whether in
Gadsden, Alabama, Duluth, Minn., or the "Hanging Tree" in Helena, Mont., someone
with a camera always seemed to be present.
</P>
<P>
	   Picture after picture shows local citizens gathered around the dangling
bodies - some undoubtedly perpetrators of the crime, others simply bystanders
agape with curiosity.
</P>
<P>
	   The amateurish snapshots reveal a sameness about the southern racist mobs
and western posses carrying out vigilante justice - rawboned, angular-faced men
wearing hats. In some, small children watch the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the photos were turned into souvenir postcards, some colorized and
inscribed with such notations as "Down in Old Kentucky," or "Negro who shot J.H.
Rogers at Ten Mile, Miss., 5-21-19."
</P>
<P>
	   At least one series of photos, from a double lynching in Okeman, Okla., in
1911, was copyrighted by the photographer. Another picture, taken after dark in
1900, is stamped, "Flash light by Dabbs."
</P>
<P>
	   The postcards with one-cent stamps could be sent legally through the mail
until about 1908, when they were banned. "I bought this in Hopkinsville for 15
cents. It's not on sale openly (the law forbids it)," an anonymous correspondent
wrote on the back of one postcard.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth said the postcards are not only curious but "insightful into the nature
of the medium and how it was disseminated in the public domain."
</P>
<P>
	   Pictures aside, perhaps the exhibit's most chilling entry is a 1921 pamphlet
issued by the National Association of Colored People. It reproduced the Jan. 26
and 27 front pages of the Memphis (Tenn.) Press that provided an account of a
white mob seizing a black youth from a jail in Georgia and transporting him to
Arkansas, where he was burned at the stake.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper duly reported how the kidnappers stopped off in Memphis and were
seen "laughing and talking" in the lobby of the Hotel Peabody, and how police
formed up to guard the roads, but did nothing to interfere - more than a decade
before the FBI won the power to take charge of interstate crime.
</P>
<P>
	   "Questions," Roth said when asked what people should take away from the
exhibit. "Questions about our culture, our history, our times. People aren't
being lynched today, that we know about, but there certainly are references ...
that we hear on the news, morning noon and night, that connect back to this
history."

<HEADLINE> Japan's Ruling Party Wants Youth  </HEADLINE>
   By SHIHOKO GOTO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan has a long tradition of respecting the elderly, but
members of the ruling party say some of their legislators may be a tad too
senior for the country's good.
</P>
<P>
	   Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers have proposed an age limit of 80 for
representing the party in parliamentary elections, a party official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are certain experiences and wisdom that only come with age,'' said
Hiromitsu Nishiwaki, an official of the LDP's political reform committee. ``But
setting an age limit would give a clear message that the LDP is eager to
rejuvenate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal supporters, who include former Foreign Minister Masahiko
Komura, hope to get it approved before the next general election, which must
take place before October.
</P>
<P>
	   But it is almost certain to face stiff opposition. Venerating the elderly is
a deeply entrenched value in Japan, and the country has a national holiday
honoring seniors.
</P>
<P>
	   Moreover, the plan would end the political careers of some of the LDP's most
prominent figures, including former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, 81, and
current Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, 80.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 500 seats in the lower house of Parliament, twelve are held by people
80 or older, and 59 are held by lawmakers over 73.
</P>
<P>
	   No date has been set for the party vote on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Japanese constitution sets a minimum age of 25 to run for parliament,
but there is no upper age limit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the private sector, most people have retired when they are past 70,''
said Nishiwaki. ``There is an increasing call from the public for politicians to
adhere to those standards too.''

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Thursday
on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwab, which owns the nation's largest discount and online brokerage, is
buying U.S. Trust for $2.7 billion in stock, or about $129 per share. U.S. Trust
provides investment management services primarily for wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it expects fiscal third-quarter earnings between 58 cents a
share and 64 cents a share, below analysts' forecasts of 73 cents a share.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch lowered their ratings on the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   The parent company of United Airlines said it expects to earn between $7 and
$9 per share in the coming year. Analysts had estimated UAL would earn $9.82 a
share. The company cited rising fuel and labor costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The boutique investment bank said it expects to report net income of 18
cents to 21 cents a share for the fourth quarter. Analysts had anticipated a
loss of 2 cents per share. Friedman Billings Ramsey officials cited strength in
its venture capital business.
</P>
<P>
	   The company could be forced to break into three parts to dilute its
competitive advantage, according to sources close to the government's antitrust
trial. A breakup would dismantle the software empire built by Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
	   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its rating on the stock to "outperform"
from "neutral." An analyst with the firm said Apple shares should reach 120
within a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Applied Materials Inc. agreed to acquire Etec for $1.77 billion in stock.
Etec makes equipment for making photomasks, a device used to lay down patterns

<HEADLINE> First USA To Lay Off Workers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- First USA, the nation's second-largest credit card
issuer, will lay off workers across the country as its parent company
restructures.
</P>
<P>
	   First USA spokesman George McCane said Thursday that the company's
Wilmington headquarters, which employs 3,300 people, would see the most layoffs.
Neither McCane nor Tom Kelly, spokesman for Bank One Corp., based in Chicago,
would say how many were losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   In papers filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bank
One reported it expected to save $260 million through layoffs and other
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials said they don't know how many First USA workers have been
let go. The U.S. Department of Labor requires companies to file notice with the
state 60 days prior to layoffs of at least 500 people. That did not happen in
this case, leading some to speculate that the layoffs will be minimal.
</P>
<P>
	   First USA has employees in 12 states. Bank One, which took control of the
credit card company in 1997, has more than 90,000 employees nationwide,
including those working for First USA.
</P>
<P>
	   The news of the layoffs came shortly after Bank One executives tried to
convince Wall Street analysts that they can turn around troubles at First USA.
</P>
<P>
	   Service problems at First USA, such as complaints that the company has
failed to post payments on time, have left the company with a dwindling customer
base.
</P>
<P>
	   A $500 million revenue shortfall at First USA hurt the parent company Bank
One, leaving Bank One 8 percent short of its own earnings projections.
</P>
<P>
	   Laid-off employees were notified Tuesday. All laid off workers were given
four months of severance pay, McCane said, with veteran workers getting
more.

<HEADLINE> Simon &AMP;Schuster Extend King Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Simon &AMP; Schuster has extended an unusual profit-sharing
deal with Stephen King, contracting for three more books from the bestselling
horror writer.
</P>
<P>
	   "This new agreement is a testimony to the strength and success of our
partnership," Simon &AMP; Schuster president and CEO Jack Romanos said Thursday. "We
look forward to being Stephen's publishing home for many years to come."
</P>
<P>
	   King left Viking/Penguin, his publisher for 20 years, in 1997. His initial
agreement with Simon &AMP; Schuster was reportedly for King and the company to
evenly split profits from his books, with the author receiving only "token"
advances and royalties.
</P>
<P>
	   In standard publishing practice, authors are paid a large advance against
sales of their book up front, and are paid royalties only when enough books have
been sold to earn back the company's advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Simon &AMP; Schuster, the publishing unit of Viacom Inc., did not disclose
financial terms of the extension. The company said it had published eight King
titles since the 1997 three-book agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The extension covers three works of fiction, to be published in hardcover
under the Scribner imprint, by Pocket Books in paperback and by Simon &AMP; Schuster
Audio as audio books.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm delighted to know that my future with Scribner, Pocket Books and Simon
&AMP; Schuster Audio is secure," King said in the release.
</P>
<P>
	   The author of "Carrie," "The Shining," and "Misery," seriously injured when
he was struck by a van in Maine in June, has begun writing again.
</P>
<P>
	   Simon &AMP; Schuster plans to publish a non-fiction book by King, called "On
Writing," this year. The first novel scheduled to be published under the new
agreement is titled "From a Buick Eight." Simon &AMP; Schuster spokesman Adam
Rothberg said no publication date had been set.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends at New High of 11,582.43  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Thursday after a report of relatively modest
inflation boosted the bond market and calmed jittery stock investors. Financial
shares led the Dow Jones industrials to a new closing record.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow rose 31.33 to close at 11,582.43, just past its previous record of
11,572.20.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators also closed higher. The Nasdaq composite index
broke out of a two-day slump to finish up 107.19 at 3,957.21. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 rose 17.43 to 1,449.68.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose after the Labor Department said inflation remained largely under
control in 1999. The department's Producer Price Index, which measures inflation
pressures before they reach the consumer, shot up 3 percent in 1999, the biggest
increase in nine years.
</P>
<P>
	   But most of the increase came from the volatile energy sector. Excluding
energy, wholesale prices rose just 0.9 percent last year. For December, the
index rose 0.3 percent, right on target with many analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports boosted investors' confidence that inflation is not escalating
quickly enough to merit sharp interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
Higher interest rates can hurt stocks by cutting into corporate profits as it
becomes more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed raised interest rates three times in 1999 in an effort to keep
inflation under control, and in recent sessions, stocks have been pressured by
fears that another series of rate hikes are ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's report eased those fears, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Fed is not behind the curve on inflation," said David Orr, chief
economist at First Union Securities Inc. While most analysts remain convinced
that the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points, or a quarter percentage point,
at its next meeting on Feb. 1 and 2, Thursday's report suggested the Fed won't
increase rates beyond that amount, Orr said.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dipped to 6.65 percent from 6.71
percent late Wednesday, benefiting bank and brokerage stocks that often suffer
when rates are rising. J.P. Morgan rose 3 3/16 and Chase Manhattan rose 1 1/16
to 71 5/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Merger activity also enlivened the sector. U.S. Trust, an investment firm
that caters to wealthy clients, soared 54 1/8 to 133 after agreeing to be
acquired by online and discount broker Charles Schwab for $2.7 billion, or about
$129 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   "That deal has prompted many investors to look at this sector in a new light
and consider other possible combinations," said Ned Riley, chief investment
strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest development in the consolidating drug industry also sparked
buying. Warner-Lambert said it would hold merger talks with hostile suitor
Pfizer, abandoning its November decision to be acquired by American Home
Products.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of all three companies rose. Warner-Lambert gained 5 1/16 to 91 7/8,
Pfizer rose 1 11/16 to 36 13/16 and American Home Products rose 7/16 to 42 5/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks reversed two days of steep losses. Apple Computer rose 9
9/16 to 96 3/4 after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its rating on the stock
to "outperform" from "neutral." Analyst Gillian Munson applauded the company's
strong product pipeline and said Apple shares should reach 120 in a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Despite some weakness so far this year, there is still a strong conviction
that the money to be made in this market is in technology stocks," Riley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft depressed the Dow for much of the session before turning higher in
advance of a late afternoon press conference. At the conference, founder and
chairman Bill Gates announced that company president, Steve Ballmer, will take
over the chief executive officer's slot.
</P>
<P>
	   Gates, who is stepping aside as chief executive, will remain chairman and
will also take over the newly created position of "chief software architect."
</P>
<P>
	   In extended-hours trading, Microsoft shares edged down to 107 3/4 from 107
13/16 at the 4 p.m. close.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was fairly volatile in advance of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's
evening speech on technology and the economy in a speech before the Economic
Club of New York. Greenspan has occasionally used his public speeches as an
occasion to telegraph the Fed's sentiment about the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders were also awaiting the government's Friday report on price pressures
at the retail level. Analysts expect the Consumer Price Index to have risen 0.3
percent in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 1.02 billion shares, compared with 968.78
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 11.15 to 501.19.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.8 percent, Germany's Xetra DAX
index rose 0.6 percent and France's CAC-40 was up 0.9 percent. Britain's FT-SE
100 fell 0.02 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise, Breaking 3-Day Slide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Government bond prices rose Thursday, breaking a three-day
losing streak, as the latest economic data showed inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year bond rose 11/16 point, or $6.87 1/2 per $1,000 in
face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.65
percent from the 2 1/2-year high of 6.71 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department's Producer Price Index, released Thursday, showed
inflation in most areas of the economy was tame. Excluding energy and food,
wholesale prices rose just 0.9 percent last year, even better than a 2.5 percent
increase in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   A second government report said consumer spending roared ahead, boosting
retail sales 8.9 percent last year, the fastest pace since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   With inflation under control it is less likely the Federal Reserve will
raise interest rates sharply when it meets next month. While a rate increase
still is widely expected, analysts said chances have been reduced for a big
increase at the Feb. 1-2 meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates hurt bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities rose 5/32
point to 7/32 point and intermediate maturities rose 5/16 point to 15/32 point,
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.39 percent as the discount fell
0.04 percentage point from Wednesday to 5.24 percent. Six-month yields were 5.67
percent, as the discount fell 0.02 percentage point from Wednesday to 5.43
percent. One-year yields were 6.07 percent as the discount fell 0.03 percentage
point to 5.73 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was
5.62 1/2 percent, up 5.50 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer said the new contract for its index
of 40 actively traded municipal bonds rose 1/16 to 91 1/2. The average yield to
maturity remained unchanged at 6.29 percent.

<HEADLINE> Feds Likely To Get Cuban Boy Case  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno implored those battling for
custody of Elian Gonzalez to return the 6-year-old boy to his Cuban father, but
the protracted dispute appeared headed for federal court first.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The issue is a father who wants his son home and grandparents who want
their grandson home and these are bonds that should be honored,'' Reno told her
weekly news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian Gonzalez's father, who wants the boy back, told ABC News that he
doesn't want to go to Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I went there, would they give him to me? No. Miami Cubans would just
entangle me in their political games,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said, speaking in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
	   An attorney for Elian's Florida relatives, who are caring for him now, said
they would go to federal court next week to challenge the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's ruling that he must be returned to his father in Cuba
</P>
<P>
	   The INS, meanwhile, rejected a second assylum petition filed this week on
behalf of Elian by his Florida relatives. Justice Department spokeswoman Carole
Florman said that only the boy's father could represent his son before the
agency. Ms. Florman said the new petition contained ``no new information.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic off Florida on
Thanksgiving. His mother and others fleeing Cuba with him had drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno voiced concern about the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My hope is that people will look at this little boy and get him into a
situation where he can live a normal life without television cameras and the
world in his face,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do you remember when you were 6? There were some days I wanted to run away
from home and there were other days when I wanted my mommy so bad I couldn't
stand it. ... I certainly think the experience of most people is that a
6-year-old is too young to speak for himself.''
</P>
<P>
	   To allow time for a federal court challenge, Reno said Wednesday the INS
indefinitely would extend its Friday deadline for turning the boy over. She
brushed aside a state court ruling delaying the boy's return and said any
challenge to the INS would have to come in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   She explained Thursday that the boy's status is an immigration matter,
solely in the jurisdiction of federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that the people involved in this situation care about the little
boy and want to do what's right by him and I think they have also indicated a
faith in the legal process. Let's let that happen,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno refused to spell out precisely the department's options.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice officials, requesting anonymity, said they could go to federal court
on their own for a ruling that the state court order does not overrule the INS
decision or for an enforcement order to carry out the INS decision. But they
said they wanted to choose the least provocative course, and, though they would
not say so directly, that course appeared to be waiting to respond to any
federal court action filed by the Florida relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer Eig, attorney for the boy's Florida relatives, said they would ask a
federal court for relief next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government should have respected the temporary protective order of the
Florida family court, as it was based on preventing imminent and irreparable
harm to the child,'' Eig said. ``Now we will take the case to a court they
cannot ignore.''
</P>
<P>
	   University of Miami immigration law professor David Abraham predicted the
Florida relatives would not succeed in federal court. But because no application
for asylum has been filed by Elian's legal custodian -- his father -- a federal
judge likely will say there is nothing to rule on, Abraham said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The judge will say there is no decision for me to make because Elian has
not been admitted to the United States,'' Abraham said. ``His father has
withdrawn the application for asylum.''
</P>
<P>
	   Eig said, ``We continue to invite Juan Miguel Gonzalez (Elian's father) and
his entire family to come here from Cuba and participate in the process.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, Raquel Rodriguez, Elian's maternal grandmother, told MSNBC: ``I
lost my only daughter and he's my only grandson. He's the only thing I have. I
feel horrible.''
</P>
<P>
	   After a meeting of Cuban exile leaders Thursday in Miami, Ramon Saul
Sanchez, leader of the Democracy Movement, an anti-Castro group, urged people to
remain home and said, ``Thank God because things are taking the road of the
court system.''
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney general bristled when asked if federal marshals would be sent
to seize the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The wonderful media ... (should) stop doing what-ifs and stop setting up
dramatic confrontations,'' she said. ``Let's say that the court process should
take its course. ... Don't go in and pick up little boys like that.''

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends 3 for Iraq Post  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan asked Security Council
members Thursday to consider three candidates to head the new weapons inspection
agency or come up with other names themselves, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan met for about an hour with the ambassadors of Russia, China, France,
Britain and the United States in a bid to get their approval for an executive
chairman for the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, or
UNMOVIC.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan proposed Sweden's U.S. ambassador and the former chief U.N. weapons
inspector Rolf Ekeus; Brazil's former U.N. ambassador, Celso Amorim; and
Finland's ambassador to Israel and Cyprus, Pasi Patokallio, according to the
Chinese deputy ambassador.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan asked the permanent five members of the council to report back Friday
on whether any of the three were agreeable, and to propose other names for
consideration, said the deputy Chinese ambassador, Shen Guofang.
</P>
<P>
	   UNMOVIC was formed last December to replace the U.N. Special Commission,
known as UNSCOM, which was charged after the 1991 Persian Gulf War with
uncovering Iraq's efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   UNSCOM inspectors pulled out of Baghdad in December 1998, ahead of U.S. and
British airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ekeus was UNSCOM's first executive chairman. He left the post in 1997 to
become Sweden's ambassador to the United States, and was replaced by the
outspoken Australian arms expert Richard Butler, who stepped down in June.
</P>
<P>
	   Amorim chaired three special U.N. panels earlier this year on Iraq's
disarmament, the humanitarian situation in the country, and the issue of Kuwaiti
prisoners of war and reparations from the Gulf War. He is currently Brazil's
ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
	   Patokallio was director for nonproliferation and arms control affairs in
Finland's Foreign Ministry from 1994-95 before becoming the ministry's deputy
director general for political affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan was to consult Friday with the 10 nonpermanent members of the council.
Under the U.N. resolution that created UNMOVIC, he must select an executive
chairman by Sunday. If no consensus can be reached by then, he may ask the
council for a delay, Shen said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Presents Farmer To Rap Bradley  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SLOAN, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore paid for a New Jersey farmer to
stand beside him in Iowa Thursday and give witness that Bill Bradley neglected
agriculture during 18 years in the Senate. ``I doubt if, today, he understands
the difference between corn and soybeans,'' farmer Roy Etsch said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, meanwhile, campaigned among New Hampshire business leaders and, in
a newspaper interview, offered new criticism on the old question of whether Gore
was guilty of race-baiting in his 1988 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The day's rat-a-tat fueled an increasingly noisy and negative contest for
the Democratic presidential nomination and its first two rounds of voting in
Iowa, on Jan. 24, and in New Hampshire, on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   His motorcade stirring a storm of dust, Gore ventured down dirt roads to a
farm house outside Sioux City to meet with 150 farmers and show off his know-how
on the complexities of hog packing and commodity pricing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You don't have to have a Ph.D. in farm economy to understand this,'' Gore
said in an apparent swipe at Bradley, the Princeton basketball star and Oxford
scholar.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore left the more direct criticism to Etsch, helpfully spelling his name so
reporters in the back of the barn could be sure to get the man's indictment of
his former senator.
</P>
<P>
	   Etsch described Bradley as ignorant of agricultural policy and unresponsive
to the New Jersey farmers he represented for three Senate terms. ``I would call
him up and everything else,'' Etsch said. ``I heard nothing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, whose campaign paid for Etsch to fly here from his Monroe Township
home, promised to ``raise Cain until we fix this farm economy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Tom Harkin also stood beside Gore in the freezing-cold barn and
assailed Bradley's record on farm policy. The senator, especially popular among
Democrats in Iowa's farming communities, also stars in a new Gore TV ad meant to
underscore that Bradley voted against an amendment that included aid for farmers
hit by 1993 floods.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who trails Gore in Iowa polls by 20 points or more, has conceded he
started the presidential race knowing little about farm policy, but he says he's
learned plenty in 31 visits to Iowa this past year.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, Bradley said the
farmers' downturn came during the Clinton-Gore watch and he tossed a
long-distance question back at Gore: ``Where were you? Where were you when this
was all happening?''
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, in a published discussion with The Boston Herald, Bradley said
Gore was responsible for making a national issue of the case of escaped murderer
Willie Horton in the 1988 campaign against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
	   Horton, a black man who committed rape while on furlough, became a symbol of
racially divisive campaigning during the Dukakis-Bush general election race
later that year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gore introduced him into the lexicon,'' Bradley said. ``It bothers me a
great deal. ... I wouldn't have used Willie Horton.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore could have found other examples if he wanted to show that Dukakis was
soft on crime, Bradley said. ``The racial dimension to that -- there were
probably a lot of other people who fit into that category.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign, which is bringing Dukakis to Iowa next week to campaign
for Gore, immediately put reporters in contact with the former Massachusetts
governor and marshaled a denunciation from House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's unfair to attack Gore in this way because it just isn't true,''
Dukakis told the AP in a telephone interview from California.
</P>
<P>
	   When Gore questioned him about the prison furlough program during a 1988
debate, Gore did not name Willie Horton and ``there certainly was no suggestion
on the racial side,'' Dukakis said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There weren't any pictures of Willie Horton as there was in the Bush
attack ads'' that aired during the general election fight with then-Vice
President George Bush, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement that Gore aides handed out as the vice president campaigned
later Thursday in Nashua, N.H., Gephardt said Bradley's statement ``unfairly
smears'' Gore.

<HEADLINE> Down Syndrome-Cancer Link Studied  </HEADLINE>
    By EMMA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- While people with Down syndrome have a high chance of
developing childhood leukemia, a new study shows they have only half the normal
lifetime risk of getting other kinds of cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts already knew about the leukemia risk faced by people with Down
syndrome, but the study by Danish scientists is the first to estimate their
chances of developing other cancers.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, published in this week's issue of The Lancet medical journal,
suggests those with Down syndrome may be protected because they have an extra
copy of a chromosome that contains cancer-fighting genes.
</P>
<P>
	   Normally, people have two copies of each chromosome -- one from each parent
-- but those with Down syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21, which has at
least one gene linked to leukemia.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists suspect the 10-fold increased risk of leukemia among those with
Down syndrome could be related to having the extra copy of the gene.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers could not say why people with Down syndrome appeared to be
less vulnerable to other cancers, but scientists have identified several genes
on chromosome 21 they suspect could help curtail the growth of cancerous tumors.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings provide a clue that there might be more protective genes on
chromosome 21 to identify.
</P>
<P>
	   "Further studies on these putative genes may have implications for the
understanding of (how cancer develops) and eventually the prevention of cancer
in the general population," said the study's leader, Dr. Henrik Hasle, a
childhood cancer specialist at Skejby Hospital at Aarhus University in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
	   In the study, the occurrence of cancer in 2,814 people with Down syndrome
was compared to that in the general Danish population. The research looked at
cancer occurring at any time from birth to old age.
</P>
<P>
	   Those with Down syndrome tend to die early, partly because they have heart
defects and develop Alzheimer's disease much sooner than normal. Many die before
they reach the age when tumors commonly develop.
</P>
<P>
	   But the study found that even after adjusting for their shorter life
expectancy, those with the syndrome had a 50 percent lower risk of non-leukemia
cancers, compared with their counterparts of the same age.
</P>
<P>
	   The advantage remained consistent regardless of their age.
</P>
<P>
	   "The finding that the decreased risk persisted in the older age groups is of
considerable importance for the future," said Charles Stiller, an epidemiologist
at the childhood cancer research group at England's Oxford University, which was
not connected to the study.
</P>
<P>
	   "Long-term survival in Down people is more common these days, and this study
suggests that Down syndrome people with a normal lifespan will be less
vulnerable to cancer than other people," Stiller said. "Once one is past the
period of raised risk of leukemia in childhood, the overall cancer risk is
appreciably lower than in the general population."
</P>
<P>
	   The most significant advantage was seen in breast cancer, according to the
study. The scientists expected to see seven cases among the Down syndrome group,
based on what occurs normally, but they found none.
</P>
<P>
	   They found no new cases of leukemia after the age of 29.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers acknowledged that the drop in risk for some of the cancers
could be due in part to non-genetic reasons such as a healthier lifestyle.

<HEADLINE> Mom Allegedly Leaves Three Kids  </HEADLINE>
   By NATALIE GOTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- One week after three children came home from school
to find that their mother had cleared out their apartment and moved away, police
arrested the woman on cruelty charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheryl Lynn Diggs, 35, was found Thursday afternoon, police said. They gave
no details on what led them to the woman. Ms. Diggs is accused of abandoning her
children, ages 5, 7 and 8. The children were put in state custody.
</P>
<P>
	   The 8-year-old, Kahim, told police that his mother told him on Jan. 5 that
she was moving and that he and his sisters would have to live in a foster home,
Cpl. Don Kelly said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The next morning, she rushed the three kids to get ready and then
physically pushed them out of the apartment when they were reluctant to leave,''
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
	   The children came home to an apartment empty of everything but a few toys
scattered across the floor. A neighbor took in the children, then called police
when Ms. Diggs did not return that evening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is just a horrible case of mental cruelty for these children,'' Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
	   An arrest warrant charging Ms. Diggs with cruelty to children was issued.
The offense carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The manager of the apartment complex said Ms. Diggs was being evicted for
not paying her rent. ``Six months ago, she was fine. Then something changed
her,'' Rebecca DeLaney said. She would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. DeLaney said she had helped Ms. Diggs sell the furniture to get some
cash for a new apartment.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. DeLaney said the children had been in foster homes before.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those kids were sweet little kids,'' she said. ``They were well dressed,
really neat.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Worker Plane Crashes in Libya  </HEADLINE>
   By BALZ BRUPPACHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- A twin-engine plane carrying employees of a Libyan
oil company to a refinery crashed in the Mediterranean Sea on Thursday with 41
people aboard. There were unconfirmed reports of fatalities.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighteen of the people on board the Swiss plane were rescued, according to
state-run Libyan television, monitored in Cairo, and search and rescue efforts
were continuing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The plane hit the water just off the Libyan coast and sank,'' said Hugo
Schittenhelm of the Swiss Transportation Ministry. ``A search for survivors and
for the aircraft is under way. Nothing can yet be said about the exact number of
victims.''
</P>
<P>
	   All 38 passengers on board were employees of a Libyan oil company, said
Franz Fassbind, chairman of Avisto AG air services company, which is based near
Zurich and owns the plane. There were also three crew members, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schittenhelm earlier said the ministry had unconfirmed reports that 15
people were killed. Fassbind told a Zurich television station that he had
information there were up to 15 dead, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen people on board were Libyans and the others were foreigners, the
Libyan television report said. It did not give their nationalities, but Fassbind
told a Zurich television they were citizens of four different countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The British Foreign Office later confirmed that 13 Britons were aboard the
plane, but officials did not know if any had died.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was headed east from Tripoli to an oil refinery at Marsa el-Brega,
halfway along Libya's Mediterranean Coast, when it ran into trouble Thursday
afternoon. About six miles before the airport, the pilot reported that both
engines had stopped working and he was going to try to make an emergency landing
on the water.
</P>
<P>
	   Aviation officials from Libya and Switzerland are investigating. The Swiss
investigator is flying from Canada, where he has been working on the probe into
the 1998 crash of a Swissair plane off the Canadian coast in which 229 people
died, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fassbind said his company has been working in Libya for the past 15 years
and had never had an accident before. The pilots were trained in Switzerland and
were very experienced, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second air crash involving a Swiss-owned plane this week. Crash
investigators had closed their office to work on the site of the first crash, in
which 10 people died when their Crossair Saab 340 came down shortly after
takeoff from Zurich airport.

<HEADLINE> Gore Presents Farmer To Rap Bradley  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SLOAN, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore paid for a New Jersey farmer to
stand beside him in Iowa Thursday and give witness that Bill Bradley neglected
agriculture during 18 years in the Senate. ``I doubt if, today, he understands
the difference between corn and soybeans,'' farmer Roy Etsch said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, meanwhile, campaigned among New Hampshire business leaders and, in
a newspaper interview, offered new criticism on the old question of whether Gore

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Do Well on Education  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush
scored the highest marks on educational issues in a report card on the
presidential candidates released Thursday by the National Urban League.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Democrats, Gore scored 13 of a possible 15 points in the ranking that
stacked the candidates' educational positions against those of the national
civil rights organization, such as opposition to school vouchers and raising
teacher quality.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, scored 5 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Republican candidates, Bush bested his competitors, scoring 7 points.
He was followed by Sen. John McCain of Arizona with 6 points and Steve Forbes
with 2 points. Both Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer received zeros. The report did not
include Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Reform Party candidate Pat
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
	   Candidates were judged on five principles: commitment to quality early
education, opposition to vouchers, providing quality teachers, access to
telecommunications technology and continuing social promotion until higher
quality schools are achieved.
</P>
<P>
	   In each category, scores ranged from zero, for opposition or no position on
an issue, to three points, indicating strong support for an issue.
</P>
<P>
	   While saying the ratings should not be viewed as an endorsement of any
specific candidate, Urban League President Hugh B. Price said he hoped the study
would help guide voters who support the league.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any presidential candidate who aspires to lead this country should commit
to eradicate achievement disparities, eliminate discriminatory educational
practices and ensure that all children have a genuine opportunity to learn and
achieve,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Gore's commitment to improving schools was ``palpable and
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president has made education the
top priority of his presidential campaign and relished the high marks.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Bradley's vision for education was promising, but expressed
concern about his ``inconsistent'' stance on school vouchers. As a senator,
Bradley voted for experimental voucher programs, but on the campaign trail has
said he doesn't believe vouchers are the answer to the problems with public
education.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke dismissed the criticism, noting that
Education Secretary Richard Riley recently said ``there is no real difference
between Bill Bradley and Al Gore in terms of their commitment to education.''
</P>
<P>
	   Of Bush, the report praised the Texas governor's record of increasing
education funding and improved standardized test scores among minority school
children in his state. But it chided Bush for trying fund an experimental
voucher program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Appraising Mr. Bush's track record as governor is complicated,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan defended Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every child should receive a first rate education and if a disadvantaged
student continues to be trapped in a failing school, Governor Bush thinks
parents should have the option to send their child to a different school,''
McClellan said.

<HEADLINE> Biotech Rice Could Solve Problem  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have genetically engineered a type of rice
that could end vitamin A deficiency in the developing world, a problem that is a
common cause of blindness and other health problems in millions of children.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers at a Swiss laboratory spliced three genes into the rice to
make it rich in beta carotene, the source of vitamin A, according to a report on
their findings appearing Friday in Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   The new crop, dubbed "golden rice" because of the hue the beta carotene
gives it, is not expected to be available to farmers for several years. Also,
scientists still have to determine if the altered rice loses any of the original
rice's nutritional value.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the International Rice Research Institute already is working on
breeding the new trait into popular varieties.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. biologist, in a Science commentary on the findings, hailed the
research as a "technical tour de force" because of its complexity and said it
"exemplifies the best that agricultural biotechnology has to offer."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rockefeller Foundation, the lead sponsor of the rice research, views
biotechnology as a solution to world hunger, and also wants to develop crops
that would be resistant to drought, pests and soil toxins. Scientists believe it
eventually will be possible to put iron and other nutrients in plants once the
genetic pathways are known.
</P>
<P>
	   Rice is a relatively poor source of many essential nutrients, including
vitamin A, but is the staple for half the world. An estimated 124 million
children worldwide are deficient in vitamin A, including a quarter million in
Southeast Asia who go blind each year because of the problem. Improved nutrition
could prevent 1 million to 2 million deaths a year, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
	   Rice naturally produces its own beta carotene, but it is lost in the milling
process. The biotech variety would have the beta carotene right in the
endosperm, the part people eat.
</P>
<P>
	   The rice is unlikely to be sold in the United States or Europe, but it has
public relations value for proponents of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
	   Most biotech crops developed so far are either tolerant of herbicides or
toxic to insects, traits of little benefit to consumers, and the seed companies
are struggling to overcome consumer resistance in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   The biotech rice could improve the industry's image because it was developed
without commercial funding and will be easily available to farmers, said Mary
Lou Guerinot, the Dartmouth College biologist who wrote the Science commentary.
</P>
<P>
	   "One can only hope that this application of plant genetic engineering to
ameliorate human misery without regard to short-term profit will restore this
technology to political acceptability," she wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of biotech crops say not enough is known about their safety or
effect on the environment. While acknowledging the potential benefit of the
rice, they say that should not be used to block efforts to require stricter
regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I certainly agree that certain applications of biotechnology can have great
social value, but that in no way obviates other concerns," said Rebecca
Goldburg, senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   It will take more testing to determine whether the biotech rice will meet a
person's daily needs for vitamin A. Although the laboratory rice may have
sufficient beta carotene, levels could vary in the varieties that are bred from
it, Guerinot said.
</P>
<P>
	   Getting consumers to accept the yellowish rice also could be a challenge.
They will have to be convinced the rice will prevent blindness and other health
problems, said Per Pinstrup-Andersen, director general of the International Food
Policy Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're changing the color of a very basic food staple for millions of
people, and that's never easy. But I think it can be done," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Use Money for Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- Sharpening their disagreement over tax cuts, George
W. Bush suggested Thursday that John McCain's proposal would leave too much
money for Congress to spend on ``bigger government,'' and McCain countered that
the Republican presidential front-runner's plan would lead to higher payroll
taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I must confess I am skeptical of appropriators,'' Bush said, referring to
members of the House and Senate committees that write multibillion-dollar
spending bills annually.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Somehow I have trouble believing that they're going to necessarily spend
it on debt reduction,'' the Texas governor said of the surplus funds that would
be left after McCain's tax cut took effect. ``I worry they may spend it on
bigger government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's tax cut, $483 billion over five years, would leave the Social
Security surplus alone, but spend from non-Social Security surplus funds.
McCain, in a written statement, said that wasn't enough, that a larger amount of
non-Social Security surplus funds must be set aside to make sure the retirement
program is protected.
</P>
<P>
	   By not shoring up the Social Security system now with surplus funds we are,
by fiat, agreeing to raise payroll taxes in the future,'' added McCain, whose
own plan is roughly half the size of Bush's. I have called this kind of
economics ``fiscally irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was defending his plan in a new 30-second ad beginning Thursday night
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men never crossed paths during the day as they made their campaign
rounds a little more than two weeks in advance of the nation's first
presidential primary, set for Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   But their cross-state sparring underscored the extent to which the campaign
is settling into a disagreement over tax cuts, an issue that has divided
Republicans for the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Two new public opinion polls released during the day pointed to a close race
in New Hampshire between the two Sun Belt political figures, but disagreed on
which man held the lead. One survey said it was Bush, the Texas governor who is
the national front-runner by far. Then other said it was McCain, running an
insurgent's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush did not mention that Republicans hold a majority in Congress, and he
made no other comments during the day that implied criticism of the
congressional wing of his party.
</P>
<P>
	   He made his remarks midway through a full day of campaigning that took him
from a high tech factory in Laconia to a lunchtime speech in this coastal city
to a town hall meeting in Londonderry before flying off to Iowa, which holds
caucuses eight days before New Hampshire votes.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather turned wintry, the first time the Texan had witnessed it in his
New Hampshire campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our first snowstorm press conference,'' aide Karen Hughes said
enthusiastically as Bush made his rounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is campaigning as the outsider in the race, and he told reporters
during the day one of the key issues will be ``executive experience'' versus
``Washington legislative experience,'' an obvious reference to McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the Republican establishment's embrace was evident during
the day. Judd Gregg, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Rep.
Charles Bass spent part of the day with Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has repeatedly accused Bush of advocating a tax cut that is too large
and risks harm to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   In remarks before a Rotary Club and afterward to reporters, the front-runner
seemed eager to keep the argument alive.
</P>
<P>
	   He lumped McCain and Vice President Al Gore together as the only ``two
voices'' in the campaign to say his own tax cut was too bold.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, McCain accuses Bush of providing overly generous relief
for the wealthy, echoing criticisms that Democrats frequently level at GOP tax
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor took that issue head-on at several points during the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's fair to cut the taxes on everybody if you're going to cut taxes at
all,'' he said to the Rotarians. At a news conference afterward, he re-enforced
his plan to cut the top tax rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said his plan would stimulate the economy as well as return money to
the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the money lies around the halls of Washington it's going to be spent,''
he said at one point. ``Appropriators appropriate,'' he said at another.

<HEADLINE> 'Wrong Mountain' Isn't for Broadway  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    An AP Entertainment Review
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- "Wrong Mountain"? Wrong venue is more like it.
</P>
<P>
	   Broadway would seem to be the most unlikely place for David Hirson's
ambitious and unwieldy screech of a play which opened Thursday at the Eugene
O'Neill Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a shrill, rarefied piece of theater, filled with a lot of arty
references to everybody from Strindberg to Sondheim, from Auden to Olivier, that
seem designed to showcase the playwright's encyclopedic knowledge rather than
his grasp of plot or characters. Don't look for it to last long on a street
where the happily middle brow beats out the querulously quirky every time.
</P>
<P>
	   The "Mountain" story: Henry Dennett is a minor poet facing late middle age
and the prospect of a less-than-fabulous legacy. He is a scholarly curmudgeon,
jealous of his ex-wife's new boyfriend, a hit-producing Broadway playwright, no
less.
</P>
<P>
	   The man also is experiencing writer's block, a condition that is symbolized
by a 40-pound worm that has found its way into his intestinal tract. And, yes,
the worm makes an appearance. No wonder Dennett is so disagreeable.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, he is disdainful of anything that smacks of the theatrical. "A
Biblia pauperum -- a Bible in pictures for the benefit of the illiterate" is
what the poet calls theater.
</P>
<P>
	   As a lark, Dennett says he can write a play -- and does. To his horror, the
work gains him an audience his poems never did. The man sneers and screams his
way to success.
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Rifkin gets quite a workout as the dyspeptic scribe, making himself as
unpleasant as possible, not only to the other people on stage, but to the
audience as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Along the way there are moments of giggly fun, most of them provided by a
hammy director portrayed by the wonderful Daniel Davis. He has the plummiest
British accent this side of Vincent Price.
</P>
<P>
	   This director runs a playwrights festival where Dennett's play is in
competition with two other works. One is an imagined conversation between famed
soprano Nellie Melba and first lady Eleanor Roosevelt called "Nellie and Ellie";
the other -- "Cerro Torre" -- tests the boundaries between truth and illusion.
It is written by an idealistic young playwright whose combative conversations
with the cantankerous Dennett provide the play's best moments.
</P>
<P>
	   "An artist is an artist regardless of the form," says the aspiring writer,
played with earnest charm by Daniel Jenkins. "Talent doesn't just come and go
depending on circumstances."
</P>
<P>
	   One suspects the play has undergone major condensation since its debut last
October in San Francisco. Most of the large cast has little to do -- except
complain about the poet.
</P>
<P>
	   Beth Dixon, as the former spouse, and Michael Winters, her new fling, serve
mainly as targets for Dennett's sniping. So do Ilana Levine and Bruce Norris, as
the man's unpleasant children. "Casualties of a failing university system," he
calls his petulant offspring.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the loud protests of its contrary main character, the comedy, in the
end, actually celebrates the middle-class business known as Broadway. By then,
the poet is wondering if he has been climbing the wrong mountain all along,
writing verse when he should have been writing plays. He even begins to like
theater.
</P>
<P>
	   The evening moves in fits and starts. Director Richard Jones can't seem to
sustain a forward momentum. Designer Giles Cadle's fanciful settings are at
least theatrical. They range from a toy train that trundles across the stage to
a campy giant statue of Lithia the corn goddess to a backdrop of jagged peaks
that give the play its title.
</P>
<P>
	   Hirson is the author of "La Bete," one of Broadway's more famous -- and
expensive -- flop plays. Set in 17th century France and written in rhymed
couplets, the elaborate comedy dared the audience to think while they were being
entertained. "Wrong Mountain" has the same lofty ambitions, but its message is
even more muddled.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Buying Hughes Satellite Unit  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hughes Electronics Corp. is getting out of the aerospace
industry to focus on entertainment and Internet services, striking a $3.75
billion deal with Boeing Co. on Thursday to sell its satellite-building
business.
</P>
<P>
	   The pact turns Boeing into the world's biggest commercial satellite maker
and allows Hughes executives to pursue their goal of becoming a dominant player
in the world of high-speed wireless communications.
</P>
<P>
	   "These strategic moves accelerate the transformation of Hughes into a highly
focused entertainment and data information services and distribution company,"
said Michael T. Smith, chairman and CEO of Hughes.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal will boost revenues and earnings from Boeing's space and
communications operations about one-third. The Hughes operations being acquired
were believed to have generated sales of $2.3 billion during 1999, Boeing said
in a news release.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing also will be able to write off $500 million of the buying price
through a new tax regulation that allows the deduction of goodwill, Boeing chief
financial officer Debbie Hopkins said. The writeoff effectively will reduce the
price to $3.25 billion, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes has a backlog of 36 satellites on order worth an estimated $4
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   "Boeing intends to be No. 1 in space. This acquisition is a significant step
forward in executing our goal of becoming the industry leader in integrated,
space-based information and communications," said Phil Condit, Boeing chairman
and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes is owned by General Motors Corp., but its shares trade separately
from regular GM shares.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Hughes' space and communications unit, Boeing gets Hughes'
Electron Dynamics and Spectrolab, which make satellite components. The three
businesses have a combined workforce of about 9,000 employees, primarily in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition will not lead to substantial layoffs, said Jim Albaugh,
president of Boeing's space and communications unit. A small number of jobs may
be eliminated where operations overlap, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts found little to criticize in the deal, which meshes Hughes'
expertise in satellite hardware with Boeing's Delta and SeaLaunch rocket
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes is expected to use proceeds from the sale to expand DirecTV, the
satellite-to-home TV service, and develop Spaceway, a wireless broadband system
that will target the Internet and other communications systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Both ventures promise to make Hughes, already the leader in wireless TV
services, a key player in the rapidly meshing entertainment and communications
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   "Broadband communications, Internet access is really the wave of the future,
and Hughes is in a position to move into that really quickly," said Marco
Caceres, an analyst with Teal Group in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is a trend in the whole satellite market. Companies that
traditionally have built hardware are getting into satellite services, because
that's where the real money is being made," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes was founded as Hughes Aircraft in 1932 by Howard Hughes. During World
War II, the company built the Spruce Goose, a wooden transport military plant
that never flew except for a brief test run over Long Beach harbor.
</P>
<P>
	   After the war, Hughes branched out into defense electronics. The company
began to move into commercial ventures, such as DirecTV, after the Cold War
ended.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes executives said in the past they wanted to keep their commercial
satellite operations as a complement to DirecTV, which has with more than 8
million subscribers. That was before Hughes ran through more than $5 billion
promoting DirecTV, buying up its competitors and developing Spaceway.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes expects to carry over $2 billion in debt from 1999, and will use
proceeds from the sale to pay some of it off, said Roxanne Austin, Hughes' chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, Hughes executives decided the potential of those ventures
outweighed the advantages of hanging onto satellite manufacturing, an industry
that has been chilled by launch failures and allegations of unauthorized
technology transfers by U.S. companies to China.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they wanted to grow that investment intensive part of their business,
they had to get some cash. I think they came to a conclusion that the satellite
manufacturing business was expendable," Nisbet said.

   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spanish police arrested 24 rowers from England's Oxford
University on Thursday following a disturbance at a restaurant where they ate
the night before.
</P>
<P>
	   The rowers -- 23 men between the ages of 19 and 27 and a 24-year-old woman
-- were arrested shortly after midnight in the town of Amposta in northeastern
Spain, police said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The group became rowdy and caused about $625 worth of damage at a pizzeria
where they were having a dinner party, police said. Out on the street, the
rowers allegedly continued to cause disturbances and damage to cars and shops.
</P>
<P>
	   After spending the night in jail and appearing before a judge Thursday they
were all released without charge. But they will have to pay for the damage at
the restaurant plus a fine, Spanish news agencies said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Koch No Stranger to Court Battles  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVE BRISENDINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The pollution penalties handed down Thursday by the
Environmental Protection Agency against Koch Industries are just the latest in a
series of problems for the Wichita, Kan.-based company.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's doings, involving one of America's richest families, read like
scripts from such departed nighttime dramas as "Dallas" or "Dynasty". The list
includes everything from intrafamily squabbles to political intrigue to long,
multimillion-dollar court battles.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past three years alone:
</P>
<P>
	   --Bill Koch, one of the four sons of founder Fred Koch, sued the two
brothers who run Koch Industries -- one of them his own twin. His suit claimed
they cheated him and other dissident stockholders out of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   --A jury found that Koch underreported the amount and quality of oil it
purchased between 1985 and 1989 from federal and Indian leases and should
compensate the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch has won its share of the fights, including the biggest, an assault
mounted by Bill Koch that widened the split in the already-divided family.
</P>
<P>
	   Last June, after listening to 10 weeks of testimony, a federal jury decided
that Charles Koch, the chairman and chief executive officer of Koch Industries,
did not cheat dissident stockholders when those stockholders sold their
interests in 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   The former stockholders, led by Bill Koch, had sought $339 million in
damages. With interest and punitive damages, the figure could have exceeded $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Koch -- the twin brother of Koch executive vice president David Koch --
didn't give up, though. He continued to pursue a whistleblower lawsuit that led
to another federal jury's verdict against Koch Industries later in the year.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, a jury in Tulsa, Okla., found that Koch had underreported its
oil purchases in almost 25,000 instances.
</P>
<P>
	   No damage has yet been assessed, but the judge could fine the company a
maximum of $214 million in penalties on the 24,587 claims the jury found to be
false. The jury recommended the company pay $553,504 to compensate the
government, but that figure could exceed $1.4 million under federal statutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Comments from both sides after that verdict pointed up just how deep the
family division runs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think my father would be incredibly shocked to see this company was built
on theft after he died," Bill Koch said at the time. "I think that it would have
destroyed him."
</P>
<P>
	   But Koch officials called the lawsuit "another unfortunate manifestation of
Billy's obsessive 19-year campaign against the company and his brothers."
</P>
<P>
	   That defeat was followed by another court victory for Koch, however. In late
December, a judge ruled that Koch Industries did not breach its contract with
Pizza Hut by backing out of a $23 million deal to purchase the pizza company's
former world headquarters in Wichita.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch said the building had environmental problems and was in need of
extensive repair. A clause in the sale contract allowed Koch to get out of the
deal if it concluded such problems existed.

<HEADLINE> Issues Survey Pins Candidates Down  </HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN WOODWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A wide-ranging questionnaire probing where presidential
candidates stand on issues was released Thursday, although only five of the
major contenders took part.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Alan Keyes
and Sen. John McCain of Arizona completed the survey by Project Vote Smart, a
nonpartisan voter education group that asks questions of candidates and helps
the public research issues, voting records and statements.
</P>
<P>
	   The responses are available on the group's Web site and through a toll-free
phone number and free booklet.
</P>
<P>
	   Vote Smart officials expressed disappointment that the survey was not
answered by the other major declared candidates -- Democrats Al Gore and Bill
Bradley, Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party and Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a free self-governing society the most precious bit of knowledge a
citizen can possess is an awareness of their leaders' intentions,'' said Peggy
Lampl, national chairwoman. ``It's a shame some of the candidates seem to
believe that the axiom 'knowledge is power' doesn't apply.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the campaigns that did not fill out the survey said they found the
multiple-choice format confining. Vote Smart said it would have accepted short
summaries on the questions in the candidates' own words.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the candidates are already on record on many of the major issues
explored, the survey, known as the National Political Awareness Test, brought to
the surface some positions less frequently discussed in the campaign and put
everything together in 22 subject areas.
</P>
<P>
	   For example:
</P>
<P>
	   -- McCain supported restoring the eligibility of legal immigrants for some
of the aid they lost in welfare reforms. He also backed normal trade relations
with Vietnam, where he was held as a prisoner of war, and said federal
regulation of Internet content could raise troubling constitutional issues.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Bauer was among candidates saying they would encourage employers to offer
flexible scheduling, time off as compensation for overtime and unpaid leave for
family emergencies, and he said English should be the nation's official
language.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Forbes backed the position that aid should be eliminated for any nation
with documented human rights abuses, although he -- like other candidates --
would not withdraw full diplomatic relations with a country on that basis alone.
On campaign finance, he supported removing all contribution limits on federal
candidates and parties while requiring immediate disclosure on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Hatch was alone in saying the United States should not recognize and have
full diplomatic relations with Taiwan, although McCain did not answer that
question. Hatch also said the United States should keep troops in Kosovo without
a deadline, because ``the U.S. should not indicate to our enemies when it will
withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- Keyes would greatly increase spending on most military programs,
eliminate the earned income tax credit and get rid of income taxes in favor of a
national sales tax.
</P>

and stress the values they believe Republicans and many Hispanics share.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have to earn the trust of these people,'' party chairman Jim Nicholson
said. ``And you earn that by showing that you're sincere, that your value system
is lined up with theirs, and there's opportunity in our party for them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This party represents things that they feel they want in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a prototype TV spot shown to reporters, a Hispanic man surrounded by
relatives touts ``the freedoms, the opportunities and the responsibilities'' of
being an American.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When people ask me why I am a Republican, I tell them it is because my
family's values are the values of the Republican Party,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicholson said GOP positions on strengthening the military, patriotism and
school choice are natural fits with Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   The RNC plans to work with state parties and its presidential nominee to
develop ads tailored to specific regions of the country in support of GOP
candidates at all levels, said Frank Guerra, a Texas advertising consultant who
will produce the ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicholson declined to reveal the ad budget. But another top RNC official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said it would range from $7 million to $10
million.
</P>
<P>
	   States likely to be targeted include Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida,
Illinois, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, Texas and Utah.
</P>
<P>
	   The RNC also polled 1,000 Hispanics nationwide to gauge their views on
issues, and the survey results will be used in developing the ad campaign,
Guerra said. The party declined to release the full survey, but said its
findings bolstered its belief that it can win more Hispanic votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Hispanics are the fastest-growing population group, and they lean
Democratic. In the last two presidential elections, Hispanics voted
overwhelmingly for President Clinton -- 72 percent to 21 percent in 1996, and 61
percent to 25 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   But there was evidence Thursday that a shift to Republicans may be under
way.
</P>
<P>
	   A Public Policy Institute of California poll showed that GOP presidential
front-runner George W. Bush would draw at least 40 percent of the Hispanic vote
in November -- almost double what Republican nominee Bob Dole received in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Top Republican officials have said the GOP must capture at least 40 percent
of the Hispanic vote to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey showed Bush would draw 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in a
general election contest against Vice President Al Gore, and 45 percent against
Democrat Bill Bradley. Either Democrat would beat Bush, however, with each
pulling more than 50 percent of the Hispanic vote, the poll showed.

<HEADLINE> Perez Still Excited Over Hall  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK LONG AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Two days after his election into the Hall of Fame, Tony Perez
asked his wife to pinch him.
</P>
<P>
	   He just wanted to make sure it was all real.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez, 57, was elected to the Hall of Fame on Tuesday, his ninth time on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   The first Cuban chosen by the Baseball Writers' Association of America,
Perez made his second acceptance speech in as many days Thursday as he returned
home to South Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm still excited,'' said Perez, a special assistant to Marlins general
manager Dave Dombrowski. ``I'm still, going and going and going, like the
rabbit. It feels great. I've been one of the luckiest players in baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been through championships, playoffs, World Series and we were
winners. I've got many rings. Now I'm going to have another one with the Hall of
Fame.''
</P>
<P>
	   Behind Perez as he spoke, six televisions replayed highlights of his career,
which spanned 23 seasons. He spent his first 13 years with the Cincinnati Reds
and won two World Series titles with Big Red Machine teammates Pete Rose, Joe
Morgan and Johnny Bench.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez also played for Montreal, Boston and Philadelphia. He hit 379 homers
and finished with 1,652 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
	   He thanked teammates -- stopping just short of naming them all -- his wife,
Pituka, and the fans during a speech that drew several ovations from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, Perez told former teammate Andre Dawson he would be waiting
for him in the Hall. Then, after Perez was asked to compare the current New York
Yankees with the Big Red Machine of the late 1970s, he turned to teammate George
Foster for help.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were the best,'' Foster said.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez, 71 votes shy last year when Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount
were chosen, got 77.2 percent and was elected with 10 votes to spare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everything before this was wonderful,'' Perez said. ``But now I can say,
`I'm done.' I don't think anything else in my baseball career can be done. I'm
going to be there forever in Cooperstown with the greatest, greatest, greatest
to ever play the game.''
</P>
<P>
	   Perez, who played from 1964-86, will be inducted into the Hall at
Cooperstown, N.Y., on July 23 along with Carlton Fisk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you talk about Tony Perez and you talk to anybody that's ever been
associated with him on or off the field, you talk about class, dignity, respect,
a leader and a winner,'' Dombrowski said. ``I don't think there's anybody in the
game that is a more respected individual than him.''

<HEADLINE> Gore presents N.J. farmer to rap Bradley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SLOAN, Iowa (AP) - Vice President Al Gore paid for a New Jersey farmer
to stand beside him in Iowa Thursday and give witness that Bill Bradley
neglected agriculture during 18 years in the Senate. "I doubt if, today, he
understands the difference between corn and soybeans," farmer Roy Etsch said.
<P>
	   Bradley, meanwhile, campaigned among New Hampshire business leaders and, in
a newspaper interview, offered new criticism on the old question of whether Gore
was guilty of race-baiting in his 1988 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The day's rat-a-tat fueled an increasingly noisy and negative contest for
the Democratic presidential nomination and its first two rounds of voting in
Iowa, on Jan. 24, and in New Hampshire, on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   His motorcade stirring a storm of dust, Gore ventured down dirt roads to a
farm house outside Sioux City to meet with 150 farmers and show off his know-how
on the complexities of hog packing and commodity pricing.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't have to have a Ph.D. in farm economy to understand this," Gore
said in an apparent swipe at Bradley, the Princeton basketball star and Oxford
scholar.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore left the more direct criticism to Etsch, helpfully spelling his name so
reporters in the back of the barn could be sure to get the man's indictment of
his former senator.
</P>
<P>
	   Etsch described Bradley as ignorant of agricultural policy and unresponsive
to the New Jersey farmers he represented for three Senate terms. "I would call
him up and everything else," Etsch said. "I heard nothing."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, whose campaign paid for Etsch to fly here from his Monroe Township
home, promised to "raise Cain until we fix this farm economy."
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Tom Harkin also stood beside Gore in the freezing-cold barn and
assailed Bradley's record on farm policy. The senator, especially popular among
Democrats in Iowa's farming communities, also stars in a new Gore TV ad meant to
underscore that Bradley voted against an amendment that included aid for farmers
hit by 1993 floods.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who trails Gore in Iowa polls by 20 points or more, has conceded he
started the presidential race knowing little about farm policy, but he says he's
learned plenty in 31 visits to Iowa this past year.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, Bradley said the
farmers' downturn came during the Clinton-Gore watch and he tossed a
long-distance question back at Gore: "Where were you? Where were you when this
was all happening?"
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, in a published discussion with The Boston Herald, Bradley said
Gore had introduced the issue of escaped murderer Willie Horton in the 1988
Democratic primary campaign against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
	   Horton, a black man who committed rape while on furlough, became a symbol of
racially divisive campaigning during the Dukakis-Bush general election race
later that year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Gore introduced him into the lexicon," Bradley said. "It bothers me a great
deal. ... I wouldn't have used Willie Horton."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore could have found other examples if he wanted to show that Dukakis was
soft on crime, Bradley said. "The racial dimension to that - there were probably
a lot of other people who fit into that category."
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign, which is bringing Dukakis to Iowa next week to campaign
for Gore, immediately put reporters in contact with the former Massachusetts
governor and marshaled a denunciation from House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's unfair to attack Gore in this way because it just isn't true," Dukakis
told the AP in a telephone interview from California.
</P>
<P>
	   When Gore questioned him about the prison furlough program during a 1988
debate, Gore did not name Willie Horton and "there certainly was no suggestion
on the racial side," Dukakis said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There weren't any pictures of Willie Horton as there was in the Bush attack
ads" that aired during the general election fight with then-Vice President
George Bush, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Susan Estrich, campaign manager for Dukakis in 1988, said it didn't matter
whether Gore used Horton's name because "he had become the symbol of the
furlough problem well in advance" of that April 1988 debate.
</P>
<P>
	   "In political terms, it's fair to say the Willie Horton issue was the
furlough issue and the furlough issue was the Willie Horton issue. And, it had
such racial overtones and was so divisive, frankly we were surprised when he
raised it in the debate," Estrich said Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement that Gore aides handed out as the vice president campaigned
later Thursday in Nashua, N.H., Gephardt said Bradley's statement "unfairly
smears" Gore.

<HEADLINE> Kochs No Strangers to Battles  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVE BRISENDINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The pollution penalties announced Thursday by the
Environmental Protection Agency against Koch Industries are the latest in a
series of problems for the Wichita, Kan.-based company and the Koch brothers who
run it.
</P>
<P>
	   The years of family feuds and drawn-out court battles involving one of
America's richest families read like scripts from such departed nighttime dramas
as ``Dallas'' and ``Dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the last three years alone:
</P>
<P>
	   --Bill Koch, 59, one of the four sons of founder Fred Koch and the twin
brother of executive vice president David Koch, sued the two brothers who run
Koch Industries, unsuccessfully claiming they cheated him and other stockholders
out of millions of dollars. Another brother, Charles Koch, 63, is the company's
chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   --In another suit pursued by Bill Koch, a jury found that Koch Industries
underreported the amount and quality of oil it purchased from federal and Indian
leases almost 25,000 times between 1985 and 1989 and should compensate the
government.
</P>
<P>
	   --Pizza Hut sued Koch after the company backed out of a $23 million deal to
buy Pizza Hut's former headquarters in Wichita, but Koch successfully argued the
building did not meet standards referred to in the sales contract.
</P>
<P>
	   --Congressional Democrats tried but failed to establish a clear link in 1997
between the Koch family and Triad Management Services, a controversial GOP
consulting firm that spent more than $1 million on Kansas political races in
1996. David Koch and Koch Industries are generous political givers and rank
among top donors nationally and in Kansas.

<HEADLINE> Singer Trevi Held in Sex Scandal  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL ASTOR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- One of Latin America's most famous performers
was arrested Thursday in an international sex scandal sparked by accusations
that the singer helped her agent seduce a teen-age girl.
</P>
<P>
	   Gloria Trevi, agent Sergio Andrade and another entertainer, Maria Raquenel
Portillo, were arrested in Rio de Janeiro under an extradition request presented
by the Mexican Embassy in Brazil, according to the Mexican federal Attorney
General's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Brazilian police said the three were picked up Thursday morning in their
rented apartment in Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach district.
</P>
<P>
	   They are accused of corrupting 17-year-old Karina Yapor, who was supposedly
training to be an entertainer with Andrade. Yapor, who was under Andrade's care
since the age of 12, abandoned a child in Spain in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The three were questioned by police for five hours and denied the charges,
said police spokeswoman Luciene Silva. They will be held in custody while the
Brazilian government studies an extradition request by Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   There is no extradition treaty between the Brazil and Mexico, and similar
requests in the past have taken months.
</P>
<P>
	   Yapor's family accused Trevi and others of helping lure Yapor and other
girls into Andrade's care and helping him seduce them.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrade has not been seen publicly for several years, and Trevi -- whose
full name is Gloria de los Angeles Trevino Ruiz -- dropped out of sight about a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Silva said the three entered Brazil through Sao Paulo in December 1998, and
all had 90-day tourist visas issued under their real names.
</P>
<P>
	   The three renewed their visas for an additional 90 days but remained in
Brazil after the visas expired, she said. Using different names, they allegedly
moved among various coastal cities, never staying in one place for more than
three months.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting on an Interpol request, Brazilian police tracked the three down late
last year. Brazil's Supreme Court issued an arrest warrant Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Trevi had a string of hits in Mexico and
across Latin America and a sexually flamboyant, politically rebellious image
that enchanted teens and fascinated Mexican intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
	   State prosecutors in the northern border state of Chihuahua have filed
charges of kidnapping and rape against Trevi, Andrade, and other associates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mexican Attorney General's Office said the arrest warrant was based on
charges filed against the three in Chihuahua, where Yapor's family lives.
Interpol investigations showed the group also had traveled to Argentina and
Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
	   Yapor, now 17, appeared unexpectedly in Mexico City last month, defending
Andrade against claims he had mistreated her or was the father of her child.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela-Bound US Ship Coming Home  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon on Thursday ordered home a U.S. troop ship
en route to Venezuela to help with flood recovery after Venezuela's president
said he did not want American soldiers in his country.
</P>
<P>
	   A second shipload of U.S. soldiers and equipment already held back at a
North Carolina port while Washington sought to clarify President Hugo Chavez's
comments will not deploy, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez's government requested the aid in late December, and the USS Tortuga
had left for Venezuela with bulldozers, tractors and engineering equipment. But
on Wednesday, Chavez said he would accept U.S. equipment -- without the troops
the Pentagon said were needed to handle the machinery.
</P>
<P>
	   The ship had been slowing down while the USS Nashville had not left Moorhead
City, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, we were surprised by the reported comments,'' said Bacon, indicating
that U.S. officials had not heard directly from Chavez's government on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez told reporters Wednesday that while Venezuela still needs more money,
equipment and other materials, additional relief workers are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to clarify before Venezuela and the world that North American
troops are not going to come to Venezuela,'' Chavez said. ``If they want to send
machines or other types of equipment we are open to that, and we are very
thankful for the intention to help.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bacon said U.S. equipment cannot be supplied without people to run it,
maintain it and bring it back home after the work is done.
</P>
<P>
	   The 450 U.S. Marine and Navy engineers set to deploy were going to help
rebuild a coastal road damaged by Dec. 15 flooding that killed thousands of
Venezuelans. They were expected to work in Venezuela for two months or more.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly, if they don't want the help, we won't provide it,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the State Department, spokesman James P. Rubin cited a Dec. 24 letter in
which Venezuela's defense minister ``specifically requested the assistance of
U.S. military engineers to open up a humanitarian corridor for flood-ravaged
coastal communities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said the deployment was authorized after close coordination with
Venezuelan authorities and as part of a $25 million U.S. aid package.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez's government earlier welcomed U.S. help, including about 120 soldiers
operating water purification facilities, Blackhawk helicopters, C-130 cargo
planes and a C-5 Galaxy cargo plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Bacon said the United States would continue to support relief efforts with
four helicopters and water purification units.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez, a former army paratrooper elected a year ago, has been accused by
opponents of using the floods and killer mudslides to consolidate his power,
eliminating Congress, replacing the Supreme Court and hand-picking top judicial
officials. Chavez's backers say he is merely taking steps mandated in his
election victory to crush a corrupt oligarchy and help the nation's poor.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez has bolstered relations with communist Cuba and has been critical of
U.S. global influence. He earlier refused to allow U.S. planes to fly over
Venezuela in anti-narcotics operations.

<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Convinced that this year's rush to earlier
presidential primaries is unhealthy, national Republicans laid out options
Thursday for averting such ``front-loading'' in 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary report released by a Republican National Committee panel
studying the issue listed several alternatives to the current system, but issued
no recommendations.
</P>
<P>
	   As it stands now, the Democratic Party allows only Iowa and New Hampshire to
hold caucuses or primaries before March 7. The RNC does not set such limits.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the options in the report are:
</P>
<P>
	   --Rotating regional system: States would be grouped by region, with each
group taking turns holding primaries first. Iowa and New Hampshire would retain
their earliest-in-the-nation status.
</P>
<P>
	   --Population-based system: States would be split into five groups based on
size. The 10 smallest states would hold their primaries first, and the 10
biggest last.
</P>

	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Two New Hampshire newspapers have endorsed Texas
Gov. George W. Bush in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.

	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- E.W. Scripps Co. television stations will give airtime to
selected political candidates this year, the company announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Scripps' nine network-affiliated TV stations will provide five minutes of
free airtime to candidates nightly between 5 p.m. and 11:35 p.m. in the 30 days
preceding both primary and general elections, the Cincinnati-based company said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each station will decide which candidates and races to give the airtime,
which may be used for debates, interviews or issue statements during local
newscasts.
</P>
<P>
	   Scripps is responding to a recommendation by the President's Advisory
Committee on the Public Interest Obligations of Digital Television Broadcasters,
said Jim Hart, the company's senior vice president of broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe our stations play an important role in encouraging public
discourse, providing a framework for open discussion and affording citizens the
best opportunity to make informed choices,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
	   Participating will be Scripps' three NBC affiliates -- WPTV, West Palm
Beach, Fla.; KSHB, Kansas City, Mo.; and KJRH, Tulsa, Okla.; -- and its six ABC
affiliates, WXYZ, Detroit; WCPO, Cincinnati; WEWS, Cleveland; WFTS, Tampa, Fla.;

	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Reform Party presidential candidate Pat Buchanan toured an
efficient but money-losing steel mill Thursday and warned that cheap imports
were ruining the U.S. steel industry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was awesome,'' Buchanan said after a 45-minute tour of LTV Steel
Cleveland Works, where 4,300 workers make flat-rolled sheets of steel for use in
cars, appliances and electrical equipment. ``It was enormously impressive.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said new equipment installed at the plant in the past 15 years had made
it one of the most efficient in the world. He asked why the parent company, LTV
Corp., had not reported a profit since 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a very simple question and a simple answer. It's because of
imports,'' Buchanan said. ``This is happening even though we've got the most
efficient steel industry in the world.''

	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The Iowa Democratic Party announced plans Thursday
to post minute-by-minute results from Iowa's first-in-the-nation presidential
caucuses on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   The party is teaming up with Voter.com., a Web site that provides
information on parties, issues, races, candidates, events and results, in the
first test of strength between Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The site at www.voter.com/iowa will continuously update results in all 99
counties and 2,131 precincts, Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Rob Tully said.
</P>
<P>
	   On caucus night, Jan. 24, as results from each precinct are telephoned into
the Democrats' tabulation center in Des Moines, they will be posted on the
Internet, said Voter.com spokesman Douglas Herman.
</P>
<P>
	   The party also will use safeguards to ensure an accurate and fraud-free
count.
</P>
<P>
	   Caucus result forms also will be mailed separately to the state Democratic
Party, with an audit of the final results at a later date.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Says Budget Surpluses Growing  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an early estimate of how the budget picture is
continuing to improve, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee produced
numbers Thursday showing that federal surplus projections are looking as good as
ever.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said
his staff believes the fiscal 2000 surplus will be $10 billion to $20 billion.
Fiscal 2000 runs through Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2001 surplus should reach $10 billion to $40 billion, he wrote. Both
sets of figures exclude Social Security money, which Republicans have pledged
not to touch.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the numbers are roughly what was projected last summer, the new
figures take into account billions in extra spending and tax cuts Congress and
President Clinton enacted last fall. When that additional spending was approved,
some Democrats suggested that it might prevent Republicans from meeting their
pledge of protecting Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At this time it seems certain that Republicans made good on our commitment
to protect the Social Security surplus,'' Domenici wrote in a letter to Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   Domenici said his staff used ``essentially the same numbers as the
Congressional Budget Office,'' which will issue Congress' official budget
projections in two weeks. He said his figures are ``likely to be confirmed'' by
CBO.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, for the decade ending 2010, Domenici estimates the non-Social
Security surplus will total $2 trillion, about double what was projected last
year, said budget committee aides.
</P>
<P>
	   That figure, however, assumes that limits legally imposed on about one-third
of the $1.7 trillion budget will be obeyed. Those limits have been ignored the
last two years and are certain to be breached again by tens of billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides consider the non-Social Security portion of the budget fair game
for use for tax cuts or higher spending.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House plans to update its own surplus projections on Feb. 7, when
Clinton introduces his fiscal 2001 budget.

<HEADLINE> Miniature Skateboards Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A teddy bear company and a toy retailer are recalling
about 15,500 miniature-skateboard key chains because their wheels may come off,
posing a choking risk to young children.
</P>
<P>
	   The key chains came attached to Z.Z. Jamboarder teddy bears, which were
produced by the Vermont Teddy Bear Co. of Shelburne, Vt. The toy bears were sold
nationwide by Zany Brainy of King of Prussia, Pa., through their stores, catalog
and Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies have had two reports of wheels coming off, but no reports of
injuries, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Z.Z. Jamboarder teddy bear is light brown, about 15 inches long and
wears a white shirt, jeans, a purple hat and sunglasses. A sewn-in tag under the
bear's left arm reads ``Z.Z. Jamboarder'' on one side and ``Limited Edition
1999'' on the other.
</P>
<P>
	   The skateboard key chain is about 4 inches long with red wheels and is
attached to a loop on the right side of the bear's jeans. It bears an emblem of
a bear head in a red circle.
</P>
<P>
	   Zany Brainy sold the bears with key chains last year between November and
December for $10 to $13 with the purchase of $50 of other merchandise.
</P>
<P>
	   The safety commission advises consumers to take the skateboard key chains
away from young children immediately and return them to any Zany Brainy store to
receive a bean-filled animal toy. The bear and key chain can also be returned
for a refund.
</P>
<P>
	   For more information, consumers can call the Vermont Teddy Bear Co. toll
free at 1-877-293-2327 between 8:30 a.m. and 10 p.m. EST Monday through Friday.

<HEADLINE> US Prisoner in Peru Needs Evidence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- An American woman serving a life sentence for treason in
Peru will not receive a new trial unless she can show proof that her conviction
was unfair, the South American country's prime minister said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lori Berenson, a New York native and former Massachusetts Institute of
Technology student, was convicted by a secret military court in 1996 for helping
rebels with the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement plan a thwarted
attack on Peru's Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Alberto Bustamante, who is also Peru's justice minister, said
Thursday that ``the possibility of a new trial for Ms. Berenson depends on
whether new evidence is presented that shows that her initial trial was unjust,
arbitrary or was not based on the facts of the case.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bustamante also said a pardon for Berenson was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
	   Berenson, who maintains her innocence, has said she was not allowed to
present evidence at her trial or to question prosecution witnesses and that the
judge wore a hood.
</P>
<P>
	   Bustamante did not elaborate as to what kind of evidence she would need to
present to receive a new trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. State Department has asked Peru to give her an open civilian trial,
arguing that her summary military trial denied her due process.
</P>
<P>
	   The government maintains that secret military proceedings with hooded judges
were necessary during Peru's bloody battle with leftist rebels because civilian
courts were releasing too many suspects and judges feared reprisals. The
practice was abolished in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Peru's internal war against leftist rebels reduced dramatically in intensity
after the capture of top rebel leaders in 1992, but thousands of convicted
rebels remain in Peru's prisons.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Investment Incentives  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- With a booming stock market and robust economy, President
Clinton said Thursday that Americans ``have a moral obligation'' to bring
prosperity to the nation's neediest urban and rural areas. On the Republican
side, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said it was important that ``no community be
left behind.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, at an evening reception on the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange, said, ``The big question before us is, what are we going to do with
this magic moment?
</P>
<P>
	   ``Are we going to take the long look into the future and do the big things
that America needs,'' he asked. ``Or are we going to indulge ourselves in
short-sighted frittering away of our present wealth and serenity at home and
stability around the world?''
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks before his State of the Union address, Clinton opened an
election-year drive to win congressional approval of $5 billion worth of tax
incentives over 10 years to encourage investment in depressed areas under a
program he calls ``New Markets.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Economic opportunity should not be the political province of any
particular party,'' Clinton said. ``Economic opportunity should be the
birthright of every American.''
</P>
<P>
	   After a night in his new, $1.7 million home in Chappaqua, the president
followed the path of countless commuters into New York. In Clinton's case,
police cleared the highways for his 14-car motorcade and toll booth operators
waved him by without charge. Long lines of motorists wound up stalled behind
police barricades.
</P>
<P>
	   The president spoke at Boricua College, a largely Hispanic school in an
ethnic neighborhood in Brooklyn. A custodian was shot to death at the college
Monday, and Clinton and other members of the audience observed a moment of
silence.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, the president went to midtown Manhattan for an economic development
program led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jackson's Wall Street Project is intended
to persuade New York's financial leaders to invest capital in minority
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton won accolades from Citigroup's chairman, Sanford Weill, for the
stock market's performance. ``I want to thank you for my net worth,'' Weill
declared, saying Citigroup's stock had climbed from $5 a share when Clinton took
office to $55 now.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, deeply in debt with legal bills, replied, ``I'm glad one of us made
money out of this administration.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president also spoke at the New York Stock Exchange at a reception for
the Wall Street Project. He also attended a $250,000 fund-raising event on the
Upper East Side for the Democratic National Committee. Clinton was to return to
Chappaqua for the night before heading to Washington on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Programs for economic revival of urban and rural areas are drawing rare
bipartisan agreement between Clinton and House Republicans. Hastert, in a
statement from his office, said, ``I look forward to working with the president
on creating a bipartisan package that will address the needs of these
communities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Removing tax and regulatory barriers that prevent private sector
investment in these areas is a hallmark of compassionate conservatism,'' Hastert
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his initiatives were aimed at giving American companies the
same incentives to invest in U.S. communities as they have for investing in
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we can't do this now, we will never do this,'' the president said. ``We
will never get around to doing this if we don't do it now. So, point number one,
we have a moral obligation to use our prosperity at this moment, especially, to
lift up the areas'' that have been left behind.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he would resubmit his New Markets initiative to Congress,
seeking more than twice the funding he requested last year. He said the tax
credits would leverage $15 billion in investments.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said he also would propose expanding the New Markets agenda
with programs geared toward helping small and first-time entrepreneurs and
private investment companies, modeled after the Overseas Private Investment
Corp. that offers loan guarantees and risk insurance for foreign ventures.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Shares Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Stocks in Tokyo rose early Friday after a robust earnings
report from Intel after U.S. markets had closed helped support tech stocks. The
dollar rose against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 150.14 points, or 0.80
percent, to 18,983.43 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the
average closed up 155.87 points, or 0.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. dollar was trading at 106.28 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange
market, up from 105.66 yen late Thursday and above its late New York level of
106.13.
</P>
<P>
	   In stock trading, U.S. computer chip maker Intel said fourth quarter
earnings rose 17 percent from the same period last year to $2.4 billion, easily
beating Wall Street analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   That helped send Sony and other Japanese technology stocks higher in morning
Tokyo trading.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it will be a fairly positive day," said Robert Sasaki, head of
quantitative strategy group at Jardine Fleming Securities. "I think Intel will
kick up more focus on high-tech issues, or the so-called 'new Japan' stocks."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 31.33 points to a
record 11,582.43 after a report of relatively modest inflation calmed jittery
stock investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index broke out of a two-day slump to
finish up 107.19 at 3957.21.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section rose 17.99 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,675.96. On Thursday, the TOPIX
rose 1.05 points, or 0.06 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, the dollar rose after U.S. sales and price data showed
that the U.S. economy is growing at a steady pace with no danger of a sharp rise
in inflation, traders said. That eased concerns -- at least for now -- that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to slow the economy at its meeting
next month.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 108.90 yen, up from 108.84 yen
late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was unquoted Friday morning.
On Thursday, the bond's yield rose to 1.8000 percent from 1.7950 on Wednesday.
Its price fell 0.04 point to 100.84.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Case Seen Helping Relatios  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA, Cuba (AP) -- The custody flap over 6-year-old Elian Gonzales could
ultimately strengthen U.S.-Cuba relations if American officials stand firm and
do not succumb to political pressure, a former American diplomat to Havana said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The federal government is doing the right thing by standing by the INS
decision,'' said Wayne Smith, referring to the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not so sure that would have been the case several years ago,'' said
Smith, who was chief of the U.S. Interests Section for three years under
Presidents Reagan and Carter.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno earlier Thursday urged those involved in the
dispute over the Cuban boy to resolve the situation quickly so the child ``can
get on with his life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reno has backed the INS determination that the boy be returned to his father
in Cuba, and has said that Florida state courts have no say in the federal
matter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that over the long term this case will actually help relations
between Washington and Havana,'' said Smith, because American officials have not
been swayed by Cuban exiles in Miami who want the child to remain in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle over Elian, Smith said, is not between two governments but
between two ideological camps on differing sides of the Florida Straits: in
Miami and Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida coast on
Thanksgiving Day. His mother and 10 others died in an attempt to emigrate to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has demanded that the child be
returned to him in Cuba. But Elian's Miami relatives say they can give him a
better life off the communist island and are fighting to keep him in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban American National Foundation, a powerful Miami-based exile group,
in 1996 won a libel suit against Smith after he accused the organization of
using taxpayer money for political campaigns. The verdict was reversed on appeal
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, in Havana with a Johns Hopkins University study group, said Cuban
exiles may be hurt most by the battle as more Americans side with the U.S.
government's decision to send the boy home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We could see a further loss of the exiles' political power,'' he said.
``The exiles already are in this alone as polls in the United States indicate a
great majority of Americans think he should be back with his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, a delegation of American agricultural firms wrapped up a
four-day visit to Cuba, calling for a lifting of U.S. restrictions on food and
medicine sales here.
</P>
<P>
	   Among delegation members was former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture John
Block, who served under Reagan and is now president of the Food Distributors
International, an association of food wholesalers interested in working with
small private family cooperatives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In years past as secretary of agriculture, I negotiated trade agreements
with the Soviet Union when it was with the Evil Empire,'' Block told reporters
during a tour of farms. ``Now we cannot even trade with a country 90 miles from
our shores.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Likely To Get Cuban Boy Case  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno implored those battling for
custody of Elian Gonzalez to return the 6-year-old boy to his Cuban father, but
the protracted dispute appeared headed for federal court first.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The issue is a father who wants his son home and grandparents who want
their grandson home and these are bonds that should be honored,'' Reno told her
weekly news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian Gonzalez's father, who wants the boy back, told ABC News that he
doesn't want to go to Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I went there, would they give him to me? No. Miami Cubans would just
entangle me in their political games,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said, speaking in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
	   An attorney for Elian's Florida relatives, who are caring for him now, said
they would go to federal court next week to challenge the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's ruling that he must be returned to his father in Cuba
</P>
<P>
	   The INS, meanwhile, rejected a second asylum petition filed this week on
behalf of Elian by his Florida relatives. Justice Department spokeswoman Carole
Florman said that only the boy's father could represent his son before the
agency. Ms. Florman said the new petition contained ``no new information.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic off Florida on
Thanksgiving. His mother and others fleeing Cuba with him had drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno voiced concern about the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My hope is that people will look at this little boy and get him into a
situation where he can live a normal life without television cameras and the
world in his face,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do you remember when you were 6? There were some days I wanted to run away
from home and there were other days when I wanted my mommy so bad I couldn't
stand it. ... I certainly think the experience of most people is that a
6-year-old is too young to speak for himself.''
</P>
<P>
	   To allow time for a federal court challenge, Reno said Wednesday the INS
indefinitely would extend its Friday deadline for turning the boy over. She
brushed aside a state court ruling delaying the boy's return and said any
challenge to the INS would have to come in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   She explained Thursday that the boy's status is an immigration matter,
solely in the jurisdiction of federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that the people involved in this situation care about the little
boy and want to do what's right by him and I think they have also indicated a
faith in the legal process. Let's let that happen,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno refused to spell out precisely the department's options.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice officials, requesting anonymity, said they could go to federal court
on their own for a ruling that the state court order does not overrule the INS
decision or for an enforcement order to carry out the INS decision. But they
said they wanted to choose the least provocative course, and, though they would
not say so directly, that course appeared to be waiting to respond to any
federal court action filed by the Florida relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer Eig, attorney for the boy's Florida relatives, said they would ask a
federal court for relief next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government should have respected the temporary protective order of the
Florida family court, as it was based on preventing imminent and irreparable
harm to the child,'' Eig said. ``Now we will take the case to a court they
cannot ignore.''

<HEADLINE> President pushing tax incentives for neediest communities  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - With a booming stock market and robust economy,
President Clinton said Thursday that Americans "have a moral obligation" to
bring prosperity to the nation's neediest urban and rural areas. On the
Republican side, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said it was important that "no
community be left behind."
<P>
	   Clinton, at an evening reception on the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange, said, "The big question before us is, what are we going to do with
this magic moment?
</P>
<P>
	   "Are we going to take the long look into the future and do the big things
that America needs," he asked. "Or are we going to indulge ourselves in
short-sighted frittering away of our present wealth and serenity at home and
stability around the world?"
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks before his State of the Union address, Clinton opened an
election-year drive to win congressional approval of $5 billion worth of tax
incentives over 10 years to encourage investment in depressed areas under a
program he calls "New Markets."
</P>
<P>
	   "Economic opportunity should not be the political province of any particular
party," Clinton said. "Economic opportunity should be the birthright of every
American."
</P>
<P>
	   After a night in his new, $1.7 million home in Chappaqua, the president
followed the path of countless commuters into New York. In Clinton's case,
police cleared the highways for his 14-car motorcade and toll booth operators
waved him by without charge. Long lines of motorists wound up stalled behind
police barricades.
</P>
<P>
	   The president spoke at Boricua College, a largely Hispanic school in an
ethnic neighborhood in Brooklyn. A custodian was shot to death at the college
Monday, and Clinton and other members of the audience observed a moment of
silence.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, the president went to midtown Manhattan for an economic development
program led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jackson's Wall Street Project is intended
to persuade New York's financial leaders to invest capital in minority
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton won accolades from Citigroup's chairman, Sanford Weill, for the
stock market's performance. "I want to thank you for my net worth," Weill
declared, saying Citigroup's stock had climbed from $5 a share when Clinton took
office to $55 now.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, deeply in debt with legal bills, replied, "I'm glad one of us made
money out of this administration."
</P>
<P>
	   The president also spoke at the New York Stock Exchange at a reception for
the Wall Street Project. He also attended a $250,000 fund-raising event on the
Upper East Side for the Democratic National Committee. Clinton was to return to
Chappaqua for the night before heading to Washington on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Programs for economic revival of urban and rural areas are drawing rare
bipartisan agreement between Clinton and House Republicans. Hastert, in a
statement from his office, said, "I look forward to working with the president
on creating a bipartisan package that will address the needs of these
communities.
</P>
<P>
	   "Removing tax and regulatory barriers that prevent private sector investment
in these areas is a hallmark of compassionate conservatism," Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his initiatives were aimed at giving American companies the
same incentives to invest in U.S. communities as they have for investing in
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we can't do this now, we will never do this," the president said. "We
will never get around to doing this if we don't do it now. So, point number one,
we have a moral obligation to use our prosperity at this moment, especially, to
lift up the areas" that have been left behind.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he would resubmit his New Markets initiative to Congress,
seeking more than twice the funding he requested last year. He said the tax
credits would leverage $15 billion in investments.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said he also would propose expanding the New Markets agenda
with programs geared toward helping small and first-time entrepreneurs and
private investment companies, modeled after the Overseas Private Investment
Corp. that offers loan guarantees and risk insurance for foreign ventures.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Score High on Education  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and Republicans George W. Bush and
John McCain scored the highest marks on educational issues in a report card on
the presidential candidates released Thursday by the National Urban League.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Democrats, Gore scored 13 of a possible 15 points in the ranking that
stacked the candidates' educational positions against those of the national
civil rights organization, such as opposition to school vouchers and raising
teacher quality.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, scored 9 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Republican candidates, Bush and McCain, the Arizona senator, were tied
with 7 points each. Steve Forbes followed with 2 points. Both Alan Keyes and
Gary Bauer received zeros. The report did not include Republican Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah and Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
	   Candidates were judged on five principles: commitment to quality early
education, opposition to vouchers, providing quality teachers, access to
telecommunications technology and continuing social promotion until higher
quality schools are achieved.
</P>
<P>
	   In each category, scores ranged from zero, for opposition or no position on
an issue, to three points, indicating strong support for an issue.
</P>
<P>
	   While saying the ratings should not be viewed as an endorsement of any
specific candidate, Urban League President Hugh B. Price said he hoped the study
would help guide voters who support the league.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any presidential candidate who aspires to lead this country should commit
to eradicate achievement disparities, eliminate discriminatory educational
practices and ensure that all children have a genuine opportunity to learn and
achieve,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Gore's commitment to improving schools was ``palpable and
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president has made education the
top priority of his presidential campaign and relished the high marks.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Bradley's vision for education was promising, but expressed
concern about his ``inconsistent'' stance on school vouchers. As a senator,
Bradley voted for experimental voucher programs, but on the campaign trail has
said he doesn't believe vouchers are the answer to the problems with public
education.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke dismissed the criticism, noting that
Education Secretary Richard Riley recently said ``there is no real difference
between Bill Bradley and Al Gore in terms of their commitment to education.''
</P>
<P>
	   Of Bush, the report praised the Texas governor's record of increasing
education funding and improved standardized test scores among minority school
children in his state. But it chided Bush for trying fund an experimental
voucher program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Appraising Mr. Bush's track record as governor is complicated,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan defended Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every child should receive a first rate education and if a disadvantaged
student continues to be trapped in a failing school, Governor Bush thinks
parents should have the option to send their child to a different school,''
McClellan said.

<HEADLINE> Two Haitian Children To Be Returned  </HEADLINE>
   By KARIN MEADOWS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Two Haitian children separated from their mother after a boat
packed with would-be migrants ran aground off the Florida coast will be reunited
with her in the United States, authorities determined Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Rep. Carrie Meek said Yvena Rhinvil's children -- 10-year-old Marc
Yvens Dieubon and 8-year-old Germanie Dieubon -- will travel to Miami in a few
days, as soon as they are issued passports by the Haitian government. They
currently are living with an aunt.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service granted the children
humanitarian parole on Thursday, INS officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This decision ends a frightening episode and addresses a major wrong that
was done to this mother and her young children,'' Meek, D-Miami, said Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Rhinvil, 33, and her children were separated after a smuggling boat from
Haiti carrying 411 passengers ran aground about two miles off the Florida coast
New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Rhinvil, who is pregnant, was one of four refugees brought ashore for
medical treatment. Her children were left on the boat and were among the 407
people returned to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
	   INS officials said Thursday Coast Guard officials didn't know Rhinvil had
children on board before they took her from the boat. If they had known, they
wouldn't have been separated the children from their mother, the INS said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The mother, who was released from an INS detention center outside Miami on
Wednesday to a sister who lives nearby, is applying for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement to U.S. immigration officials, she said she fled Haiti
because of the country's political situation.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates for equal treatment of Haitians attempting to reach the United
States heralded the INS decision.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday night, about 3,000 people attended a candlelight march in Miami
to protest the U.S. policy of sending illigal immigrants from Haiti back.
</P>
<P>
	   Haitian and African-American activists have said they are troubled by the
contrast between the huge outcry to keep 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez from being
returned to Cuba, while Haitian children are routinely sent back to their
country.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thanksgiving Day, Elian was rescued from an inner tube off the coast of
Florida after a boat sank in an attempt to reach the United States. His mother,
stepfather and nine others died.
</P>
<P>
	   Under U.S. policy, Haitians and others who arrive illegally are sent back.
The Cuban Readjustment Act of 1966 grants any Cuban who reaches American soil
the right to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   Activists say Haitians are routinely repatriated without being offered a
chance to request a hearing to determine if they have a ``credible fear'' of
persecution in their homeland.

<HEADLINE> DeLorean Ordered Off Estate by Mar.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A bankruptcy judge has awarded John DeLorean's estate
to a golf course developer and ordered the erstwhile automaker off the property
by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Garrett Brown on Wednesday approved the sale of
DeLorean's 434-acre Bedminster, N.J., property to National Fairways Inc. for
$15.25 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale ended DeLorean's five-year battle to keep his property despite
financial and legal ruin. The proceeds from the sale are earmarked for
DeLorean's creditors, but the price falls about $15 million short of paying off
DeLorean's total outstanding debt.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLorean, 75, declined to comment on the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   His largest creditor, Merrill Lynch Credit Corp., won title to the Georgian
mansion and the rest of the estate in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLorean had vowed to pull himself out of his financial troubles when he
filed his bankruptcy petition in September. He announced that he himself would
develop a golf resort and equestrian center on his property, which he estimated
to be worth $27 million.
</P>
<P>
	   He had even intended to build a new line of gull-winged sports cars powered
by ceramic engines, like the 8,500 stainless steel DeLorean Motor Co. cars built
in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   That company, based in Northern Ireland, collapsed 18 years ago amid charges
of money laundering.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Diamond Trade Targeted  </HEADLINE>
   By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Britain on Thursday pledged to help Sierra
Leone stamp out illegal diamond trading, which has led to international calls
for a boycott of gems from the war-battered West African nation.
</P>
<P>
	   British Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain, on a visit to the capital of
Freetown, stopped short of supporting an all-out embargo of the country's
diamonds but said action must be taken to keep diamond profits from funding
warfare.
</P>
<P>
	   Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front has fought to control the
diamond-producing areas in the country's densely forested east, and the group
allegedly profits from the sale of the diamonds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Diamonds must be used to help rebuild Sierra Leone's schools and
hospitals, not destroy them,'' Hain told reporters on the second day of a visit
in which he met with President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and toured military and
refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
	   An international policy research organization, Partnership Africa-Canada,
issued a report Wednesday accusing international diamond mining companies,
dealers and sellers of helping the RUF rebels wage a brutal eight-year civil
war.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ottawa-based group's report called for a boycott of all diamonds from
Sierra Leone and its neighbors Liberia and Ivory Coast, saying gems often are
smuggled to the two countries from where they are dealt indirectly to
international diamond firms.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, U.S. Reps. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, and Frank Wolf, R-Va., urged the
United Nations to back up Sierra Leone peacekeeping efforts with an
international embargo on black-market diamonds. They said rebels financed by gem
sales were continuing to attack civilians, including children.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of innocent civilians were killed and many others were mutilated
in the rebels' terror campaign against Sierra Leone's government. Although the
warring sides signed a peace deal in July, the United Nations and human rights
groups report that rebel atrocities continue.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Use Money for Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- Sharpening their disagreement over tax cuts, George
W. Bush suggested Thursday that John McCain's proposal would leave too much
money for Congress to spend on ``bigger government,'' and McCain countered that
the Republican presidential front-runner's plan would lead to higher payroll
taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I must confess I am skeptical of appropriators,'' Bush said, referring to
members of the House and Senate committees that write multibillion-dollar
spending bills annually.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Somehow I have trouble believing that they're going to necessarily spend
it on debt reduction,'' the Texas governor said of the surplus funds that would
be left after McCain's tax cut took effect. ``I worry they may spend it on
bigger government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's tax cut, $483 billion over five years, would leave the Social
Security surplus alone, but spend from non-Social Security surplus funds.
McCain, in a written statement, said that wasn't enough, that a larger amount of
non-Social Security surplus funds must be set aside to make sure the retirement
program is protected.
</P>
<P>
	   By not shoring up the Social Security system now with surplus funds we are,
by fiat, agreeing to raise payroll taxes in the future,'' added McCain, whose
own plan is roughly half the size of Bush's. I have called this kind of
economics ``fiscally irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was defending his plan in a new 30-second ad beginning Thursday night
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men never crossed paths during the day as they made their campaign
rounds a little more than two weeks in advance of the nation's first
presidential primary, set for Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   But their cross-state sparring underscored the extent to which the campaign
is settling into a disagreement over tax cuts, an issue that has divided
Republicans for the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Two new public opinion polls released during the day pointed to a close race
in New Hampshire between the two Sun Belt political figures, but disagreed on
which man held the lead. One survey said it was Bush, the Texas governor who is
the national front-runner by far. The other said it was McCain, running an
insurgent's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush did not mention that Republicans hold a majority in Congress, and he
made no other comments during the day that implied criticism of the
congressional wing of his party.
</P>
<P>
	   He made his remarks midway through a full day of campaigning that took him
from a high tech factory in Laconia to a lunchtime speech in this coastal city
to a town hall meeting in Londonderry before flying off to Iowa, which holds
caucuses eight days before New Hampshire votes.
</P>
<P>
	   During the town hall meeting, Bush bristled at the suggestion from someone
in the crowd that he had a ``drug past.'' The Texas governor has refused to
directly answer questions about whether he has used illegal drugs, except to say
he has not since 1974.
</P>
<P>
	   A man who said he was Sanho Tree of the Institute for Policy Studies, a
Washington think tank, asked the governor for his perspective on the war on
drugs ``from your own drug past.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sir, sit down please,'' Bush said. ``You're making an assumption about me
that you have -- you really don't know what you're talking about. I don't accept
that assumption.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush told the man that ``what you need to know about is, should I swear in,
I'm going to bring honor and dignity to the office.'' He added, ``You shouldn't
fall prey to rumors and gossip.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is campaigning as the outsider in the race, and he told reporters
during the day one of the key issues will be ``executive experience'' versus
``Washington legislative experience,'' an obvious reference to McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the Republican establishment's embrace was evident during
the day. Judd Gregg, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Rep.
Charles Bass spent part of the day with Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has repeatedly accused Bush of advocating a tax cut that is too large
and risks harm to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   In remarks before a Rotary Club and afterward to reporters, the front-runner
seemed eager to keep the argument alive.
</P>
<P>
	   He lumped McCain and Vice President Al Gore together as the only ``two
voices'' in the campaign to say his own tax cut was too bold.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, McCain accuses Bush of providing overly generous relief
for the wealthy, echoing criticisms that Democrats frequently level at GOP tax
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor took that issue head-on at several points during the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's fair to cut the taxes on everybody if you're going to cut taxes at
all,'' he said to the Rotarians. At a news conference afterward, he re-enforced
his plan to cut the top tax rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said his plan would stimulate the economy as well as return money to
the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the money lies around the halls of Washington it's going to be spent,''
he said at one point. ``Appropriators appropriate,'' he said at another.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A fugitive associate of mob boss John Gotti who allegedly
paid a juror $60,000 to arrange a 1992 acquittal for the ``Teflon Don'' is in
federal custody in Florida, authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bosko Radonjich was arrested Jan. 2 at Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors plan to arraign Radonjich, 56, in federal court in Brooklyn,
where he was indicted in 1992 on jury tampering charges, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Paul Schoeman. No date for the arraignment was set.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities refused to speculate on Radonjich's whereabouts for the past
eight years.
</P>
<P>
	   He was apparently in Miami on a brief stopover for an international flight.
Because he was traveling under his own name, a background check turned up the
warrant for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Gotti was known as the ``Teflon Don'' for beating conviction in three trials
as the Gambino boss. He was imprisoned for life in 1992 after being convicted in
a murder racketeering case which relied on the testimony of a mob turncoat.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns About Imbalances  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans, enjoying the most prosperous times in a
generation, have fueled a remarkable economic boom, but there are dangers that
growing imbalances could derail the economic expansion, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to the Economic Club of New York, Greenspan expressed an upbeat
assessment of the economy's current performance, noting that next month it will
become the longest expansion in U.S. history, surpassing the 106 months of
uninterrupted growth in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   "There can be little argument that the American economy as it stands at the
beginning of a new century has never exhibited so remarkable a prosperity for at
least the majority of its citizens," Greenspan said in the speech, copies of
which were released in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Greenspan also repeated worries he has voiced before that the
Federal Reserve must be alert to the growing imbalances between continued strong
consumer demand, bolstered by Americans' soaring stock portfolios, and the
dwindling supply of available workers, given that unemployment is now at a
30-year low.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to concerns about rising inflation pressures, Greenspan also
repeated concerns he has expressed in the past that the huge runup in stock
prices could without warning reverse itself.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates three times in the past six
months in an effort to slow the economy and relieve pressures on tight labor
markets before they trigger inflationary wage demands.
</P>
<P>
	   While it is widely expected that the Fed will raise rates when they meet
again on Feb. 1-2, Greenspan did not specifically address that issue, saying
only that the central bank is always forced to make interest-rate decisions
based on incomplete evidence of where the economy is headed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Regrettably, we at the Federal Reserve do not have the luxury of awaiting a
better set of insights into this process," Greenspan said in the speech.
"Indeed, our goal, in responding to the complexity of current economic forces,
is to extend the expansion by containing its imbalances."
</P>
<P>
	   In all of his comments, Greenspan was careful to balance his worries about
the future with expressions that some fundamentally beneficial changes are
occurring in the economy that have given a strong boost to U.S. productivity.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said that when economists look back at the current period a decade
from now, they may well conclude "at the turn of the millennium, the American
economy was experiencing a once-in-a-century acceleration of innovation which
propelled forward productivity, output, corporate profits and stock prices at a
pace not seen in generations, if ever."
</P>
<P>
	   But Greenspan also said there could be an alternative view of the current
period when viewed in a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   "Alternatively, that 2010 retrospective might well conclude that a good deal
of what we are currently experiencing was just one of the many euphoric
speculative bubbles that have dotted human history."
</P>
<P>
	   That comment echoed Greenspan's famous worry, voiced in December 1996, that
investors might be in the grip of "irrational exuberance." At the time, the Dow
Jones industrial average was trading around 6,400.
</P>

	   Despite worries expressed since that time by Greenspan about market
valuations, the Dow closed on Thursday at a new record of 11,582.43.
</P>
<P>
	   In his Thursday speech, Greenspan said that the boom in stock prices, by
bolstering consumer spending, has probably added around 1 percentage point

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Score High on Education  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore scored the highest marks on
educational issues in a report card on the presidential candidates released
Thursday by the National Urban League.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley, Gore's Democratic party rival for the nomination, came in
second while Republicans George W. Bush and John McCain were tied for third.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore scored 13 of a possible 15 points in the ranking that stacked the
candidates' educational positions against those of the national civil rights
organization, such as opposition to school vouchers and raising teacher quality.
Former Sen. Bradley of New Jersey scored 9 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas gov. Bush and McCain, the Arizona senator, were tied with 7 points
each. Steve Forbes followed with 2 points. Both Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer
received zeros. The report did not include Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah
and Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
	   Candidates were judged on five principles: commitment to quality early
education, opposition to vouchers, providing quality teachers, access to
telecommunications technology and continuing social promotion until higher
quality schools are achieved.
</P>
<P>
	   In each category, scores ranged from zero, for opposition or no position on
an issue, to three points, indicating strong support for an issue.
</P>
<P>
	   While saying the ratings should not be viewed as an endorsement of any
specific candidate, Urban League President Hugh B. Price said he hoped the study
would help guide voters who support the league.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any presidential candidate who aspires to lead this country should commit
to eradicate achievement disparities, eliminate discriminatory educational
practices and ensure that all children have a genuine opportunity to learn and
achieve,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Gore's commitment to improving schools was ``palpable and
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president has made education the
top priority of his presidential campaign and relished the high marks.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Bradley's vision for education was promising, but expressed
concern about his ``inconsistent'' stance on school vouchers. As a senator,
Bradley voted for experimental voucher programs, but on the campaign trail has
said he doesn't believe vouchers are the answer to the problems with public
education.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke dismissed the criticism, noting that
Education Secretary Richard Riley recently said ``there is no real difference
between Bill Bradley and Al Gore in terms of their commitment to education.''
</P>
<P>
	   Of Bush, the report praised the Texas governor's record of increasing
education funding and improved standardized test scores among minority school
children in his state. But it chided Bush for trying fund an experimental
voucher program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Appraising Mr. Bush's track record as governor is complicated,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan defended Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every child should receive a first rate education and if a disadvantaged
student continues to be trapped in a failing school, Governor Bush thinks
parents should have the option to send their child to a different school,''
McClellan said.

<HEADLINE> Experts Discuss Salton Sea's Future  </HEADLINE>
   By DARA AKIKO WILLIAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DESERT HOT SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Federal officials warned Thursday that
the Salton Sea's rich ecosystem will die unless 9 million tons of salt is pulled
from the lake each year.
</P>
<P>
	   The process could cost up to $9.5 million annually for at least 30 years.
</P>
<P>
	   David Hayes, Interior Department deputy secretary, said reducing the
salinity is part of an overall plan to restore and develop California's biggest
lake, which sustains one of the nation's most productive fisheries and is an
important stop for migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to save the Salton Sea and we need to do it now,'' said Hayes, who
spoke during a Salton Sea Symposium. ``To let the sea die, in our view, is not
an option.''
</P>
<P>
	   A draft environmental impact report outlining the best methods of restoring
the sea's health was discussed by politicians, environmentalists and scientists.
The document will be used by Hayes and others when seeking restoration funds
from Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Salton Sea formed in 1905 after the Colorado River burst through a canal
and flooded an area 120 miles northeast of San Diego. The lake, below sea level,
sucked salt out of the desert over the years, making it 25 percent saltier than
the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   The Interior Department, the Bureau of Reclamation and the Salton Sea
Authority spent 18 months preparing the draft as other experts developed
scientific studies. The results of those studies will be presented Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The draft offers five alternatives, including damming sections of the lake
to create evaporation ponds, building evaporation towers that would pull water
from the sea and spray mist into collection basins, or a combination of ponds
and towers.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual costs range from $1.6 million for the ponds to $9.5 million for
the towers. A combination of both would cost $7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal is to reduce the sea's salinity to the same level as the Pacific
Ocean.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Denies Job Rumors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton denied rumors Thursday that a big-money
job already awaits him on Wall Street or elsewhere when he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a total fabrication,'' the president said. ``I must say that it was
an immense surprise to my wife and daughter that anybody would ever offer me
that kind of money to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, in an interview with CNBC, was asked about reports he will take a
multi-million dollar job at Lazard Freres, a well-known investment firm. There's
also been speculation he will take a big-bucks job in the entertainment industry
or run for Congress from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it was not appropriate now to discuss his future. ``What I want to
do is to work until the last hour of the last day I'm president, to get as much
done for the country as I can, to leave America in the best shape I can, and ...
for the rest of my life, try to be a good and useful citizen. And I'll have
plenty of time to figure out what I should do to make a living at a later time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But it was a flattering rumor,'' the president said. ``Many of the other
rumors have been flattering. But they're all, as far as I know, completely
unfounded.''

<HEADLINE> Dad Sentenced in Starvation Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A father convicted of starving to death his 2-year-old son
because ``God doesn't like babies who are fat'' was sentenced Thursday to 25
years to life in prison, the maximum sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   David Mayer, 32, was convicted in December of first-degree murder. Jurors
could not reach a unanimous decision on a special circumstance charge of
torture, which would have qualified Mayer for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy, Zechariah, weighed only 19 pounds when he died in January 1998 in a
home where the refrigerator was full of food, prosecutors said. He was a month
shy of this third birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge Laura Hammes said Mayer drank alcohol, smoked
marijuana, watched his big screen television and left the house when he wanted
while his son starved to death.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayer ``related everything back to God,'' Hammes said. ``God conveniently
gave him an excuse to provide for himself and his selfish wants while permitting
him to kill the child intentionally.''
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Jesse Gilbert argued that Mayer was delusional, believed
that God controlled his life and that God would take care of everything.
</P>
<P>
	   A social worker told authorities that prior to Zachariah's death, Mayer said
that ``God doesn't like babies who are fat.''
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's mother, Jennifer Mayer, 23, was convicted in October of
second-degree murder. Her sentencing is set for Jan. 27. She faces 15 years to
life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Court To Keep Wolves in Rockies  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVE GUTTERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that hundreds of
transplanted Canadian wolves can remain in the northern Rockies, a decision
environmentalists hailed as a boon for species recovery efforts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 1997 decision by a Wyoming
federal judge who ruled that a government wolf reintroduction program in
Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho was illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   Ranchers and state farm bureaus oppose the 5-year-old program because they
say the wolves endanger livestock. They also claim that the program is
unnecessary because there is already a viable wolf population in the area.
</P>
<P>
	   The government and environmental groups deny that, and say there may be only
a few lone native wolves.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups suing over the program, the American Farm Bureau Federation and
state chapters in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, employed an unusual tactic.
</P>
<P>
	   They pointed out that while native wolves are covered by the Endangered
Species Act, the reintroduced wolves are considered part of an ``experimental
population'' and can be shot if they threaten livestock. The farm groups said
the reintroduction program violates the Endangered Species Act by providing
different protections to the native and the reintroduced wolves.
</P>
<P>
	   But the appeals court said the 1973 Endangered Species Act and a section
added by Congress in 1982 were intended to allow the Interior Department
flexibility in its approaches to the goals of preserving and recovering
threatened animals.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court said a limit to that flexibility ``ignores biological
reality and misconstrues the larger purpose'' of the law.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmental groups that joined Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and other
government agencies in the appeal of the Wyoming ruling said Thursday's decision
sets an important precedent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The practical effect is that the wolves are here to stay,'' said Mark Van
Putten, president of the National Wildlife Federation, adding that the decision
has ``enormous significance nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
	   Van Putten said there is a thriving population of about 300 wolves in
Yellowstone and central Idaho as a result of the reintroduction program.
</P>
<P>
	   Babbitt called the decision ``a ringing endorsement to our wolf
reintroduction program.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jon Robinett, who says his livestock has been attacked repeatedly by wolves
at his ranch in Dubois, Wyo., about 40 miles from Yellowstone, was disappointed
with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just don't think they paid close enough attention to what was presented
to them,'' he said. ``Maybe they weren't well-versed in the Endangered Species
Act.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, U.S. District Judge William Downes ordered the reintroduced wolves
removed but stayed his ruling pending the decision by the federal appeals court.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmother Wants Him Home  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- The grandmother of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez says her
daughter -- killed in the boating accident that set the child adrift off the
Florida coast -- would have wanted the child returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She will not rest in peace until the child is here with his father and his
grandparents,'' Raquel Rodriguez, mother of the late Elisabeth Brotons, said in
an interview printed Thursday in the Communist Party daily Granma.
</P>
<P>
	   Brotons died at sea with 10 others when their boat sank on the high sea in
late November. Elian, just one of three who survived, was found clinging to an
inner tube.
</P>
<P>
	   The child was paroled to the care of his paternal relatives in Miami, who
are trying to keep him in the United States. The boy's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, has demanded that Elian be returned to him in Cuba and the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service has said that the father and son should
be reunited.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who oppose returning Elian to Cuba argue that the mother gave her life
to take him to the United States and that her wishes should be respected.
Rodriguez took issue with that argument.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Saying that keeping Elian there out of respect for my daughter's will is a
bunch of lies,'' said Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can see that none of them know her,'' the grandmother said, referring
to the statements made by Elian's parental relatives in Miami about her
daughter. ``I was her mother and I knew her better than anyone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am convinced that after this tragedy that her ultimate wish would have
been that the boy be at the side of his father and his grandparents,'' Rodriguez
added.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday evening, Cuba's government-controlled television showed footage
of another interview Rodriguez gave at her home in the town of Cardenas to
MSNBC. The grandmother told of the anguish of first losing her only child, then
seeing images of her only grandchild in another country often surrounded by
television cameras.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Dad Speaks Out With Anger  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flashing anger at those responsible for keeping his son
in Miami, the father of Elian Gonzalez said Thursday he feels like ``breaking
the neck'' of politicians fighting the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Repeating previous statements that he has no intention of coming to Miami to
pick up the boy, Juan Miguel Gonzalez told ABC's ``Nightline'' that Elian's U.S.
relatives don't ``have any feelings.''
</P>
<P>
	   The interview was conducted as Attorney General Janet Reno sought the return
of the 6-year-old child, even while the custody case headed to federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The issue is a father who wants his son home and grandparents who want
their grandson home and these are bonds that should be honored,'' Reno told her
weekly news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez asked whether, if he went to Miami, his son would be handed over.
``No,'' he said, answering his own question. ``Miami Cubans would just entangle
me in their political games.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a transcript released by the network, translated from Spanish, the father
grew angry when he was asked about a news report that he didn't work anymore,
didn't live in his own home and was under psychiatric treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   He called the report ``a lie,'' and added: ``Perhaps I might be a little bit
crazy because I would feel like breaking the neck of all those SOBs'' opposing
Elian's return. He cited ``the politicians in Miami and those who ... have
behaved in a manner that is contrary to what our relatives should have done.''
</P>
<P>
	   At another point, Gonzalez said he ``what I would like to do is go down
there with a rifle.'' Told by interviewer Chris Wallace the remark was
inflammatory, the father responded: ``Isn't it inflammatory what they are doing
with my son?''
</P>
<P>
	   An attorney for Elian's Florida relatives, who are caring for him now, said
they would go to federal court next week to challenge the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's ruling that he must be returned to his father in Cuba
</P>
<P>
	   The INS, meanwhile, rejected a second asylum petition filed this week on
behalf of Elian by his Florida relatives. Justice Department spokeswoman Carole
Florman said that only the boy's father could represent his son before the
agency. Ms. Florman said the new petition contained ``no new information.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic off Florida on
Thanksgiving. His mother and others fleeing Cuba with him had drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno voiced concern about the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My hope is that people will look at this little boy and get him into a
situation where he can live a normal life without television cameras and the
world in his face,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do you remember when you were 6? There were some days I wanted to run away
from home and there were other days when I wanted my mommy so bad I couldn't
stand it. ... I certainly think the experience of most people is that a
6-year-old is too young to speak for himself.''
</P>
<P>
	   To allow time for a federal court challenge, Reno said Wednesday the INS
indefinitely would extend its Friday deadline for turning the boy over. She
brushed aside a state court ruling delaying the boy's return and said any
challenge to the INS would have to come in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   She explained Thursday that the boy's status is an immigration matter,
solely in the jurisdiction of federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that the people involved in this situation care about the little
boy and want to do what's right by him and I think they have also indicated a
faith in the legal process. Let's let that happen,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno refused to spell out precisely the department's options.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice officials, requesting anonymity, said they could go to federal court
on their own for a ruling that the state court order does not overrule the INS
decision or for an enforcement order to carry out the INS decision. But they
said they wanted to choose the least provocative course, and, though they would
not say so directly, that course appeared to be waiting to respond to any
federal court action filed by the Florida relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer Eig, attorney for the boy's Florida relatives, said they would ask a
federal court for relief next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government should have respected the temporary protective order of the
Florida family court, as it was based on preventing imminent and irreparable
harm to the child,'' Eig said. ``Now we will take the case to a court they
cannot ignore.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro appeared at a rally in Havana on Thursday as
his countrymen kept up their pressure for the boy's return. He did not address
the demonstrators.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Request on Waco Papers Denied  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN PARROTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday denied government requests to
delay the handover of documents in the wrongful-death case filed by Branch
Davidian survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith turned down the two-week delay requested by
the Justice Department and ordered it to produce reams of evidence and turn it
over to the plaintiffs' lawyers. Justice lawyers had argued that competing
demands would not allow them to meet Saturday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith also said he will not allow government lawyers to put on hold a second
round of depositions scheduled for next week in Washington with FBI agents
involved in the siege.
</P>
<P>
	   The deadly standoff near Waco began Feb. 28, 1993, when federal agents
raided the rural compound of Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and his
followers.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials insist government forces fired no shots when the
seven-week siege ended in an inferno. Koresh and some 80 followers perished
during the blaze, some from the fire, others from gunshot wounds. The government
says the Davidians died by their own hands.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, the plaintiffs' lead counsel, Michael Caddell, asked
Smith to sanction the government $50,000 for delaying the surrender of the
documents.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Michael Bradford has said the government was slowed by
competing demands for information from the judge; special counsel John Danforth,
who is conducting an independent probe of the matter; and the congressional
committees re-investigating the siege.

   PERRIS, Calif. (AP) -- Twenty cars and trucks collided Thursday in
chain-reaction accidents on a fog-shrouded stretch of freeway. Several minor
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   It began about 5:40 a.m. when a car rear-ended a tractor-trailer on
Interstate 215 about 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles, authorities said.

said Veronica Gonzalez, spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol. Dense fog

<HEADLINE> 4 Convicted in Viagra Smuggling Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Four businessmen were convicted Thursday of scheming to smuggle
70,000 doses of Viagra to Russian nightclub patrons with an undercover agent who
portrayed himself as a Russian mobster.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys conceded the group may have broken some law, but not the
one charged in the federal indictment -- conspiracy to distribute Viagra without
a wholesaler's license -- because one of them had the license.
</P>
<P>
	   A Miami Beach detective assigned to an organized crime task force targeting
Russian crooks played the nightclub owner -- known only as Vladimir in the
sting. A wholesaler, broker, shipper, lawyer and middleman got together with
Vladimir in 1998 to put together the $1.6 million deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The imitation Russian let everyone know he was ``crooked'' and said the
impotence pills were destined for the black market, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawyer, Jon Freeman of Hallandale, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and
agreed to cooperate with the prosecution of the other four -- wholesaler Victor
Penafiel, middleman Arthur Goodman, shipper Lachman Raichandani and broker
Matthew Scott.
</P>
<P>
	   Each defendant faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Want 'Fresh Start'  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- Bill Bradley and Al Gore agree on one thing: Democratic
voters crave a ``fresh start.'' That may explain why Bill Clinton's personal
conduct and job performance are nagging issues in their presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The lingering effects of impeachment could cut more than one way for both
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Many voters give Gore credit for a soaring economy but saddle him with his
boss' baggage. Bradley may benefit from ``Clinton fatigue,'' but he runs a risk
of alienating Democrats loyal to their president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think Democrats feel Clinton is doing a good job, and they're glad he's
leaving,'' New Hampshire businessman Michael A. Vance said before a Bradley
speech Thursday. ``I'm sure it's a mixed blessing for his vice president.''
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews with more than a dozen voters in Iowa and New Hampshire suggest
the political context.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm concerned that your ability to win the election is reduced by your
association with the Clinton scandal,'' Craig Wood of Linn County, Iowa, told
Gore on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to the president's affair with a White House intern, Gore replied,
``I wouldn't have done that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Listening, Democratic voter Karen Teig said she wasn't surprised that the
issue arose because people in her circles still talk about impeachment. ``It
only surprised me that someone had the guts to bring it up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is not shying from the question. At times, he seems to be running as
much against Clinton as Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Explaining his vote in favor of the now-unpopular ``Freedom to Farm Act,''
Bradley said he had trusted Clinton to make changes after the bill passed. ``I
took his word which isn't, you know, always the best thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   He accused Gore of being stuck in a ``Washington bunker'' that Clinton
helped to build. ``There was the fund-raising scandals. There was the
impeachment problem,'' the former New Jersey senator said in a recent debate.
</P>
<P>
	   And he is stepping up attacks on the administration's farming, welfare and
campaign finance reform policies, accusing both Clinton and Gore of ``timid
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley says his references to Clinton are intended to show that Gore is
part of an administration that settles for small solutions to big problems.
``The real question is not Clinton, the real question is what did Gore do in all
of that,'' he said in an interview with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Democrats are still wrestling with the impeachment episode.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is some ambiguity. When a president is under attack by a hostile and
almost irrational Republican majority there isn't a Democrat in the country,
including me, who wouldn't come to Clinton's defense in terms of saying, 'No
impeachment.' But I think that there is a large segment of the Democratic Party
that is also concerned about the party continuing the direction of these small
steps and symbolic actions,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said many independents and Democrats who can vote in New Hampshire's
primary ``feel that they want a fresh start'' from Clinton and his policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore used the same phrase in Iowa on Wednesday, sometime after Wood said
Clinton might be dragging him down. ``We need a fresh start,'' Gore said. ``We
need a good beginning.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president has offered implicit criticisms of Clinton when
challenged about administration failures. After a voter in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
accused the administration of doing nothing about global warming, Gore replied,
``How do we change that? I believe that a president who is committed heart and
soul to using the bully pulpit to change the level of public support for a vote
to ratify that (global warming) treaty can make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yet the vice president focuses on administration successes to fend off
Bradley's jibes.
</P>
<P>
	   In their most recent debate, Gore said, ``I want to start by telling you
what we were doing in that Washington bunker.'' He gave the administration
credit for 20 million new jobs, gun control laws and ``the strongest economy in
the history of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president's advisers argue that Bradley's strategy will backfire,
because Democratic voters still like Clinton. They point to people like Myron
Riediger, an Iowa farmer who said Bradley shouldn't criticize Clinton's farm
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Such negative talk ``backfired bad in our hometown,'' he said Thursday
``Sure, times have gotten worse, but a lot of us wouldn't have even been able to
hang on if it weren't for Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's impact won't be easy to measure, according to polls showing that:
</P>
<P>
	   -- One quarter of Americans say Gore's ties with Clinton make them view the
vice president less favorably. Four out of 10 Republicans felt that way. One
quarter of independents, whose votes are critical in New Hampshire. Just one in
10 Democrats felt that way.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Nearly 90 percent of Democrats say they're pleased with the president's
job performance. Four out of five have a positive view of Clinton personally.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Of socially conservative Democrats who say they're troubled by the
Clinton scandal, nearly half favor Republican candidate George W. Bush over
Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Watching Bradley walk in from the snow in Nashua, Alan Sax and the
businessman Vance debated Clinton's impact on the race.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's dangerous to knock a man who has helped bring about these good
times,'' said Sax, 46.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's right,'' said Vance, pointing to Sax. ``But some people are tired of
(Clinton) anyhow.''

<HEADLINE> Va. Executes Man Who Killed at 17  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JARRATT, Va. (AP) -- A man who killed his 70-year-old neighbor while robbing
her when he was a teen-ager was executed Thursday by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Edward Roach, 23, was the second man executed in Virginia this week
for committing murder at age 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Roach shot Mary Ann Hughes in her home in 1993 before fleeing with her purse
and car. He had been convicted of four felonies in the seven months before the
slaying and was armed in violation of his probation terms.
</P>
<P>
	   Amnesty International wrote to Gov. Jim Gilmore asking him to spare Roach.
And on Wednesday, about 50 people gathered in front of Charlottesville Circuit
Court to protest the death penalty, especially when used to punish crimes
committed by juveniles.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview last week, Roach said, ``I am ready to accept whatever
happens, and I am praying for a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gilmore rejected Roach's request for clemency an hour before the execution.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Douglas Christopher Thomas, 26, was executed for shooting his
girlfriend's parents in Middlesex County in 1990 when he was 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Roach and Thomas had hoped to take advantage of a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling last June in which another Virginia youth was granted a new trial because
only his mother was notified of a hearing to transfer his case from juvenile
court to adult court. Virginia law at the time required notice of such hearings
go ``to the parents'' of the juvenile.

<HEADLINE> France Restores Power After Storms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- France's national electric company has restored power to all
the homes that lost it during violent storms that swept through France at
Christmastime, the EDF power company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   At the worst point of the electricity crisis, about 3.4 million homes -- 10
percent of EDF's clients -- had no power, company chairman Francois Roussely
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But telephone lines were still a problem. About 5,000 subscribers were still
without telephone connections, though national company France Telecom said the
problem should be resolved by the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
	   After the two violent windstorms whipped through France, the total cost of
repairs to the electricity network alone came to $2.7 billion, with about a
third of that going towards emergency repairs, the government has said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin unveiled an aid package
worth $630 million aimed at helping France get back on its feet after the
devastating weather.
</P>
<P>
	   Ninety people died in storm-related accidents. Many people are still carting
away uprooted trees and repairing battered roofs.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts from Gonzalez Interview  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Excerpts from Chris Wallace's interview with Juan Miguel Gonzalez, father of
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, on ABC News' ``Nightline,'' as transcribed by the
network:
</P>
<P>
	   Q. Mr. Gonzalez, there is a story in the Miami Herald that says that you
don't work anymore, that you don't live in your own home and it even says that
you are under psychiatric treatment. How much of that is true, sir?
</P>
<P>
	   A. ... I will just say that all of that is a lie. I am still working. I
continue living in my home and I am under no type of psychiatric treatment.
Perhaps I might be a little bit crazy because I would feel like breaking the
neck of all those SOBs ... starting will all of those of the politicians in
Miami and those who, you know, have behaved in a manner that is contrary to what
our relatives should have done, they do not take into account that this is only
a 6-year-old child. The problem is suffering that both the child as well as all
of his relatives here are going through simply because of political reasons and
also because of money.
</P>
<P>
	   Q. The implication of this is that you are under the control of the Cuban
government and therefore not free to speak you own mind.
</P>
<P>
	   A. ... I have been under absolutely no pressure from anybody here. I have
always said with everybody I have had interviews with, the INS, journalists,
etc., with total freedom, I have been the one who has been exerting pressure on
the government to get a response, ... and they have not sent my child back to
me.
</P>
<P>
	   Q. It has been suggested ... that the reason you do not come to Miami is
because the Cuban government is afraid once you get to Miami, you will defect.
</P>
<P>
	   A. Who said that? ... People think, or some people think, that I am under
pressure here. I have always said I haven't lost anything in Miami, and
sometimes what I would like to do is go down there with a rifle -- I don't know
-- to get rid of how many people. ... And what about -- isn't it inflammatory
what they are doing with my son? ... I think the main thing is to send my child
back to me as soon as possible ... It's almost -- been almost two months that I
haven't seen my son, that he's away from me, and this has been always my main
interest.
</P>
<P>
	   A. Do you see the pictures of him from Miami, for instance waving the
congressional subpoena and giving the ``V'' for victory sign?
</P>
<P>
	   A. ... This is child abuse. He is being made to do things against his will
because if he were able to say or to defend Fidel (Castro), he would do it. ...
He told me over the phone that he is dreaming about coming back to me to be with
him, to be with me, and they are manipulating what he is saying and saying
things that are untrue. ... I would like to express my gratitude to Janet Reno,
the attorney general, and I would like to ask her please to do whatever is
possible for them to send my son back to me.''

<HEADLINE> Accused Killer Drops Trial Request  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Angel Maturino Resendiz, suspected in the deaths of nine
people while he was riding freight trains across the country, dropped a request
Thursday to have his murder trial moved from Houston, saying he did not want to
risk facing a jury composed of ``rednecks and Germans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Maturino Resendiz last week asked state District Judge Bill Harmon to move
his trial in the 1998 slaying of Houston physician Claudia Benton to Austin,
Waco or El Paso.
</P>
<P>
	   He specifically asked Harmon not to relocate to a city of German heritage,
which Maturino Resendiz called ``Nazi enclaves.'' He said he feared them because
he has Jewish beliefs.
</P>
<P>
	   Maturino Resendiz withdrew his motion after he was informed that Harmon
could move the trial to any courthouse in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also pushed jury selection back one month to March 27 to allow
prosecutors and defense attorneys more time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
	   Maturino Resendiz is charged with capital murder in Benton's death.
Prosecutors are waiting for psychological profiles to be completed before
formally seeking the death penalty.
</P>

Kentucky. His surrender to Texas authorities July 13 was negotiated by
relatives.

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Unveils Debt Buyback Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, seeking to operate in the new
world of budget surpluses, adopted rules Thursday that will allow the government
to buy back up to $30 billion of the national debt this year, something that
hasn't happened for at least a century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to get this country out of debt,'' President Clinton told a
Democratic fund-raising audience in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, in making the announcement, called the
debt buyback program ``an important new tool'' for the government to use in
managing the $5.76 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reducing the supply of Treasury debt held by the public brings enormous
benefits to our economy,'' Summers said. ``It means that there will be less
pressure on interest rates than there would otherwise have been and therefore
lower borrowing costs for businesses and lower interest payments for American
families.''
</P>
<P>
	   The administration, which first proposed the idea of debt buybacks last
August, has sought to portray its proposal as the responsible way to utilize the
government's burgeoning surpluses, the product of the current economic boom, in
contrast to Republican calls for large tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton said the debt buyback plan was a ``dramatic reminder'' of
how much the government's economic fortunes have improved after decades of
rising budget deficits and would allow the government to ``refinance old debt
and pay it down on the best terms possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the rules the government adopted, Treasury will conduct what is known
as a ``reverse auction,'' in which the government will offer cash to bond
holders who indicate their willingness to sell government bonds back to the
government.
</P>
<P>
	   The price will be set in a bidding process designed to make sure the
government pays prevailing market rates for the bonds it buys.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury Under Secretary Gary Gensler, who oversees the debt operations,
said Treasury records show it has been at least a century since the federal
government has offered cash to buy securities that have not yet matured.
</P>
<P>
	   Gensler said the Treasury conducted limited swap operations in the 1960s and
as late as 1972, swapping new bonds for older bonds held by the public in an
effort to reorganize the types of bonds outstanding.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers said the debt buyback program would be launched in the coming weeks
with several operations conducted in the next 12 months, totaling up to $30
billion. Officials said the exact timing of the program and the size of each
buyback program had yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   The national debt now stands at $5.76 trillion, with the amount of that debt
held by the public totaling $3.6 trillion. The rest of the debt, some $2
trillion, is held by the government's large trust funds, primarily the Social
Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers noted that under current surplus forecasts, the entire $3.6 trillion
in debt held by the public could be eliminated over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
	   However, private economists caution that those long-range projections are
based on assumptions that the current good economic times, which have triggered
the swelling revenues, continue and that Democrats and Republicans resist the
urge to spend the surplus on new government programs or in tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Elimination of the $3.6 trillion of publicly-held debt would mark the first
time that the debt held by the public has been eliminated since President Andrew
Jackson accomplished the feat in 1835.
</P>
<P>
	   However, even if that goal is accomplished, it would still leave the sizable
$2 trillion in debt the government owes to the Social Security trust fund, money
that will be needed to finance the Baby Boomers' retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Participants in financial markets offered general support for the debt
buyback approach.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The $30 billion was on the high side of market expectations and the
initial market reaction has been positive,'' said David Jones, chief economist
at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co., a government securities dealer in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount of the national debt held by the public has been reduced over the
past two years by $140 billion, reflecting the fact that the government has
posted back-to-back surpluses over the last two years for the first time since
Dwight Eisenhower was president.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra cash allowed the Treasury to reduce outstanding debt simply by
selling fewer new bonds at its regularly scheduled auctions than the amount of
old bonds coming due.
</P>
<P>
	   That procedure will be employed again this year. But officials said the new
buyback procedure will allow them to better control the government's interest
costs by buying back longer maturities and substituting shorter-term maturities
with lower interest payments.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Use Money for Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- Sharpening their disagreement over tax cuts, George
W. Bush suggested Thursday that John McCain's proposal would leave too much
money for Congress to spend on ``bigger government,'' and McCain countered that
the Republican presidential front-runner's plan could lead to higher payroll
taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I must confess I am skeptical of appropriators,'' Bush said, referring to
members of the House and Senate committees that write multibillion-dollar
spending bills annually.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Somehow I have trouble believing that they're going to necessarily spend
it on debt reduction,'' the Texas governor said of the surplus funds that would
be left after McCain's tax cut took effect. ``I worry they may spend it on
bigger government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's tax cut, $483 billion over five years, would leave the Social
Security surplus alone, but spend from non-Social Security surplus funds.
McCain, in a written statement, said that wasn't enough, that a larger amount of
non-Social Security surplus funds must be set aside to make sure the retirement
program is protected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By not shoring up the Social Security system now with surplus funds we
are, by fiat, agreeing to raise payroll taxes in the future,'' added McCain,
whose own plan is roughly half the size of Bush's. I have called this kind of
economics ``fiscally irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was defending his plan in a new 30-second ad beginning Thursday night
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   And in comments later to reporters, McCain said that his was a conservative
approach. ``I think it's conservative to pay down the debt and save Social
Security'' and shore up Medicare, as well as cutting taxes, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men never crossed paths during the day as they made their campaign
rounds a little more than two weeks in advance of the nation's first
presidential primary, set for Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   But their cross-state sparring underscored the extent to which the campaign
is settling into a disagreement over tax cuts, an issue that has divided
Republicans for the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Two new public opinion polls released during the day pointed to a close race
in New Hampshire between the two Sun Belt political figures, but disagreed on
which man held the lead. One survey said it was Bush, the Texas governor who is
the national front-runner by far. The other said it was McCain, running an
insurgent's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush did not mention that Republicans hold a majority in Congress, and he
made no other comments during the day that implied criticism of the
congressional wing of his party.
</P>
<P>
	   He made his remarks midway through a full day of campaigning that took him
from a high tech factory in Laconia to a lunchtime speech in this coastal city
to a town hall meeting in Londonderry before flying off to Iowa, which holds
caucuses eight days before New Hampshire votes.
</P>
<P>
	   During the town hall meeting, Bush bristled at the suggestion from someone
in the crowd that he had a ``drug past.'' The Texas governor has refused to
directly answer questions about whether he has used illegal drugs, except to say
he has not since 1974.
</P>
<P>
	   A man who said he was Sanho Tree of the Institute for Policy Studies, a
Washington think tank, asked the governor for his perspective on the war on
drugs ``from your own drug past.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sir, sit down please,'' Bush said. ``You're making an assumption about me
that you have -- you really don't know what you're talking about. I don't accept
that assumption.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush told the man that ``what you need to know about is, should I swear in,
I'm going to bring honor and dignity to the office.'' He added, ``You shouldn't
fall prey to rumors and gossip.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is campaigning as the outsider in the race, and he told reporters
during the day one of the key issues will be ``executive experience'' versus
``Washington legislative experience,'' an obvious reference to McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the Republican establishment's embrace was evident during
the day. Judd Gregg, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Rep.
Charles Bass spent part of the day with Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has repeatedly accused Bush of advocating a tax cut that is too large
and risks harm to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   In remarks before a Rotary Club and afterward to reporters, the front-runner
seemed eager to keep the argument alive.
</P>
<P>
	   He lumped McCain and Vice President Al Gore together as the only ``two
voices'' in the campaign to say his own tax cut was too bold.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, McCain accuses Bush of providing overly generous relief
for the wealthy, echoing criticisms that Democrats frequently level at GOP tax
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor took that issue head-on at several points during the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's fair to cut the taxes on everybody if you're going to cut taxes at
all,'' he said to the Rotarians. At a news conference afterward, he re-enforced
his plan to cut the top tax rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said his plan would stimulate the economy as well as return money to
the taxpayers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Using Noose  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A white man convicted of ethnic intimidation after
placing a noose around a black co-worker's neck was sentenced Thursday to serve
the next 12 weekends in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the prison sentence, Joe Larose, 35, will be under house arrest
for three months and on probation for two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Larose was convicted two months ago of intimidation and simple assault for
having approached Dwayne Jackson from behind and looped the noose around his
neck while their co-workers at the trucking company erupted in laughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Larose, who was fired from his job, apologized during the sentencing hearing
without looking at Jackson. He has said the November 1998 incident was a joke.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against T&AMP;N Van Service Inc.,
Larose and several others at the company. He is seeking more than $50,000 in
damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Jackson was not physically injured, he testified that he was
terrified because he wasn't sure of Larose's intent.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, reported
incidents of harassment and intimidation based on race in the workplace have
almost doubled nationwide in the last decade. In 1990, 3,600 cases were filed.
Last year, there were 6,500.

<HEADLINE> Va. Executes Man Who Killed at 17  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JARRATT, Va. (AP) -- A man who killed his 70-year-old neighbor during a
robbery when he was a teen-ager was executed Thursday by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Edward Roach, 23, was the second man executed in Virginia this week
for a murder committed at age 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Roach shot Mary Ann Hughes in her home in 1993 before fleeing with her purse
and car. He had been convicted of four felonies in the seven months before the
slaying.
</P>
<P>
	   After the execution, his attorney released a statement in which Roach asked
to be remembered ``not just as the teen-ager who committed a horrible crime, but
also the adult who accepted responsibility for it and begged the forgiveness of
those he caused to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Roach wrote that he was ``unable to grasp, even to his last breath, why we
kill people to teach other people that killing is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Jim Gilmore had rejected Roach's request for clemency.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Douglas Christopher Thomas, 26, was executed for shooting his
girlfriend's parents in 1990 when he was 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Roach and Thomas had hoped to take advantage of a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling last June in which another Virginia youth was granted a new trial because
only his mother was notified of a hearing to transfer his case from juvenile
court to adult court. Virginia law at the time required notice of such hearings
go ``to the parents'' of the juvenile.

<HEADLINE> Samoa Death Sentence Commuted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- The death sentence of a man who pleaded
guilty to the assassination of a Samoan Cabinet minister has been commuted to
life in prison, sources close to the head of state said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Samoan head of state, Malietoa Tanumafili II, commuted 34-year-old
Alatise Vitale Leafa's death sentence, sources told The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Alatise Vitale will be a state prosecution witness next week when his
father, former Cabinet minister Leafa Vitale, and another former Cabinet
minister, Toi Aukusa, go to trial for the same murder -- of Public Works
Minister Luagalau Levaula Kamu. He was shot to death last July.
</P>
<P>
	   Alatise Vitale later pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to death
by hanging.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Samoa retains the death penalty, it has not been enforced since the
modern Samoan state was founded in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   Samoa is 2,300 miles southwest of Hawaii.

<HEADLINE> Jordan King Appoints New Top Aide  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMAL HALABY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan's King Abdullah II on Thursday appointed as his
top aide a confidant of his late father and a proponent of Jordan's 1994 peace
treaty with Israel, the state-run Jordan Television reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Fayez Tarawneh, 52, replaces Abdul-Karim Kabariti, who resigned last month
amid speculation of a deep rift between him and Prime Minister Abdur-Ra'uf S.
Rawabdeh.
</P>
<P>
	   The television said Abdullah, 37, issued a royal decree appointing Tarawneh
as the chief of the Royal Court, a post that has often been a stepping stone to
the prime ministership.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarawneh had earlier served as prime minister under Abdullah's father, the
late King Hussein, who died of cancer on Feb. 7. When Abdullah succeeded
Hussein, he removed Tarawneh. The move was largely seen as an attempt by
Abdullah to assert his independence rather than a reflection on Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarawneh, who led Jordan's negotiating team in peace talks with Israel for
two years ending in 1994, also served as a royal court chief under Hussein for
six months. Known for his liberal views, Tarawneh was Jordan's ambassador to the
United States in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the official Petra news agency said Prime Minister Rawabdeh would
shuffle his Cabinet on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Petra said Rawabdeh has instructed all his 23 ministers to submit their
resignations in line with a formality that allows the king, the ultimate
authority in the kingdom, to approve a new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   But government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said key
portfolios like foreign affairs, information, finance and planning are unlikely
to be changed.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks rose at midday Friday after a robust earnings
report from Intel boosted technology share prices. The U.S. dollar rose against
the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 29.76 points, or 0.16
percent, to 18,863.05 at the end of the morning trading session. On Thursday,
the average closed up 155.87 points, or 0.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. dollar was trading at 106.19 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange
market, up from 105.66 yen late Thursday and above its late New York level of
106.13.
</P>
<P>
	   In stock trading, U.S. computer chip maker Intel said fourth quarter
earnings rose 17 percent from the same period last year to $2.4 billion, sending
Sony and other Japanese technology stocks higher.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it will be a fairly positive day," said Robert Sasaki, head of
quantitative strategy group at Jardine Fleming Securities. "I think Intel will
kick up more focus on high-tech issues, or the so-called 'new Japan' stocks."
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo stocks had risen as much as 192 points in the morning session, but
pared some of the gains after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan expressed
concerns that growing imbalances between consumer demand and the supply of
available workers could derail the U.S. economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wall Street, before Greenspan's speech, the Dow Jones industrial average
rose 31.33 points on Thursday to a record 11,582.43 after a report of relatively
modest inflation calmed jittery stock investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index broke out of a two-day slump to
finish up 107.19 at 3,957.21.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section rose 0.55 points, or 0.03 percent, to 1,658.52. On Thursday, the TOPIX
rose 1.05 points, or 0.06 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, the dollar rose after U.S. sales and price data showed
that the U.S. economy is growing at a steady pace with no danger of a sharp rise
in inflation, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar earlier rose as high as 106.28, but fell back somewhat after
Greenspan said that the U.S. central bank can't afford to wait for signs of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   That raised concerns that the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee will
increase interest rates to slow the economy at its meeting in early February,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 108.82 yen, down from 108.84 yen
late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8000
percent from 1.7950 percent on Thursday. The bond's price fell 0.04 point to
100.84.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore said his
office is contacting state authorities after discovering an Alabama Klan group's
Web site declared Moore had ``earned a death sentence.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moore, perhaps best known for his role in suing the tobacco industry, has
recently helped to bring to trial several murder cases dating back to the
state's civil rights struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   A group calling itself the Alabama White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan railed
against Moore in an article on its Web site glorifying onetime Mississippi Klan
chieftain Sam Bowers. Bowers is serving a life prison term for the 1966 murder
of Vernon Dahmer, an NAACP leader and black voting rights advocate.
</P>
<P>
	   The article calls Moore ``the cynical and politically ambitious Mississippi
Attorney General'' for his prosecution of Bowers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is our opinion it is Moore who has earned the death sentence for
treason against the white race,'' the article said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore said his office is contacting Alabama authorities and may work with
federal authorities on the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to take these things seriously but, honestly, I'm not afraid of
cowards who dress up in robes,'' Moore said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Contracts Probed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Federal prosecutors are investigating city contracts that
sent more than $1 million to a company run by a family that has raised campaign
funds for Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   The city contracts were set aside for companies owned and operated by women
and minorities. But city officials say the company, Windy City Maintenance,
while owned by a woman, is no longer a woman-operated company.
</P>
<P>
	   City Corporation Counsel Mara Georges said U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar had
requested city documents pertaining to contracts awarded to Windy City
Maintenance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know the extent of the U.S. attorney's investigation,'' she said
Wednesday. ``All I know is that they are looking at it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Randall Samborn, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader, recently suggested a
federal investigation of the contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Windy City has two contracts with the city worth $500,000 each to perform
janitorial services at the police communications center and a detective
headquarters. It also subcontracted for work at O'Hare International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Daley ordered an investigation following published reports, and on Dec. 31,
the city decertified Windy City as a woman-operated company.
</P>
<P>
	   Jenny Hoyle, a spokeswoman for the corporation counsel's office, said that
while Patricia Green remained the 100 percent owner of Windy City, her son and
another man were making the day-to-day decisions.

<HEADLINE> TV Anti-Drug Messages Encouraged  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The federal government used financial incentives to
get television networks to work anti-drug messages into the scripts of some
popular TV shows. The White House drug office even got the opportunity to review
scripts before the shows aired.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement, first disclosed Wednesday by the online news service
Salon.com, raised questions about the independence of networks and their
willingness to let others influence what goes on the air.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the shows reviewed by the government were NBC's top-rated "ER," CBS's
"Chicago Hope" and "Cosby," ABC's "The Drew Carey Show" and "The Practice," and
Fox's "Beverly Hills 90210," according to Salon.com.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement stemmed from Congress' 1997 approval of a program to buy
anti-drug ads on TV. Networks were asked to match each commercial spot bought by
the government with a free one. Since the program started, however, commercial
time has become more valuable with the rising demand for ads by Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has since agreed to give up some of its ad time -- as long as
the networks demonstrate that some of their programs convey anti-drug messages,
said Rich Hamilton, CEO of Zenith Media, the ad buying firm that helped develop
the idea as a go-between for the networks and the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   This freed up advertising time that the networks could then sell to other
clients at steeper prices, Hamilton said. The White House drug office valued the
programming messages it had approved at $22 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm fairly amazed that there has been any concern expressed about this,"
Hamilton said. "It has been so above board and clearly voluntary on the part of
everyone involved."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet an expert on media ethics said it raises questions about the motives of
the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "What it can do for the networks is make it seem that they are only going to
run those messages or shows that have prior government approval," said Aly
Colon, a professor at the Poynter Institute. "That may not be reality, but at
least it can become a perception."
</P>
<P>
	   Networks submitted scripts or tapes of completed shows for the government
drug office's review, said Alan Levitt, director of the national youth media
campaign at the White House drug office. At no time did the office suggest
changes or rewrite the scripts, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "All we said was, if you believe that a certain program that you intend to
broadcast delivers our message -- essentially that drugs can kill you -- submit
it to us for an evaluation and we may decide that we can credit you for a pro
bono match," Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox said it had received financial credit for episodes of "Beverly Hills
90210" and "America's Most Wanted." They were aired in lieu of public service
announcements, but did not necessarily free up air time for Fox to sell to other
businesses, spokesman Tom Tyre said. The WB network received credit for an
episode of "7th Heaven," a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The WB said that in an episode of the "Smart Guy" series, two
substance-abusing teen-agers were originally depicted as being popular, but the
script was changed after government review to show them as "losers" hidden away
in a utility room taking drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Brad Turell said it is common for the network to ask for changes
to a script before a show is aired. Just because the government gave advice in
this instance doesn't mean the network gave up creative control, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In at least 24 instances over the past few years, networks or producers have
come to the federal drug office for advice in how to portray substance abuse
situations, Levitt said. This was independent of the deal offering financial
credit, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, producers and writers of "ER" have frequently contacted the
office. One recent storyline about a youth coming into the emergency room after
having abused alcohol was likely included after the office told producers that
alcohol is the most frequently abused drug among young people, said Donald
Vereen, deputy director of the White House drug policy office.
</P>
<P>
	   "We plead guilty to using every lawful means to saving the lives of
children," said another member of the drug office, Bob Weiner.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC has not accepted any financial credits for anti-drug messages and has
never "ceded content control of any of our programs," said Rosalyn Weinman,
executive vice president of broadcast content policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said the network submitted scripts to the drug
office, but received no financial credit because it had already used enough free
commercials. ABC does not plan to seek credit in the future, Hoover said.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Steve Dnistrian, executive vice president of the Partnership For a
Drug-Free America, which has created anti-drug commercials: "The government is
not rejecting scripts or controlling creative direction here. That's absurd. You
can't buy networks that cheap."

	   Heart Institute Rejects Keon Resignation Over Hooker Incident
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- The University of Ottawa Heart Institute wants renowned
surgeon Wilbert Keon to stay on as director and chief operating officer despite
an embarrassing arrest during a police prostitution sweep.
</P>
<P>
	   The institute's board of directors voted unanimously Thursday to reject the
resignation tendered last month by Keon and ask him to resume his duties, said
chairman Gordon Ritchie.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Support for Dr. Keon was total,'' Ritchie told a news conference, saying
none of the 15 members spoke against him at a two-hour, closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear whether Keon, who did not attend the meeting,
would heed the board's advice and withdraw his resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has asked for a few days to reflect and decide on his future,'' said
Ritchie.
</P>
<P>
	   Keon was not at his medical office Thursday and could not be reached at
home. Hospital officials said they do not expect a decision from him until next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   The famed surgeon, who also serves as a Conservative senator, resigned
shortly before Christmas after he was caught in a ``compromising situation''
with an undercover police officer posing as a prostitute.

	   Doer, Ventura To Meet on Water Diversion Plans
</P>
<P>
	   WINNIPEG (AP) -- Manitoba Premier Gary Doer is teaming up with Minnesota
Governor Jesse Ventura to battle two water diversion projects planned by North
Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   Doer called Ventura a powerful partner in the drive to protect Canadian
waters from possible contamination by the projects, and the two planned to meet
in St. Paul, Minn., Friday to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The Minnesota governor has been an outspoken opponent of the projects on
environmental grounds.
</P>
<P>
	   North Dakota wants two controversial water diversion projects built.
</P>
<P>
	   One is a modified form of the Garrison diversion project, defeated once by
Canada more than 10 years ago, which would channel water from the Missouri and
Mississippi rivers north.
</P>
<P>
	   The other is a new plan to divert water out of Devils Lake to ease flooding.
</P>
<P>
	   Manitoba is concerned about the foreign fish species and other organisms
that might be transferred into its waterways and also about the quality of the
water that will find its way north.

	   Court Says Francophones Entitled to French School
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Children of a small Francophone community in P.E.I. have won
the right to be educated in French in a decision that supports French and
English minority rights enshrined in the charter.
</P>
<P>
	   An unanimous Supreme Court of Canada decision Thursday sided with
Francophone parents in Summerside who want the province to pay for French
elementary education in the community.
</P>
<P>
	   The court reaffirmed the purpose of Section 23 of the Charter of Rights and
Freedoms, which says children of English- or French-language minority
communities have the right to have publicly funded education in their language
where the numbers warrant.
</P>
<P>
	   The law, said the court, ``mandates that provincial governments do whatever
is practically possible to preserve and promote minority language
education.''

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis will serve as state chairman of
Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign, Gore announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Helping Gore with the March 7 primary and, if he wins the Democratic

<HEADLINE> Israel, Morocco Ministers Meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- Morocco wants to raise the level of its relations with
Israel, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said Thursday after meeting his
Moroccan counterpart during a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Both countries share a ``mutual desire'' to build upon their current
low-level diplomatic relations, said Levy, adding that he doesn't know when
Morocco might be prepared to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It could be soon. I can't say how much time or how many days,'' he told
Israeli Army Radio. ``But it is certainly a mutual desire, not only ours, and it
will all be done in time and out of a determination to do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Levy met Thursday with Mohamed Benaissa, part of a visit that suggests that
Morocco is not about to forgo its discreet but important role in the Middle East
peace process -- despite the death of King Hassan II in July. The late monarch
broke Arab world taboos to hold secret talks with Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The trip is the first official Israeli visit to Morocco since Mohammed VI,
Hassan's son, came to power in July.
</P>
<P>
	   It is also a sort of emotional homecoming for Levy, who was born in Morocco.
Meeting with Andre Azoulay, an adviser to the king, he discussed the Jewish

	   Heart Institute Rejects Keon Resignation Over Hooker Incident
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- The University of Ottawa Heart Institute wants renowned
surgeon Wilbert Keon to stay on as director and chief operating officer despite
an embarrassing arrest during a police prostitution sweep.
</P>
<P>
	   The institute's board of directors voted unanimously Thursday to reject the
resignation tendered last month by Keon and ask him to resume his duties, said
chairman Gordon Ritchie.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Support for Dr. Keon was total,'' Ritchie told a news conference, saying
none of the 15 members spoke against him at a two-hour, closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear whether Keon, who did not attend the meeting,
would heed the board's advice and withdraw his resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has asked for a few days to reflect and decide on his future,'' said
Ritchie.
</P>
<P>
	   Keon was not at his medical office Thursday and could not be reached at
home. Hospital officials said they do not expect a decision from him until next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   The famed surgeon, who also serves as a Conservative senator, resigned
shortly before Christmas after he was caught in a ``compromising situation''
with an undercover police officer posing as a prostitute.

	   Doer, Ventura To Meet on Water Diversion Plans
</P>
<P>
	   WINNIPEG (AP) -- Manitoba Premier Gary Doer is teaming up with Minnesota
Governor Jesse Ventura to battle two water diversion projects planned by North
Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   Doer called Ventura a powerful partner in the drive to protect Canadian
waters from possible contamination by the projects, and the two planned to meet
in St. Paul, Minn., Friday to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The Minnesota governor has been an outspoken opponent of the projects on
environmental grounds.
</P>
<P>
	   North Dakota wants two controversial water diversion projects built.
</P>
<P>
	   One is a modified form of the Garrison diversion project, defeated once by
Canada more than 10 years ago, which would channel water from the Missouri and
Mississippi rivers north.
</P>
<P>
	   The other is a new plan to divert water out of Devils Lake to ease flooding.
</P>
<P>
	   Manitoba is concerned about the foreign fish species and other organisms
that might be transferred into its waterways and also about the quality of the
water that will find its way north.

	   Court Says Francophones Entitled to French School
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Children of a small Francophone community in P.E.I. have won
the right to be educated in French in a decision that supports French and
English minority rights enshrined in the charter.
</P>
<P>
	   An unanimous Supreme Court of Canada decision Thursday sided with
Francophone parents in Summerside who want the province to pay for French
elementary education in the community.
</P>
<P>
	   The court reaffirmed the purpose of Section 23 of the Charter of Rights and
Freedoms, which says children of English- or French-language minority
communities have the right to have publicly funded education in their language
where the numbers warrant.
</P>
<P>
	   The law, said the court, ``mandates that provincial governments do whatever
is practically possible to preserve and promote minority language
education.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts from Gonzalez Interview  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Excerpts from Chris Wallace's interview with Juan Miguel Gonzalez, father of
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, on ABC News' ``Nightline,'' as transcribed by the
network:
</P>
<P>
	   Q. Mr. Gonzalez, there is a story in the Miami Herald that says that you
don't work anymore, that you don't live in your own home and it even says that
you are under psychiatric treatment. How much of that is true, sir?
</P>
<P>
	   A. ... I will just say that all of that is a lie. I am still working. I
continue living in my home and I am under no type of psychiatric treatment.
Perhaps I might be a little bit crazy because I would feel like breaking the
neck of all those SOBs ... starting with all of those politicians in Miami and
those who, you know, have behaved in a manner that is contrary to what our
relatives should have done, they do not take into account that this is only a
6-year-old child. The problem is suffering that both the child as well as all of
his relatives here are going through simply because of political reasons and
also because of money.
</P>
<P>
	   Q. The implication of this is that you are under the control of the Cuban
government and therefore not free to speak you own mind.
</P>
<P>
	   A. ... I have been under absolutely no pressure from anybody here. I have
always said with everybody I have had interviews with, the INS, journalists,
etc., with total freedom, I have been the one who has been exerting pressure on
the government to get a response, ... and they have not sent my child back to
me.
</P>
<P>
	   Q. It has been suggested ... that the reason you do not come to Miami is
because the Cuban government is afraid once you get to Miami, you will defect.
</P>
<P>
	   A. Who said that? ... People think, or some people think, that I am under
pressure here. I have always said I haven't lost anything in Miami, and
sometimes what I would like to do is go down there with a rifle -- I don't know
-- to get rid of how many people. ... And what about -- isn't it inflammatory
what they are doing with my son? ... I think the main thing is to send my child
back to me as soon as possible ... It's almost -- been almost two months that I
haven't seen my son, that he's away from me, and this has been always my main
interest.
</P>
<P>
	   A. Do you see the pictures of him from Miami, for instance waving the
congressional subpoena and giving the ``V'' for victory sign?
</P>
<P>
	   A. ... This is child abuse. He is being made to do things against his will
because if he were able to say or to defend Fidel (Castro), he would do it. ...
He told me over the phone that he is dreaming about coming back to me to be with
him, to be with me, and they are manipulating what he is saying and saying
things that are untrue. ... I would like to express my gratitude to Janet Reno,
the attorney general, and I would like to ask her please to do whatever is
possible for them to send my son back to me.''

    DETROIT (AP) -- Twelve black employees are suing Home Depot Inc. for $120
million, alleging racial discrimination at a store in suburban Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court alleges a five-year pattern of
denying raises, training and promotions to black employees at one of the

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an interview tonight with ABC's "Nightline" the father
of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez said he feels like "breaking the neck" of

that he has no intention of coming to Miami to pick up the boy, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez told ABC's "Nightline" that Elian's U.S. relatives don't "have any

living rhesus monkey, a female named Tetra, but Professor Gerald Schatten said
that four more twinned infants are on the way. Schatten, a researcher at the
Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, said the goal is to produce
identical monkeys that could be used to perfect new therapies for human disease.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Avoids Possible Walkout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. and the union representing its engineers and
technical workers reached a tentative contract agreement Thursday, narrowly
avoiding a proposed walkout that had been set for Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   After both sides met for nearly seven hours, the union won concessions on
four of five major issues, said Charles Bofferding, executive director of the
Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
	   "The membership solidarity and dedication prompted The Boeing Co. to make
significant changes in the contract," Bofferding said in a release. An earlier
offer contact offer was rejected Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   "We held the line on benefits, we protected the weekends and we reduced the
length of the contract from four to three years."
</P>
<P>
	   The revised offer still needs to be approved by the SPEEA membership. Voting
could begin as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing hailed the offer as one worthy of SPEEA members' full consideration.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is one of the fairest packages offered to any bargaining unit in the
country," Geoff Stamper, Boeing's director of union relations and chief
negotiator in the talks, said in a release.
</P>
<P>
	   The offer did not include a guaranteed general wage increase for the
engineers, but the union did win total increases of 8 percent the first year,
4.5 percent the second year, and 4.5 percent the final year to the pools of
money available for engineer wage increases, SPEEA said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pools of money available for technical employees wage increases are 5.5
percent, 4.5 percent and 4.5 percent, with 3 percent guaranteed in the first
year and 2 percent guaranteed in the final year.
</P>
<P>
	   The new offer also includes a reduction in the contract length from four to
three years.
</P>
<P>
	   SPEEA represents nearly 23,000 scientists, engineers, computer programmers,
manual writers and other technical workers in the Puget Sound region, Spokane
and Portland, Ore. Included are more than 13,000 dues-paying union members.
</P>
<P>
	   The 50-year-old union, the second largest at Boeing behind the machinists,
has never had a full-scale strike.

<HEADLINE> Disney Animation Pioneer Davis Dies  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GLENDALE, Calif. (AP) -- Cartoonist Marc Davis, one of the ``nine old men''
who made up the core of Walt Disney's crack animation staff and the lead
designer of Tinker Bell, Bambi and Cruella De Vil, has died. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis died Wednesday at Glendale Memorial Hospital in suburban Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   He had been one of four surviving members of the key animators Walt Disney
assembled to work on his studio's cartoon features beginning with ``Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs'' in 1937.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis and his colleagues were dubbed the ``nine old men'' by Disney, who
compared them to Franklin Roosevelt's Supreme Court appointees, said Ollie
Johnston, another of the nine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Walt said, 'Hey, I've got my nine guys, and they're all over the hill,
too,' even though we were only in our 30s and 40s,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis was the best artist of the bunch, Johnston said. ``The others were
excellent draftsmen, but Marc had the ability to take things and make them into
fine art,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis attended art schools in Kansas City, San Francisco and Los Angeles
before becoming an apprentice animator for Disney in 1935. He was an assistant
animator on ``Snow White,'' then took the lead on developing the animals for
``Bambi,'' including the title character and Thumper.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis became something of a specialist on designing female characters,
including Alice for ``Alice in Wonderland,'' Tinker Bell for ``Peter Pan,''
Briar Rose, the princess from ``Sleeping Beauty,'' and two classic villainesses,
Maleficent from ``Sleeping Beauty'' and Cruella from ''101 Dalmatians.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, he designed concepts and characters for such Disney theme-park
attractions as ``Pirates of the Caribbean,'' ``It's a Small World'' and ``Jungle
Cruise.''
</P>
<P>
	   He retired in 1978 but remained a design consultant for Disney theme parks.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis is survived by his wife, Alice. No funeral service was planned.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Rebels Renew Cease-Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Rebels on Thursday renewed a three-month humanitarian
cease-fire in war-torn areas of southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   The new cease-fire will take effect Saturday when the current one expires,
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The SPLA was renewing the cease-fire due to the ``prevailing hunger induced
by the combination of war and natural causes such as alternating drought and
floods,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cease-fire covers western Bahr el Ghazal, where fighting has been halted
for more than a year on humanitarian grounds, and also in the Western Upper Nile
and Central Upper Nile regions of southern Sudan, where government troops have
been fighting rebel forces, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels in the predominantly Christian and animist south want increased
autonomy and development in their region, which has been traditionally neglected
under the government in the Muslim and Arab north.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 2 million people have been killed since the civil war began in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns About Imbalances  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans, enjoying the most prosperous times in a
generation, have fueled a remarkable economic boom, but there are dangers that
growing imbalances could derail the economic expansion, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to the Economic Club of New York, Greenspan expressed an upbeat
assessment of the economy's current performance, noting that next month it will
become the longest expansion in U.S. history, surpassing the 106 months of
uninterrupted growth in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   "There can be little argument that the American economy as it stands at the
beginning of a new century has never exhibited so remarkable a prosperity for at
least the majority of its citizens," Greenspan said in the speech, copies of
which were released in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Greenspan also repeated worries he has voiced before that the
Federal Reserve must be alert to the growing imbalances between continued strong
consumer demand, bolstered by Americans' soaring stock portfolios, and the
dwindling supply of available workers, given that unemployment is now at a
30-year low.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to concerns about rising inflation pressures, Greenspan also
repeated concerns he has expressed in the past that the huge runup in stock
prices could without warning reverse itself.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates three times in the past six
months in an effort to slow the economy and relieve pressures on tight labor
markets before they trigger inflationary wage demands.
</P>
<P>
	   While it is widely expected that the Fed will raise rates when they meet
again on Feb. 1-2, Greenspan did not specifically address that issue, saying
only that the central bank is always forced to make interest-rate decisions
based on incomplete evidence of where the economy is headed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Regrettably, we at the Federal Reserve do not have the luxury of awaiting a
better set of insights into this process," Greenspan said in the speech.
"Indeed, our goal, in responding to the complexity of current economic forces,
is to extend the expansion by containing its imbalances."
</P>
<P>
	   David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. who was in the audience
for Greenspan's speech, said the Fed chairman left little doubt that the central
bank will raise rates again at the February meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan continues to be worried that consumer spending and demand are
greater than potential supply and that is exerting additional pressures on the
labor market," Jones said.
</P>
<P>
	   During the question-and-answer session following his speech, Greenspan said
that before the Feb. 1-2 meeting the central bank would release guidelines to
help the public and financial markets better interpret its new policy of
announcing changes in its policy directives, which are intended to signal future
Fed moves.
</P>
<P>
	   In all of his comments, Greenspan was careful to balance his worries about
the future with expressions that some fundamentally beneficial changes are
occurring in the economy that have given a strong boost to U.S. productivity.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said that when economists look back at the current period a decade
from now, they may well conclude "at the turn of the millennium, the American
economy was experiencing a once-in-a-century acceleration of innovation which
propelled forward productivity, output, corporate profits and stock prices at a
pace not seen in generations, if ever."
</P>
<P>
	   But Greenspan also said there could be an alternative view of the current
period when viewed in a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   "Alternatively, that 2010 retrospective might well conclude that a good deal
of what we are currently experiencing was just one of the many euphoric
speculative bubbles that have dotted human history."
</P>
<P>
	   That comment echoed Greenspan's famous worry, voiced in December 1996, that
investors might be in the grip of "irrational exuberance." At the time, the Dow
Jones industrial average was trading around 6,400.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite worries expressed since that time by Greenspan about market
valuations, the Dow closed on Thursday at a new record of 11,582.43.
</P>
<P>
	   In his Thursday speech, Greenspan said that the boom in stock prices, by
bolstering consumer spending, has probably added around 1 percentage point
annually to economic growth since 1996. The economy during this period has been
growing at annual rates of around 4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Use Money for Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- Sharpening their disagreement over tax cuts, George
W. Bush suggested Thursday that John McCain's proposal would leave too much
money for Congress to spend on ``bigger government,'' and McCain countered that
the Republican presidential front-runner's plan could lead to higher payroll
taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I must confess I am skeptical of appropriators,'' Bush said, referring to
members of the House and Senate committees that write multibillion-dollar
spending bills annually.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Somehow I have trouble believing that they're going to necessarily spend
it on debt reduction,'' the Texas governor said of the surplus funds that would
be left after McCain's tax cut took effect. ``I worry they may spend it on
bigger government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's tax cut, $483 billion over five years, would leave the Social
Security surplus alone, but spend from non-Social Security surplus funds.
McCain, in a written statement, said that wasn't enough, that a larger amount of
non-Social Security surplus funds must be set aside to make sure the retirement
program is protected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By not shoring up the Social Security system now with surplus funds we
are, by fiat, agreeing to raise payroll taxes in the future,'' added McCain,
whose own plan is roughly half the size of Bush's. I have called this kind of
economics ``fiscally irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was defending his plan in a new 30-second ad beginning Thursday night
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   And in comments later to reporters, McCain said that his was a conservative
approach. ``I think it's conservative to pay down the debt and save Social
Security'' and shore up Medicare, as well as cutting taxes, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men never crossed paths during the day as they made their campaign
rounds a little more than two weeks in advance of the nation's first
presidential primary, set for Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   But their cross-state sparring underscored the extent to which the campaign
is settling into a disagreement over tax cuts, an issue that has divided
Republicans for the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Two new public opinion polls released during the day pointed to a close race
in New Hampshire between the two Sun Belt political figures, but disagreed on
which man held the lead. One survey said it was Bush, the Texas governor who is
the national front-runner by far. The other said it was McCain, running an
insurgent's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush did not mention that Republicans hold a majority in Congress, and he
made no other comments during the day that implied criticism of the
congressional wing of his party.
</P>
<P>
	   He made his remarks midway through a full day of campaigning that took him
from a high tech factory in Laconia to a lunchtime speech in this coastal city
to a town hall meeting in Londonderry before flying off to Iowa, which holds
caucuses eight days before New Hampshire votes.
</P>
<P>
	   During the town hall meeting, Bush bristled at the suggestion from someone
in the crowd that he had a ``drug past.'' The Texas governor has refused to
directly answer questions about whether he has used illegal drugs, except to say
he has not since 1974.
</P>
<P>
	   A man who said he was Sanho Tree of the Institute for Policy Studies, a
Washington think tank, asked the governor for his perspective on the war on
drugs ``from your own drug past.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sir, sit down please,'' Bush said. ``You're making an assumption about me
that you have -- you really don't know what you're talking about. I don't accept
that assumption.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush told the man that ``what you need to know about is, should I swear in,
I'm going to bring honor and dignity to the office.'' He added, ``You shouldn't
fall prey to rumors and gossip.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is campaigning as the outsider in the race, and he told reporters
during the day one of the key issues will be ``executive experience'' versus
``Washington legislative experience,'' an obvious reference to McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the Republican establishment's embrace was evident during
the day. Judd Gregg, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Rep.
Charles Bass spent part of the day with Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has repeatedly accused Bush of advocating a tax cut that is too large
and risks harm to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   In remarks before a Rotary Club and afterward to reporters, the front-runner
seemed eager to keep the argument alive.
</P>
<P>
	   He lumped McCain and Vice President Al Gore together as the only ``two
voices'' in the campaign to say his own tax cut was too bold.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, McCain accuses Bush of providing overly generous relief
for the wealthy, echoing criticisms that Democrats frequently level at GOP tax
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor took that issue head-on at several points during the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's fair to cut the taxes on everybody if you're going to cut taxes at
all,'' he said to the Rotarians. At a news conference afterward, he re-enforced
his plan to cut the top tax rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said his plan would stimulate the economy as well as return money to
the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the money lies around the halls of Washington it's going to be spent,''
he said at one point. ``Appropriators appropriate,'' he said at another.

<HEADLINE> Bush Campaigning for Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC, Iowa (AP) -- Former President Bush campaigned for his son the
front-runner on Thursday, telling Iowa Republicans that George W. learned at his
side and would ``be excellent at doing what I tried to do'' to unite Americans
at home and allies abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the former president's first vote-hunting mission of the 2000
presidential campaign, in territory where he both won and lost as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Father, like son, talked about Barbara Bush, and joked that he was tired of
always being asked where she was. ``I used to be president, you know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She's working her heart out for our son,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   While helping the son, Bush said, ``I will have nothing bad to say against
any of the people that he is campaigning against right now.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, he said that when he left the White House he vowed not even to
criticize President Clinton, the man who beat him in 1992. He said it would have
been ``sort of sour grapes, bad loser.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, he did slip in a taunting reminder of the sex scandal that led to
Clinton's impeachment, saying that the Jenny Craig diet people had called to ask
him whether he wanted to lose 30 pounds. Monica Lewinsky said she did, and has
signed on as a representative of the organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's speech to an overflow crowd of more than 500 people at the Atlantic
High School auditorium was generally low key. He said he spoke on the basis of
his experience as a president and as a father.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in Des Moines, Bush addressed nearly 1,400 people at an annual
Chamber of Commerce dinner, ``a nonpolitical event at a highly politicized time
of the year in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he'd respect the bipartisan ground rules. ``Though I might be
tempted to utter a few words of encouragement to anyone who is considering
supporting my boy,'' he said, ``I will heed the immortal words of Dana Carvey.
'Not gonna do it. Wouldn't be prudent.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Carvey is the comic who used those lines in Bush parodies. ``A lot of guys
don't miss me in Washington, but there's one guy who does,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. Bush leads the public opinion polls in Iowa by margins of 25
points and more over Steve Forbes in preferences for the Jan. 24 caucuses that
will begin the 2000 voting. Sen. John McCain, Bush's closest challenger
nationally, is not competing in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can tell you in Iowa organization counts,''' the former president told
reporters. ``I came in here as asterisk ... but I won.'' That was in 1980, when
he upset Ronald Reagan in Iowa. Then Bush said, ``I got dusted by Reagan in New
Hampshire.'' Nominated, Reagan made Bush his vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight years later, Bush was the upset victim, running third in Iowa but
winning the White House anyhow.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said George W. was with him in four national campaigns, learning in the
process. ``You know presidential politics is not very pleasant, it's not very
civil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He knows it's tough,'' Bush said. ``He's seasoned enough to take criticism
and seasoned enough not to make mistakes when somebody writes something personal
about you.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the American people are tired of divisiveness,'' Bush said. ``I
think George has demonstrated an ability to bring people together.'' He said his
son had done that better than other Republicans, including ``certainly, his
Dad.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush recalled the fall of the Berlin Wall, the disintegration of the old
Soviet Union, the Persian Gulf War, all during his one term as president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All around that four-year period George was at my side during a lot of
this,'' he said. ``I think he'd be excellent at doing what I tried to do as
president in building coalitions.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't do it alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'd better get somebody who's knowledgeable enough and concerned enough
to get good people around him to be able to cope with problems and work with
others, build coalitions. ...''
</P>
<P>
	   So, he said, ``without criticizing anybody else ... I would simply suggest
that if you take a look at Texas, our candidate did what he said he would do ...
kept his word.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he hopes uncommitted Iowa Republicans will recognize that when
they vote in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Then he reminisced, wryly, about his own defeat in 1992. He said Clinton
made the economy a winning issue, even though the Republican administration
``handed him an economy that was doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I wasn't clear about that,'' he said. ``People wanted change, change,
change, and people want change today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And I think that my son has the opportunity to represent change.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has appeared at private fund-raising receptions for George W., but the
Iowa outing, in Atlantic and later at a Des Moines dinner, was his first
outright campaigning. ``He'll be on the road more for his son,'' said Karl Rove,
political director of the Bush campaign.

<HEADLINE> No. 17 Ohio St. 53, Wisconsin 51  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Ken Johnson had 13 points, 14 rebounds and a
career-high six blocked shots as No. 17 Ohio State won its first road game of
the season, beating Wisconsin 53-51 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Scoonie Penn's driving layup with 1:09 left turned out to be the
game-winner, but Ohio State had to survive two missed 3-pointers by the Badgers
in the closing moments, including Kirk Penney's airball with two seconds to
play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Buckeyes forced four turnovers and held Wisconsin to four points over
the game's final 5:32. Johnson was the focal point on defense, limiting the
Badgers' inside game with four second-half blocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Wisconsin beat the first three ranked teams that came into the Kohl Center
this season. But unlike Texas, Temple and Illinois before them, the Buckeyes
(10-3, 2-1 Big Ten) didn't wilt under the Badgers' trademark defensive pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   Penn and Michael Redd each had 14 points for the Buckeyes in a matchup of
the Big Ten's best defensive teams. Mark Vershaw led the Badgers' struggling
offense with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Ohio State was criticized for loading its schedule with eight preseason home
games against weak opponents. After losing their only previous road games at
Kansas and Illinois, the Buckeyes outlasted Wisconsin (9-6, 1-2).
</P>
<P>
	   Corey Koskie's layup with 2:17 to play put Wisconsin up 51-49, but Johnson
rebounded Penn's miss and scored. After Roy Boone missed a wide-open 3-pointer
for Wisconsin, Penn drove the baseline and hit a layup to give Ohio State a
two-point lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Wisconsin then turned the ball over, but Penn missed a jumper with 10
seconds to play. The Badgers got the ball to Penney, who faked a drive and shot
a 3-pointer that was well short of the rim. Koskie's tip attempt at the buzzer
also missed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Badgers led most of the game and had a 28-25 halftime lead, but they
missed 12 of their first 15 shots to start the second half. Ohio State's star
guard tandem of Penn and Redd continued its shooting slump, going a combined
5-of-17 in the first half before recovering to hit big shots in the second.

to unravel the secrets of enzyme function.
</P>
<P>

    FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- LSU coach Sue Gunter won her 600th game Thursday
night as DeTrina White had 27 points and 12 rebounds in the 17th-ranked Tigers'
82-69 victory over Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
	   Gunter, who has a 600-269 record in 36 seasons, is the fourth coach to reach
600 victories in the women's game, after Texas' Jody Conradt, Tennessee's Pat
Summitt and Rutgers' Vivian Stringer.
</P>
<P>
	   LSU (12-3, 3-1 Southeastern Conference) led throughout the first half, but
Arkansas (9-5, 0-2) halved a 12-point deficit by halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just glad to have this 600th win and have it over with," Gunter said.
"I was more worried about getting win No. 12 for the season and win No. 3 in SEC
play than 600. The game has been very gracious to me, and I'm very thankful for
what the game has given me."
</P>
<P>
	   LSU held a 10-point lead with 10:37 to play, but the Lady Tigers couldn't
shake Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lady Razorbacks took a 67-66 lead on a jumper by Brandi Whitehead with
4:32 to play. Arkansas' Wendi Willits hit a 16-footer at the 3:54 mark for a
69-68 lead, but LSU then held the Lady Razorbacks without a point the rest of
the way, finishing with a 13-0 run.

    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Mark Messier scored with 1:31 left in overtime and
Garth Snow made 48 saves to lead the Vancouver Canucks to a 4-3 victory over the
Nashville Predators on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow, pulled briefly in the first period after giving up two goals on the
first seven shots, stopped all 20 in the third period and overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Messier connected from the right circle on a snap-wrister for his 616th
career goal, giving the Canucks just their fourth win in 22 games and ending
Nashville's club-record home unbeaten streak at six.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver's Donald Brashear tied it 3-3 at 5:42 of the third from the right
circle.
</P>
<P>
	   The Predators missed a good scoring chance when Snow robbed Ville Peltonen
with a glove save with 6:37 left in regulation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Azinger Takes Sony First-Round Lead  </HEADLINE>
    By GORDON SAKAMOTO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONOLULU (AP) -- Paul Azinger, still trying to recover from the tragic
deaths of close friend Payne Stewart and two associates, shot a 7-under-par 63
Thursday for a three-stroke lead over seven players after the first round of the
Sony Open.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting on the back nine of the 7,060-yard Waialae Country Club course,
Azinger birdied three of the four par-4s and then used a 7-wood and a 3-wood on
the longest hole on the oceanside course, the 551-yard 18th, to get within three
feet to set up an eagle to make the turn at 5-under 30.
</P>
<P>
	   On the back nine, he had a birdie on No. 5 to complete his bogey-free round.
</P>
<P>
	   Azinger's closest pursuers at 4-under 66 included Jim Furyk, who won this
tournament in 1996 when it was known as the Hawaiian Open; John Cook, another
Hawaiian Open titleist; Stuart Appleby and 1999 qualifying school graduate Ben
Bates.
</P>
<P>
	   Afternoon starters John Huston, who set the PGA Tour record of 26-under in
winning the final Hawaiian Open two years ago, Vijay Singh and Fred Funk also
checked in with 66s.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Sluman, the defending tournament champion; Ernie Els, who lost a
two-hole playoff to Tiger Woods in last week's Mercedes Championships; Shigeki
Maruyama, No. 3 on the Japan PGA Tour money list; Fred Kelly and Esteban Toledo
were grouped at 67.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan PGA Tour player David Ishii, who won the Hawaiian Open in 1990, was at
68 and Corey Pavin, who won Hawaiian Opens in 1996 and 1997, was grouped with 17
others at 70.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had a pretty tough offseason," said Azinger, who himself faced adversity
when he was stricken with lymphoma in his right shoulder in 1993. "I didn't play
for awhile and just wanted to make sure I would come back focused.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Trade Surplus Lower in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's trade surplus shrank by a third from the previous
year to $29.1 billion in 1999, according to revised customs figures reported
Friday by state-run media.
</P>
<P>
	   The total is slightly less than the $30 billion estimate given by the
National Bureau of Statistics late last year, and a 33.3 percent decline from
the $43.6 billion surplus recorded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Exports rose 6.1 percent last year to $194.9 billion, while imports soared
18.2 percent to $165.8 billion, the official China Daily newspaper reported the
revised statistics as showing.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Bureau of Statistics had reported 1999 imports at $165 billion
and exports at $195 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   More than three quarters of last year's total trade surplus came from a
$22.5 billion trade gap with the United States, according to a separate report
in the International Business Daily, which is published by China's foreign trade
ministry.
</P>
<P>
	   That figure is 7.1 percent higher than the $21 billion trade surplus with
the United States that China reported for 1998, which means growth in the gap
has tapered off from the 28 percent jump in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Exports to the United States totaled $42.0 billion in 1999, the paper
reported, up 10.6 percent from the $37.98 billion in U.S. exports China recorded
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Imports from the United States reached $19.5 billion in 1999, 15.0 percent
higher than in 1998.
