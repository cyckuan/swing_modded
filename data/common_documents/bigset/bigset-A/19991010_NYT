<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Standing before 3,000 Iowa Democrats and the
man who is blocking his path to the Democratic presidential
nomination, Vice President Al Gore Saturday night challenged former
Sen. Bill Bradley to an immediate series of debates.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic appeal before an important partisan crowd in this
battleground state, Gore offered himself as a feisty underdog and
gestured toward his rival in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened carefully, Bill, to what you had to say about
making this campaign a different kind of experience and lifting up
our democracy,'' Gore said. ``I really agree with that. I think we
have a chance to do exactly that. But you know the best way to do
that is to have regular debates on the issues. Let's have one every
week. What about it? Let's have a debate on agriculture in Iowa
right now. What about it, Bill? If the answer is yes, stand up and
wave your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not wave his hand. The candidate's aides have said
he would definitely debate Gore this year. But they have not agreed
to the challenge of frequent debates.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Bradley, riding a wave of positive publicity and
poll numbers, portrayed himself as the candidate of the high road
and called on Gore to run a positive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes discipline to be positive,'' Bradley said. ``I
believe that _ to the deepest core of my being the American people
want that.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing together in the same ballroom for the first time in
the 2000 campaign, Gore and Bradley drew ebullient responses from
Democrats from across Iowa, which will hold the first presidential
caucuses in late January.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' appearances were carefully choreographed so they
were sure to get equal billing. Behind the left side of the stage,
a banner declared, ``Iowa Loves Bill Bradley.'' Behind the right
side, a banner of similar size proclaimed, ``Al &AMP; Tipper Gore.
Change That Works For Working Families.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore made back-to-back appearances before the
Democratic National Committee in Washington two weeks ago, but
neither was present for the other's speech.
</P>
<P>
   As they mingled with participants during the dinner, the two men
_ former colleagues in the Senate _ shook hands for the first time
in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   They smiled broadly as Bradley tapped Gore gently on the
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Iowa,'' Gore said. ``Best to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Gore drew his sharpest contrasts yet with
Bradley, casting his rival as one who went along with the Reagan
budget cuts and fled Washington after Newt Gingrich and the
Republicans took over the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bradley cast Gore as a captive of the
establishment and the entrenched powers of the party and the Vice
Presidency.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During a campaign walk through neighborhood streets, Gore
portrayed Bradley as a disloyal Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The 1981 budget vote, Gore said, was ``the single most defining
vote for the Democrats in the last 20 years,'' and the
determination to counter Gingrich was second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of us was called upon to fight against it with everything
we had or not, and he did not,'' Gore said of Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates so far plan a joint appearance at a town-hall
meeting in New Hampshire on Oct. 27, and a debate on Jan. 8 in Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
   The event here was particularly important because Iowa _ which
is scheduled to have the first presidential caucuses on Jan. 31 but
may move the date up by a week _ is shaping up as a crucial
battleground.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has cultivated Democrats in Iowa for years, and has the
aggressive support of the party establishment, including Sen. Tom
Harkin and Christie Vilsack, the wife of Gov. Tom Vilsack, who is
neutral. Gore is leading in the polls, but the surveys also show
that Bradley has been gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for both candidates to leave a good
impression,'' said Rob Tully, the chairman of the Iowa Democratic
Party, ``because this particular campaign, I think, is still fluid
enough that either candidate can leave themselves open to criticism
after the dinner's over in terms of how they may have addressed
each other in terms of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Tully said that this was the best attended Jefferson-Jackson Day
dinner in Iowa history _ and that both campaigns had asked that
their candidates not sit at the head table but mingle in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Offstage, the Bradley campaign responded to Gore's barbs.
``There is a quote from Robert E. Lee,'' said Anita Dunn, Bradley's
communications director. ``When you're too weak to defend, you must
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the vice president was a product of the Washington
establishment and still enmeshed in vice presidential trappings _
trappings that Gore is trying to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that we are up against an entrenched
power.'' Bradley said. ``When a candidate has the president of the
United States standing by his side, loyally, as he has stood by his
side, and he has the Democratic National Committee, most of the
large Democratic fund-raisers, arrives in Air Force II, and is
ahead by 15 points nationally, well, that's entrenched power. All I
have is the people.''

O'NEILL'S RIBS NOT FEELING ANY BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Paul O'Neill, the Yankees' right fielder, was
out of the starting lineup for Game 3 Saturday night because of
bruised ribs, and he feels he will be out indefinitely unless he
improves quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't get any better, I might be out for awhile,''
O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill tried a deep knee bend Saturday as his teammates
stretched for batting practice, his torso upright, and his pain was
betrayed by a grimace. ``I really felt it today,'' O'Neill said
later. ``I came out to try to stretch, and I'm really feeling it.
We'll have to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre indicated that if his team had been
playing a decisive game Saturday night, then O'Neill probably would
have been in the lineup. But that clearly wasn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee stood in right field during batting practice,
chatting with O'Neill while the veteran stuck his left hand below
his shirt and felt his chest. Ledee may have been asking O'Neill
for pointers in playing the position: Ledee played only seven
innings in right field this season, over three games, and had just
17 innings in right in 1998. ``It's not a big difference from left
to right,'' Ledee said.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neill sat out games this year, Shane Spencer usually
played right field, but the Yankees chose to keep the utility man
Clay Bellinger on their 25-man roster for the playoffs, rather than
Spencer, and with O'Neill sidelined, the team is short on
outfielders. Darryl Strawberry has played the outfield most of his
career but has not played there since rejoining the Yankees in
September. Designated hitter Chili Davis hasn't played in the field
in the latter half of this decade, and Bellinger has been an
infielder most of his career.
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neill ailing, there is a strong chance the Yankees will
reconsider the option of adding Spencer to their roster before the
next round of playoffs begins Wednesday, with the Yankees playing
either Cleveland or Boston.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill was injured while playing the Devil Rays on Oct. 2. With
David Cone's 12th victory on the line, O'Neill ran hard after a
foul ball, bounced against the wall, spun and slammed the right
side of his torso against the top of the fence. O'Neill left the
game immediately, holding his right side, and after taking some
batting practice last Monday, he played in Game 1 and Game 2 of the
division series in New York, going 2 for 8.
</P>
<P>
   But he had to come out of the first game for a defensive
replacement in the ninth inning, and he thinks he aggravated the
bruise while running in the outfield in Game 2. His pain is located
in his two lowest ribs, and Torre said it is probably the type of
injury that won't improve until O'Neill is fully rested in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The bruise bothers O'Neill when he runs, and hurts most when he
throws.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill usually bats third, but Saturday night Bernie Williams
batted third, Tino Martinez fourth, Strawberry fifth and Ledee
sixth.

USC STOPPED COLD BY ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ There was finger-pointing. Expressions of
befuddlement. Answers bordering on alarmist.
</P>
<P>
   And these were the least disconcerting things that happened to
USC on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the oppressive 95-degree temperature at Arizona Stadium, USC
suffered a complete meltdown that ominously looked like something
capable of lasting a lot longer than one game.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 22-ranked Trojans lost to Arizona 31-24 before 51,418.
But the final score was the only statistic that failed to reflect
the game's lopsided nature.
</P>
<P>
   USC (3-2, 1-2) rushed for minus-20 yards, the second-lowest
total in school history. This is particularly troubling when you
consider Arizona's defense was ranked 10th against the run in the
Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (4-2, 2-1) amassed 550 yards offense, and its previously
porous defense limited USC to 271 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' defense, which gave up 334 yards rushing in its
first four games, allowed the Wildcats 307.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't really about the defense. It had a partial
excuse for its shortcomings, since it was forced to stay on the
field for more than 35 minutes, while USC's nonexistent offense
played less than 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense was horrendous,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
``(Arizona) completely shut down the run. We didn't block anything.
The offense has to take some responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember the finger-pointing? It came from an unlikely source.
</P>
<P>
   USC trailed 24-17, with barely two minutes left. The Trojans had
a fourth-and-3 at their own 35-yard line. But before a play could
be run, quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst fumbled the snap, Arizona
cornerback Kelvin Hunter recovered and went 24 yards for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fumble is inexcusable,'' Hackett said. ``That was the
turning point of the game. I had no doubt we would convert there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett wasn't done assigning blame. USC got the ball back and
scored a touchdown with only 28 seconds left when Van Raaphorst
found Marcell Allmond in the end zone to cut the lead to 31-24.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans tried an on-sides kick, but David Bell's effort
bounced out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was inexcusable,'' Hackett said. ``That's shoddy special
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were more reluctant to say it but couldn't completely
mask the Trojans' biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in the way we played defense, but you have to
throw some blame to the offense,'' free safety David Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's things you want to go and say,'' linebacker Zeke
Moreno said. ``It's to the point where you don't want to sit there.
Tell me what to do. I'll go block somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to do something. Maybe even call plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm, there's an interesting suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   The expressions of befuddlement? Asked what the offense could do
to avoid future embarrassment, Van Raaphorst said, ``I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Chad Morton added: ``I really have no idea. I never
thought my senior year would be like this.''
</P>
<P>
   They sounded almost exactly like wide receiver R. Jay Soward,
who tried to figure out the offensive woes, despite suffering a
likely concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were confused,'' Soward said. ``I really can't call it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarmist answers? Here's one of many.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a major crossroads right now,'' Gibson said. ``It
will be easy for guys to go into the tank.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost amazingly, the Trojans held a 17-10 advantage early in
the third quarter even with so many deficiencies. Wide receiver
Windrell Hayes (nine catches, 115 yards) caught an 18-yard pass
from Van Raaphorst, and the Trojans went ahead for about 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought when we went ahead 17-10, it would be a momentum
changer,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona struck back on a 17-yard pass from Keith Smith to Dennis
Northcutt and took the lead in the fourth quarter when Trung
Canidate (194 yards) scored on an 11-yard run to give the Wildcats
a 24-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans never recovered. Van Raaphorst was intercepted on
the next series, USC went three-and-out and then the all-important
fumbled snap decided the game, according to Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a motivational game. It's a big setback,'' Gibson
said. ``Some guys might say, `We can't go to the Rose Bowl, who
cares?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Someone who does care is athletic director Mike Garrett. Outside
the stadium, before heading back to Los Angeles, he had a succinct
response to the day's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play very well.''

SMITH STANDS OUT FOR ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Keith Smith, who is half of Arizona's
quarterback combo, insisted Saturday afternoon that he still shares
the position with Ortege Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Forget, Smith says, that he was the one who took 70 snaps and
Jenkins only six in Arizona's 31-24 victory over visiting USC. And,
never mind, Smith pleads, that he completed 15 of 23 passes for 243
yards and a touchdown and rushed for another 87 yards, including a
57-yard scoring run in the first quarter, while Jenkins' totals
were one incomplete pass and minus-7 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   It is, according to Smith, still both quarterbacks' job to
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no guy,'' said Smith. ``I think (offensive
coordinator Dino Babers) just went with the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona coach Dick Tomey wouldn't bite when asked if the flow
would last past Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a credit to all of our guys,'' Tomey said. ``Keith
played well and O.J. was doing everything he could to help us
win.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Smith didn't need any help _ at least not from
Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was this my best game?,'' Smith said. ``Cal my freshman year
(when he set an NCAA freshman record with 502 yards of total
offense) was pretty hard to beat. But we didn't get the win that
day. So, yeah, it may have been.''
</P>
<P>
   He completed 7 of 12 passes for 102 yards in the first half, but
it was his running that made the difference, going 57 yards
untouched with 10:20 left in the first half to give the Wildcats a
7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when we called that play I was going to take it to the
house,'' Smith said. ``The field was so wide open I couldn't
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Wildcats fell behind 17-10 in the third quarter, Smith
went to work on an eight-play, 65-yard drive that was extended
twice on third down by completions of 21 yards to Dennis Northcutt
and 9 yards to Bobby Wade. Smith also showed excellent touch on a
sideline completion to tight end Brandon Manumaleuna and the
17-yard touchdown pass on a fade pattern run by Northcutt.
</P>
<P>
   The go-ahead touchdown came on a 11-yard run by Trung Canidate,
but it was completions of 44 yards to Palmdale High graduate Malosi
Leonard and 16 yards to Northcutt that set up the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith was just on (Saturday),'' Northcutt said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a reason for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that there are a lot of guys on this team from
California who didn't get recruited by (USC) makes it more
special,'' said Smith. ``I wasn't even offered a trip there when I
was in high school. It makes you want to play extra tough. You
could just feel it when we got off the bus and went into the locker
room. Whenever we play USC, it seems like the legs get stronger and
you get faster.''

RANGERS' OFFENSIVE FUTILITY DEFIES A SIMPLE EXPLANATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAYX 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ A hundred years from now, future baseball
historians will stumble across this statistical Titanic,
immediately register doubt, and then order extensive research.
</P>
<P>
   No way, they will say. The record books are out of whack, they
will think. It couldn't have been that bad. Not for a club good
enough to be in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Computerized double-checks will be ordered. Old box scores from
late in the 20th century will be revisited. Grainy video from NBC
and Fox will be watched,inning by inning. Consider for a second,
the boredom involved in that assignment.
</P>
<P>
   But once all the facts and figures have been gathered, the
historians will then rest easy. The truth will be known. There was
no mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' batting order of 1999 will live forever in baseball
infamy, outdone in futility, just barely, by the Rangers' batting
order of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 0-for-October Gang'' became a discredit to their
profession, but for what it is worth, which is exactly nothing, a
permanent fixture in baseball record books.
</P>
<P>
   No postseason team has ever come close to displaying this kind
of rotten wood, and just think, the Rangers did it back to back.
It's difficult to believe, even in another 100 years, that it could
happen again. Unless, of course, the Rangers have a first-round
matchup in October 2000 against the same ol' Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   In the broom-kill last night at The Ballpark in Arlington, New
York pitchers did what New York pitchers have done for six
consecutive playoff meetings over two years. They breezed. In fact,
shutting down the Rangers in the postseason has become so easy for
Yankees hurlers, their efforts are unfairly diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the name-calling mounts for those in the Rangers'
batting order. Heartless, gutless, chokers _ probably all of it
applies. But whatever, Roger Clemens worked seven shutout innings,
Mariano Rivera applied the finish, and the Yankees won, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Those three runs came on a first-inning home run by Darryl
Strawberry, coming off another drug suspension. Manager Joe Torre
last night mentioned Strawberry's ``hiccup,'' meaning an arrest
last spring on charges of cocaine possession and asking a hooker
for favors. Joe, this is Cowboys' country. Down here, you can call
it what it is. We understand.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Loaiza regrouped after the Strawberry bomb, and his
seven innings were a winning effort. But over two years, there's a
long line of Rangers' pitchers who can say the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored one run in the three games, the same as 1998.
The Rangers had 13 hits last year in 27 innings. This time it was
14 hits. In other words, this ``record'' is now twice as bad, and
again, no postseason club has come close to this sort of misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two runs in two years _ there is no explanation for that,''
said catcher Pudge Rodriguez. ``I will, however, give credit to the
Yankee pitchers. It wasn't just us not hitting. It has also been
them pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have been searching for explanations for two
Octobers. Again last night, mouths did open, words came out, but
really, how do you explain this statistical impossibility? Two runs
over six games in two years goes beyond words even for the Yankees,
who also stumble around verbally when trying to give answers.
</P>
<P>
   As a side note, however, Rodriguez achieved more last night with
a simple act of courtesy than anything that was said in the
post-game gloom. He popped out of the dugout a few minutes after
the final out, and begin waving to what was left of the ballpark
crowd. Pudge was saying his thank yous, and the fans responded
loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great crowd _ really into the game,'' said general
manager Doug Melvin. ``The shame is we don't give them much to
cheer about, either this time or last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the 50,269 in attendance was ready for action before
the first pitch, and stayed revved up despite nine scoreless
innings from the home team. For noise and awareness, it was the
best crowd in Arlington history. And this was totally due to
self-motivation. Certainly the Rangers provided nothing in the way
of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Melvin pondered the question of where the team
goes from here. ``Let me think about that one for a while,'' he
finally answered.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred years from now, baseball historians will be saying the
same thing. Two runs in two years will have them thinking about
double-checking the accuracy of the record books.

NO CLEANUP PLAN YET FOR BELMONT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ State toxics officials told an independent
commission Saturday they weren't prepared to recommend a cleanup
plan for the toxin-laden Belmont Learning Center site because
significant tests had yet to be conducted on the site of the
nation's most expensive high school.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the state Department of Toxic Substances Control
instead gave the Belmont Commission an overview of the site
mitigation process for the 35-acre property that was once an oil
and gas field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not recommending a particular alternative (remediation
plan),'' said Bob Borzelleri, DTSC's chief deputy director. ``We
don't have all the information I'd like to see to make that
categorical statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Borzelleri said it may be possible for an engineering solution
to be found to prevent potentially explosive methane gases and
dangerous toxics like hydrogen sulfide from reaching the surface.
But, the state officials said, the extent and cost of that solution
would not be known until all tests were complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information we've gathered so far doesn't mean any deal
breakers'' aside from any unforeseen test results as the
environmental investigation continues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Commission member and former state Sen. Charles Calderon, who
was looking for possible cleanup remedies and associated costs,
said he was surprised and disappointed by the testimony of state
toxics officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting a mediation plan based on a worst-case
scenario that would tell us whether to proceed or not go forward,''
Calderon said. ``I don't see this information in that report. I
don't know where we're going from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Other commission members said they were no closer to a decision
on abandoning or proceeding with construction on Belmont after
Saturday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we to do with all this data,'' lamented Maribel
Marin, co-chairperson of the eight-member commission. ``All this
data does is point to the fact there is a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission is charged with making a recommendation to the
school board by Oct. 20 on the advisability of completing the
school.
</P>
<P>
   State toxics officials said they won't be able to recommend a
cleanup plan until a seismic study is done and other soil testing
is complete.
</P>
<P>
   The seismic test is needed to determine potential pathways for
hydrogen sulfide and other toxins to reach the surface. The study
is expected to take three months, including a month-long pilot to
determine if the assessment method is appropriate and will yield
the desired data.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's missing is the seismic study,'' said Hamid Saebfar,
DTSC's chief of Southern California's cleanup operations branch.
``Once we have that and a feasibility study, we can answer those
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   A feasibility study -- which will detail alternative remediation
plans, their related levels of health protection and costs -- is
not expected in February or March.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district contractor is due back to address likely
solutions that could receive DTSC approval and the cost of those
solutions,'' said Angelo Bellomo, chairman of the district's safety
team. ``The district contractor will look at how extensive the
possible remedial actions will be and their associated costs.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the commission is expected to learn about a range of
possible cleanup remedies and their costs from Environmental
Strategies Corp., the firm conducting environmental testing at the
Belmont site.
</P>
<P>
   ``ESC is due back to address likely solutions that could receive
DTSC approval and the cost of those solutions,'' Bellomo said.
``ESC will look at how bad can the remedy be and how much will it
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   During Saturday's meeting, state toxics officials described one
possible remedy to clean up the school site.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would feature a gas extraction system and a series of
methane barriers that would cover the entire 35-acre property to
prevent the escape of gases such as hydrogen sulfide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just incredible to me the type of mitigation that is
feasible for this site,'' Marin said.
</P>
<P>
   Saebfar said the best remedy won't be known until the
environmental investigation is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's look at all the alternatives and design a system that is
more efficient and cost-effective,'' he said.

KINGS SETTLE FOR 2-2 TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Kings flew back to Los Angeles after Saturday
night's 2-2 tie with the Washington Capitals, knowing they left
something sour on the ice of the MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   Surely they had reason to smile after going 3-1-1 during the
first leg of a seven-game road trip that resumes Friday in Calgary.
But by raising the bar since last season, blowing a two-goal lead
in the third period was the part they will remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I happy?'' said Luc Robitaille, who added a seventh goal to
his league-leading total. ``I guess. But we have to learn to bury
teams in situations like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings got their first taste of the league's new overtime
rule, which includes playing four on four to cut down on ties.
Actually, the Kings played almost two minutes shorthanded after
Robitaille was called for a penalty in the final seconds of
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The team held on, with goalie Stephane Fiset stopping a blast by
Adam Oates after a 2-on-1 break with 13 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   But rookie coach Andy Murray, who said he would have been
ecstatic with seven points before the trip start, smiled through
clenched teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was better than a good trip, but not quite a great trip,''
Murray said. ``After they tied it, we retook control of the game,
but we let this one get away.''
</P>
<P>
   With the team off today, Murray is catching a 5 a.m. flight to
his home in Minnesota, where he will spend most of the day with his
wife Ruth watching his two sons play hockey. He'll get back on a
plane at 10:30 tonight and return for practice Monday at the
Iceoplex.
</P>
<P>
   Murray certainly will have his tray table down to help figure
out what happened Saturday after his team controlled the Capitals
for the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille had given the Kings the lead early in the second
period with Caps defenseman Ken Klee off for holding. Jozef Stumpel
had missed on a rebound of Rob Blake's blast from the point.
Robitaille didn't waste a third chance, poking it past goalie Olaf
Kolzig.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings made it 2-0 just over two minutes later. Third line
right-winger Marko Tuomainen beat Kolzig in front after Ian
Laperriere dug the puck out of the corner.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first career goal for Tuomainen, who played four
games for Edmonton in 1994-95 but spent the past two seasons
playing in his native Finland.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the first goal by a forward not on the first line.
Donald Audette and Bryan Smolinski from the scoreless second line
had six shots, but Glen Murray was shut out and was on the ice when
the tying goal was scored.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings outshot Washington 24-13 in the first two periods but
never scored again.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bondra, one of the fastest skaters in the league, cut the
Kings' lead to 2-1 with a power-play goal with 15:57 left in
regulation, but the game still seemed well in hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' only loss on the trip, however, was last Wednesday
against Florida when they allowed three goals in the last two
minutes. They rebounded against Tampa Bay the next night, but
Saturday the Caps kept on the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Simon, Washington's popular long-haired left winger, tied
the game with 8:13 left when he tipped in Joe Sacco's blast from
the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy, getting a point after trailing by two goals in
the third period,'' said former Ducks coach Ron Wilson, in his
second year with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 4-on-3 advantage early in overtime, the Caps could not
sustain the momentum. The Kings outshot them 4-3 and stopped a
2-on-1 break when Fiset gloved a blast by Oates with two minutes
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recovered nicely after they tied the game, but it's still a
game you want,'' Fiset said.

WOMACK WASN'T ONLY ONE TO DROP THE BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - For an eternity, Tony Womack sat at his locker. Head
down, feet bouncing, tears trickling down his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, his eyes were fixed on the back of his cubicle. A
man staring into nothing but despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just dropped it,'' he said. ``I just dropped it. Oh, gosh.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick reminder for anyone who wants to lay the goat horns on
Womack for dropping a fly ball that changed the course of a game
and a season:
</P>
<P>
   An infielder by trade, he never wanted to play right field in
the first place. He did so reluctantly, at the team's request. He
made progress. He kept his mouth shut. And in the 166th game of the
season, the experiment blew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``No excuses,'' Womack said. ``I've been doing it all year. I
was making adjustments. I was making progress. I'm not going to
make excuses. I just dropped the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   There is bitter irony here. In Pittsburgh, Womack learned to
play second base because Jay Bell was the incumbent shortstop. In
Arizona, Womack was displaced again after Bell was moved to second
base.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, long before his right-field miscue, Womack made a
tremendous play at shortstop to save a run. Remember that. He was
moved to the outfield for defensive purposes _ because the original
right fielder, Bernard Gilkey, misplayed a line drive that cost the
Diamondbacks a run. Remember that, too.
</P>
<P>
   History will not go easy on Womack. Our obsession with success
carries a rough edge, and these kind of moments rarely fade out of
memory. Instead, they become ghosts with a lifetime pass. Just ask
Mitch Williams. Brant Brown. Jean Van de Velde. Scott Norwood. A
cruel list that goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, people assume Bill Buckner's legendary error handed
the Mets a World Series title in 1986. It did not. It only gave
them Game 6. A similar distinction applies here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony's played great baseball all season, and today he made a
mistake,'' Bell said. ``But it didn't cost us a game. It only tied
it up. I hope this doesn't turn into Tony Womack bashing, because
that's not what this should be about. We all fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and if you want to cast blame, start with everybody. With
only a few exceptions, the Diamondbacks underachieved in the
postseason. They did not play well. Their manager, Buck Showalter,
made some questionable decisions in two of the three losses. In
their finest moment, they fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they will have to live with balancing 100
regular-season victories against hollow playoff failure. In the
discomfort of knowing the defeat was largely of their own making.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not play up to our potential,'' Brian Anderson said.
``Maybe if we do that, the series comes out different.''
</P>
<P>
   In this era of the tape-measure home run, we are reminded that
baseball is, indeed, a game of inches. On Saturday, Bell's clutch
double clipped the top of the wall. Another inch, and he's rounding
the bases. Instead, he's thrown out at home moments later. By an
inch.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Colbrunn's home run barely cleared the fence. Darryl
Hamilton's at-bat in the eighth inning could've blown the game wide
open. Except his looping fly down the left-field line dropped foul.
By an inch.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, a series-winning home run that bounced off Steve
Finley's glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should've had it,'' Finley said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Womack stared forward, wondering whether his error ended a
magical season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough question,'' he said. ``A tough, tough question.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sun set in New York, a huge gathering of birds circled
just above an empty stadium, flying over an imaginary carcass. A
dream season died Saturday. In time, the good memories will
resurface and the bad memories will turn to motivation. But whether
they'll ever get this chance again is impossible to predict, and in
the end, the biggest loss was an opportunity wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they dropped the ball. Long before the right fielder
did. &QL;

D-BACKS EXPRESS HITS WALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How do you begin to describe the end?
</P>
<P>
   Dejection. Pain. Tears. Fatigue. Anger. The contemplation of
what could have been. If only . . .
</P>
<P>
   After 100 regular-season victories and a division title won by
the Diamondbacks in just their second season, the magic disappeared
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pratt, filling in behind the plate for the second straight
game after Mike Piazza suffered a thumb injury, hit a solo home run
off Arizona closer Matt Mantei with one out in the 10th inning
Saturday to lift the wild-card New York Mets to a 4-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets will face the Braves in the National League
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come this far, you hope for something better,''
Diamondbacks Managing General Partner Jerry Colangelo said. ``Could
have, would have, should have . . . it doesn't matter now. It is a
moment of euphoria for them and the end for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks had hoped to force a Game 5 today back home at
Bank One Ballpark with left-hander Randy Johnson on the mound. No
go.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt's blast, which was nearly caught by Arizona center fielder
Steve Finley as he reached over the fence and had the ball hit the
tip of his glove, brought to an end a game that should be
considered one of the classics of this or any season.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 56,177 fans at Shea Stadium _ not even Pratt _ knew
for sure whether Finley returned from no-man's land with the ball.
Pratt made the turn at first base and was headed toward second when
he realized that Finley had come up empty. Fireworks exploded, the
crowd erupted and Pratt's teammates poured onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Steve starting to plant for his jump and we have all
seen it a million times on the highlight films _ Steve bringing
back balls,'' said Pratt, who hit .293 with three homers and 21
RBIs in 71 games for the Mets this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went up and I lost the ball, kind of paused. I thought he
had the ball, actually. Then he put his head down. I didn't see the
umpire, but he (Finley) put his head down. I knew we won the game
right then.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley wished his arm were a fraction of an inch longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I should have caught it. It hit the end of my
glove. I've caught a lot of those before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter met briefly with the team after the game
before addressing the media. Colangelo consoled many of the
players, especially right fielder Tony Womack, who was quite
shaken. Outfield coach Dwayne Murphy also gave Womack support.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Brian Anderson, who gave up seven hits and two runs in
seven innings, said Showalter told the team ``that he was very
proud of us. It was emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Showalter: ``My thoughts are on the players. I think as
many ebbs and flows of the season there are, that the finality of a
situation like this is real tough for them . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told them that the pain would pass, but the burning
desire to get back here and get it right won't, because that is the
type of people they are. Tucson (spring training) will be here
before they know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 also featured:
</P>
<P>
   Solo home runs by Mets second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo (fourth
inning) and Arizona first baseman Greg Colbrunn (fifth).

<P>
   Mantei pitched two innings, matching his season high. He had
pitched two innings twice with Florida early in the year. He had
not been used in the first three games of this series, but said the
inactivity didn't affect him.

<P>
   ``I've been up (in the bullpen) a lot,'' he said. ``I felt good.
He (Pratt) just hit the ball hard. That happens sometimes. We had a
good run, but all good things must come to an end.''

MANTEI `READY FOR NEXT SEA SON'  
 CLOSER WON'T DWELL ON LOSS IN 10TH INNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This was where Matt Mantei wanted to be and why the
Diamondbacks went after him in July: With the ball, do or die, the
Diamondbacks' season rested on Mantei's 98 mph fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mantei's world froze as he watched center fielder Steve
Finley leap at the wall. He watched the ball descend. Into Finley's
glove, he prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he caught it at first,'' Mantei said. ``But then I
saw him bang up against the wall, so I knew it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over now. I'm ready for next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Mantei, who had saved so many games in helping turn the season
around, couldn't win this time. Unlikely hero Todd Pratt sent
Mantei's fastball over the center-field fence in the bottom of the
10th inning Saturday to send the New York Mets to the National
League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Mantei says he won't let it devour him. He refused to replay it
in his mind, to dwell on defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``All good things come to an end, eventually,'' Mantei said.
``We've got to keep our heads up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mantei was outstanding in rescuing the Diamondbacks from a
first-and-third, one-out situation in the eighth inning, then left
a runner stranded in the ninth before returning for the 10th. It's
the longest he's pitched since he went 2 innings in a July 24, 1998
game with the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still had a lot left in me,'' Mantei said. ``I felt great
going back out there. I felt real confident. He just beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Randy Johnson, who was hoping to have the ball one
last time in this series today, said he was proud of Mantei's
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``His job normally is to go out there for one inning,'' Johnson
said. ``He gave it all he had. He twice left it in the position
where we were still tied. He didn't lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter said he felt he could go longer than
normal with a well-rested Mantei, who had not pitched in the series
before entering Game 4 in the eighth with the score tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mantei did a great job,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mantei would gladly take a pitch or two back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to drop a breaking ball for a strike,'' Mantei
said. ``Then, I threw a fastball right down the middle of the
plate. I think it was the first hit (Pratt) got in the series. What
a great time for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley stared at an empty glove with disbelief as fireworks shot
off behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even hear them,'' Finley said.
</P>
<P>
   Finley was in the World Series last year with San Diego and said
he felt this team had what it takes to get there, especially after
acquiring Mantei from the Marlins on July 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel that way,'' Finley said. ``We just didn't get the
breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked back at the play at the plate in the eighth inning
when second baseman Jay Bell, who had given the Diamondbacks a 3-2
lead with a two-run double, was called out on left fielder Melvin
Mora's throw to Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   Then he recalled the ball that escaped his glove, a glove that
has been so golden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ends so quickly,'' Finley said. ``We had a lot of losses
like that, where we walked off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   It started on opening day in April, when the Los Angeles Dodgers
beat them with the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   And it ends here, on another long ball. There's no sense of
disgrace. Only agony.
</P>
<P>
   ``That pulled us together,'' Finley said about the opening
week's run of heart-breaking, last-inning losses. ``This will keep
us together.'' &QL;

REMOVING WILLIAMS TORE OUT TEAM'S HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Many will point to Todd Pratt's home run in the
bottom of the 10th inning as the crushing blow to a terrific
Diamondbacks season, the final dagger that left the Arizona boys
laid out on the canvas for the final time in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But what occurred two innings earlier may have played just as
big a role in the demise of the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   For the very first time in his career, Matt Williams said, he
was removed from the middle of a game as part of a double-switch in
the bottom of the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   There's one school of thought _ one that starts right here _
that says the Diamondbacks had absolutely no shot of winning once
Williams was removed. No chance.
</P>
<P>
   To understand what the no-nonsense Williams represents, consider
he is the absolute and unquestioned leader of this club, which, in
so many ways, plays the game exactly the way it was intended.
</P>
<P>
   He is the heart, soul and spiritual leader that pushes the
Diamondbacks in the right direction. He is the club's father, son
and holy ghost.
</P>
<P>
   When the rest of the Diamondbacks looked toward third base in
the final two innings Saturday, they did not see Williams. If they
looked toward the bench, there sat Williams, unable to do a damned
thing to help prolong the Diamondbacks' wonderful season.
</P>
<P>
   To this bunch, Williams is the equivalent of Gen. Patton, ``Old
Blood and Guts.'' He inspires his teammates simply by manning his
spot at third base. He is the anchor of the club, and, while there
are others who definitely motivate, they simply do not come close
to representing what Williams does.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Manager Buck Showalter's call made sense. After all,
Williams had made the last out of the eighth inning, and inserting
Matt Mantei into Williams' slot and putting Lenny Harris into the
pitcher's spot in the lineup appeared logical.
</P>
<P>
   There was one flaw in that thinking: This game has never been
played on paper. It's played by human beings who have an emotional
attachment to the game and what it represents. Take away the
leader, and you are left with a shell.
</P>
<P>
   Certain players should never ever come out of a crucial game
unless they are injured. Williams is the rock of Gibralter for this
team. The one steadying constant that everyone else can always
count on.
</P>
<P>
   Take him out of the game, and you've removed the Diamondbacks'
heart. It's that simple. You don't take Barry Larkin, Jeff Bagwell
or Chipper Jones out of any game. Matt Williams is at the top of
that list.
</P>
<P>
   Following the 4-3 loss to New York that eliminated the
Diamondbacks in the best-of-five series, Williams defended
Showalter's move to the end. Then again, what else would anyone
expect?
</P>
<P>
   Forget that nothing happened at third base or that Williams'
spot in the lineup never came up before Pratt's game-winning home
run off Mantei. Taking away the best defensive player on the field
was reason enough not to make the move.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter could have chosen several other moves, including
removing Luis Gonzalez, who hits right in front of Williams, for
Andy Fox. Even taking out Jay Bell and moving Hanley Frias over to
second base and inserting Fox at shortstop could have been done.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody but Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something he's got to do,'' Williams said of Showalter's
double-switch. ``I understand it and fully agree with it and have
no problems with it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds later, Williams was again questioned by a reporter
from the Midwest about the emotions surrounding his removal. This
time, the response wasn't so kind. Williams ended the initial
question-and-answer session and walked into the trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
   The loud, profanity-filled diatribe that followed was strong
enough to make sailors blush. What was actually said was
unimportant, though many were stunned to hear such an outburst. A
few minutes later, after having cooled off, Williams returned and
politely answered most questions, once again punctuating what kind
of man he is.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, his verbal eruption was not surprising because of
the passion with which he embraces the game of baseball. This is
not simply a job to Williams. It never will be, and that's what
makes him so special.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost impossible to envision the Diamondbacks winning
this game once Williams was removed. How could Arizona possibly win
any game without Williams? It's impossible to fathom. &QL;

ANDERSON MAKES CASE FOR 2000 ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _  &UR; Brian Anderson punctuated Saturday the case he made
in the season's last two months: that he should be part of the
Diamondbacks' starting rotation in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Lost amid one the most nerve-racking, wild playoff games in
memory was Anderson's seven innings of brilliance. The left-hander,
who loves postseason pressure, gave up seven hits and two runs,
walked none and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's performance in the 4-3 loss to the New York Mets
didn't escape Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter, who had spent the past
couple of days fielding questions from the media about why he
wasn't coming back with his ace,  &UR; Randy Johnson, for Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson showed why Showalter had so much faith in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how (Johnson) could have pitched any better than
Brian Anderson did. . .'' Showalter said. ``We felt like this was
our best option, and we are real comfortable with it, to be able to
hold this team to this type of runs. B.A. was outstanding. That
didn't surprise me.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson escaped a potential catastrophe in the sixth inning
when the Mets scored just one run. They had runners on second and
third with one out, and Anderson got out of it. &QL; 
Are you old school? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This was as wild and as intense a game Anderson has ever pitched
in. It didn't get any less intense after he left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel myself actually aging watching it,'' Anderson
said. ``Randy made the quip in the ninth inning: `Man, this might
be one of those instant sports classics.' He got in my face and
said, `Are you old school?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly one of the better baseball games you'll see
in a long time.'' &QL; 
An imperfect world &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody felt worse for right fielder &UR; Tony Womack than  &UR; Bernard
 &UR; Gilkey, the man Womack replaced in right before dropping a fly ball
that ended up tying the game at 3 for the Mets in the eighth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Womack started the game at shortstop, but he moved to the
outfield in the late innings when  &UR; Hanley Frias came in at short
for defensive purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's human,'' Gilkey said. ``Everybody makes mistakes.
They've found glitches in computers. It's not a perfect world.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is. I'm still with Tony. I want him on my
side any day.'' &QL; 
Playoff leaders &QL; 
Left-handed reliever  &UR; Greg Swindell led the bullpen. In the three
games he appeared in, Swindell did not give up a run in 3 innings
and yielded just one hit.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder &UR; Steve Finley, who was 2 for 22 in last year's
division series for San Diego, led the Diamondbacks with a .385
batting average (5 for 13) and five RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman &UR; Matt Williams was second in batting average at
.375 (6 for 16), but he did not have an RBI after leading the
Diamondbacks with 142 during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing sucks, but we work hard,'' Williams said.

TALK ABOUT DELIVERY  
 PIZZA GUY PRATT'S FAIRY-TALE HOMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It began with his mom tossing underhand to him, and
somewhere along the way, it diverted to tossing pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   But in a borough that loves its pizza, fairy-tale New York Mets
hero Todd Pratt delivered a baseball legend Saturday afternoon in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt smashed an improbable 10th-inning home run to the
center-field graveyard where deep flies die at Shea Stadium,
sending the new-look Miracle, Amazin', destiny-charmed Mets to the
National League Championship Series against enemy Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Improbable, not so much because of the extra-inning tension, his
lack of a hit in the series or his 10-day cold. Not even because of
the fact that Pratt never would have hit in the series if not for
All-Star catcher Mike Piazza's quirky sprained thumb having an
inflammatory reaction to a cortisone shot Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Improbable, because Pratt was managing a Domino's Pizza
franchise three years ago. The closest he came to baseball in 1996
was teaching kids at Bucky Dent's baseball school in Boca Raton,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, with one wicked lick of ash on hide, Pratt is the king
of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to cry at that moment,'' Pratt said, chugging a
magnum bottle of Budweiser with Andre champagne soaked to his
scalp. ``It was just awesome rounding third to see my whole team
waiting for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a little bit of power. If I got consistent at-bats,
I'd hit a lot of home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs, but he's not really joking.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt hated baseball so much for not giving a career .300
Triple-A hitter a fair shot at staying in the show that he left
baseball and learned pizza management in Florida, only to return a
year later for more frustration with the Mets organization.
</P>
<P>
   He nearly quit baseball twice last year, but Rick Dempsey talked
him out of it the first time, only to be reduced to tears the next
time he was sent down. An injury gave him an opportunity to stay in
New York that time.
</P>
<P>
   And then after nearly being the goat for bouncing back to
Arizona reliever Matt Mantei with runners on first and third in the
eighth, Pratt donned a cape in the 10th that was a reminiscent fit
to another New York backup catcher, Jim Leyritz, in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one hell of a script,'' Piazza said. ``We hope there
is some sort of underlying destiny for this ballclub. We're not
asking questions. We don't want it explained. We just hope it
continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, who last homered in April, took a first-pitch curve. He
said he had been looking to get ahead of a Mantei fastball on the
pitch he homered.
</P>
<P>
   He stalled rounding first, thinking center fielder Steve Finley
hauled it back. But Finley's head sunk and Pratt's arms soared.
</P>
<P>
   When the severity of Piazza's injury came out Friday morning,
Game 5 starter Al Leiter was the first to make reference to the
unlikely heroes who surface in postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   The first clue that this was Pratt's day came in the eighth,
when he applied the tag that nailed Jay Bell at the plate in the
eighth inning. Then came the 10th and the best moment of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   A stadium employee later approached Pratt to sign the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Expletive), I'm taking it,'' Pratt said as he snatched the
ball, noting he has intentions to give the man a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Mets fans would say he already has. &QL;

LEITER STAYS CALM ON MOUND BUT DRINKS PEPTO AFTERWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The pressure was too much. Mets starter  &UR; Al Leiter
had to sneak into the hallway &UR; Saturday behind the New York dugout
to take a swig of Pepto-Bismol.
</P>
<P>
   This was the 10th inning, three stanzas after he had left the
game only to watch reliever &UR; Armando Benitez blow his lead. The
mound was no problem for Leiter, whose cool big-game personality
rose to the occasion again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have much more of a hard time watching than playing,''
Leiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter got the Mets to this National League Division Series with
a two-hit shutout of Cincinnati on Monday, when he threw 135
pitches. He came back Saturday to toss 108 more in a quality start
that began with four no-hit innings.
</P>
<P>
   He held up a 2-1 lead entering the eighth, when he was pulled
after a walk and an infield single with two outs. Just as he did
for Florida in Game 7 of the 1997 World Series, Leiter gave New
York the chance to win in extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we play for,'' Leiter said. ``I treat every game
now like it's my last start. That means every pitch could make the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter was the difference against a team that led the league in
hitting against left-handers. He gave up three hits and faced the
minimum in five of his first seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Leiter has been huge, and today he was excellent,''
Manager &UR; 
 &UR; Bobby Valentine said. &QL; 
Cookie monster &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mets third-base coach &UR; Cookie Rojas may not join his team when
the National League Championship Series starts Tuesday in Atlanta.
He got into a heated argument with left-field umpire  &UR; Charlie
Williams over a correct call on an eighth-inning foul ball.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas shoved Williams during the obscenity-laced exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the ball hit on the line,'' Rojas said. ``We argued
back and forth until he called me a (expletive). I'm not going to
take that from anyone or any umpire.''
</P>
<P>
   Replays showed that Williams, who was rated the worst umpire in
the NL by players last year, made the correct call on  &UR; Darryl
Hamilton's looping drive with two runners on and the game tied at
3. Williams had left the umpires' locker room by the time a
reporter approached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas ran from the coach's box to shallow left field to confront
Williams and was ejected. As the argument grew heated, Manager
Bobby Valentine sprinted out of the dugout to try to restrain
Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine and others restrained Rojas, who left the field to
chants of, ``Cookie, Cookie.'' &QL; 
Fitting for Franco &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mets reliever  &UR; John Franco got the win. How just is that?
</P>
<P>
   Franco is a boyhood Mets fan and New York native. Franco had not
been to the playoffs in 15 seasons, the longest drought for any
active player. Franco had not even won a game since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest moment of my career,'' he said. ``All
hell broke loose, and I couldn't believe I was the pitcher of
record.'' &QL; 
Doing right on lefties &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mets picked up all three victories when Arizona started
left-handers, the purported strength of Arizona that would hurt New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a lefty myself, I like the fact we got the lefties,''
Mets first baseman  &UR; John Olerud said. &QL;

RULES CHANGES MAY HELP SLASH, DASH SUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ Last season, by accident more than design, the
Portland Trail Blazers were a team constructed to perfection for
the concentrated, 50-game sprint caused by the labor lockout.
That's because the Blazers had a stockpile of youth and depth.
</P>
<P>
   Could the Suns be a team that, coincidentally, is built to order
this season for rules changes implemented by the NBA? The league
made several changes, some in the rules and some in the way they're
to be enforced, to create more movement and flow.
</P>
<P>
   And that figures to benefit a team such as the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so. It's not going to be so much of a power game
anymore,'' Suns guard Penny Hardaway said. ``It's going to be more
of a finesse game now. I think the league wants it to go back the
way it was, teams scoring 110, 115 points a game with guys knocking
down shots.''
</P>
<P>
   And with players such as Hardaway, Jason Kidd, Rex Chapman and
rookie Shawn Marion _ players who all can slash to the basket _ the
Suns could be difficult to defend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's going to help me a lot,'' said Hardaway, who was
eager to get into a more wide-open style of game in the Western
Conference and now may find even more room to work. ``Nobody is
going to put their hands on me as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing we had for me in Orlando was a cross-screen,
and guys used to able to really hit me when I came across that
cross-screen. Now, they're not going to be able to do that, so it's
going to make it a lot easier for me to get to the lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's going to hurt sometimes because you don't want to put
your hands on somebody and end up over on the sideline with two
fouls early in the first quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rules will prohibit a defender from making contact with
his hands or forearms except below the free-throw line, extended
from sideline to sideline.
</P>
<P>
   The changes also mandate that players must either shoot, pass or
pick up their dribble within five seconds if the player has his
back to the basket. This is called the ``Charles Barkley Rule''
because it's aimed at players such as Barkley, who take large
chunks off the 24-second shot clock while backing down with the
ball and waiting for a second defender to come to them.
</P>
<P>
   Also, defenders may now double-team a player on the side of the
lane where the ball is, even if that player doesn't have possession
of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the 24-second shot clock will be reset to 14
seconds if there is a violation with the clock below 14 seconds.
The clock won't be adjusted if there are 14 seconds or more on the
shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   There also is supposed to be an emphasis on cleaning up contact
in the key, particularly grabbing players coming off screens or
penetrating the lane. At the same time, offensive players won't be
able to get away with pushing off to create space.
</P>
<P>
   Suns guard Rex Chapman, a master at setting up defenders and
working off screens to get shots, believes the rules will help him
at the offensive end and are going to be murder on everybody at the
defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to really call it like they say they're going
to call it, you're going to really have to fight on defense,'' he
said. ``To be honest, if they're not going to let you touch anybody
on defense, there are going to be times when you just have to hope
guys miss shots.''
</P>
<P>
   There are only about a dozen players in the league who have
truly mastered the art of using screens, players such as Chapman,
Indiana's Reggie Miller, Washington's Mitch Richmond, New York's
Allan Houston and Golden State's John Starks.
</P>
<P>
   But Chapman said they all may have to adjust because the new
rules could work against them in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us get down there (in the paint), and do a lot of
acting to get a call,'' he said. ``I have a feeling there are going
to be a lot of offensive fouls called if we try that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Suns best defenders, Kidd and forward Clifford
Robinson, don't expect the rules to eliminate their ability to lock
up opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense is a matter of moving your feet,'' Kidd said. ``There
are some people who say I have bad habits because I don't touch
anybody on defense. But I don't touch them because I don't like the
offensive player to know where I'm at. I think the rules will help
the offense and the defense equally. Everybody has to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still going to come down to being determined. You hear
people say some guys can't play defense, but they can. Defense
always comes down to determination.''
</P>
<P>
   With big guards such as Kidd, who is 6 feet 4, and Hardaway, at
6-8, the Suns may find they have an advantage in double-teaming on
the strong side. Players may now drop down and double-team a player
on the post even if that player doesn't have the ball. Tall guards
like Kidd and Hardaway will make it tough to get the ball over
them, yet they've got the length to recover to a shooter on the
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he's still learning all the changes and how
they're going to affect his game and the Suns. But he believes that
it's impossible to eliminate the contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so used to bumping guys when they come through the lane,
that's going to be tough for me,'' he said. ``The defensive
position they're going to allow on the strong side may make it
easier to keep the ball out of some players' hands, like Shaq
(O'Neal).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still learning it, but we'll adjust to it. I think
you'll still see a lot of bumping because it's just part of the
game. But there's definitely going to be a smoother flow to the
game. And it's going to make everybody work a lot harder, too.'' &QL;

HIGH STICK MEANS ROENICK MUST SIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As expected, Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick was
suspended by the NHL for his high stick Friday night to the face of
good friend Tony Amonte of the Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Just how long Roenick will be suspended remains to be seen. The
league ordered him to sit out today's game against the New York
Rangers pending further review.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick could be eligible to return to the lineup for Monday's
game in Buffalo, or he could face further discipline and miss
additional games depending on his hearing with Colin Campbell, the
NHL's director of hockey operations.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing could be held in Campbell's office today or Monday. It
also isn't unusual for hearings to be handled over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 12 years, I've never been suspended. Hopefully, that will
work to my favor,'' Roenick said. ``I haven't seen the replay, but
when Campbell reviews it, I hope he agrees it was a split-second
reaction on my part and that I had no intent to injure Tony at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those things that happen in a game. I tried
to give him a whack on the hands. . . . He had his head down low,
and I guess the tip of my stick rode up and caught him on the
chin.''
</P>
<P>
   But Roenick, who received a five-minute match penalty and
automatic ejection, also hurled a stream of expletives at Amonte,
his former linemate in prep school. He said that, too, was just
part of the game, but acknowledged it was just a bad night overall.
</P>
<P>
   In Roenick's absence, the Coyotes planned to recall center
Daniel Briere from Springfield of the American Hockey League.
Rookie defenseman Radoslav Suchy, meanwhile, a healthy scratch in
the Coyotes' first three games, was assigned to Springfield. &QL; 
In 12 years, I've never been suspended. Hopefully, that will work
to my favor. &QL;

RANGERS GIVE ZERO RESISTANCE AS YANKEES REPEAT '98 SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The end came swiftly and without mercy for
the Rangers at The Ballpark in Arlington last night.
</P>
<P>
   There was no lingering at the scene or any hint of drama to stir
the 50,269 fans who showed up in a surprisingly enthusiastic mood,
ready to cheer loudly at any signs of life in their team.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry sounded the death knell with a three-run homer
in the first and Roger Clemens finished the dirge with a
three-hitter over seven innings, leading the New York Yankees to
3-0 victory and, for the second consecutive year, a three-game
sweep of the Rangers in their American League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is definitely hard to swallow,'' shortstop Royce
Clayton said in the somber clubhouse afterward. ``We felt much
different than last year. Last year we just wanted to get in the
playoffs. This year getting to the playoffs was not our goal.
Getting to the World Series was our goal. It's very disappointing,
but we have to deal with that. We're going to have to deal with it
again next year and that's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark McLemore, sitting at his locker and staring
glumly off into space, said, ``I can't describe the feeling right
now. It's very hard to take, very hard to take. We came into this
year with a better ballclub and the same thing happened again. It's
tough to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, a franchise once known for having never been in the
playoffs, are now saddled with the stigma of a nine-game postseason
losing streak, the fifth longest in major-league history.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive year, the Rangers are left wondering
how their offense can be so good during the regular season and
still score only one run in three games against the Yankees. They
batted .152 in this series, only 11 points better than their 1998
funk when they also scored one run.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing different from the 1998 series is that Game
3 wasn't delayed by rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a good hitting team,'' designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro
said. ``We ought to be able to hit any pitcher. I can't explain
what happened. I can't explain how we could score just one run in
three games. I'll think about it all winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Esteban Loaiza pitched a decent game, except for
the three-run homer by Strawberry in the first. Derek Jeter's
triple and a walk to Bernie Williams set up the blast and the
Rangers never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have that first inning back,'' Loaiza said.
``That was the whole ballgame. One pitch and it could have been a
different game. We could still be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   A 3-0 deficit in the first inning never gave the Rangers cause
for alarm during the regular season. Loaiza even beat the Yankees,
7-3, on Aug. 25 despite being down 3-0 in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the playoffs. Don Larsen is about the only pitcher
who could have saved the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a better ballclub but that's part of what makes them
so good,'' center fielder Tom Goodwin said. ``They make other teams
look not as good as they really are. It's definitely stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, in getting his first playoff victory since 1986, left
after seven innings, allowing three hits and two walks while
striking out two. After Jeff Nelson allowed a single to Goodwin to
start the eighth, Mariano Rivera pitched the final two innings for
the save.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers never got a runner past second base and only once
did they get the tying run to the plate. That was with two on and
two outs in the fourth, but Clemens got Lee Stevens to ground out
to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played tight the first two games in New York,''
third baseman Todd Zeile said. ``We didn't let it all out. I didn't
see that tonight so there really isn't an explanation. The bottom
line is you have to look yourself in the mirror and say you didn't
get the job done.''

MITCHELL'S DAY LEAVES SOONERS FEELING SICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATHAN SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A sinus infection had Texas running back Hodges
Mitchell playing at only about 75 percent yesterday, but it didn't
seem to slow him down when the game was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the Oklahoma defense.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the illness, Mitchell overwhelmed the Sooners for a
career-high 216 yards on 30 carries in the Longhorns' 38-28 victory
over Oklahoma at the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-9 and 190 pounds, Mitchell is the first to admit that
he's no Ricky Williams. But on this day, he broke through with
Ricky Williams-type numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to make every game my breakout game,'' said Mitchell, a
junior from Dallas Skyline who became only the seventh UT running
back to crack the 200-yard mark. ``I was just seeing the holes a
lot better today.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's biggest run came when Texas needed it most. Trailing
by only three points early in the fourth quarter, Oklahoma downed a
punt at the Texas 1 in front of an end zone section full of vocal
Sooners fans. After straining to hear quarterback Major Applewhite
audible, Mitchell was surprised when Applewhite turned and handed
him the ball three yards deep in the end zone on a draw play up the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   That surprise turned to excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Major handed me the ball, I looked up and I said to
myself, `I'm fixin' to go 99 yards,' '' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell didn't quite make it that far _ he was dragged down
from behind after a 35-yard gain _ but he got the Longhorns started
on a 99-yard touchdown drive that proved to be the clincher.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns then put the ball in Mitchell's hands in the final
minutes to seal the game. He responded. More than half (116) of his
216 yards came in the fourth quarter, including a 27-yard run on
third-and-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an exciting player,'' Applewhite said of Mitchell. ``He
made some big runs today that were definitely a factor in the ball
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said this was the most drained he had felt after a
game. But to do this well in front of his hometown crowd, it was
worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I treated it just like a high school game playing in front of
my fans,'' Mitchell said. ``I hope I did Dallas proud.''

ASTROS USHERED OUT OF DOME, PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As the Astros can attest, those who fail to learn from
baseball history are Domed to repeat it.
</P>
<P>
   As they did six times during their 35-year run in the Astrodome,
the Dis-Astros yesterday lost a playoff series in which they simply
failed to hit the baseball in the clutch. A too-little, too-late
7-5 loss to the Atlanta Braves before 48,553 eliminated the Astros
from their National League Division Series and capped a dreary Dome
era in which they never hit above .233 in the postseason and never
won a playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not being able to score was the biggest frustration of the
series,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``If we get in the
playoffs next year I'm sure our stigma will grow even greater. The
only pleasure from this is knowing we don't have to come back here
because the Dome's day has gone by.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who rode more pressure pitching from John Rocker and
two more hits from Brian Jordan, advance to next week's NL
Championship Series against the New York Mets. Before moving
downtown into the natural-grass, retractable-roof Enron Field in
April, the Astros get to spend their off-season trying to
comprehend their latest ``Livin' La Vida Choka''.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating beyond belief,'' said Astros second baseman
Craig Biggio, 2-for-19 in the series with five strikeouts. ``We
didn't really start playing relaxed until it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Visibly demoralized by Friday's 12-inning loss in which they
failed to score with the bases loaded and no outs in the 10th, the
Astros continued their offensive futility early yesterday by
stranding five runners in the first two innings and digging a 7-0
hole against John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Houston at least made it interesting.
</P>
<P>
   A solo homer by Tony Eusebio got the Astros on the board in the
seventh and a three-run shot by Ken Caminiti got them back in the
game in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   After a run-scoring double by Tim Bogar pulled Houston within
7-5 in the eighth, the Astros actually sent the tying run to the
plate five times. Pinch hitter Daryle Ward grounded to first and
Biggio struck out swinging against Rocker. After Stan Javier walked
to lead off the ninth and bring what was left of the crowd to its
feet, Jeff Bagwell struck out on a check-swing, Carl Everett struck
out swinging and Caminiti flied out to deep right-center to send
the Braves to their eighth consecutive NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to contain that team as long as we did,'' Braves
manager Bobby Cox said. ``We knew they had to explode at some
point, and the game sort of got on the line there at the end. But
again, Rocker was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brian enforced his version of Jordan Rules by
consistently making the Astros pay for pitching around Chipper
Jones with eight hits and seven RBI. The most glaring Astro-Nots,
however, continued to be stars Biggio and Bagwell. After
yesterday's 1-for-9, the two combined to go only 4-for-32 with nine
strikeouts and no extra-base hits or RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Each struck out in his last at-bat as the tying run, a microcosm
of their 10-for-81 (.123) performance during the Astros' 2-9
playoff run the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the NBA playoffs you don't allow layups and in baseball you
don't let those guys get good pitches,'' Smoltz said. ``Those are
the two guys we were determined not to let beat us, and we pitched
them well.''
</P>
<P>
   After Jones' sacrifice fly gave Atlanta a 1-0 lead in the top of
the first, the Astros again failed to score with the bases loaded
when Bill Spiers bounced out weakly to second base. In the second,
Javier grounded to third with runners on first and third.
</P>
<P>
   Including a game in which they had only one hit, the Astros
stranded 31 runners in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves took a 2-0 lead in the third when Smoltz doubled and
scored on Brett Boone's single, then blew the game open with a
five-run sixth that forced thousands of fans to the exits and the
ones that stuck around to begin booing. Singles by Jordan and Ryan
Klesko chased Houston starter Shane Reynolds before reliever Chris
Holt deflated the Dome for good by allowing run-scoring singles to
Jones and Eddie Perez for a 5-0 deficit that eventually ballooned
to 7-0 before the Astros rallied.

PAIN LIMITS OATES BUT CAN'T KEEP HIM OUT

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates came to the
ballpark yesterday feeling terrible, and it had nothing to do with
his team being down two games to the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Oates is suffering from an infection of the prostate gland, a
condition that has occasionally flared up on him over the past 28
years. It started when he was hit by a foul ball in a sensitive
area in 1971, and yesterday he was feeling particularly bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had better days,'' Oates said in his office before the
game. ``They gave me something to relieve the pain. But the
prostate is extremely enlarged.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said this is the third time in 12 months that he's had the
problem, and he's becoming more concerned about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a specialist, and surgery doesn't cure it,'' Oates
said. ``It's just something that flares up.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates had a 103 degree temperature Friday night but said it was
lower yesterday. He was not on the field with his team during
batting practice but was on the bench during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Only one time in his managing career has Oates been forced off
the bench because of a prostate infection. That was in 1983 when he
was managing the Yankees' Triple-A team in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Third base coach Jerry Narron said the only reason Oates would
have missed the game was ``if he's unconscious. If he's conscious,
he'll be here.''

REVOLUTION FAIL TO GAIN PLAYOFF BERTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Revolution discovered an effective style of
play on their final day of the season. But it was too late, as they
tied D.C. United, 1-1, Saturday night, then won the shootout, but
were eliminated from playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution finished with 26 points, 8 in the second half of
the season. They won twice in regulation time this year. The Miami
Fusion, who took a 2-0 win over Colorado, became the final team to
qualify for the playoffs with 29 points. United, who finished with
57 points, open the playoffs against the Fusion Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nicol, who replaced player-coach Walter Zenga 10 days ago,
restructured the Revolution midfield, placing Paulo Dos Santos in
front of Leonel Alvarez. The duo helped keep the Revolution compact
and dangerous. Their combination of experience, skill, and stamina
helped set the tone for the Revolution, who wisely retained
possession for long periods in the second half, going to a slow
buildup rather than their usual hurried attack. Not only did this
quiet a boisterous crowd of 20,695, it also limited United's
possessions and relieved the pressure on the Revolution defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution surrendered an own goal in the second minute, but
they regained their composure and tied the score on Joe-Max Moore's
15th goal of the season five minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was common sense to do it,'' Nicol said of the
midfield combination. ``When you come to D.C., you've got to keep
the ball. I played with Paulo with the Bulldogs, and I know what he
can do. He can keep the ball, and he can pass. When the basics are
done well, it can look easy, but you have to have a certain ability
to make it look easy, and Paulo and Leonel have that.''
</P>
<P>
   The new-look midfield meant Jeff Baicher and John Harkes moved
to the outside, as they had occasionally done during other games.
But this was the first time they stayed wide for the entire game,
and Harkes provided the cross for Moore's goal.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez chested down a hurried clearance by Carlos Llamosa, who
later departed with a knee sprain. Alvarez then calmly held
possession near the penalty area before releasing Harkes on the
right. Moore called Giovanni Savarese off of Harkes's sharp cross
and volleyed the ball in on the first bounce, giving goalkeeper Tom
Presthus no chance.
</P>
<P>
   The tie in regulation time was deserved by the Revolution,
though they were fortunate that Jeff Causey was allowed to handle
his own miskick in the second half and that Jaime Moreno missed the
game because of suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno's replacement, A.J. Wood, seldom troubled Dan Calichman,
though he did provide a decent target for Marco Etcheverry, and Roy
Lassiter squandered an exceptional cross from Etcheverry at the far
post in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Burns helped set the defensive tone with a hard foul on Ben
Olsen in the second minute of the game, and midway through the
second half he cleared a Carey Talley header off the line. Olsen
seldom ventured into a dangerous position after that, but
Etcheverry's free kick went off Ted Chronopoulos for an own goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could afford it, I would take out a full-page ad and
apologize to the fans,'' Calichman said. ``We deserved to be in the
playoffs, and they deserve to have a playoff team. This was the way
we should have played all year, but we put ourselves in a
predicament. If we had played like this all year, we would have
been in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the lineup we had out there. The effort was
outstanding. You saw us beating them to the ball, and that is
effort and concentration and being sharp. That lineup can match up
against anybody in the league for talent.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nicol was hired as interim coach Oct. 30. His status for next
season is undetermined. ``Anybody wants to go as high as they can
in their profession,'' Nicol said . . . Dos Santos earned a place
on the team as a defensive midfielder during preseason training
camp in Italy, but his only previous full game was as a defender in
a 2-0 loss at Columbus May 15 before he seemed to fall out of favor
with Zenga. ``I was nervous before the game, but once it started I
had fun,'' Dos Santos said. ``That is the position I've played my
whole life, and it comes naturally to me. It's a high-profile
position, and it's a position that some of the top foreigners in
the league play. You have more freedom there, and I was just glad
to have the opportunity.'' . . . The Revolution will meet Tuesday
before disbanding . . . Savarese will return to Venezuela to play
for Caracas FC Sunday.

BRUINS MAKE THEIR POINT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's a point.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a victory, but more important, it's not a loss either.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins earned their first point of the season
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night in a 1-1 tie with the Philadelphia Flyers at the
FleetCenter. It was also the first point for the Flyers, who scored
their first goal of the season in three outings.
</P>
<P>
   In securing the tie, the Bruins avoided equalling their worst
start in franchise history (0-4-0), which was done twice (1964-65
and 1942-43). The last time the Bruins started the season 0-3-1 was
1965-66. That season, they went 0-4-1 before getting a 3-1 win at
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   There were several good signs:
</P>
<P>
   --Center Jason Allison looked by
</P>
<P>
   far the most comfortable he has in the four games. He was
controlling the play at times, passing better, playing with less
hesitation, and looking like the Allison of old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first game all year that I actually played with
confidence and I was a lot stronger,'' said Allison, who is
recovering from a sore right forearm. ``I was controlling the game
at times, which I haven't done all year.''
</P>
<P>
   --Goaltender John Grahame, who was hung out to dry in his first
start in Toronto, made 28 saves, several of which were spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   --The Joe Thornton-P.J. Axelsson-Rob DiMaio line continues to
impress. It was Axelsson who scored with help from his linemates.
</P>
<P>
   --The lack of work ethic that was so glaring in the earlier
contests was absent here. The Bruins actually looked desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were skating for the puck and going into position faster
and the determination was there to want the puck and want to win,
which you rarely saw or only saw glimpses of in the first three
games,'' said defenseman Kyle McLaren, who landed a game-high 11
hits. ``It's going to get better still.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins started off as they had in Ottawa Thursday night,
scoring a goal in the first minute.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton dished a pass to Axelsson, who was skating into the
slot. The puck caromed off Axelsson's skate, he put it on his
stick, and beat goalie John Vanbiesbrouck with a forehander for his
first tally of the season at the 46-second mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers, who were shut out in back-to-back games for the
first time in franchise history in their first two contests, didn't
register a shot until 7:24 into the game with left wing John
LeClair firing from the left circle; Grahame turned it back.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Flyers started to generate some shots, they put heavy
pressure on Grahame. One of the toughest saves he made was with
21.4 seconds remaining in the first period. Grahame, an aggressive
netminder, had lost his stick when he used it to pokecheck a Flyer.
The puck went out to Mark Recchi, who gunned it at the net, forcing
Grahame to make the save.
</P>
<P>
   It was Recchi who broke the Flyers' extended drought midway
through the second period. With Anson Carter off for holding, right
wing Mikael Renberg dished a pass from the right circle to Recchi
in the slot. Recchi let fly a wrist shot that went over Grahame's
shoulder and clanged off the inside of the left post to tie the
game, 1-1, at 6:42. That goal ended a Philadelphia scoreless streak
at 146 minutes 41 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   With about 14 seconds left in the second period and the teams
skating four a side, Grahame came up big again. LeClair had blocked
a shot by Don Sweeney at the blue line and a favorable bounce gave
LeClair a breakaway. The Flyer barreled down the slot and fired a
forehander that Grahame stopped with his right toe. LeClair got the
rebound and tried again, but Grahame blocked it with the inside of
his right pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to jump out and be as aggressive as I could,''
said Grahame. ``I wanted to stay up and make him make the first
move and fortunately he shot it and the rebound was there as well
so I tried to stick my pad out. It worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   It did more than work out. It buoyed the Bruins significantly
and even though they couldn't get anything else past Vanbiesbrouck,
they knew Grahame would hold the fort.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really boosted our confidence,'' said McLaren.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has always played great when our backs were against
the wall,'' said Allison.

THE LOST IS FOUND IN WILDCATS' WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Arizona discovered something Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Itself.
</P>
<P>
   The picture remains incomplete, but a 31-24 victory over
Southern California at Arizona Stadium is a big piece in what is
still a puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   The win also has to be judged through the prism that is the
Pac-10. The league's look is dim and dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   But theories of relativity are for pollsters and talk-show
geeks. For the Wildcats, there is the daily task of trying to
correct a season.
</P>
<P>
   Their battle has been fought from within. They began the year
wearing T-shirts with this motto: Beat The Little Man. The
proverbial idea was to overcome that tiny voice of self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   After five difficult weeks, the little man had grown into a
monster that was threatening to consume a season. The Wildcats were
a mystery, mostly to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But against the Trojans, they began to recognize some of the
things they were supposed to be all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out, but my measuring stick is that we
played hard, spilled our guts,'' Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said
after his team (4-2 overall, 2-1 Pac-10) stayed alive in the league
race with a victory over No. 22 USC.
</P>
<P>
   For Tomey, the game was like a reunion. For the first time this
year, he saw the hard-hitting defense that has been the hallmark of
his tenure in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's reputation for feared defense had begun to sound like
so much fiction after one missed tackle after another.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no misses on this hot afternoon. Playing in
temperatures of about 100 degrees, the Trojans offense evaporated
like the mist from the cooling machines located behind their bench.
</P>
<P>
   The heat and the Arizona defense were one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   Oppressive.
</P>
<P>
   After it was all over, the Wildcats had held USC (3-2, 1-2) to
minus-20 yards rushing. The Wildcats had seven sacks as DaShon Polk
and Idris Haroon led the way with two apiece. The Arizona defense
even did some of the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Within the final two minutes, cornerback Kelvin Hunter picked up
a bobbled snap by USC quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst and raced 24
yards for a score that assured victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Arizona defense should look like,'' said senior
linebacker Marcus Bell, who accounted for Arizona's second
interception of the season.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Arizona's offense marched up and down the field
with a balance that relied on quarterback Keith Smith, running back
Trung Canidate and receiver Dennis Northcutt, who did double duty
at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Canidate continued to emerge from his slow start with an
unerring, workmanlike performance that resulted in 194 rushing
yards, his fourth straight game with a 100 or more.
</P>
<P>
   In what might be a promising sign, there were moments when he
looked like the Canidate who was so explosive through the second
half of last season. On an 11-yard touchdown run early in the
fourth quarter, he high-stepped into the end zone. He is beginning
to dance as the tendinitis in his knees begins to ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really great to see him high-kicking through the
middle, looking like a horse,'' said Smith, who contributed 87
rushing yards, including a 57-yard scoring scramble in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Smith augmented the ground game with poised passing. He
completed 15 of 23 attempts for 243 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The TD was a thing of beauty. The all-purpose Northcutt caught
the ball with with one hand as he cut across an edge of the end
zone. He grabbed the aerial with his right hand and then wedged it
against the side of his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's effectiveness might signal a change in Arizona's
philosophy. Tomey has relied on a two-quarterback system since last
season.
</P>
<P>
   But against USC, Smith was at quarterback throughout most of the
game. His only mistake was a fumble that USC cornerback Antuan
Simmons turned into a 44-yard TD early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's counterpart, Ortege Jenkins, was at QB for only one
series late in the first half, which ended in a 10-10 tie despite
Arizona's statistical dominance. The rest of the time, Jenkins
filled in as a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same, the same exactly,'' Smith said when asked if
offensive coordinator Dino Babers has decided to make him the
starter and Jenkins the backup. ``Coach Babers just went with the
flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``OJ was in there as a receiver. We needed our best athletes on
the field in some way. And OJ is maybe our best. He's a playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   On this one day, there were just a lot of reborn possibilities. &QL;

IRISH CRUSH SUN DEVILS  
 TURNOVERS COSTLY FOR ASU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ Presented with the opportunity to redeem
itself on national television, Arizona State really dropped the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   And again.
</P>
<P>
   And again.
</P>
<P>
   And again.
</P>
<P>
   Five fumbles and three interceptions summarize what went wrong
in the Sun Devils' bumbling 48-17 loss to Notre Dame on Saturday.
Everything you've heard about the Pac-10 Conference? It's true.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this wasn't about a difference in talent level,'' tailback
J.R. Redmond said. ``We had the upper hand early and shot ourselves
in the foot.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: ASU is 1-6 in its past seven road games and visits
a Washington team that is starting to show some muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: Ummm, hmmm, uh . . . Nope, nothing comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils dominated the Fighting Irish early in front of a
sellout Notre Dame Stadium crowd of 80,012. But the Irish scored 27
second-quarter points, 20 off turnovers, and were in command the
rest of the way. They increased their lead to 41-0 in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys started falling apart. You could see it,'' ASU defensive
end Erik Flowers said. ``All year, we've been killing ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils left South Bend with some big-time concerns:
</P>
<P>
   Although a healthy Ryan Kealy looked sharp much of the game, his
alter ego also surfaced and he was intercepted three times. He was
clearly frustrated with himself afterward and wouldn't talk to the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond left in the third quarter after re-injuring his
shoulder. Both the tailback and Coach Bruce Snyder said it was in
worse shape than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils also helped Notre Dame quarterback Jarious
Jackson have a career day. He tied a school record with four
touchdown passes and also ran one in. He was 10 of 17 for 223 yards
and no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes plays,'' Fighting Irish Coach Bob Davie said. ``He is
playing the best football of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU seems to bring that out in people.
</P>
<P>
   The tide turned in the second quarter after Jackson hit split
end Bobby Brown with a 42-yard scoring pass.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, Kealy underthrew Delvon Flowers and the pass
landed in the hands of safety A'Jani Sanders, who returned the ball
28 yards for a touchdown. Suddenly, it was 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it was 21-0. ASU's next possession ended when tight
end Todd Heap, who made an impressive catch at the Notre Dame
25-yard line and tried to get extra yards, fumbled. He got knocked
by defensive end Grant Irons, and safety Deke Cooper recovered.
Five plays later, Jackson found tight end Dan O'Leary for a 6-yard
touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get a couple of extra yards and got hit from behind
and didn't expect it,'' Heap said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare mistake for a player who was otherwise brilliant,
with eight receptions for 100 yards, both career highs.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish took advantage of a another Kealy interception and
scored on the next play. Jackson connected with Joey Getherall for
25 yards to give Notre Dame a 27-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The halftime score didn't matter,'' Flowers said. ``We felt
like we could come back from that.''
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the case. Notre Dame rolled up 211 more yards of
offense in the second half and outscored ASU, 21-17. The highlight
(lowlight?) was a 48-yard Jackson run early in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ASU didn't score until late in the third on a Gerald Green
1-yard run. A 5-yard pass from Griffin Goodman to Brian Jennings
with 48 seconds in the game resulted in another touchdown, and the
Sun Devils got three points earlier on a Stephen Baker 45-yard
field goal. Previously, he missed one from 24-yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking responsibility for the way we played,'' Snyder
said. ``This team was really excited about being here and they
wanted to play a great game. It's extremely disappointing for all
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Said linebacker Adam Archuleta, ``We will bounce back from this.
Something this team has to learn is that bad things are going to
happen but you just have to be oblivious to them. We're going to
recover. We've got to trust our coaches and trust our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fighting Irish, meanwhile, improve to 3-3 and play host to
Southern California on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a great example of what happens when you don't turn
over the football,'' Davie said.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens when you do.

CARDS' POINTS DWINDLE, BUT HOPE FOR OFFENSE RISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Their offense looks like something that needs to
be lanced.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, the Cardinals seemingly find ways to bottom
themselves, or at least that is the perception as their point
totals dwindle, from 25 to 16 to 10 to 7.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that they are not that far away from breaking
out.
</P>
<P>
   They have more first downs than their opponents (68 to 61), have
a better third-down conversion percentage (32.8 to 32.1), have lost
fewer fumbles (four to five), have the same number of punts (24),
and have been outgained by only 38 yards a game. Over the final
three quarters of games, the Cardinals have outscored foes, 58-50.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably have played even better than we did early last
year, yet we're nowhere near where we want to be right now,''
offensive coordinator Marc Trestman said.
</P>
<P>
   Where they have buried themselves is with pass interceptions in
the first quarter _ five of their 13 _ leading directly to being
outscored, 52-0, in the first 15 minutes and to the 1-3 start that
has wary eyes cast on the offense with the New York Giants coming
in for a 1 p.m. game today at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are ready for a breakout mentally. Physically,
they might not be ready, and by the time the Cardinals get well on
the offensive side of the ball it might be too late. They can
afford no more than six losses and expect to get back to the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we talked about after the Dallas game was that we've been
on a spiral downhill that we've got to stop,'' Trestman said.
``It's been ugly. We haven't been at the standard we want to
perform at. We had to come back out here on the practice field and
work on getting better with an understanding that we will if we
stay focused and stay together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   One would think so, given the Cardinals' personnel. Jake Plummer
was hyped from coast to coast as one of the game's most exciting
and promising young quarterbacks. In Rob Moore, Frank Sanders and
rookie David Boston, Plummer would be throwing to as strong a
threesome as any in the NFL. New tight end Terry Hardy has been a
pleasant surprise who has added a dimension.
</P>
<P>
   With the passing game clicking, three-time 1,000-yard rusher
Adrian Murrell should have no trouble providing the threat of the
run to keep a defense honest. Up front are a lot of sturdy young
players, one of the league's largest lines, who have been brought
along in the Cardinals' development program.
</P>
<P>
   It was expected that the Cardinals would have a powerful,
high-scoring attack capable of carrying a defense weakened by the
loss of both starting tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it has been the defense that has kept the team in games
while the Cardinals deal with widespread injuries on offense,
starting with the groin and throwing hand thumb of Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer appeared in three preseason series, 15 snaps. Although
he has played in every regular-season game, he practiced little
through the first two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've been getting better and better as the weeks go
by,'' Plummer said. ``But sometimes when you practice better during
the week, it doesn't automatically transfer onto the field, and
that's what's been happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we show we're coming around as an offense. That would
be great against a defense as good as the Giants'. As soon as
everyone is out here healthy, I know we'll start to jell and start
looking like a unit that can move the ball up and down field.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer doesn't have to be told that his two touchdown passes
against 12 interceptions doesn't cut it. His 31.8 quarterback
rating not only is last in the NFC and next to last in the league
among starters, it ranks only third on the team. Backup Dave Brown
is at 38.9. Running back Michael Pittman is at 118.8 on the basis
of completing his only attempt on an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake's had three weeks of practice,'' Trestman said. ``You can
see the development and improvement each day. I think a lot of what
has happened is about turnovers and not really having the big play
being part of our offense right now, not having the big run or the
short throw with a big long run. There hasn't been anything that
gives us a jump-start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some opportunities in the red zone we haven't been
able to convert. We've fumbled twice on the 1-yard line, which
hasn't helped us. It hasn't gone anywhere near the direction we
want it to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Spotting the other team two or three touchdowns is no formula
for success.
</P>
<P>
   It also renders useless the exercise of preparing a game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has really inhibited the growth of our offense is we've
gotten down so quickly in games, we've really never had a chance to
run a game plan,'' Trestman said. ``We're down 21 at Philadelphia,
down 17 against San Francisco, down 21 against Dallas. So we've
never had to function in a normal environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of a state of the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Sputtering along at a 246-yards-a-game pace isn't what was
envisioned for the group. Only San Diego and Philadelphia have
total offenses rated lower. Even with the big play non-existent,
the Cardinals easily could be 3-1 absent the turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a similar pattern each week _ we fall behind, we
have to play catch-up from then on, and we haven't played catch-up
well,'' Coach Vince Tobin said. ``Usually what happens when you
turn it over and you're not moving is you lose. Until that changes,
the result is not going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it changes today against the Giants (2-2), who have won
four straight from the Cardinals by dominating with physical
players, is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer has not known from week to week which receivers will be
available. Moore is out today because of a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is expected to play, but he has a sore shoulder. He
hasn't had a chance to concentrate on learning the third receiving
spot. He had to learn Moore's spot during Moore's holdout, and he
had to learn Sanders' spot when Sanders had a sprained ankle.
Boston, 21, came out of Ohio State a year early and is the youngest
player in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   With Moore out, and backups Andy McCullough (hamstring) and Mac
Cody (hamstring) slowed, it could be difficult for Plummer to
throw.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, starting tackles Matt Joyce (knee) and James Dexter
(groin, triceps) have been slowed. Dexter is out today. Starting
guards Chris Dishman (elbow surgery) and Lester Holmes (facial cuts
suffered in an auto rollover) missed most of the preseason and are
just now returning to game condition.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell, at the quarter-season mark, has 198 rushing yards. He
hasn't reached the 60-yard mark in a game yet, and his 2.7-yard
average doesn't scare defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it because everybody wants results now, but the
running game takes timing, and that comes with practice together,
which we haven't had a lot of,'' Murrell said.
</P>
<P>
   It's no mystery, then, why the offense has not been on top of
its game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adrian hasn't had a chance to perform under conditions where
there has been some continuity in the game,'' Trestman said.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing turnovers, getting an early lead, getting Murrell
going, getting players healthy, getting Plummer back to his
confident playmaking self would help, Tobin agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'd still like to be able to run our offense,'' Tobin
said. ``We're not interested in going into a shell and all at once
becoming like turtles afraid to do anything, because I think that's
the worst thing that we can do.'' &QL;

`WILD CARDS' MAY EASE REALIGNMENT FOR BIDWILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regardless of which realignment proposal NFL owners choose, the
Cardinals are done playing the Cowboys home-and-home as of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a miracle for the Cardinals not to be shifted out
of the NFC East. Every realignment plan has them in the NFC West
with San Francisco, St. Louis and an AFC team.
</P>
<P>
   But  &UR; Dan Rooney, the Steelers owner who is the godfather of
realignment, thinks he has found a way to soften the blow for
Cardinals owner  &UR; Bill Bidwill, whom he has known since the two were
infants.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-division, four-team format would allow a team to play
two wild-card games each year, along with six division games, four
games against other teams in its conference and four games against
teams in the other conference.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney thinks the Cardinals often could play the Cowboys as one
of their two wild-card games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Billy about it, and he has told me that Dallas
is the only team that has sold out (Sun Devil Stadium) every
year,'' Rooney said. ``I totally understand in his situation, the
Cardinals against the Cowboys could be a game that's played most
years. As it is, they'll play each other every three years,
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney thinks the two wild-card games will soften the blow for
the six teams that are going to be displaced from their current
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the wild-card games would be rivalry games _
Jets-Giants, 49ers-Raiders, Dallas-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Another annual wild-card game would be the match-up of the two
Super Bowl teams from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have games in which some teams play strong vs. strong
and weak plays weak,'' Rooney said. ``You can take care of some
long-standing rivalries and account for even some rivalries that
aren't geographical, such as Carolina vs. Jacksonville, two former
expansion teams that came in the same year.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cowboys official said the two wild-card games that would
interest them the most would be Houston and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys like that their west Texas and New Mexico fans can
see them play each year at Sun Devil Stadium. El Paso is closer to
Tempe than it is to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Cowboys game at Sun Devil Stadium is one of
their biggest paydays each year, and money will talk in
realignment. Teams don't want to lose the big revenues they get
from certain visiting gates. The Cardinals, for instance, receive
their biggest visitors' check when they play at Washington's new
stadium because of the Redskins' high ticket prices and many club
seats.
</P>
<P>
   The league also can make it financially worthwhile for teams to
move out of their divisions. The last time the NFL realigned in
1970, three NFL teams _ the Browns, the Steelers and the Colts _
were paid $3 million each to move to the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   The realignment plan likely won't be voted on for almost two
years. It will take only 21 votes to pass because the Rams, Ravens
and Titans don't have votes as conditions of their franchise
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Expect realignment to cause one other scheduling change.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Cardinals play the 49ers, Falcons, Packers and
Lions as their four non-division NFC games. But beginning in 2002,
the NFC East would play the NFC Central one year, the NFC West
another and the proposed NFC South the third year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel that to have true winners, the more common
opponents you have, the better,'' Rooney said. &QL; 
McGinnis in running? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Redskins General Manager  &UR; Charley Casserley is expected
to land an executive position with the new Houston team.
</P>
<P>
   Two coaching candidates have surfaced _ Broncos offensive
coordinator
 &UR; Gary Kubiak, a former Texas A&AMP;M quarterback who was raised in
Houston, and Cardinals defensive coordinator  &UR; Dave McGinnis, a
Texas Christian University product who is from Snyder, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's my hometown and stuff, that's why it's a topic,''
Kubiak said. ``But I've got enough problems right here to worry
about.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis, who turned down the Bears' head coaching job last
January, said he is flattered that his name has been mentioned but
that his ``only concern is beating the Giants'' today. &QL; 
Lopsided rivalry &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rams have much history to overcome in today's game against
the 49ers in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   They've lost 17 consecutive times to the 49ers, the longest
current streak in the NFL and the third most lopsided streak in
league history.
</P>
<P>
   Only Buffalo, which lost 20 games in a row to Miami from 1970
through 1979, and Detroit, which has lost 18 in a row to the
Redskins, have longer losing streaks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the games between the 49ers and the Rams during the
streak haven't even been close. Fourteen of the 49ers' 17 victories
have been by 15 points or more.
</P>
<P>
   Often during the streak, the Rams gave the 49ers bulletin-board
material.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, former Rams safety  &UR; Toby Wright, a Mesa Dobson High
School product, said the 49ers were ``sweating bullets'' over
playing the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Rams wide receiver  &UR; Isaac Bruce said he
couldn't wait to step on the 49ers' throats. Another time,
cornerback  &UR; Todd Lyght said the Rams had better personnel than the
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the Rams' theme today:
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep your mouth shut,'' Bruce said. Play football.'' &QL; 
Honeymoon over &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things have gotten so bad in Denver, where the Super Bowl
champions are winless, a Broncos fan hit cornerback  &UR; Dale Carter
with a battery in last week's loss to the Jets at Mile High
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real surprised,'' Broncos quarterback  &UR; Bubby Brister
said. ``I've said since the day I got here that Denver has the best
fans in the country. They understood football, they were a little
smarter than the places I've been. But they turned hostile on us
last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Raiders wide receiver  &UR; Tim Brown, who will play against the
Broncos today in Oakland, called the actions of the Denver fans
``sad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two championships in a row, they have a down year with all the
major adjustments they have to make . . . they're bandwagon
jumpers,'' Brown said, ``and I guess they're jumping off the
bandwagon in Denver, which is unbelievable after a team wins
back-to-back Super Bowls.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos Coach  &UR; Mike Shanahan isn't worried about the fans. He's
furious about a story in this week's ``Sports Illustrated ''that
quotes an unidentified player as saying the team could go 0-8 and
finish 3-13.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan discussed the story at a team meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hey, I don't know if someone said that, but if
someone feels we're going to be 0-8 or we're going to wind up 3-13,
please let me know _ I'll send you out of here so quick. I don't
care if you want a bus ticket or a plane ticket. Just let me know.'
'' &QL; 
Quick kicks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Colts second-year quarterback  &UR; Peyton Manning is the latest NFL
player to get his own breakfast cereal _ Peyton's O's, a honey-nut
toasted cereal produced by the same company, Famous Fixins, that
made Jake's Flakes, Cardinals quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer's cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys quarterback  &UR; Troy Aikman on this year's upside-down
season: ``I don't know that anybody right now knows how good they
are.'' &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; THE TOP FIVE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. Dallas &QL; Before Cowboys fans book &QL; 
their Super Bowl trip, they &QL; 
should check Dallas' &QL; 
November schedule. &QL; 
 &QL; 
2. New England &QL; Has any unbeaten team
gotten less respect? &QL; 
 &QL; 
3. Green Bay &QL; Even retired, former Packer  &UR; Reggie White continues to
be a distraction. &QL; 
 &QL; 
4. Jacksonville &QL; The latest NFL feud is quarterback  &UR; Mark Brunell
vs.
Coach  &UR; Tom Coughlin. The quarterback will win. &QL; 
 &QL; 
5. Buffalo &QL; There's nothing sweeter to western New Yorkers than
annual fish fry of Dolphins. &QL; 
 &UR; THE BOTTOM FIVE &QL; 
 &UR; 31. Cleveland &QL; It's Bengals week, the Browns'
best chance to win this season. &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. Philadelphia &QL; How bad does QB  &UR; Doug Pederson have to get before
he
gets dumped? &QL; 
 &QL; 
29. Cincinnati &QL; Team President  &UR; Mike Brown wouldn't mind going 2-14
if
the victories were against the Browns. &QL; 
 &QL; 
28. Atlanta &QL; Attention: Coach  &UR; Dan Reeves. &UR; QB  &UR; Tony Graziani can't
play. &QL; 
 &QL; 
27. Denver &QL; Coach  &UR; Mike Shannahan's &UR; team will be a permanent fixture
in the cruddy quintet until it wins. &QL; 
ON THE RISE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Buffalo Bills: With home games the next two weeks against
Pittsburgh and Oakland, the surprising Bills could be 5-1. Their
offense is mediocre, but the defense, led by veteran  &UR; Bruce
 &UR; Smith, is one of the league's best. It has allowed only one
touchdown in the past three games. ``We know we have a lot of
talent,'' free safety  &UR; Kurt Schulz said. ``I don't know if the rest
of the NFL knows that, but I think we're proving that.'' &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tampa Bay Buccaneers: The Buccaneers could have the best
defense in the league since the 1985 Bears. But their offense is
27th overall, 28th in passing. Running backs  &UR; Warrick Dunn and
 &UR; Mike
 &UR; Alstott could play for anybody. Their young receivers are getting
better. The problem is quarterback  &UR; Trent Dilfer. He's not good
enough to take them to the next level. It's that simple.  &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bills Coach Wade Phillips, on how he celebrated Monday
 &UR; night's victory over Coach Jimmy Johnson's Dolphins: ``I didn't go
in and stomp on a can of hair spray or anything.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
ODD-SHAPED BALL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a logical reason why the Chiefs lost to the Chargers a
week ago. There weren't enough facts on the Internet for Chiefs
Coach  &UR; Gunther Cunningham to learn all he needed to know about the
Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Diego stinks,'' Cunningham said, referring to the amount
of information on the Internet about the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get any good information out of San Diego. When you
have a media outlet like San Diego, you might as well go to
Tijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   It saddens Cunningham that San Diego is a one-newspaper town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what people are saying about us,'' Cunningham
said. ``I want to know the little things about other teams. Or
maybe a player will slip and say something that will give me an
inkling of some change.'' &QL; 
SHORT SHOTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five of the league's top 15 rushers from a year ago aren't even
dressing for games, including the top four _ the Broncos'  &UR; Terrell
Davis (knee injury), the Falcons'  &UR; Jamal
 &UR; Anderson (knee), the 49ers'  &UR; Garrison Hearst (ankle) and the Lions'
 &UR; Barry Sanders (retirement).
</P>
<P>
   Colts Coach  &UR; Jim Mora doesn't agree with the assesment of the
Dolphins' Johnson that Miami quarterback  &UR; Dan Marino is slipping:
``How can you not say nice things about Dan Marino? My God. He's as
good as any quarterback to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs owner  &UR; Lamar Hunt was told ``thanks a million'' by a
reporter after Hunt returned his call. ``No, thanks to $700
million,'' said Hunt, referring to the price tag of Houston's
expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cardinals punter  &UR; Jeff Feagles of the Seahawks helped
save last week's victory against the Raiders with a punt that
stayed airborne for 5.2 seconds, the longest hang time of his
12-year career.

CARDS NEED DEFENSE VS. SCAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Federal court documents unsealed Thursday in
Austin claim that three current and three former Cardinals were
among the NFL players duped into investing $5.5 million in an
illegal scheme run by an Austin resident.
</P>
<P>
   The three current players _ defensive tackle Eric Swann, tight
end Johnny McWilliams and receiver Chad Carpenter _ all said Friday
that they did not invest a cent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they did or didn't really is their business. It will
come out in the process. Their names are in the court documents.
They more than likely will give depositions or be called as
witnesses against 29-year-old Brian Russell Stearns of Austin, who
was arrested at his home by FBI agents last month.
</P>
<P>
   The greater concern is how any shady figure gets to these guys.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy. Too easy. Scary easy.
</P>
<P>
   All three acknowledged being approached to invest in the scheme.
According to Swann, the contact was made in the parking lot at the
Cardinals' Tempe facility following a practice last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm approached by I bet four people a year out there with
stuff that you know is shady,'' Swann said. ``It's not right. They
shouldn't even be able to get that close to us.''
</P>
<P>
   He is absolutely correct.
</P>
<P>
   Though the building and practice fields are secured with locks,
guards and surveillance equipment, the players' parking lot is not.
There are hangers-on out there every day, most of them innocent
autograph-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   The players claimed Friday they were bright enough to see
through this scam. Swann said he had mentioned it to Carpenter, who
had been an intern with an investment brokerage firm and is
knowledgeable about such things. Carpenter notified NFL security,
he said. McWilliams, who according to documents invested $100,000,
said he, too, notified the league's security department.
</P>
<P>
   The unsealed court documents indicate that former players Lomas
Brown, now with the Cleveland Browns; Larry Centers, now with the
Washington Redskins; and Duval Love, now retired, invested.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents suspect the players invested in DFJ Italia, which was
operated by Stearns. He is accused of receiving $5.5 million from
players in a wire transfer from Los Angeles sports agent Robert
Caron, according to a report in the ``Austin American-Statesman.''
Contacted by the newspaper, Caron said, ``It's a complete surprise
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Court documents charge that Stearns worked with Florida
businessman Jerry Vosselman in telling investors they would have
access to secret overseas markets that would generate huge returns
over short terms _ guaranteed 40 percent every 35 days on some.
Only Stearns has been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they believe Stearns bilked $31 million from
investors from March 1998 until this July. Last week, Stearns also
was indicted by a federal grand jury in New York in connection with
$26 million allegedly defrauded from foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns is accused of using the money to support an extravagant
lifestyle that includes a $2.2 million home near Austin, two jet
aircraft, a helicopter and more than $1 million worth of vehicles.
The ``American-Statesman'' reported that Stearns began to float in
high political circles, including fund-raisers for President
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns' attorney, Laird Palmer, denied that Stearns was
involved in any criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is a wake-up call for the players.
</P>
<P>
   It also should be one for upper management: Secure the players'
parking lot. &QL;

USC RECEIVER HOSPITALIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Southern California wide receiver  &UR; R. Jay Soward was
knocked unconscious during a kickoff early in the fourth quarter of
Arizona's 31-22 victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to enter the game a few plays later but was pulled from
the field by the USC coaching staff. He was taken to a Tucson
hospital, where he underwent a CAT scan. The Trojans were planning
for him to stay at the hospital overnight as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   On a roll &QL; 
 &UR; Trung Canidate's 194 rushing yards are the second-highest total in
his Arizona career. The senior from Central High was at his best
last year against Arizona State with 288 yards. While at Arizona,
he has rushed for more than 100 yards 12 times.
</P>
<P>
   SACK 'EM: The Wildcats' seven sacks against USC equaled their
total for the season before kickoff. &QL; 
Among the best &QL; 
USC coach  &UR; Paul Hackett on Arizona receiver  &UR; Dennis Northcutt: ``He
is a game-turner, one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The best &QL; 
Arizona quarterback  &UR; Keith Smith says Northcutt has no rivals. ``I
keep hearing about Florida State's  &UR; Peter Warrick,'' Smith said of
the Seminoles receiver who was suspended last week after he was
charged with felony theft. ``But I'm convinced that Dennis is the
best receiver in the country right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Could be the best &QL; 
Smith also has no doubts about Northcutt's ability as a defensive
back, a position he also played against USC. ``In practice, I'm
scared to death every time I have to try to throw against him,''
Smith said. ``I'm glad he's on my side.'' &QL; 
Some leadership &QL; 
In a departure from prior seasons, Arizona has picked captains for
the rest of the season. On offense, they are Smith and Northcutt.
On defense, they are linebackers  &UR; DaShon Polk and  &UR; Marcus Bell. The
Wildcats had been selecting captains on a game-by-game basis.
Leadership has been a question this year. &QL; 
For the defense &QL; 
Arizona's defense didn't play like the one that was ranked last in
the Pac-10 Conference against the rush. ``That did not look like a
defense that gives up 5 yards a rush,'' Hackett said. ``I am going
to have to look at the films to see what went wrong. That was a
totally different run defense than what we had seen before.'' &QL; 
Briefly &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Dick Tomey was in Auburn, Calif., Friday to attend
memorial services for former Wildcats linebacker  &UR; Akil Jackson, who
died Tuesday from an allergic reaction. Jackson, 27, was a starter
in 1993 and 1994, Desert Swarm days.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Arizona Coach  &UR; Jim Young was honored Saturday at halftime for
his induction to the College Hall of Fame. Young, also a former
Purdue and Army coach, was at Arizona for three years in the mid
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, he coached the Wildcats to a Western Athletic
Conference title. Other inductees are former San Diego State Coach
 &UR; Don Coryell, former Eastern Kentucky defensive back  &UR; George Floyd
and ex-Tennessee linebacker  &UR; Steve Kiner. &QL;

UA'S NORTHCUTT A 1-MAN TEAM  
 COLLAPSES AFTER WIN VS. USC 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TUCSON _ Dennis Northcutt set an Arizona record for receiving
yardage, returned punts, scored a touchdown, played cornerback and
conducted interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Then he collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   An exhausted Northcutt fell flat on his face in a room beneath
Arizona Stadium on Saturday after meeting the media following the
Wildcats' 31-24 victory against Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   He was suffering from cramps, which were brought on by
dehydration after a long afternoon under a hot sun.
</P>
<P>
   He fell to the floor from a chair as Arizona Coach Dick Tomey
answered initial questions from the media. Tomey interrupted the
interview session and rushed to help his star receiver.
</P>
<P>
   As Tomey resumed the post-game news conference, Northcutt moaned
in evident pain. He was iced down by Arizona's medical staff, which
eventually lifted him from the concrete floor and out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a guy giving it up, giving all of it up,'' Tomey
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stark, yet dramatic moment summed up perhaps the best game
in what already has been a brilliant season for Northcutt.
</P>
<P>
   With his 121 yards on eight receptions, Northcutt became
Arizona's all-time leader in receiving yardage with 2,580. He also
is one game short of tying a Pac-10 record of 37 straight games
with at one catch.
</P>
<P>
   Those are impressive numbers on any scale. But a different scale
has begun to apply to Northcutt, a leading candidate for the
Biletnikoff Award, the prize given to the nation's best receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey is using his talent as often as possible. Late in the
second quarter, the senior lined up at cornerback, his position
when he arrived at Arizona as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't wind up with any interceptions. But his sudden
appearance on defense seemed to surprise the Trojans just enough to
knock them off-track.
</P>
<P>
   Northcutt said he had seen a look of bewilderment in the eyes of
USC receiver R. Jay Soward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lined up once, glanced my way and sort of stopped for a
second,'' Northcutt said before he collapsed. ``Then, on the next
play, I looked over at him and said: `Yes, this is me.' He just
looked back at me like he was stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, Northcutt was pressed into defensive duty because of
the overall weakness in the Arizona secondary. Northcutt said he
was asked if he could handle the additional work in preseason camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been working at it some for a few weeks,'' he said. ``But
this was the time. USC was the game to spring it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do whatever helps us win. God gave me the athletic
ability to play both ways. Ever since my freshman year, I've never
stopped doing defensive-back work.''
</P>
<P>
   For Northcutt, the win against USC was especially gratifying. He
grew up on the mean streets that surround the Trojans home field,
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot about USC,'' he said. ``I kind of grew up with
USC football. For me, I guess there is some motivation in that. We
had to win.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what. &QL;

ST. MARY'S GRAD LOSES KICKING JOB 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _  &UR; Jim Sanson knew this chance was his last.
</P>
<P>
   The Notre Dame senior kicker from Scottsdale missed a chip field
goal Saturday when the game against Arizona State was still
scoreless. In 12 tries going back to last season, Sanson has missed
nine. Not to mention 15 career missed extra points, particularly
the infamous 1996 misfire against Southern California that
conspired to keep the Irish out of the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sanson persevered and continued to outduel all comers in
practice until two short misses last week against Oklahoma, when a
loss would have left the Irish at 1-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Sanson knew the situation going into the game,'' said
Notre Dame Coach  &UR; Bob Davie, who turned to sophomore  &UR; David  &UR; Miller
after the 33-yard miss against ASU. ``He knew he had to be
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was just that, going 6 for 7 on extra points for his
first Irish points, with the exception being blocked. He did not
attempt a field goal but will from here out, Davie said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanson, a high-school teammate of ASU quarterback  &UR; Ryan Kealy,
who was his holder at St. Mary's, will continue to kick off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud of the way (Sanson) stayed in the game on kickoffs
and even got a touchback,'' Davie said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanson, close to tears afterward, said the weight of his spotty
career is heavy: ``I knew I only had one chance,'' he said. ``I
knew that going out. That was on my back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got booed going out there and booed coming in. That's usual
here at Notre Dame. I've gotten used to it. But in the back of my
mind all I was thinking about was being booed by the fans.'' &QL; 
Briefly &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ASU received $600,000 for the privilege of having its 48-17
embarrassment nationally televised by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being outscored, 77-25, in its first two tries against
Notre Dame, the Sun Devils hope to renew the series on the earliest
possible occasion. That won't be before 2008.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the Irish remain an independent in football, they
will have openings, and have told ASU officials that their Pac-10
preferences are Southern California, Washington, Stanford and the
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Some 4,000 Chicago-area ASU alumni attended the game, as did a
group of close to 200 Fiesta Bowl sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame (3-3) is perhaps No. 1 on the wish list of the Fiesta
Bowl-owned Insight.com Bowl in Tucson, although the Irish hope to
place themselves higher on the postseason pecking order. &QL;

IRISH QB BURIES PERSIST ENT GHOSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ Three consecutive passes for three
touchdowns. His longest career run in the first half, bettered in
the second for another score. A fourth passing touchdown, tying the
school record.
</P>
<P>
   Jarious Jackson not only buried Arizona State on Saturday but a
few more of the ghosts that persistently haunt Notre Dame
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Heisman winners: Angelo Bertelli, John Lujack, Paul Hornung,
John Huarte. Theismann and Montana, your not-so-average Joes,
following Terry Hanratty and leading to Steve Beuerlein.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Powlus never dodged the ghosts, regularly being booed even
while he wrapped up his career two years ago as the school career
passing yardage and touchdown leader. Jackson, the people's choice
over Powlus, came next.
</P>
<P>
   He was what Powlus wasn't, mobile, in taking the Fighting Irish
to a 9-1 record and the brink of a berth in the Bowl Championship
Series. But as he tried to run out the final three seconds of a win
over Louisiana State, Jackson was blindsided low and taken out of
the regular-season finale with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame lost for a third straight year to Southern California
then, with Jackson back but hurting, to Georgia Tech in the Gator
Bowl. The losing stretched to five out of six with this year's 1-3
start as Jackson battled a turf toe in agonizing defeats by a
combined 19 points to Michigan, Purdue and Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Jackson became the fall guy. Except that the
fifth-year senior is too good to be stepped on for long.
</P>
<P>
   His string of five consecutive passing games of 220 yards or
more seems repeatable against any of the Fighting Irish's six
remaining opponents except perhaps Tennessee. And with his toe
better and the offense jelling under new coordinator Kevin Rogers,
who's to say Jackson won't keep up his 100-yard rushing average of
the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is playing the best football of his career,'' third-year
Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie said. ``That is a special statement
considering all he has done for us at Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Snyder said it was a much improved Jackson who took out
his Sun Devils with five touchdowns and 316 yards of total offense.
Consider that Jackson passed for 69 yards with one touchdown and
rushed for 7 when the Irish won, 29-8, in Tempe last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Rogers has helped a lot with his diverse offense,''
Jackson said. ``That's the type of offense that can show my
talents. I'm concentrating more on being a better quarterback,
being more accurate on my throws, being more decisive on the option
pitches and trying not to turn the ball over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, I'm not taking any downs off right now.''
</P>
<P>
   With Notre Dame up, 27-0, thanks to his 3-for-3 touchdown
string, Jackson could have taken the second half off. Instead, he
took Davie's halftime critique of the Fighting Irish being ahead
but not in control to heart, ripping off a career-high 48-yard run
on a perfectly executed option.
</P>
<P>
   That was 4 yards longer than his first-half breakaway that only
a diving tackle by Courtney Jackson prevented from going for 50
yards and another rushing touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Davie labeled some of Jackson's early-season option decisions as
silly. But in bringing his team back from 30-14 to beat Oklahoma,
34-30, and against ASU, Jackson worked the defense like Silly
Putty.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have 3-4 defenders around you, you have nowhere else
to run, that's when you just fall down and go to the next play,''
Jackson said. ``When I have the offensive linemen and backs
standing up and I can see the blocking from a certain angle, then
I'll keep going for it.'' &QL;

KEALY STILL NO. 1, DESPITE MISCUES  
 BAD DECISIONS LEAD TO 3 INTERCEPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ When all was said and undone, Arizona State
quarterbacks coach John Pettas said, ``I still have confidence in
Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   But for how long?
</P>
<P>
   The two sides of ASU quarterback Ryan Kealy surfaced Saturday
against Notre Dame. He was on-target much of the time, taking
advantage of an offensive line that held its own against the
Fighting Irish.
</P>
<P>
   But he also made a handful of bad decisions that resulted in
three interceptions. One was returned for a touchdown, and the
other set one up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just got to regroup,'' Pettas said. ``I really thought he
was fine other than the critical mistakes. Take away the mistakes
and we'd be thinking differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy wasn't talking afterward, more out of frustration with
himself than with the media. No one on the team takes losses harder
than the junior quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shoulders a lot of the blame himself,'' Pettas said. ``But
he's the quarterback and that's the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy completed 18 of 30 passes for 196 yards and no touchdowns.
One interception was intended for Tariq McDonald but ``just got
away from him,'' Coach Bruce Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Another, that was intended for Delvon Flowers, was poorly thrown
and landed in the hands of safety A'Jani Sanders, who returned it
for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The last was a long pass downfield to Richard Williams that was
overthrown and intercepted by Deke Cooper. The Fighting Irish
scored one play later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Ryan was emotionally ready for this game,'' Snyder
said. ``I felt he threw the ball pretty well, excluding the
interceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks John Leonard and Griffin Goodman both saw playing
time in the second half. Leonard came into the game in the third
quarter and completed 2 of 4 passes for 21 yards. He led the drive
that resulted in Stephen Baker's 45-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman was 4 of 5 for 46 yards and a touchdown. He also
engineered the game-winning scoring drive against UCLA last week.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy had left last week's game because of injuries, but that
wasn't the case this time. Snyder and Pettas said afterward that
Kealy was cleared for the game to play and didn't express concern
about his health.
</P>
<P>
   Bruised ribs and an injured right knee have sidelined him much
of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Even though some disgruntled ASU fans may cry for a quarterback
change, don't look for it to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the three interceptions, Kealy didn't play himself out
of a job. And even though the backups show promise, neither one
made a strong enough argument to take over.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Kealy was upset afterward, Snyder said, ``Of
course. He cares a great deal about this football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder hopes that care translates into a victory. Soon.

UCLA DEFENSE DELIVERS AT FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ After being missing nearly as long as Amelia
Earhardt, the UCLA defense was discovered Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rose Bowl, of all places. Making a difference in a
football game, if you can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you heard about UCLA's defenders. Never around when you
needed them. As elusive as the Loch Ness Monster. Rumored, but
never actually seen. Much like Big Foot.
</P>
<P>
   A football team's defense is supposed to be its anchor. UCLA's
was its millstone, particularly last season when the Bruins scored
points in bunches _ and gave them up nearly as fast.
</P>
<P>
   Had the 1998 Bruins shown the slightest ability to cover and
tackle, they might have won the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA won its first 10 games thanks to Cade McNown &AMP; Co.; it lost
its last two behind the most inept defenders since France 1940.
</P>
<P>
   The most appalling demonstration was the nationally televised,
49-45 loss to Miami that knocked the Bruins out of the Fiesta Bowl
and made a first-round draft choice of a Hurricanes running back
named Edgerrin James. UCLA's defense that day gave up 689 yards and
what little remained of its self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA had the Pac-10's best offense in 1998 but its second-worst
defense, allowing a staggering 432 yards and 27.5 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   A new season brought more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   After five games (including three defeats), UCLA was giving up
453 yards and 28 points per game. It was torched by Stanford, then
allowed Arizona State to go the length of the field for a
game-winning, last-gasp drive.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game vs. Oregon at the Rose Bowl didn't augur any
improvement. In the first 65 seconds, the Ducks threw three passes
that went for a net 86 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon 7-0, just like that.
</P>
<P>
   Then a strange and wonderful thing happened: UCLA's defense
began making plays. A sack here. A deflected pass there. An
open-field tackle over there. Two fumble recoveries and an
interception that set up 14 UCLA points.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's offense disappeared. Its running game was stuffed. Its
passing offense was negated in a swarm of rushing Bruins linemen
and tight-covering DBs.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon quarterback A.J. Feeley completed only eight of his next
28 passes, and UCLA bolted to a 34-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' defense was the best unit in the game. It mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Then the offense, in a role-reversal, let Oregon back in the
game, giving up an 81-yard interception return for touchdown. And
the Ducks got hot.
</P>
<P>
   A 44-yard TD pass after a short UCLA punt. A 10-yard TD run
after a UCLA fumbled kickoff return. Suddenly, it was 34-29.
</P>
<P>
   But UCLA's defense stepped up again. And again and again. It had
to, because the offense couldn't muster even one first down to help
kill the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon had three possessions in the final 5:02, but the Bruins
stopped all three. One by interception. Another on downs. The last
by about 36 inches.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it was close, but that doesn't count.
</P>
<P>
   On the final drive, Oregon went 79 yards. It needed 80. On the
last play, the Ducks needed 21 yards. They got 20. Marshaun Tucker
was dragged down at the 1 by Joey Strycula and Joe Hunter, and the
final second ticked off.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA defense had won a game, even if the score was 34-29. For
the first time in a while, they made the plays they needed to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys played their butts off,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo
said of his defensive players.
</P>
<P>
   They played so hard, they won a game. That's news on the order
of man bites dog. At UCLA, it's also a relief.

PAUS GETS THE JOB DONE

<P>
   PASADENA _ Cory Paus doesn't want to hear about what he (begin
ital)can(end ital) do, or what he (begin ital)might(end ital) do.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he just (begin ital)did(end ital) it.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA freshman quarterback, ever earful of the constant
comparisons to a young Cade McNown, passed for 332 yards and two
touchdowns to carry the Bruins to a 34-29 Pac-10 football victory
over Oregon on Saturday night before 55,674 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Paus completed 21 of 34 passes with two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I played all right,'' he said. ``I had a few
mistakes, but as soon as I cut down on those mistakes, everything
is going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Bruins snapped a two-game losing streak, and with Paus
gaining more and more confidence, there is definitely a good vibe
in Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying all along Cory reminds me of Cade McNown, and
now he's progressing very well,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``I'm
pleased because he's throwing the ball so well, and I know Cory
will keep on improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus completed 3 of 4 for 34 yards on UCLA's first scoring
drive, culminating in Chris Griffith's 47-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Following an Oregon field goal that gave the Ducks a 7-3 lead,
Paus led UCLA on a 31-point spree this way:
</P>
<P>
   _His 31-yard pass to Danny Farmer set up Griffith's second field
goal, a 48-yarder cutting the gap to 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   _Two series later, he hit Farmer on a 11-yard TD with 38 seconds
remaining in the quarter to give UCLA a 20-10 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   _He connected with Farmer on a 48-yard deep post on the first
play of the second half, then hit Bryan Fletcher for 9 yards. Brown
scored on a 10-yard run three plays later.
</P>
<P>
   _Ahead by 17 points, he came through again, this time on a
65-yard touchdown pass to Farmer that started with him rolling
left, then firing a bomb across field.
</P>
<P>
   Paus' performance proved he has fully recovered from bruised
ribs suffered in his first start against Fresno State on Sept. 18.
He returned against Arizona State last week _ completing 15 of 40
for 235 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   However, he was still in pain and frequently rushed his passes
to avoid getting hit.
</P>
<P>
   On the day he was injured in his first start against Fresno
State, Paus had shown flashes of excellence. He completed his first
eight passes and was 9 for 12 for 113 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Paus has 905 yards passing, completing 52 percent, to go with
five TDs.

UCLA'S FARMER BACK IN A GROOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ It's no coincidence UCLA snapped a losing streak at
two games the night All-American receiver Danny Farmer emerged as
the Bruins' primary playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer connected with quarterback Cory Paus the way he teamed
with Cade McNown last year _ catching seven passes for 196 yards
and two touchdowns in UCLA's 34-29 victory over Oregon on Saturday
in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   His yardage total was the second-best in UCLA history, behind
J.J. Stokes' 263-yard performance against USC in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer, who missed most of training camp and all of two games
because of a sprained left ankle, is gradually finding his groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cory's settling down a lot, and the offensive line gave him a
lot of protection, a lot of time,'' Farmer said. ``I think I'm to
the point where I'm on the same page as the quarterback and the
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Home sweet home: Shaken and road weary, its season on the brink,
UCLA began the home-heavy portion of its schedule Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins play five of their last six games in Southern
California. Four are at the Rose Bowl, and the fifth, at USC, is a
few miles away at the Coliseum. The lone remaining road trip is
Oregon State, on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Bob Toledo believes the home-field advantage lies
not in the field or the familiar surroundings or a good night's
sleep _ the Bruins spend home Fridays in a Pasadena hotel, anyhow _
but in the crowd and the sideline support.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 rules limit travel squads to 60 players. Because the
offense and defense often huddle on the sideline when they aren't
playing, Toledo said, there aren't many bodies standing in support
of the unit on the field.
</P>
<P>
   But a team can dress as many players as it wants for home games
and rivalry games, so the Bruins will have constant support for
five of their last six.
</P>
<P>
   The home crowd helps, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a home-field advantage,'' Toledo said. ``It was a good
crowd, very vocal. It helped to motivate our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Precious hours: No one seemed to benefit from the 7:25 p.m.
kickoff more than Bruins tailback DeShaun Foster, who's recovering
from a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Had the game started at 12:30, Foster might not have played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are important hours,'' Toledo said. ``He can get a
couple more treatments in.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Foster played one snap, ran for 11 yards and tweaked
the ankle trying to cut. He spent the rest of the game on the
bench, his status for Saturday's game against Cal in question.
</P>
<P>
   Strange call: When UCLA's Ryan Nece blocked an Oregon punt in
the third quarter, it appeared the Bruins would have sparkling
field position to add to their 27-10 lead. Instead, Oregon retained
possession.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: After Nece's block, the ball hit UCLA's Gabe
Crecion, which signaled a change of possession. When Oregon
recovered the loose ball, it was awarded first down as if it had
been a normal UCLA fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great call, although I didn't tell them that at the
time,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Uniforms that don't conform: Oregon's new uniforms _ which
include an ``O'' on the helmet where the Duck used to be _ have
drawn mixed reaction. The black and green home jerseys are not as
popular as the white and green road uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The helmets are awesome and I think most people agree,'' Ducks
coach Mike Bellotti said. ``You always run the risk of change. We
talked about establishing a new tradition. It's an attempt to
change our image to a more aggressive nature.'' &QL;

UCLA HOLDS OFF OREGON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADEN _ Five-point lead, four seconds left, UCLA's defense on
the field. No, not a soul had left the Rose Bowl, especially those
who saw the last-minute collapse last week at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches told us to stand on the goal line and not let
anything behind us,'' Bruins safety Joey Strycula said. ``Once they
threw it in front of me, I knew we were OK.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Bruins held. They held by 1 yard _ 1 measly yard
_ as Oregon's final pass ended three feet short of the game-winning
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But close didn't matter in the aftermath of the Bruins' 34-29
victory Saturday before 55,674 at the Rose Bowl _ not to a UCLA
team that snapped its two-game losing streak and kept its
postseason hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of eerie, the same situation _ one minute left,
and they had to drive 80 yards,'' Strycula said, alluding to the
ASU game. ``I'm kind of relieved. We stopped them this time. It
feels great. We were so sick of hearing that crap about how the
defense (stinks).''
</P>
<P>
   It was a typically wild UCLA-Oregon game, with nine turnovers,
massive momentum shifts, 63 points and 897 yards offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins took a 20-10 halftime lead after forcing back-to-back
turnovers and converting them into two second-quarter touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   When UCLA opened the second half with two more touchdown drives
_ both ignited by long passes from quarterback Cory Paus to
receiver Danny Farmer _ its 34-10 lead seemed insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   But a Paus interception and Lovell Houston's fumbled kickoff
return quickly became Oregon touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 minutes left, UCLA's lead had dwindled to five.
</P>
<P>
   With four seconds left, the Ducks were 21 yards from victory.
But quarterback A.J. Feeley's pass to Marshaun Tucker, with
Strycula and Eric Whitfield defending, was one yard short of the
goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created a lot of our own agony, but we pulled it out,''
Bruins coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer and Paus were the standout performers. Farmer caught
seven passes for 196 yards, while Paus looked more comfortable than
he did against Arizona State and completed 21 of 34 passes for 332
yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's defense, with former coordinator Nick Aliotti on the
Ducks' sideline, played its best game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon scored 16 points off UCLA turnovers and did not generate
a lengthy scoring drive after the first quarter. The Bruins (3-3,
1-2) contained Oregon's running game and pressured Feeley into bad
throws and three turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we're better at is stopping big plays,''
linebacker Ryan Nece said. ``That's what has hurt us. But we're
developing an attitude, and we showcased that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks scored first, covering 84 yards on three plays on
their opening series for a 7-0 lead. The big play was a receiver
pass from Keenan Howry to Enyi Nwamuo for 38 yards to UCLA's 20.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon tailback Reuben Droughns fumbled on the next series,
giving UCLA possession at the Ducks' 20. But the Bruins, so
devastating in the red zone last year, did nothing with the
opportunity _ gaining one yard in three plays before Chris
Griffith's line drive field goal was blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon had a chance to take command when UCLA's Ryan Roques
fumbled a punt at the 21. But the Bruins held for three downs at
their 1, forcing the Ducks to kick an 18-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA offered a quick riposte, moving 45 yards in seven plays.
The biggest was a 31-yard pass from Paus to Farmer. Four plays
later, Griffith boomed a 48-yarder, and Oregon's lead was 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   The goal-line stand seemed to energize UCLA's defense. First,
defensive end Santi Hall sacked Feeley and forced a fumble that was
recovered by linebacker Billy Pieper at Oregon's 18. Three plays
later, Keith Brown rumbled around left end for the Bruins' first
touchdown and a 13-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of Oregon's next possession, Feeley threw an
errant crossing pass to Tucker. Bruins linebacker Marcus Reese
stepped in front for the interception, giving UCLA possession at
the Ducks' 33. On third-and-one from the 11, Paus hit Farmer on a
curl route in the end zone, and UCLA had a 20-10 lead as the half
ended.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's big lead began to unravel when Paus' short pass to the
left side was intercepted by linebacker Matt Smith, who raced 81
yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks scored on their next possession, then again a few
minutes later, when Houston's fumbled kickoff return gave Oregon
first down on UCLA's 21.

 &HT;    Bush's idea of conservativism criticized
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Seven months into his presidential campaign,
George W. Bush is discovering the bumps in the middle of the
political road.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is getting traction with his effort to show that his
self-styled ``compassionate conservative'' label is not oxymoronic,
the strategy also invites attacks from the party's right lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wobbly moderate,'' is how GOP foe Gary Bauer tags Bush's brand
of politics. And Steve Forbes, in an upcoming high-dollar TV ad
campaign, will target what Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col
calls ``Bush's moderate mush.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism, and thanks to fund raising and poll
numbers indicating it would take a political earthquake to shake
his hold on the party nomination, Bush has not allowed the sniping
from the right to divert him from his more moderate message.
</P>
<P>
   It's a path not without peril. ``I think he's a
middle-of-the-roader,'' said Bob Mann, a New Jersey home-school
parent who recently heard Bush speak and doesn't think the Texas
governor is conservative enough. ``With the `compassionate
conservative,' he's trying to play both camps.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that kind of criticism, several recent developments
indicate Bush shows no signs of swerving from the path that's made
him the front-runner. In fact, some of the events offer evidence of
an effort to move more toward the middle as Vice President Al Gore
faces the possibility of having to veer left to fend off a suddenly
serious challenge from Democratic rival Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Three recent events show Bush as a candidate who believes he
cannot be defeated from the right, a development allowing him to
chart the kind of centrist path to the White House made famous by
Bill Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   When congressional Republicans devised a bill to finance their
spending plans by delaying payment of tax credits for working-class
families, Bush cautioned against balancing the budget on the backs
of the poor. Within days, the plan was dead. The move could help
protect him against ongoing efforts by the Democratic National
Committee to show Bush is in lock-step with a GOP Congress not
widely viewed as the model of lawmaking efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   When the Christian Coalition gathered this month in Washington,
Bush offered up his standard stump speech and made no mention of
school prayer, gay rights and other issues of burning concern to
social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got the warmest reception of the candidates at the meeting
and drew this seal of approval, on national TV, from Christian
Coalition President Pat Robertson: ``I think he's committed to the
agenda, but at the same time he's running for president. He's aware
of that. He's aware that he needs to be portrayed as a centrist
candidate.'' Robertson, though still a Bush fan, later cautioned
that Bush's more recent criticism of the GOP could ``alienate the
core conservatives of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in announcing education policy, Bush went out of his
way to scold his own party for too often being `d on the
national economy, to the exclusion of all else _ speaking a sterile
language of rates and numbers, of CBO this and GNP that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often,'' Bush said, ``on social issues, my party has
painted an image of America slouching toward Gomorrah.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Bush softened up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was making the case that the conservative philosophy is a
compassionate philosophy,'' he said. ``I'm talking from my heart,
and I hope the Republican Party appreciates it.''
</P>
<P>
   BACKLASH FROM GOP HARD-LINERS
</P>
<P>
   But some within the party did not. From the right, vitriol
flowed from Bauer, an aggressive campaigner who believes every
half-step of his campaign is worthy of a news release. (Last week's
highlight: ``Prominent African-American Pastors from Alaska Endorse
Gary Bauer.'')
</P>
<P>
   On the same day Bush spoke of the GOP's focus on ``rates and
numbers,'' Bauer torched him.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush this week sent Republican conservatives an
unmistakable message: I don't need you,'' he said. ``Mr. Bush is
distancing himself from the conservatives in the Republican Party
and running as a wobbly moderate under the banner of compassion.
This is seen most clearly in his embrace of big-government,
Washington-knows-best nostrums on education.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's education plan, fleshed out in a speech last week in
Manhattan, calls for federally mandated annual testing by the
individual states of all third- through eighth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also said Bush is ``AWOL in the culture war, which is
hardly surprising in view of the hundreds of thousands of dollars
the Hollywood elite have contributed to his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer told Bush to take a hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not need to weaken or water down our conservative
message in order to counter the false and distorted caricature of
conservatives as uncaring and lacking compassion as offered up in
the elite liberal media,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes his conservative credentials are confirmed by the
kind of people _ including experts from Stanford University's
Hoover Institution _ who are helping him devise policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Bauer, not content with Bush's day-after attempt to soften
his criticism of the GOP, said, ``the front-runner weasels and
waffles and tries to explain away his comments by saying he did not
mean what plainly he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, coming from the right and standing ready with an ad
campaign that will brand Bush as a tax-and-spender, said Bush
``clearly comes across as being embarrassed by the basic principles
of his party _ more freedom and less government.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also fielded some flak from the conservative whose voice
reaches more Americans every day than any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``My humble opinion,'' said radio commentator Rush Limbaugh,
``and for what it's worth to the W. campaign: You people shouldn't
be running to the left of congressional Republicans. You should be
even further to the right than they are. More tax cuts, stronger
defense. Break the back of the liberal monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   BACKING FROM BOTH CAMPS
</P>
<P>
   But Bush backer Mary Matalin, a former political adviser to the
elder George Bush, said on CNN that Bush's efforts have been
misread by conservatives who are criticizing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not compromising his principles, he's not running against
Congress,'' Matalin said. ``He's trying to undo the damage done by
Democratic demagogues who defined, wrongly, the conservative
movement. He's recasting it for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also got an attaboy that could provide fuel for foes who
fear Bush is dangerously moderate. U.S. House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt of Missouri praised Bush in a letter to the
governor Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that your influential relationship with House
Republicans may have helped convince some of them that (proposing
to stretch out payment of the earned income tax credit) was a bad
idea that should be rejected,'' Gephardt told Bush. ``I hope this
is just the first step you will take to provide guidance to try and
steer House Republicans towards the mainstream on a number of other
critical issues. You often say that conservatism can indeed be
compassionate. Unfortunately, your allies in the Republican
leadership just don't get it _ compassion isn't at the top of their
agenda. I hope that you will use your position as the Republican
front-runner to help set the House Republican leadership back
towards the center.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a peculiar twist that could help Bush on the GOP side,
the National Abortion Rights Action League _ not meaning to help _
said Friday that Bush has earned his conservative credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a meeting with leaders of the Christian right, Bush
reassured conservatives that he was not soft on the abortion
issue,'' the group noted, referring to a press account of a Bush
meeting last month with conservative leaders.

many of them. According to Catholic and Jewish theologians,
followers of those faiths often are put off by politicians' talk
about faith and religion. That's because the talk generally sounds
like evangelical Protestant faith. (Elizondo, Austin

</P>
<P>
   BRIDGE-OPERA-OPENING (Chicago) _ In the aftermath of the world
premiere of ``A View From the Bridge,'' four years after it was
commissioned from the composer William Bolcom and the librettist
Arnold Weinstein, the creators and performers were ebullient,
thrilled by the enthusiasm of an overall audience reaction that
seemed to confirm their highest hopes. Part of The Creation of an
Opera series. By Bruce Weber.
</P>
<P>
   BRIDGE-OPERA-REVIEW (Chicago) _ Although it does not break new
ground in the genre, or even attempt to, ``A View From the
Bridge,'' the new opera based on Arthur Miller's 1955 play, is an
admirable and often affecting work that convincingly solves the
problem of translating this play into an opera. By Anthony
Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   MUSEUM-MAYOR-NOCOMMENT (New York) _ Within a week after Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani first threatened to evict the Brooklyn Museum of
Art over the ``Sensation'' exhibit, so many of the city's
high-profile art institutions signed a letter objecting to his
actions that it was the holdouts who were conspicuous by their
absence. Few of the abstaining organizations would comment on the
issue, which has been a widespread and often impassioned topic of
conversation around the city. By Barbara Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   WRITERS-ON-WRITING (Undated) _ For many decades now I have been
a fiction writer, and from the first I was aware that mine was a
questionable occupation. The Writers on Writing series, this week
by Saul Bellow.
</P>
<P>
   SOULS-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ At the heart of Martin Booth's
novel, ``The Industry of Souls,'' is a story of darkness and light:
a light that shines not only in the fields, woods and vegetable
gardens of the Russian town of Myshkino _ from the incipient
thawing of the 1970s to the post-communism of today _ but more
singularly, in this Tolstoyan tale, in the black tunnels of
Sosnogorsklag. By Richard Eder.
</P>
<P>
   LIMON-DANCE-REVIEW (New York) _ The Limon Dance Company has come
up with a winner in its company premiere and revival of Sophie
Maslow's 1948 ``Champion,'' a terse tale about an antihero, a man
of the people who exploits the people. By Anna Kisselgoff.
</P>
<P>
   TV-DATELINE-REVIEW (Undated) _ When it comes to eyewitness
testimony, you can't always believe your eyes. Such is the lesson
of Monday's ``Dateline'' report on a Greenwich Village murder in
November 1990. By Walter Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   FINANCIAL

</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-PRIVACY (Undated) _ So far, on issues of consumer
privacy, Internet companies have prevailed upon government
regulators to allow the industry to police itself. Thanks to the
online industry's campaign, led by Christine Varney, a former FTC
commissioner, the self-policing approach seems to be prevailing on
both sides of Atlantic _ but at what cost to consumers? By Steve
Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL-FILMS (Hollywood) _ After a disastrous 1998, with
box-office flops like ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' and ``Meet Joe
Black,'' Universal Films is having its most profitable year ever,
on the strength of movies that include ``Notting Hill'' and
``American Pie.'' Is this the result of Universal's management
makeover or simply a string of good luck? By Rick Lyman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   APPLE-SOFTWARE-RESURGENCE (Cupertino, Calif.) _ Much has been
said and written about the turnaround at Apple Computer in recent
years. But the seeds of Apple Computer's remarkable renaissance
were sown in a contentious meeting that took place here in January
1997 and that involved the unsung part of Apple's business:
software. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT (Undated) _ When the Clinton administration
recently announced plans to relax restrictions on exports of
data-scrambling software, a key fact that escaped notice was that
the new policies affect only shrink-wrapped software, not the
original source code _ the lines of instructions that programmers
actually write. The exclusion threatens to constrain software
developed under the ``open source'' model, most notably the Linux
operating system. By Peter Wayner.
</P>
<P>
   HDTV-STANDARDS (Washington) _ Facing angry opposition, nearly
300 of the nation's 1,600 television stations filed a petition with
the Federal Communications Commission on Friday, formally
requesting a revision in the nation's digital-television standard
that was approved almost three years ago. By Joel Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   E-COMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) _ Companies hoping to do business on
the Web are being bombarded with more ``solutions'' than ever _ all
promising to provide services that address the problem of how to
set up shop online. By Bob Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
   DIGICOM-COLUMN (Undated) _ The technology sector's blazing
financial success in the last three years has been largely a North
American phenomenon. But some forward-thinking investors have been
moving offshore toward untapped markets and investments, often
pushing communication technologies into underdeveloped countries in
Latin America and Asia. By Denise Caruso.
</P>
<P>
   CONFERENCE-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ The theme of the 1999 annual
conference of the Association of National Advertisers is ``Brand
Building for the 21st Century.'' But it might as well be called
``Payback Time III.'' That's because for the third consecutive
year, the advertiser association is selling sponsorships of daily
general sessions of the conference to media companies seeking to
promote themselves to an audience of potential clients. By Stuart
Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-ONLINE-MEDIA (London) _ As Britain's broadsheet
newspapers eye the Web, their traditional, no-holds-barred
competition has taken a new turn and the fabled wars of what used
to be known as Fleet Street have spilled into cyberspace. By Alan
Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   DEFINING-NEWS-MEDIA (Undated) _ How do you decide what is news?
These days, there are so many outlets and news organizations or
quasi-news organizations pumping out information that many things
seem to matter, at least for a moment. A better question may be,
How do you decide what news lasts? Media column by Felicity
Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   REPORTER-SOURCES-MEDIA (Los Angeles) _ A reporter for a magazine
published by a civil rights group has been subpoenaed to provide
tape recordings and notes of an interview with a defendant in an
allegedly race-motivated murder case, after she told a federal
investigator that the man acknowledged committing a murder. By
Christian Berthelsen.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the stilted linguistic standards of government reports, the
Federal Trade Commission gave the online industry a pistol whipping
in June 1998. After reviewing the privacy practices of World Wide
Web sites, the commission told Congress that the industry had
``fallen far short of what is needed to protect consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a tiny fraction of Web sites, the FTC noted, told people
what the sites did with the personal information they collected _
names, e-mail addresses, credit card numbers. Even fewer sites
offered consumers any choice about how their personal data were
used, allowed them to access the data or gave assurances of its
security.
</P>
<P>
   Industry self-regulation, the FTC concluded, was not working.
</P>
<P>
   Its scathing report increased the chances that Congress would
enact sweeping Internet privacy legislation. And the findings
hardened resolve in Europe to reject the American self-regulatory
approach to privacy online, a dispute that threatened to escalate
into the first Internet trade war.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Varney, the commission's Internet activist until she
left in August 1997, had long warned the industry that if it did
not move to shoulder responsibility on privacy, the government
would surely step in. Suddenly, that threat seemed imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, two months before the FTC report was released, a group of
companies had already taken a collective first step toward trying
to shore up the Internet industry's credibility on privacy, fend
off regulation and deflect a trade war with Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, 1998, some 60 lawyers, lobbyists and executives
gathered in an 11th floor conference room at IBM's Washington
office, representing several companies that included America
Online, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, plus a few trade groups
like the Direct Marketing Association.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of urgency at that afternoon meeting. ``We
realized we had to make a lot of progress in a short time on the
privacy issue,'' recalled Marc Berejka, Microsoft's manager of
government affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The group formed that day, the Online Privacy Alliance, now has
nearly 100 corporations and associations as members, and it has
done a remarkable job in turning the public debate over Internet
privacy in the industry's direction.
</P>
<P>
   And in a switch of roles of the kind so unremarkable in
Washington, the person heading the industry alliance, as its legal
counsel and spokeswoman, is Ms. Varney, the same FTC commissioner
who led the government's efforts to safeguard privacy on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Her success, privacy advocates say, has been as a Washington
insider guiding a shrewd campaign of persuasion and not, as the
industry alliance asserts, in prodding online companies to adopt
meaningful privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   But even her critics admire her work. ``Christine Varney has
been enormously effective in her role _ she's a cheerleader for an
industry self-regulatory approach that she believes in,'' said Marc
Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, a civil liberties advocacy group. ``The problem is that you
now have the government taking its lead from industry on the
privacy issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Judgments about the Online Privacy Alliance vary. But there is
no disputing that the group has strengthened the standing of those
who believe that a hands-off approach is the wisest Internet
policy. The group has blunted the drive for broad Internet privacy
legislation or strict government regulation. Its efforts have won
praise from the FTC. And the group has even made headway on
impressing Europe's trade negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out as to whether self-regulation will work,
but there is no doubt that the industry has made a lot of progress
on the Internet privacy issue in the last year or so,'' said Robert
Pitofsky, chairman of the FTC. ``And if the industry keeps making
as much progress as it has recently, I don't see how you can really
argue that we need legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old Ms. Varney, who served as secretary to the
Cabinet in the Clinton White House before joining the FTC in
October 1994, is a lawyer at Hogan &AMP; Hartson, a Washington law
firm, where she is building an Internet-law practice. Her pedigree
made Ms. Varney very attractive to the companies assembling the
industry privacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was perfect,'' said Jill Lesser, vice president for
domestic public policy for America Online Inc. ``She had really
pushed this issue at the FTC, so she had credibility with
government and with consumer groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Varney has no qualms about her labors on the industry's
behalf. She sees her role as a continuation of her work as a
privacy advocate and not as a compromise of the principles she
espoused during her government service.
</P>
<P>
   She is not opposed to regulation per se, Ms. Varney says, and
she urged the industry alliance to get ahead of its critics by
pushing for a privacy law tailored for children. The industry group
did encourage Congress to enact the Children's On-Line Privacy
Protection Act of 1998, passed last October, which requires Web
sites to obtain parental permission before collecting any personal
information from children under 13.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, however, Ms. Varney believes regulation should be
a last resort, filling the breach if the private sector fails,
especially in Internet markets, which change so quickly,
undermining the effectiveness of traditional regulation. ``I think
we can have a market-driven approach to privacy on the Internet,''
she said. ``And, at least, this experiment with self-regulation is
worth doing. Let's see if the marketplace can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are encouraging signs of progress. In early 1998, when the
FTC surveyed 1,400 commercial Web sites, only 14 percent gave users
any notice of how they handled personal information. In early 1999,
a Georgetown University survey of some 360 heavily trafficked Web
sites _ a study requested by the FTC and paid for by the industry _
found that 66 percent gave users some notice of how they handled
personal data.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 66 percent is pretty astonishing from where we were a
year ago,'' Ms. Varney observed. ``From my perspective, that means
that self-regulation is working.''
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates point to other numbers as evidence that
self-regulation is failing. They note, for example, that the 1999
Georgetown survey also found that only 10 percent of Web sites
included the four touchstones of what the FTC calls ``fair
information practices'': notifying users of the sites' data
collection practices; giving users a choice of opting out; giving
them access to personal data; and assuring them that their personal
data were secure.
</P>
<P>
   The same four principles also serve as the basis for the Online
Privacy Alliance's voluntary guidelines, but critics say the
principles are too vaguely worded, giving companies too much
leeway. ``And those policies are just window-dressing unless they
are backed up by a credible system of enforcement,'' said Deborah
Hurley, director of Harvard University's Information Infrastructure
Project.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The industry has financed independent privacy monitoring
organizations, like eTrust and BBB Online. Even so, enforcement
remains an issue for privacy groups and in negotiations between the
United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   To date, much of the development of privacy practices online has
been by the marketplace, responding to complaints, often by the
thousands. In 1997, for example, when word spread that America
Online planned to pass along customers' telephone numbers to
telemarketers and other direct-sales merchants, the big Internet
service provider heard a consumer outcry _ and quickly dropped the
plan.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Likewise Amazon.com, the big online bookstore, ran into a
backlash last month when it posted ``purchase circles,'' which
showed the book buying habits of users from selected companies and
universities. Some users found this a breach of privacy without
consent and asked to be removed. After asking employees for their
reaction, IBM Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr. received 5,000 e-mail
responses within hours. More than 90 percent objected to having
their book-buying habits as a group disclosed online.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was removed from the book-purchase circles. Later, Gerstner
wrote to Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.com, saying, ``I'm
certainly not going to tell you how to run your business, but I do
urge you to view this as an enormously important issue.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Some online privacy issues have surfaced case by case. Last
year, for example, a customer service representative at America
Online told a Navy investigator the real name of a naval officer
who had identified himself by the screen name ``Tim'' and listed
his marital status as ``gay.'' Later, America Online reached an
out-of-court settlement with the officer and adopted new policies
to protect the privacy of its customers. America Online's thousands
of customer service representatives are now given special
``scenario training'' to insure that they do not give out private
information about users without the users' consent or a court
order.
</P>
<P>
   This trial-and-error, market-driven approach to privacy,
Internet executives note, has often resulted in stricter practices
than those, for example, of the credit card and catalog industries.
Besides, they add, a rapid response system for customers is built
into the Internet, where e-mail complaining and chat room
organizing can punish companies more quickly and more severely than
government regulations can.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, good privacy policy is good business
for us,'' said Robert Pittman, president of America Online. ``It's
very important to our members. We've learned that anything you do,
you have to think through the prism of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not always perfect,'' Pittman added. ``But if we miss
something, our members tell us in one big hurry.''

<P>
   Most online consumers, apparently, are willing to fend for
themselves on the increasingly commercial Internet. A survey by
Privacy and American Business, a research firm, found that 86
percent of 460 adult Internet users questioned earlier this year
said they wanted to be able to essentially ``trade'' their own
personal information with Web sites _ as long as they were properly
informed about how their data were used and were offered benefits
for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky, the FTCan, points to those survey results as
the reason he is ``willing to be patient to see if self-regulation
works.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yet many people argue that some basic legislation to protect
individual privacy on the Internet is inevitable _ and that it
could both benefit consumers and stimulate the growth of e-commerce
by fostering greater public trust in doing business on line. Such
sentiments extend well beyond the traditional champions of
government intervention like privacy advocates and consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Berners-Lee, the British physicist who created the basic
software for the Web, is the director of the World Wide Web
Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His
consortium is working on privacy-enhancing technology, software
that holds a person's privacy preferences and can communicate and
bargain on an individual's behalf over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Berners-Lee said: ``On privacy, I don't think that
self-regulation is enough. In America, I believe that the lack of
regulation means that the corporate marketers have too much
power.''
</P>
<P>
   That power seems certain to increase in the near future. The
spread of Internet technology will result in a data collection
network of previously unimagined reach as telephones, televisions,
cars and appliances _ not just personal computers _ are connected
to the global digital network before long. And the rapidly
developing fields of data-mining and profiling software will enable
corporations to increasingly slice and search through this ocean of
data to identify personal patterns of buying and behavior _ and
make inferences, accurate or not, about a person's likely behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The unnerving prospect, according to Paul Saffo, a director for
the Institute for the Future, is that ``we will all be players in
what could be a fairly inaccurate virtual Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake, technologists say, is far more than who gets which
Internet marketing pitches. Profiling, they say, could be employed
to determine who gets _ and who is excluded from _ all kinds of
opportunities like jobs, housing and education.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC is also studying the use and potential abuse of
increasingly powerful Internet software. The commission has
scheduled a public workshop on ``online profiling'' in November.
</P>
<P>
   Digital red-lining, Ms. Varney says, is an evocative term and a
troubling concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that this technology could be hugely
invasive,'' she said. ``But it could also be enormously empowering
by allowing individuals to make their own choices and by saving us
all time and money. Particularly in the future, we will face more
difficult decisions and trade-offs. But I think that argues for
leaving those decisions to the marketplace for privacy as much as
we can.''

   CUPERTINO, Calif. _ Much has been said and written about the
turnaround at Apple Computer Inc. in recent years, as measured by
its return to profitability, the resurgence of its share price and
the explosive sales of its fruit-colored iMac machines. But in
fact, the seeds of Apple Computer's remarkable renaissance were
sown in a contentious meeting that took place here in January 1997
and that involved the unsung part of Apple's business: software.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was held only days after Apple's chairman at the
time, Gilbert Amelio, purchased Steven Jobs' Next Computer. Next's
chief software designer, Avidis Tevanian, was huddling for the
first time with Apple's top engineers. The session, according to
several people who participated, escalated into a shouting match
between Tevanian and the head of Copland _Apple's troubled effort
to create a next-generation operating system.
</P>
<P>
   As Tevanian recalls the meeting, he simply stated that he was in
charge and that, because he had a deep technical grounding in
computer science, it would be impossible for programmers to pull
the wool over his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But to several of Apple's beleaguered managers, it sounded as if
Tevanian was arrogantly telling them that Next had just acquired
Apple and that he was taking over.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever actually transpired, Tevanian recalls leaving the
meeting with the belief that Apple's technical culture was severely
flawed. ``There were people who were saying, `We're going to work
on what's cool and we're not going to be held accountable,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Today that is an impression of Apple Computer that no longer
applies.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian won the confrontation, the Copland effort was
subsequently scrapped and most of Apple's software managers were
forced from the company.
</P>
<P>
   The revamping of Apple's software effort is the untold story
behind Apple's turnaround, which has led to two consecutive
profitable years; a rebound from the single digits to more than 10
percent in the company's PC industry market share, and Apple's
buoyant stock price, which closed on Friday at $65.5625, more than
double its price 52 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while almost all of the reporting on Apple's reversal in
the wake of Amelio's ouster and Jobs' return to Apple as ``acting''
chief executive in July 1997 has focused on the company's
reinvigorated industrial design, new products and glitzy marketing,
it is the story of the steady improvement of Apple's existing
Macintosh software operating system that has done the most to
solidify the company's loyal customers, while giving the computer
maker a means for attracting new ones.
</P>
<P>
   And while Jobs, 44, has carefully presented himself as the
single public face of the revitalized computer maker (which he
co-founded in 1976), it is Tevanian, 38, working largely outside of
the public eye, who has re-energized Apple's programming force and
sharpened its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 23, Apple plans to begin shipping Mac OS 9, the fifth
upgrade of its operating system software since Tevanian came to
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Such a prolific series of updates bespeaks a discipline and
efficiency that is not only new for Apple, but rare in the software
industry. And the new operating system will have a range of new
features that are expected to be highly attractive to current and
potential Macintosh users. Significantly, too, a number of the new
wrinkles, including an improved version of its Sherlock search
tool, seamless Internet file sharing and a simple password
``keyring'' that keeps all of a user's security information in one
place, are innovations not found in Microsoft's industry-dominant
Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new version comes as Microsoft is visibly struggling
with its own software development system, and the computer industry
is watching carefully to see how quickly and completely Microsoft
will be able to ship a more solid and bug-free version of its
Windows NT operating system, recently renamed Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives acknowledge that they are well aware of
Apple's new software virtuosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've noticed,'' said Yusuf Mehdi, a Microsoft executive who
ran the company's marketing effort for Windows 98. ``They've gotten
their software act together.''
</P>
<P>
   But the best testimony comes from Apple's software developers _
the outside programmers who create software that runs on the Mac OS
and who are benefiting from Apple's rising computer sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple developers like to complain and it was easy to complain
in the early 1990s,'' said David Shayer, a developer at Sentient
Software, a small Macintosh software firm in San Carlos, Calif.
``But although I may not like Steve Jobs, I'm selling software.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The change at Apple is largely the result of a rare chemistry
between Jobs and Tevanian. Jobs is legendary for both his aesthetic
sense, which is not often found in the computer industry, and his
willingness to take risks and gamble on new and unproven
technology. Tevanian has a reputation for staying focused and being
pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs lectured his original team of Apple Macintosh programmers
that ``real artists ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian has adopted a variation of that theme. ``Shipping
software is a good thing,'' he said during a recent interview in
his office, where he sits surrounded by computer monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Over 13 years of working together, initially in the face of
adversity at Next, which was never financially successful, Jobs'
well-chronicled mercurial qualities have been matched by the
ability of Tevanian, who is known as Avie, to be the consummate
engineering manager _ tough but even-keeled. Significantly, it was
Tevanian and not Jobs who took the witness stand earlier this year
during the Microsoft antitrust trial to recount the story of
Apple's bitter behind-the-scenes dealings with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The two men met in the mid-1980s, after Jobs lost his battle for
control of Apple Computer with its president, John Sculley, when
Macintosh sales were slow to take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was traveling to different campuses trying to get a better
understanding of the education marketplace and Avie was a starving
graduate student, so I took him to dinner,'' Jobs recalled. At the
time, Tevanian was already well known in elite computer science
circles for his role in developing a modernized version of the Unix
operating system, known as Mach, while he was at Carnegie Mellon
University.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs wooed Tevanian by telling him that he was willing to bet
his new computer company Next on the Mach software. In return,
Tevanian agreed to join the small start-up, turning down a
competing job offer from Microsoft.

   &UR;  &LR; Bud Tribble, now a Sun Microsystems executive, was a manager at
Next when Tevanian came aboard in 1988, fresh from Carnegie Mellon
with a Ph.D. in computer science. He recalls Tevanian as being
``self-confident and bright'' and quickly rising to run Next's
software operating system group.
</P>
<P>
   ``A key quality, shared by many who successfully work for Steve
Jobs, is that he could definitely hold his own with Steve,''
Tribble said. ``I think Steve admires that, as long as it is clear
that the person really knows what they are talking about.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Tevanian's friends say that for many years, during which Next's
software received high technical marks but failed to catch hold in
the PC marketplace, Tevanian would often speak wistfully about the
large number of Microsoft stock options he had forgone by signing
on with Next. But Tevanian's patience has been vindicated. In 1997,
when he left Next to come to Apple, he received almost 400,000
Apple stock options, potentially worth $27 million at the stock's
current price.
</P>
<P>
   But then it is Tevanian's role in bringing new rigor to Apple's
software operation that has had much to do with the company's
improved financial standing. Apple's operating system strategy,
which is based on shipping a major release each year and a minor
upgrade six months later, is already contributing significantly to
the company's profitability. Although the numbers are not reported
separately in Apple's annual report, Jobs said last week that Mac
OS was now contributing $50 million a year in profit to the
computer maker, which had $300 million in total profit in 1998.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Turning Apple's decade-and-a-half-old operating system into a
cash cow has been one of Jobs' cleverest accomplishments since
returning to Apple. When he sold Next to Apple in late 1996, many
people in the computer industry expected that Apple would simply
replace its aging Mac OS with Nextstep, the elegant but
commercially unsuccessful operating system developed by Tevanian.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jobs has chosen an approach of gradually trickling the
Next technology into the Mac OS, while continually pushing back the
introduction of a completely new operating system, now known within
the company as Mac OS X.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs said in a recent interview that customer test versions of
Mac OS X would appear early next year, but that a final version
would not reach the market until later in 2000 _ a significant
delay, compared with the original timetable, which called for the
new system to appear by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Several former and present Macintosh software engineers, who
would speak only if they were not identified, said the company
still had an imposingly large amount of work left to finish on the
project. That would suggest that Jobs and Tevanian, for all their
success in updating the current Mac OS, may have simply succeeded
in delaying the same crucial transition that the company failed to
make nearly three years ago, when it canceled its ambitious but
troubled Copland project.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than merely delaying a potentially wrenching
transition, Jobs contends that he realized there was still plenty
of potential growth in the existing Mac OS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that we were the owners and caretakers of one of
only two high-volume operating systems in the world, and that this
was a wonderful place to be,'' he said.

RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT NEWS LASTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn., N.Y., Mass.)   (jw) 
 By   FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any journalist who gives a talk to a lay audience is almost
certain to be asked, ``How do you decide what's news?''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the question may need to be rephrased. There are so
many outlets and news organizations or quasi-news organizations
pumping out information that many things seem to matter, at least
for a moment. A better question may be, ``How do you decide what
news lasts?''
</P>
<P>
   The news of the past couple of weeks offered two very different
answers.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 29, The Associated Press presented media audiences with
two disturbing reports. First, it offered its own voluminously
documented account indicating that American troops massacred
hundreds of civilians in the first days of the Korean war. Second,
it revealed that in a Playboy interview, Jesse Ventura, the
Minnesota governor and the Reform Party's most visible leader,
dissed the devout. ``Organized religion is a sham and a crutch for
weak-minded people who need strength in numbers,'' Ventura was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Korea story, pieced together over more than a year by three
Associated Press reporters on two continents, went up like a
rocket. It drew on the accounts of the survivors of the massacre at
No Gun Ri and the soldiers who participated, all of whom were
quoted by name. Newspapers in major markets, including The New York
Times, played it prominently, as did the networks' evening news
programs, along with CNN, Fox News and National Public Radio. Time
and Newsweek each did a report. Defense Secretary William Cohen
ordered an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Not half bad. For about four days, news organizations followed
the Pentagon's reaction and published reports about the AP account.
But after the first accounts and editorials, there was little to
add. The editorial murmurs of regret faded away, with the exception
of Wednesday's searing responses from James Webb, a combat Marine
in Vietnam and a former Navy secretary, who offered a sympathetic
view of the soldiers in an essay in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Compare the arc of the No Gun Ri coverage with that of the
Playboy interview. Brief news accounts about the
wrestler-turned-governor's brash remarks appeared on Thursday,
Sept. 30, but generally played inside newspapers. The interview was
mentioned that night on the evening news programs of NBC, Fox and
ABC. But it was a pipsqueak of an item, compared with No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   At first.
</P>
<P>
   But over the next week, while less and less was said about No
Gun Ri, more and more was said about Jesse Ventura. The Reform
Party's national chairman had denounced Ventura shortly after the
first news accounts of the Playboy interview. Ventura defended
himself and did not apologize. On Sunday morning, the governor's
remarks were revisited on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Ventura coverage escalated. His statements were
again dissected in a Newsweek cover article focusing on him and the
maybe presidential candidates Warren Beatty and Donald Trump.
   The brouhaha was back on ABC's evening news on Monday and was
featured on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' Ventura declined to appear,
but his former colleague Hulk Hogan was there.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Oct. 6, Ventura was at the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University taping a segment of CNBC's
``Hardball With Chris Matthews.'' That evening, the Harvard
appearance was featured on NBC's evening news.
</P>
<P>
   The No Gun Ri and Playboy-Ventura reports broke the same day.
Both were fueled by new developments a day or two later. The only
other developments and commentary were generated by news outlets
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   News has always been fed by a sense of ongoing struggle, which
puts the No Gun Ri revelations at a disadvantage. Those events
happened long ago and are difficult to reconstruct. The Associated
Press spent 14 months reporting and writing its account and the
memory of CNN's Tailwind debacle last year prompted caution inside
AP, according to two AP editors, and may have done the same in
other newsrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, attention may well shift back to No Gun Ri;
correspondents and producers for ``Dateline NBC'' and CBS' ``60
Minutes'' are continuing to explore the topic, as are some print
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Their work, prompted by the painstaking AP account, could make
Americans rethink a small piece of their history. Which is one way
to define news.
</P>
<P>
   By that definition, the Playboy interview was news, too. It
might make people rethink their views of the Reform Party, which
could, in turn, affect that party's viability in the presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
   But why, in the second week, was Jesse Ventura covered more
closely than No Gun Ri? Because mixing controversy and celebrity
gets attention. And news that raises Nielsen ratings is news that
lasts.  &QL;

``Payback Time III.'' That's because for the third consecutive
year, the advertiser association is selling sponsorships of daily
general sessions of the conference to media companies seeking to
promote themselves to an audience of potential clients. By Stuart
Elliott.

EASING ON SOFTWARE EXPORTS HAS LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER WAYNER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Clinton administration recently announced plans to
relax restrictions on exports of data-scrambling software, a key
issue that escaped notice was that the new policies affect only
shrink-wrapped software, not the original source code _ the lines
of instructions that programmers actually write.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to source code, the undersecretary of commerce for
export administration, William Reinsch, said last week that
``nothing has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The exclusion of source code from the relaxed rules threatens to
constrain software developed under the so-called open-source model,
most notably the Linux operating system, an upstart competitor to
Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Linux and other open-source programs are created by loose-knit
coalitions of programmers around the world who exchange source
codes. Many of these teams have developed unusually error-free
software in part because access to the source code allows each
programmer to find colleagues' mistakes, improve on a program's
efficiency, offer fixes for bugs and add new features.
</P>
<P>
   Before software written in any of today's more sophisticated
programming languages can run on a computer, it must be compiled, a
process that translates the text of the source code into
combinations of ones and zeros that can be understood by a
microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   Once a program is compiled, it is almost impossible to determine
what the original source code was. Thus it cannot be adapted or
modified by other programmers unless the source code itself is
published.
</P>
<P>
   This happens to suit U.S. government intelligence and
law-enforcement agencies, which worry that access to the source
code for encryption and security software would enable terrorists,
drug dealers and other criminals to devise secure communications
networks that agents would not be able to monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Attorney General Janet Reno wrote to the German
justice minister, Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, asking for her help in
writing new regulations to control the proliferation of the source
code for encryption software that is distributed over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the government is increasingly turning to
open-source software to build secure communications networks that
protect government secrets or citizens' privacy. Of particular note
is a cousin of Linux known as OpenBSD, which is popular in
government agencies because its development team conducted
unusually rigorous security audits to anticipate and plug holes
that attackers might use to gain entry.
</P>
<P>
   While it might seem logical that the hidden code ined
software would offer greater security than code that anyone can
read, many security experts argue that the opposite is true. Open
source, they say, is ultimately more secure because the people
writing security software know exactly how the systems they are
protecting run.
</P>
<P>
   Theo de Raadt, the leader of the OpenBSD development team, said
last week that his group's software had been bought by many
laboratories and agencies. ``I went down a list,'' he said, ``and
it includes hundreds of them.'' He refused to name the agencies butsaid it was fair to assume that the list included some of the
government's most security-conscious operations.
</P>
<P>
   OpenBSD is also used as the basis for many security
applications. For example, Network Flight Recorder, based in
Washington, makes a device that monitors activity on a network,
watching for packets of data that suggest suspicious or forbidden
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that by the government's definitions, OpenBSD is
foreign software. De Raadt lives in Calgary, Alberta, and he uses
many Canadian programmers to add security enhancements. He said
that the more liberal rules of the Canadian government made it
possible for his team to pursue absolute security without fear that
the government would regulate it. The OpenBSD CD-ROM bears a label
boasting, ``Made in Canada, Land of Free Cryptography.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Internet and software development defy the notion of
national boundaries. OpenBSD originated at the University of
California at Berkeley (the BSD stands for ``Berkeley software
distribution''). De Raadt led the  increase the security by
adding software in Canada that could not be exported by developers
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, several key security enhancements came from programmers
in the United States. For example, the Naval Research Lab in
Virginia is using OpenBSD as a foundation of its new IPv6 project,
an attempt to increase the security of both the Internet in general
and the secure parts of the global network used by the military.
</P>
<P>
   No open-source development can be a made-in-America project. The
Naval Research Lab's Web page thanks several Italians who
contributed some of the source code that works with OpenBSD.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Navy's project is built with Italian enhancements to a
Canadian product that was born in a U.S. university. What is more,
it is likely that the software contains pieces of code contributed
by programmers in Finland, Germany, Eastern Europe, Russia,
Australia, India, Mexico and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many security professionals argue that the nationality of a
piece of source code is irrelevant, that what matters is achieving
a blend of software produced by the best minds everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Perry, the chief technology officer of Network Security
Technology in Herndon, Va., said that OpenBSD is the most secure
operating system in the world. He added that his company already
used it for many projects and was exploring commercializing the
system or selling expert support.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is not only security but cost. Marcus Ranum, chief
executive of Network Flight Recorder, said the OpenBSD operating
system enabled his engineers to read the source code, check for
bugs and build a very secure tool for detecting attackers. If the
attorney general sucn persuading the Europeans and Canadians
to shut off the flow of open-source security software, he said, ``I
think it would be a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But in case Reno has her way, the software industry is
developing end runs. The administration, for example, has so far
declined to regulate the international movement of source code if
it is printed on paper, presumably out of concern that such
regulation would violate the First Amendment. Thus, several
companies are already shipping printouts of their code to Europe
where it is scanned into computers.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the policy's impact on the development of
Linux, FreeBSD, and other open-source projects that serve the
government's own needs, Reinsch, the commerce undersecretary, said:
``It's an important question which we need to study a lot more. We
don't have all of the answers.''

   &UR; MOMMY DRESSING: A Love Story, After a Fashion &LR;  By Lois Gould.
Anchor, $12.95. The daughter of a glamorous dress designer tells
how she grew up starved for affection but hypnotized by her
mother's elegance and solipsism. ``What is so extraordinary'' about
this memoir is that it ``makes us feel the helplessness, the awful
emotional ignorance and deprivation that made her mother who she
was, as a parent and as a woman,'' Margo Jefferson wrote in The New
York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A MAN IN FULL &LR;  By Tom Wolfe. Bantam, $8.50. The twin tales of a
white Atlanta real estate mogul hurtling toward ruin and a black
football star accused of raping a white woman converge in a wild,
sprawling narrative crammed with the author's zestful reporting on
the ins and outs of the modern South. ``The novel contains passages
as powerful and as beautiful as anything written not merely by
contemporary American novelists but by any American novelist,''
Michael Lewis wrote in The New York Times Book Review last year.
``The book is as funny as anything Wolfe has ever written; at the
same time it is also deeply, strangely affecting.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE NIGHT CLUB ERA &LR;  By Stanley Walker. Johns Hopkins
University, $17.95. This popular history of New York during
Prohibition was written by the city editor of The New York Herald
Tribune when the Volstead Act was a fresh memory, and its pages are
jumping with bootleggers, celebrities, swindlers, speak-easy
owners, and assorted tough guys and politicians. ``It is vivid but
accurate, thoroughly informed, and it moves at a smart pace,''
Robert Van Gelder wrote in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; CITY EDITOR &LR;  ($17.95), an
insider's view of a big-city newsroom and 1930s newspaper
journalism. ``Walker's learned essays on freedom of the press,
libel, editing, the varieties of reporting experience and other
topics ... give the book body,'' C.G. Poore wrote in 1934. ``Style
and stories give it flavor and bouquet.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WALL &LR;  By John Marks. Riverhead, $14. In his first novel, an
American journalist follows a large cast of spies, expats and
traitors whose lives are complicated by the fall of the Berlin
wall. ``The story is captivating and reminds us that although each
side of the Cold War was guided by strategy ... it was still a time
of individual choices,'' Charles Norchi wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RESTRAINT OF BEASTS &LR;  By Magnus Mills. Scribner, $11. This
darkly humorous first novel revolves around three slacker fence
builders and drinking buddies in Scotland forced to deal with a
growing number of deadly work-related accidents. The result is ``a
witty, intricate fable about a working-class hell constructed by
its own inhabitants,'' Anthony Bourdain wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SEARCH FOR THE GIANT SQUID &LR;  By Richard Ellis. Penguin,
$14.95. Zoology's last grand mystery is the giant squid, which
lives in the deep ocean and can grow to 60 feet. In fact, it has
rarely, if ever, been seen alive, and little is known of its
hunting and breeding habits. Ellis tells what we do know, and can
surmise, and his account ``will send a shiver down your spine, the
kind of shiver from which squid mania is born,'' Laura Miller wrote
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; IMAGINING ATLANTIS &LR;  (Vintage, $13), Ellis wades through
thousands of years of myth about the legendary lost continent and
the legions of quasi-historians and mystics who have weighed in.
After reviewing the geological and archaeological evidence, he
concludes that Plato made it all up. Last year the reviewer Robert
Eisner called this ``an entertaining, thorough yet readable
account.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO LEASE ON LIFE &LR;  By Lynne Tillman. Harvest/Harcourt Brace,
$12. This novel records a day in the life of a streetwise
proofreader whose revenge on the crazies and operators on her New
York City block pales in comparison with her violent fantasies.
``It dramatizes what the city that never sleeps can do to a tough,
smart, but no longer quite so resilient woman,'' David Gates wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ISAIAH BERLIN: A Life &LR;  By Michael Ignatieff. Owl/Holt, $16. In
this authorized biography, the celebrated liberal philosopher
Isaiah Berlin (1909-97) is portrayed as having lived a charmed life
in which the three strands of his existence _ Jewish, Russian and
British _ were richly interwoven. ``The result is a touching
portrait,'' Steven Marcus wrote last year. ``It gives us a rounded
view of an extraordinarily distinguished mind.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IF I DON'T SIX &LR;  By Elwood Reid. Anchor, $12.95. The hero of
this first novel is a 275-pound offensive lineman from a
blue-collar family who's not sure he wants to get ground up in the
brutal and brutalizing machine of big-time college football. ``In
muscular prose, with appealing imagery ... `If I Don't Six' is by
turns funny, insightful, sad,'' Ira Berkow wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GIANT, O'BRIEN &LR;  By Hilary Mantel. Marian Wood/Owl/Holt,
$12. In 18th-century Britain, a huge Irish dreamer who hawks
himself as a sideshow curiosity crosses paths with a mad scientist
who has an insatiable appetite for dissection. Last year the
reviewer Walter Kendrick admired the novel's ``careful period
setting, its spare, elegant prose and its stretches of wistful
fantasy as the giant spins his tales.''

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

AD COLUMN: MEDIA COMPANIES PAY HANDSOMELY FOR THE RIGHT TO PROMOTE
THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The theme of the 1999 annual conference of the Association of
National Advertisers is ``Brand Building for the 21st Century.''
But it might as well be called ``Payback Time 3.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because for the third consecutive year, the advertiser
association _ the trade organization representing America's largest
marketers _ is selling sponsorships of daily general sessions of
the conference to media companies seeking to promote themselves to
an audience of potential clients.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, media outlets that are always charging marketers
for commercial time and ad space are now paying the marketers for
platform time and program space.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, when the advertiser association became the only
advertising industry trade organization to sell conference
participation, the media companies spending an estimated $100,000
to sponsor general sessions have included the ABC, CBS and Fox
television networks; Gannett Co., for USA Today; and the Time Inc.
unit of Time Warner Inc. Their presentations have ranged from
huckster, including hard sells that were indistinguishable from
infomercials, to low-key, thoughtful discussions of issues that
were indistinguishable from conventional, unsponsored sessions.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the sponsors are five national radio networks and
Conde Nast Publications, the owner of 17 magazines from Allure to
Wired. They are to make presentations at general sessions of the
1999 conference, which is the 90th annual gathering of the
advertiser association. The conference began on Saturday afternoon
at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Amelia Island, Fla., with a
registration of more than 500 people and is scheduled to end
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer if they thought we were interesting enough that we
didn't have to pay,'' said Catherine Viscardi Johnston, the
executive vice president responsible for marketing and sales at
Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I rather have it without charge?'' she said. ``Yes. But
it wasn't a big issue because we thought we could make good use of
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first general session Sunday morning, Conde Nast
presented a panel of editors of six of its magazines. The editors
included Graydon Carter of Vanity Fair, Elizabeth Crow of
Mademoiselle and David Remnick of The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main marketing goal is to have people who advertise with
us _ and those who don't _ see Conde Nast as more than just vendors
of ad space,'' Ms. Johnston said. ``By hosting this panel, we want
advertisers to see us as a resource to help establish connections
with consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Conde Nast paid to be included in the
conference, Ms. Johnson said, ``or they paid us, these editors are
interesting people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we handed each person in the audience $50,000,'' she added,
``they wouldn't sit and listen to something boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnston paused, then said with a chuckle, ``Well, maybe
some of them would listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Several media executives whose careers revolve around listening
habits _ top managers at national radio networks _ are also paying
their way into the conference, sponsoring the second general
session Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view this not as a paid commercial but as an opportunity to
present the facts and figures about network radio and let the
audience members make their own decisions,'' said Lyn Andrews,
president at the ABC Radio Networks in New York, which like ABC-TV
is owned by the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always love for radio in general and network radio in
particular to be included as part of the regular agenda,'' she
added. ``Given the opportunity was there, albeit on a paid basis,
this is the best alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Her counterpart at Westwood One Inc., Joel Hollander, agreed.
</P>

network radio,'' he added. ``So it was a good idea to come up with

division of the CBS Corp. The other network radio sponsors are AMFM

<P>
   &UR; DIRECTORS SHOOTING THE BREEZE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Martin Scorsese  &LR; tells  &UR; Spike Lee &LR;  that it may have been good
for his career that he's never won an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   But doesn't it make you angry, asks Lee in the latest issue of
Premiere magazine, that ``Ordinary People'' won a best picture
Oscar in 1980 over ``Raging Bull''. Nah, says Scorsese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a little twinge myself since 1989,'' says Lee, when
``Do the Right Thing'' was released and the Oscar went to ``Driving
Miss Daisy.'' ``After that, I said, `I give up.' What can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do anything about it,'' says Scorsese, and the two
go on to say nice things about &UR; Robert Redford &LR; , who directed
``Ordinary People.'' ``But you know,'' says Scorsese, ``this is
America. It's the children of light and the children of darkness,
you know what I'm saying? The children of light get passed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie industry now is dominated by 12-year-olds,'' says
Lee. ``I mean, I'm not trying to sound snobbish, but `American
Pie'? Sticking your d_ in a pie, that's a movie? Come on!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AUTHOR ON THE ROAD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Feminist  &UR; Susan Faludi &LR; , whose new book about men in the '90s is
``Stiffed'' (Morrow; $27.50), writes in the latest issue of
Harper's about the media tour for her last book, ``Backlash'':
</P>
<P>
   One interviewer asked, ``Do you shave your underarms?'' As she
was waiting to go on in another show's green room, the producers
``burst in with a suggestion: `How about we have you appear on the
set in a bathrobe and rollers?'''
</P>
<P>
   After the tour, advertisers contacted her about celebrity
spokesmanship. A shoe manufacturer asked if she wanted to be in an
ad for high heels. And a cosmetic surgery center asked if she'd
endorse silicone breast implants. When she said she didn't have
them, the center's representative said ``That's OK. We just want to
use your name because you're a feminist.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO has bought movie rights to ``Stiffed,'' paying what the New
York Times called a ``mid-six-figure sum'' to turn it into a TV
drama.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAUSES AND EFFECTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Winona Ryder &LR; , 27, told Vogue magazine that she has an
unnatural fear of becoming separated from her family, ``which she
believes comes from having lost relatives in the death camps'' of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile  &UR; Kristin Scott Thomas &LR;  told the Calgary Sun why she
chose her profession: ``I wanted to be an actress since I was four.
I think that comes of being raised Catholic. There's so much
theatricality to the religion.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Browsing through the Web site for the online brokerage ETrade,
 &UR; Dario Oakley &LR;  came upon this example of positive spin, in a
company profile: ``For the 9 months ended 6 /99, revenues rose from
76.6M to 66.8M.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Prince Edward &LR; 's Ardent Productions has signed a deal with E!
Entertainment Television to make a 13-part documentary on aspects
of royal life.
</P>
<P>
   - Bright idea of the month: Marie Claire magazine has  &UR; Courtney &LR; 
 &UR; Love &LR; , whose husband,  &UR; Kurt Cobain &LR; , committed suicide, answering
``your questions about sex, love and relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   - Police received a report of construction at a house in San
Carlos on Sunday, says a Carmel Pine Cone report forwarded by
 &UR; Daryl Glen &LR; . ``Perhaps was replacing a doorknob. No permit needed,
no violation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``With the rapid approach of the third millennium, many people
can't help wondering what role the Devil will be playing in it. But
a cursory examination of the mainstream press of America reveals
almost no mention of him, and even using the Internet services that
promise to keep track of everything, it's much easier to find
information on Monica Lewinsky than on the Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Robert Wernick &LR;  in Smithsonian magazine.

TRADITIONAL BARRIERS FALL AS BRITISH PAPERS PUT NEWS ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Peter Martin, a senior editor, strides briskly through
the newsroom of The Financial Times, gesturing to a bank of
computer terminals where journalists craft the news for FT.com, the
paper's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of months, Martin tells a visitor, that relatively
small unit will be gone, replaced by something much more innovative
that, far more extensively than at any other British paper, will
erase what he calls the ideological barrier between online news and
the printed word. In its place, he says, will be a redesigned,
integrated newsroom where journalists will work to feed both the
Web site and the distinctively salmon-colored British newspaper.
And that is not all, says Martin, whose title is deputy editor and
editorial director for the FT Internet Businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site will be reinvented as a full-fledged Internet
portal, featuring a search engine for business readers, diary and
e-mail capabilities and expanded use of columnists and analysts to
provide an early peek into their thinking. ``We envisage it
becoming a global business portal,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the development at The Financial Times, which
expects to hire as many as 100 new staff members and spend up to
$70 million on its online expansion this year alone, reflects both
a broader push by its owner, Pearson PLC, to wring global value
from its flagship, blue-chip brand name, and a response to growing
competition from a range of business-oriented Web sites like
TheStreet.com., in which The New York Times is an investor.
</P>
<P>
   But The Financial Times' ambitious expansion is also being
played out against a familiar backdrop. As Britain's broadsheet
papers look to the Web, their traditional, no-holds-barred
competition has taken a new turn and the fabled wars of what used
to be known as Fleet Street have spilled into cyberspace. These
days, visitors to the former Fleet Street's Web sites can expect to
be enticed not simply by a rehash of the day's headlines but by a
broader palette, including what George Brock, managing editor of
The Times of London, calls ``rolling journalism,'' driven by the
same urge for speed as are news agencies like Reuters, Bloomberg
News or The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Britain's online broadsheet newspapers are promoting a
range of interconnected offerings _ all advertising-driven _
designed to lure just about everyone from job seekers to movie
buffs to highflying executives. And they are not just competing
with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online, the British are competing head to head in a firmly
competitive market where we are also competing with the broadcast
media,'' said Danny Meadows-Klue, publisher of the electronic
version of The Daily Telegraph (www.telegraph.co.uk). ``Our
competitive landscape is no longer just newspapers. It's TV, radio,
specialist sectors like football, where we are competing with
football clubs' own home pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the former Fleet Street is not alone. Internet
service providers from Compuserve to Yahoo already offer real-time
news feeds from big news agencies. Newspapers in the United States,
including The Washington Post and The New York Times, are seeking
not just to provide up-to-the-minute news agency feeds but also to
deploy editorial staffs of their own working alongside print
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Never was that changing relationship between the Web page and
the printed page more obvious than after last week's London train
crash _ the worst in over four decades _ which confronted editors
with what, for some journalists, has become the central puzzle, or
even threat, presented by their online editions: how to serve
readers with breaking news and early analysis without undermining
the value of the following day's printed pages.
</P>
<P>
   Within three hours of the crash, said Simon Waldman, editor of
Guardian Unlimited, the Guardian newspaper's network of Web sites,
``we had everything up'' on the Web site _ including photos and
eyewitness accounts that would ordinarily have been kept for the
next day's printed editions.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mike Butcher of New Media Age, an induwsletter, said:
``One thing that newspapers have swallowed now is that the Web does
not significantly eat into circulation. People use it in a
different way. People don't really read articles in any depth
online. It's a different medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Distinctions between what is happening in the British press and
among American newspapers are manifold. For one thing, U.S.
newspapers are rooted in a stronger regional tradition, compared
with the scramble for national dominance that distinguishes British
newspapers. And they were generally quicker to go online than their
British counterparts. U.S. newspapers benefited not just from the
much cheaper U.S. telephone rates, which encourage Internet use,
but also from a much bigger potential market. ``Web revenue is not
the same and that explains the different speeds at which things
have tended to develop,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, ad revenue from British papers' online operations was a
measly $31.3 million last year. But, according to many online
managers, that represented an increase of some 140 percent over
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites, like The Daily Telegraph, with six interconnected
sites, are building networks for students and travelers to win over
a new generation to replace an aging readership.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the desire to avoid being left out that The Independent
(www.independent.co.uk) recently lured Web experts away from rivals
like Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which owns The Times of London,
to redesign its Web site in an effort to increase the number of
visits to individual Web pages _known here as page impressions _
from a lowly 3.6 million a month. The Times of London
(www.the-times.co.uk), too, is promising new features. It draws
some 12 million visits a month _ roughly the same as The Financial
Times, which reckons that some 40 percent of its online usage comes
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And, with five interlinked Web sites catering to news junkies,
job seekers, movie fans and others, The Guardian's Guardian
Unlimited (guardianunlimited.co.uk), begun in January, is pressing
to expand beyond its roughly 10 million visitors a month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Financial Times' aggressive strategy has raised some doubts
among industry experts, particularly since it says it will be
looking to advertising, not subscriptions, to provide revenue. Noah
Yasskin, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, said the recruitment
of 100 people ``sounds like a lot of bodies for the British
advertising market to pay for.'' And Jamie Wood, European media
analyst at J.P. Morgan, said he was ``not sure that Pearson has
worked out'' where the expansion fits in the overall strategy of a
company whose activities include book publishing, television,
business information and educational publishing.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin has an answer. ``The risk from doing nothing is much
higher,'' he said.

``Do the Right Thing'' was released and the Oscar went to ``Driving
Miss Daisy.'' ``After that, I said, `I give up.' What can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do anything about it,'' says Scorsese, and the two
go on to say nice things about &UR; Robert Redford &LR; , who directed
``Ordinary People.'' ``But you know,'' says Scorsese, ``this is
America. It's the children of light and the children of darkness,
you know what I'm saying? The children of light get passed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie industry now is dominated by 12-year-olds,'' says
Lee. ``I mean, I'm not trying to sound snobbish, but `American
Pie'? Sticking your d_ in a pie, that's a movie? Come on!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AUTHOR ON THE ROAD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Feminist  &UR; Susan Faludi &LR; , whose new book about men in the '90s is
``Stiffed'' (Morrow; $27.50), writes in the latest issue of
Harper's about the media tour for her last book, ``Backlash'':
</P>
<P>
   One interviewer asked, ``Do you shave your underarms?'' As she
was waiting to go on in another show's green room, the producers
``burst in with a suggestion: `How about we have you appear on the
set in a bathrobe and rollers?'''
</P>
<P>
   After the tour, advertisers contacted her about celebrity
spokesmanship. A shoe manufacturer asked if she wanted to be in an
ad for high heels. And a cosmetic surgery center asked if she'd
endorse silicone breast implants. When she said she didn't have
them, the center's representative said ``That's OK. We just want to
use your name because you're a feminist.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO has bought movie rights to ``Stiffed,'' paying what the New
York Times called a ``mid-six-figure sum'' to turn it into a TV
drama.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAUSES AND EFFECTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Winona Ryder &LR; , 27, told Vogue magazine that she has an
unnatural fear of becoming separated from her family, ``which she
believes comes from having lost relatives in the death camps'' of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile  &UR; Kristin Scott Thomas &LR;  told the Calgary Sun why she
chose her profession: ``I wanted to be an actress since I was four.
I think that comes of being raised Catholic. There's so much
theatricality to the religion.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Browsing through the Web site for the online brokerage ETrade,
 &UR; Dario Oakley &LR;  came upon this example of positive spin, in a
company profile: ``For the 9 months ended 6 /99, revenues rose from
76.6M to 66.8M.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Prince Edward &LR; 's Ardent Productions has signed a deal with E!
Entertainment Television to make a 13-part documentary on aspects
of royal life.
</P>
<P>
   - Bright idea of the month: Marie Claire magazine has  &UR; Courtney &LR; 
 &UR; Love &LR; , whose husband,  &UR; Kurt Cobain &LR; , committed suicide, answering
``your questions about sex, love and relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   - Police received a report of construction at a house in San
Carlos on Sunday, says a Carmel Pine Cone report forwarded by
 &UR; Daryl Glen &LR; . ``Perhaps was replacing a doorknob. No permit needed,
no violation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``With the rapid approach of the third millennium, many people
can't help wondering what role the Devil will be playing in it. But
a cursory examination of the mainstream press of America reveals
almost no mention of him, and even using the Internet services that
promise to keep track of everything, it's much easier to find
information on Monica Lewinsky than on the Devil.''

REPORTER GETS A SUBPOENA ON INTERVIEW IN '95 KILLING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.. Calif.)   (nk) 
 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A reporter for a magazine published by a civil
rights group has been subpoenaed to provide tape recordings and
notes of an interview with a defendant in a murder that may have
been racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter is said to have told a federal investigator that
the defendant acknowledged committing a murder. She is a writer for
the quarterly magazine, Intelligence Report, which covers
right-wing extremists and is published by the Southern Poverty Law
Center, a civil rights group that regularly holds seminars for law
enforcement agents about trends and beliefs among hate groups. The
magazine is circulated to about 150,000 contributors to the
organization, which is based in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Trish O'Kane, the writer, interviewed the defendant, Randall Lee
Rojas, in August. Rojas and two others are accused of beating a
black man, Milton Walker Jr., to death in 1995 in California. In a
hearing on Oct. 1 in state Superior Court, FBI agent John Schafer
testified that Ms. O'Kane called him a month after the interview to
ask him some questions, and in the course of the conversation told
him that Rojas said ``the worst crime I ever committed was
murder,'' in 1995, and that he felt remorseful, although he did not
specifically say the murder involved Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer testified he told Ms. O'Kane to preserve her notes and
recordings, and ``she was quite taken aback by my request'' because
she did not realize until then that it they could be evidence in a
criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors considered issuing a subpoena for the evidence and
notified defense lawyers of its existence but decided against it.
Now, lawyers for Rojas' co-defendants are seeking Ms. O'Kane's tape
recordings and notes in the belief that they may exonerate their
clients. Richard Cohen, a lawyer with the center, said the magazine
would seek to quash the subpoena in Alabama. If it does not
prevail, it will assert the California shield law before Judge
Lance Ito, who is handling the case.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous jet-stream flow over the northern tier of states will
direct a series of fronts from the northern Rockies to the
northeastern states. As a result, marked day-to-day temperature
changes will occur across these regions through midweek. The fronts
will be accompanied by some clouds and a few showers, but the rapid
motion of weather systems will prevent substantial precipitation.
Meanwhile, unseasonable warmth will spread from the Southwest
toward the Plains.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast will become partly to mostly sunny as a cold front
moves offshore. Breezes from the northwest will gradually deliver
cooler air to interior sections, but coastal areas will stay
several degrees warmer than the seasonal average on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and showers will linger near a slow-moving front from the
southern Appalachians to the middle Atlantic coast. The coastal
Carolinas and Georgia will have some sunshine, but afternoon and
evening thundershowers will arrive from the west. Farther south,
Florida will be warm and humid with ample sunshine, although a few
showers will occur in the western panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   After a chilly dawn, breezes from the south will deliver warmer
air to the central and northern Plains. Clouds will thicken and
patches of rain will develop near the Canadian border from Montana
to the Dakotas as the milder air rises over cool air in place
across this region.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny and very warm weather will cover the Southwest, but cooler
air will spread into the Northwest late Monday and Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Rip Currents
</P>
<P>
   Rip currents threatened swimmers in southern Florida over the
weekend after several days of steady onshore winds. Because a
wind-generated wave rarely is of uniform height along its entire
length, water piles up near shore where incoming waves are tallest.
Water sliding down both sides of the piles creates flows that move
parallel to the shore. Where these flows converge, water is
diverted seaward, creating a dangerous rip current that can push
swimmers into deep water. People who are caught in a rip current
should swim parallel to the beach until they are out of the current
and then swim back to shore.

   There are certain publishing rituals that necessarily must be
abandoned when an author lives in a federal prison cell under
23-hour lockdown with just a 13--inch black and white television
for company.
</P>
<P>
   With the approaching publication of Theodore Kaczynski's memoir,
``Truth Versus Lies'' the book's small independent publisher,
Context Books, is trying to figure out just how to promote a title
about brotherly resentment and dysfunctional family life without
much help from the writer. Kaczynski is serving a life sentence in
a Colorado prison for a series of bombings that left three people
dead and at least 22 injured.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski has written a book that does not dwell in any way on
the crimes he pleaded guilty to as the Unabomber, who eluded the
federal authorities for more than 17 years. That is because he is
seeking a review of his case by a federal appeals court, said
Context's publisher and founder, Beau Friedlander. So instead, he
said, Kaczynski's memoir is an attempt to offer a more complex view
of himself than portrayals that characterized him as insane.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the 368-page book is devoted to the literary dissection
of David Kaczynski, the brother who made the wrenching decision to
alert federal authorities about his suspicions that his only
sibling might be the Unabomber.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a chapter on ``My Adolescence; Family Dysfunction;
Verbal Abuse,'' Theodore Kaczynski has devoted at least eight
chapters to his brother, from ``My Brother's Ambivalent Feelings
Toward Me'' to ``My Brother's Relations with Linda Patrik; I Break
Off With Him'' to finally ``How My Brother's Attitudes Changed
Under Linda Patrik's Influence; Why He Denounced Me to the FBI.''
(Ms. Patrik is David Kaczynski's wife.)
</P>
<P>
   This book is about the ways Theodore Kaczynski ``was
misrepresented by the media after his arrest,'' Friedlander said.
Friedlander said he proposed the project to Kaczynski. He added
that any share of Kaczynski's book proceeds would be placed in a
special escrow account for bombing victims or their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The book is scheduled to be published sometime this year. About
promoting it, Friedlander conceded: ``You have a hard time. You
don't do an author tour and Kaczynski is not chummy with the
media.''

   Rival Reagan Biography Will be Reissued
</P>
<P>
   While critics debate Edmund Morris' controversial memoir of
Ronald Reagan and its blend of fact and fantasy, an upstart
publisher is preparing to reissue a rival biography, contending
that Morris failed to deliver a definitive account of the former
president's life.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, Public Affairs will publish an updated trade
paperback version of Lou Cannon's 1991 biography, ``President
Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime,'' said Peter Osnos, the publisher
of Public Affairs, a two-year-old company.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two Reagan biographers share the same subject, they
are openly scornful of each other and have started trading literary
uppercuts. As the controversy deepened this month about his newly
published biography, ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' Morris
said that Cannon's book demonstrated why it was necessary to take
the unconventional approach of inserting himself in the memoir as a
semifictional contemporary of Ronald Reagan's with an eyewitness
view of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou Cannon, who spent almost all of his professional
journalistic career following Ronald Reagan around, produced a
massive, orthodox political biography of him,'' said Morris, who
received a Pulitzer Prize in 1980 for his biography of Theodore
Roosevelt. ``To my mind, he utterly failed to convey Reagan's
theatrical nature because Lou was a reporter and never a witness.
It's a different view altogether. It's the reportorial view _ too
neutral, too subjective.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Cannon _ a former Washington Post reporter who wrote
three books about Reagan _ reviewed Morris' memoir for The Los
Angeles Times. In his critique, Cannon faulted Morris for factual
errors, calling ``Dutch'' a strange book in which ``realistic
political analysis wages a losing battle with novelistic
technique.''
</P>
<P>
   Cannon said he contracted with The Los Angeles Times about a
year and a half ago to review the book with no intentions of doing
anything with his own biography, which is still available in
hardcover from California Journal Press. But after Public Affairs
asked him to bring out an updated version, Cannon said that he was
glad to have his book resurface, no matter Morris' caustic
critique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think Morris' criticism of me is just another alibi,''
Cannon said. ``Edmund blames everyone but himself. He blames Ronald
Reagan for being a mystery. He's trashing everybody. I can't judge
my own book. I'm not puffed up about it, but I think I did capture
Reagan in my news stories and in my writing. Magic or no magic,
I've got the story of the Reagan administration, and he had such an
opportunity to build on it.'' ``Dutch'' has been selling briskly,
climbing to No. 2 on the New York Times best-seller list and the
two largest bookstore chains, Borders and Barnes &AMP; Noble, said it
was selling well. &UR;  &QL;

   CNN Rejects Advertisement From Salon
</P>
<P>
   Does mighty CNN view teeny Salon magazine, the online journal of
culture, news and opinion, as a competitor?
</P>
<P>
   In the last week of September, Salon.com introduced its first
television advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, now running on MSNBC, CNBC, VH1, Comedy Central, A&AMP;E,
Bravo and Fox, features the heads of famous and infamous people on
caricatured bodies: Chris Rock dances with Linda Tripp; Al Gore
watches agog as Tipper Gore chats amiably with the shock-rocker
Marilyn Manson; Howard Stern and Martha Stewart canoodle on a sofa,
and Courtney Love raises her cocktail glass to a beneficent Pope
John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   The spot was scheduled to appear on CNN on Sept. 27. A few days
earlier, Salon's vice president for marketing, Patrick Hurley, said
he received a phone call from Steven Mizer, manager for commercial
clearance at Turner Networks, a unit of Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that they rejected the ad and would not be able to run
it because they view us as a competitive news source,'' Hurley
said. ``He said it had nothing to do with the spot itself. He said,
`Look, we don't let everybody who wants to advertise on CNN
advertise on CNN.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hurley said if taste was the issue, he was curious to know
whether CNN had run advertisements from Outpost.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those could be construed as much more tasteless,'' Hurley
said. ``I mean, they're shooting gerbils out of a cannon in those
ads.''
</P>
<P>
   (Hurley was referring to a series of ads from the online
retailer that show, among other things, a muscular man affixing Web
address stickers to infants' heads and, indeed, gerbils being shot
from cannons.)
</P>
<P>
   Mizer referred inquiries to a CNN spokeswoman, Sue Binford. Ms.
Binford could not confirm whether CNN had ever run ads from
Outpost.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that comes in we look at on a case-by-case basis,''
she said. ``And we will, from time to time, not accept an
advertisement. One of the things we are certainly ng to do
is get into all the ins and outs on why we make these decisions
every time we make one. I think it is sufficient to say that these
decisions are up to us, and we made a decision to pass on this
one.'' &QL;

<P>
   When I was a boy ``discovering literature,'' I used to think how
wonderful it would be if every other person on the street were
familiar with Proust and Joyce or T.E. Lawrence or Pasternak and
Kafka. Later I learned how refractory to high culture the
democratic masses were. Lincoln as a young frontiersman read
Plutarch, Shakespeare and the Bible. But then he was Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Later when I was traveling in the Midwest by car, bus and train,
I regularly visited small-town libraries and found that readers in
Keokuk, Iowa, or Benton Harbor, Mich., were checking out Proust and
Joyce and even Svevo and Andrei Biely. D.H. Lawrence was also a
favorite. And sometimes I remembered that God was willing to spare
Sodom for the sake of 10 of the righteous. Not that Keokuk was
anything like wicked Sodom, or that Proust's Charlus would have
been tempted to settle in Benton Harbor. I seem to have had a
persistent democratic desire to find evidences of high culture in
the most unlikely places.
</P>
<P>
   For many decades now I have been a fiction writer, and from the
first I was aware that mine was a questionable occupation. In the
1930s an elderly neighbor in Chicago told me that he wrote fiction
for the pulps. ``The people on the block wonder why I don't go to a
job, and I'm seen puttering around, trimming the bushes or painting
a fence instead of working in a factory. But I'm a writer. I sell
to Argosy and Doc Savage,'' he said with a certain gloom. ``They
wouldn't call that a trade.'' Probably he noticed that I was a
bookish boy, likely to sympathize with him, and perhaps he was
trying to warn me to avoid being unlike others. But it was too late
for that.
</P>
<P>
   From the first, too, I had been warned that the novel was at the
point of death, that like the walled city or the crossbow, it was a
thing of the past. And no one likes to be at odds with history.
Oswald Spengler, one of the most widely read authors of the early
'30s, taught that our tired old civilization was very nearly
finished. His advice to the young was to avoid literature and the
arts and to embrace mechanization and become engineers.
</P>
<P>
   In refusing to be obsolete, you challenged and defied the
evolutionist historians. I had great respect for Spengler in my
youth, but even then I couldn't accept his conclusions, and (with
respect and admiration) I mentally told him to get lost.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years later, in a recent issue of The Wall Street Journal,
I come upon the old Spenglerian argument in a contemporary form.
Terry Teachout, unlike Spengler, does not dump paralyzing mountains
of historical theory upon us, but there are signs that he has
weighed, sifted and pondered the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks of our ``atomized culture,'' and his is a responsible,
up-to-date and carefully considered opinion. He speaks of ``art
forms as technologies.'' He tells us that movies will soon be
``downloadable'' _ that is, transferable from one computer to the
memory of another device _ and predicts that films will soon be
marketed like books. He predicts that the near-magical powers of
technology are bringing us to the threshold of a new age and
concludes: ``Once this happens, my guess is that the independent
movie will replace the novel as the principal vehicle for serious
storytelling in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   In support of this argument, Teachout cites the ominous drop in
the volume of book sales and the great increase in movie
attendance: ``For Americans under the age of 30, film has replaced
the novel as the dominant mode of artistic expression.'' To this
Teachout adds that popular novelists like Tom Clancy and Stephen
King ``top out at around a million copies per book,'' and notes,
``The final episode of NBC's `Cheers,' by contrast, was seen by 42
million people.''
</P>
<P>
   On majoritarian grounds, the movies win. ``The power of novels
to shape the national conversation has declined,'' says Teachout.
But I am not at all certain that in their day ``Moby-Dick'' or
``The Scarlet Letter'' had any considerable influence on ``the
national conversation.'' In the mid-19th century it was ``Uncle
Tom's Cabin'' that impressed the great public. ``Moby-Dick'' was a
small-public novel.
</P>
<P>
   The literary masterpieces of the 20th century were for the most
part the work of novelists who had no large public in mind. The
novels of Proust and Joyce were written in a cultural twilight and
were not intended to be read under the blaze and dazzle of
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Teachout's article in the Journal follows the path generally
taken by observers whose aim is to discover a trend. ``According to
one recent study 55 percent of Americans spend less than 30 minutes
reading anything at all. ... It may even be that movies have
superseded novels not because Americans have grown dumber but
because the novel is an obsolete artistic technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not accustomed to thinking of art forms as
technologies,'' he says, ``but that is what they are, which means
they have been rendered moribund by new technical developments.''
</P>
<P>
   Together with this emphasis on technics that attracts the
scientific-minded young, there are other preferences discernible:
It is better to do as a majority of your contemporaries are doing,
better to be one of millions viewing a film than one of mere
thousands reading a book. Moreover, the reader reads in solitude,
whereas the viewer belongs to a great majority; he has powers of
numerosity as well as the powers of mechanization. Add to this the
importance of avoiding technological obsolescence and the
attraction of feeling that technics will decide questions for us
more dependably than the thinking of an individual, no matter how
distinctive he may be.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   John Cheever told me long ago that it was his readers who kept
him going, people from every part of the country who had written to
him. When he was at work, he was aware of these readers and
correspondents in the woods beyond the lawn. ``If I couldn't
picture them, I'd be sunk,'' he said. And the novelist Wright
Morris, urging me to get an electric typewriter, said that he
seldom turned his machine off. ``When I'm not writing, I listen to
the electricity,'' he said. ``It keeps me company. We have
conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   I wonder how Teachout might square such idiosyncrasies with his
``art forms as technologies.'' Perhaps he would argue that these
two writers had somehow isolated themselves from ``broad-based
cultural influence.'' Teachout has at least one laudable purpose:
He thinks that he sees a way to bring together the Great Public of
the movies with the Small Public of the highbrows. He is, however,
interested in millions: millions of dollars, millions of readers,
millions of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing ``everybody'' does is go to the movies, Teachout
says. How right he is.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the '20s children between the ages of 8 and 12 lined up
on Saturdays to buy their nickel tickets to see the crisis of last
Saturday resolved. The heroine was untied in a matter of seconds
just before the locomotive would have crushed her. Then came a new
episode; and after that the newsreel and ``Our Gang.'' Finally
there was a western with Tom Mix, or a Janet Gaynor picture about a
young bride and her husband blissful in the attic, or Gloria
Swanson and Theda Bara or Wallace Beery or Adolphe Menjou or Marie
Dressler. And of course there was Charlie Chaplin in ``The Gold
Rush,'' and from ``The Gold Rush'' it was only one step to the
stories of Jack London.
</P>
<P>
   There was no rivalry then between the viewer and the reader.
Nobody supervised our reading. We were on our own. We civilized
ourselves. We found or made a mental and imaginative life. Because
we could read, we learned also to write. It did not confuse me to
see ``Treasure Island'' in the movies and then read the book. There
was no competition for our attention.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more attractive oddities of the United States is that
our minorities are so numerous, so huge. A minority of millions is
not at all unusual. But there are in fact millions of literate
Americans in a state of separation from others of their kind. They
are, if you like, the readers of Cheever, a crowd of them too large
to be hidden in the woods. Departments of literature across the
country have not succeeded in alienating them from books, works old
and new. My friend Keith Botsford and I felt strongly that if the
woods were filled with readers gone astray, among those readers
there were probably writers as well.
</P>
<P>
   To learn in detail of their existence you have only to publish a
magazine like The Republic of Letters. Given encouragement, unknown
writers, formerly without hope, materialize. One early reader wrote
that our paper, ``with its contents so fresh, person-to-person,''
was ``real, non-synthetic, undistracting.'' Noting that there were
no ads, she asked, ``Is it possible, can it last?'' and called it
``an antidote to the shrinking of the human being in every one of
us.'' And toward the end of her letter our correspondent added,
``It behooves the elder generation to come up with reminders of who
we used to be and need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what Keith Botsford and I had hoped that our ``tabloid
for literates'' would be. And for two years it has been just that.
We are a pair of utopian codgers who feel we have a duty to
literature. I hope we are not like those humane do-gooders who,
when the horse was vanishing, still donated troughs in City Hall
Square for thirsty nags.
</P>
<P>
   We have no way of guessing how many independent, self-initiated
connoisseurs and lovers of literature have survived in remote
corners of the country. The little evidence we have suggests that
they are glad to find us, they are grateful. They want more than
they are getting. Ingenious technology has failed to give them what
they so badly need.
</P>

PATENTS: PIANO HONORING GERSHWIN; DURABLE CD BOX; HALLOWEEN-CANDY
TRACER

<P>
   Since it went into business in 1853, Steinway &AMP; Sons has
introduced many design and mechanical innovations in its legendary
pianos. Last week Steinway received its 122nd patent _ a design
patent that protects the look of a new, extravagantly detailed
piano called the Rhapsody.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhapsody piano was designed last year to honor the 100th
birthday of composer George Gershwin. And, of course, it is very
blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made of curly maple that is dyed blue and clear-coated in
lacquer,'' said Andrew Horbachevsky, director of engineering
development at Steinway.
</P>
<P>
   The piano is studded with hundreds of mother-of-pearl stars, and
its lid features a mother-of-pearl starburst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very art-deco New York in the '20s and '30s,''
Horbachevsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Frank Pollaro of East Orange, N.J., the piano has a
music desk hand-carved with the silhouette of the New York City
skyline. The piano plate _ the plate that all the piano strings are
attached to _ is silver and hand-painted in blue with the first 24
notes of Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The relevance of the 24 is that it took George Gershwin 24
days to compose `Rhapsody in Blue,''' Horbachevsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The piano is part of a limited-edition series of designs, which
includes a J.B. Tiffany piano, in honor of an art director who
worked for Steinway and was a distant cousin of the famous glass
designer.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Steinway will be introducing the Tri-Centennial, a
limited-edition piano designed in honor of the 300th anniversary of
the invention of the piano by Bartolomeo Cristofori, the Italian
musician and instrument maker.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the limited-edition Rhapsody piano? About $145,000
for the 7-foot version.
</P>
<P>
   ``A doctor from Pittsburgh should be getting the first one any
week now,'' Horbachevsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinway &AMP; Sons was assigned patent D414,797.
</P>
<P>
   Father and Daughter Win Separate Patents
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Weingarden and his daughter, Alison, are patenting very
different inventions within a couple of months of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Weingarden, a package designer in Haworth, N.J., recently
patented a new type of CD case that he says is superior to those
clear-plastic jewel boxes that infuriate music lovers by easily
breaking or cracking.
</P>
<P>
   His box is made of polypropylene, which _ unlike the polystyrene
of the hard plastic cases _ is a soft and somewhat pliable plastic
that won't crack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other polypropylene boxes,'' Weingarden said. But
unlike those, he said, his box is close enough in size and
configuration to the crystal polystyrene boxes that his version can
be loaded with the CD and booklet on the same packaging equipment
that is already used by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Alison Weingarden's patent, which is expected to
be issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came up with the idea when she was volunteering at a
hospital,'' her father said. It's a hand-held remote-control device
that allows a hospital worker to hold an elevator door open while
maneuvering a wheelchair or gurney on or off the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Does this invention portend an engineering career for Ms.
Weingarden, a senior at Northern Valley Regional High School in
Demarest, N.J.?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, ag to her father, ``But she's also a promising
oboist.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Weingarden received patent 5,931,294. Alison Weingarden
is to receive patent 5,964,319. They are both hoping to license
their patents.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing the Candy on Halloween Night
</P>
<P>
   Gwendolyn Anderson, an inventor in Newark, Del., has patented a
``food donator identification container'' that she says will help
protect trick-or-treaters from tainted Halloween goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson's invention is essentially a big bag containing
many smaller bags, each of which has a label for writing down the
address from which the candy inside it came.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the parent and child go back to their house, they can
examine each small bag of candy,'' Ms. Anderson said. ``This way
there is a way to identify the person who handed out the candy if
there is a problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson received patent 5,735,548, which she hopes to
license.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231.

`THE INDUSTRY OF SOULS': REDEMPTION AFTER A NATION'S NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD EDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bayliss, an old Englishman, rouses himself in the modest cottage
in a Russian village where he has lived for a quarter of a century
with Frosya and her husband, Trofim. He moves cautiously, testing
his 80-year-old's aches and pains, and wary of getting the sagging
skin on his thighs pinched between mattress and bed frame.
</P>
<P>
   Frosya had called out to him to open his shutters, as she does
each morning: afraid, as she is each morning, of getting no reply.
Now she bustles in with a hot cloth to massage the aching veins in
his legs, and with a breakfast of cheese, pared apple, tea and a
slice of bread: ``dark, dense, slightly moist and grainy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an errand of reverence and love, repeated daily in the
decades since Bayliss, a ragged scarecrow, stumbled up to the door
with a last blessing from Kirill, Frosya's father, killed in the
mines of the Siberian gulag where the two men had worked side by
side for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Industry of Souls'' goes back and forth between Bayliss'
life a mile and a half underground in Sosnogorsklag (he was seized
and charged as a spy while visiting East Germany on business at the
start of the Cold War), and his years in Myshkino ever since.
Instead of returning to England, he had stayed there, working as an
unofficial village schoolteacher and living as an honored guest.
</P>
<P>
   Why he did not return, and why the villagers honor him almost as
they do the icons they smuggled into their rebuilt church, is the
heart of Martin Booth's novel. It is a story of darkness and light:
a light that shines not only in the fields, woods and vegetable
gardens of Myshkino _ from the incipient thawing of the 1970s to
the post-Communism of today _ but more singularly, in this
Tolstoyan tale, in the black tunnels of Sosnogorsklag.
</P>
<P>
   Bayliss' breakfast is the start of a day of quiet climax. It is
his birthday, and he will spend much of it walking around the
village and receiving the congratulations of his neighbors. Trofim
has started a private garage, is preparing to run a taxi service
and dreams of opening a chain of foreign-car dealerships. The
baker, who had worked for a state enterprise, now has his own
business, making bread by a savory traditional formula and baking
pastries to be sold at the railroad station. Another family has
emigrated to America.
</P>
<P>
   These vignettes tend to be thin and emblematic; a set of
Polaroids to portray the new Russia. Booth takes some shortcuts.
There are a number of conversations that seem to stem from the
point to be made more than the person making them. The author does
not resist an old chestnut about the former Soviet system: that the
workers pretended to work, and the state pretended to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   They are flaws, yet ``The Industry of Souls'' can be remarkably
moving: a morality tale, essentially, and one that reaches well
beyond the obvious. Take one of the village conversations. Toasting
Bayliss with homemade apple kvass, a neighbor offers an apology.
His father was a gulag guard; the apology is on behalf of all
Russia. Grandiose, but Booth knows, and conveys, that in the
Russian tradition grand and heartfelt do not exclude each other.
</P>
<P>
   As he makes his birthday rounds, Bayliss recalls the years in
the mines and the men in his work unit, each from a different
background (a fighter pilot, a sailor, a shopkeeper, an Albanian
student, a mathematician) and each denounced and arrested on
trivial suspicions or for petty revenge. He describes graphically
the hellish conditions they lived in. He evokes, as well, the
extraordinary solidarity and generosity of seven men whom hardship
compacted like the coal they dug.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of Kirill, the unit leader, is the most memorable.
After months of brutal preliminary detention Bayliss had arrived at
the seeming lower depths of the mine pit. It is a suggestive
reversal: These outcasts find themselves oddly out of the system
that cast them out. And oddly free. Kirill initiates Bayliss into a
place where, devoid of all vestiges of humanity, it is possible to
rebuild the condition of being human. Addressing the new arrivals,
all with sentences of 20 years or more, Kirill tells them:
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the rest of your lives. And take a word of advice.
Do not dream of the day of your release....Men go mad thinking
about the past, the future. Here, there is no then and no next.
There is only now.''
</P>
<P>
   The scenes in the mine and Bayliss' walk through the village are
intercut. The contrast seems vast; Bayliss, whose hard-won wisdom
illuminates the story even as it overworks him as a character,
finds the connection.
</P>
<P>
   Mortally injured when their pit collapsed, Kirill had extracted
Bayliss' promise that if he was ever released he would make his way
out of Siberia and find his daughter: ``Go to Frosya. One day, a
million years from now. Even if you are a ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   It is more than a paternal plea. The courage, the humanity, the
steadfastness of the men in the mine stand for hope of a future
beyond the national nightmare. (At one point someone notes the
irony that here, a mile and a half underground, is Russia's only
true communism, and that only here does ``comrade'' have meaning.)
</P>
<P>
   To the villagers of Myshkino, Bayliss is an icon of that hope;
partly for what he has been through _ as it were, on their behalf _
and partly from his refusal to be defeated by it. This foreigner,
staying with them and teaching their children, is a sign that
history can be redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day one question hangs over both Bayliss and the
villagers. A cousin in England has traced him; he will be arriving
that evening with a member of the British embassy to invite him to
go home. It is the thread of suspense that pulls the day taut.
Suspense of a kind, that is. The village doesn't know what he will
decide. Bayliss knows but isn't saying. For the readers he doesn't
need to; his answer has been annealed in the 20-year crucible of
Work Unit 8, Sosnogorsklag.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: TAKING TECHNOLOGY TO AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DENISE CARUSO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The technology sector's financial success in the last three
years has been largely a North American phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   But some forward-thinking investors have been moving offshore
toward untapped markets and investments, often pushing
communication technologies into underdeveloped countries in Latin
America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign soil, U.S. investment often looks _ and acts _
remarkably like invasion. And it is sometimes treated accordingly,
as cellular-telephone providers discovered last year when the
Chinese government abruptly terminated a number of successful joint
ventures with vendors like Motorola and Ericsson in favor of its
own technologies.
</P>
<P>
   So how will U.S. investors, particularly those drunk on their
recent good fortune and feeling perhaps a little invincible,
henceforth enter these raw new markets? The answer to that question
may determine which nations are pulled into the global market and
which are left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas, notably much of Africa, might even welcome an
invasion of foreign technology investment.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 800 million people in nearly 50 countries speaking
hundreds of dialects and often in conflict with one another, Africa
has attracted almost no technology investment. Add to those
problems the continent's relatively high levels of poverty and
illiteracy, and the risk-reward ratio is not exactly compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Yet people like Noah Samara are willing, and even eager, to take
the risk.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of planning and development, Samara, the
Ethiopian-born founder and chairman of Worldspace Corp. in
Washington, began broadcasting digital radio programming from his
company's Afristar satellite on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Afristar, the first of three Worldspace satellites (two more
serving Asia and Latin America are to be launched in 2000), is the
first satellite to deliver simultaneous programming to the entire
African continent.
</P>
<P>
   If all three satellites are in orbit by the end of next year,
Worldspace's potential audience will be more than 4.8 billion
people.
</P>
<P>
   Worldspace was conceived when, while practicing law in
Washington, Samara saw the AIDS epidemic ravaging Africa. People
desperately needed information to stem the spread of the virus, he
realized, but distributing printed materials was expensive and
impractical in a continent with so many remote areas and such
illiteracy, and television sets were rare and were too expensive
for most Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Samara's answer was the world's first portable satellite media
receiver: a digital radio that connects with various power sources,
including solar panels for poor, rural areas, as well as to PCs and
printers.
</P>
<P>
   The receivers, manufactured by Matsushita's Panasonic and JVC
subsidiaries, Hitachi and Sanyo, cost about $250 today, Samara
said. That seems prohibitively expensive, but he said that ``once
you start introducing new products and services, people start
working harder to make sure they can benefit from the
conveniences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've calculated the number of families in our coverage area
that can afford receivers at these prices,'' he added. ``We
designed the African satellite's footprint to cover the more
affluent Middle East, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Why radios and not the Internet? Digital radio was the only
solution that made sense, he insisted, because it was the cheapest,
most efficient way to reach the widest population, from poor,
illiterate rural villages to more affluent urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the most adaptable, he said, because the digital
radios could also receive data, like documents and static Web
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Worldspace, with $1.2 billion of investments, primarily from
Saudi backers, hopes to make money by selling time on the
satellites to various broadcasters, and by offering pay services of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   Today, these include Time Warner's CNN International and
Bloomberg Financial News as well as national and indigenous
broadcasts from countries like Egypt, Ghana, Senegal and South
Africa. But more interesting than its commercial services is its
goal of creating markets by fighting poverty.
</P>
<P>
   A central part of Samara's strategy was setting aside 5 percent
of his satellites' capacity for a nonprofit organization called
Equal Access, which Worldspace started with Solaria, a solar-energy
equipment provider and the State of the World Forum
(www.worldforum.org), a nonprofit global leadership and education
organization formed by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Equal Access aspires to provide free digital radios and a rich
flow of basic information, including educational and health
programming, to the poorest African villages, at a net cost of $10
a user.
</P>
<P>
   Its strategy is to get money directly from organizations like
UNESCO and the World Bank, which have millions of dollars earmarked
for poverty-eradication programs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An early project will be a Pan-African, noncommercial news
program, in the tradition of National Public Radio. Samara calls it
``the voice of Africa talking to the people of Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   And because the Worldspace radio receiver can also connect with
a PC and a printer, even remote villages would be able to receive
multimedia data for distance learning and health programs as well
as school curriculums in multiple languages.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most l project for Equal Access, says Tom
Rautenberg, director of strategy and program development for State
of the World Forum, is a broadcasting service for women and
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned from World Bank studies that the education of
women and girls is probably the most critical variable in
sustainable development,'' Rautenberg says. ``Their status and
economic potential is a leading indicator of how that community is
doing and its potential for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Samara is dedicated to changing the lives of Africans
and others in developing countries, he argues that the strategy
makes business sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought a lot about how to subsidize the development of the
poorest part of the market,'' he said. ``People need so many things
in these areas _ information on hygiene, how to be better
entrepreneurs, a whole range of issues. If we can do that, we will
help them break through some of the hardest barriers.''

POP REVIEW: THE STARS GIVE A PARTY FOR A GLOBAL WEB SITE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When is a benefit not a benefit? When it's a start-up party for
a Web site. Three all-star concerts were given on Saturday for
www.netaid.org, a Web site intended to take on not just one cause
on one occasion but long-term work on five major global issues:
poverty, the environment, human rights, refugees and poor
countries' debt. It was a way for stars to demonstrate concern
about everything from malnutrition in Bolivia to toxic oil-refinery
waste in Lake Charles, La.
</P>
<P>
   Net Aid was modeled on Live Aid, the shows in England and the
United States that raised $200 million for African famine relief in
1985. While donations were accepted (to be used for refugee relief
efforts in Kosovo and in Africa), the goal of Net Aid was primarily
to publicize the Web site. Net Aid, supervised by the U.N.
Development Program, is a clearinghouse for volunteer efforts,
donations, information on agriculture and business development and
Internet-style organizing, including an e-mail petition urging
developed countries to forgive $371 billion in third-world debt.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. concert, Net Aid New York, took place at Giants Stadium
in East Rutherford, N.J.. The nearly eight-hour show began and
ended with Wyclef Jean and Bono. They had collaborated on a song
for Net Aid, ``New Day,'' which touches on problems from
unemployment to crime to homelessness but promises, ``Sun got the
darkness on the run.'' The lineup also included Puff Daddy, Sting,
Jewel, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes, Sheryl Crow, the Black Crowes,
Counting Crows, Jimmy Page, the Algerian singer Cheb Mami and the
Italian rocker Zucchero. Although nearly all the performers have
sold at least a million albums each, the scattered lineup didn't
fill the stadium; the top tier was empty, as were expanses of the
lower tiers and the field.
</P>
<P>
   Between sets, the audience at Giants Stadium saw video clips
from the two other Net Aid concerts: a packed performance at
Wembley Stadium near London, with a lineup including David Bowie,
the reunited Eurythmics, George Michael, Bush, Bryan Adams, the
Corrs and Robbie Williams, and an invitation-only event at the
Palais des Nations in Geneva with Bryan Ferry and Des'ree, which
was attended by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The concerts
were broadcast on radio stations in 132 countries and shown on VH1
and MTV in the United States and on the BBC. A two-hour show of
excerpts is scheduled for Wednesday night at 8 on the TNT cable
network.
</P>
<P>
   With television cameras transmitting to an international
audience, the musicians didn' on production values. They
brought full bands, choirs, string orchestras and, for Puff Daddy,
pyrotechnics. They also refrained from profanity.
</P>
<P>
   Some stars brought out their most earnest, idealistic anthems.
Bono _ dressed in a quasi-military uniform and wearing a cap from
Jubilee 2000, an organization pressing for debt forgiveness _ sang
``One'' with a string orchestra conducted by Quincy Jones,
insisting, ``We got to carry each other.'' Jewel declaimed like a
gospel preacher in ``Life Uncommon,'' which grows militant: ``There
is a new army coming and we are armed with faith/To live, we must
give.''
</P>
<P>
   Others just treated their short sets as condensed versions of a
regular show. The guitarist Jimmy Page rocked the stadium with
time-tested arena fare when he played his old Led Zeppelin songs
while Chris Robinson, of the Black Crowes, sang as much as he could
like Robert Plant; Robinson, a Southerner, was imitating an
Englishman who emulated Southern blues singers. Mary J. Blige
lavished her voice on songs about romantic strife, as her vows and
pleas gave way to wordless, virtuosic swoops, blending the cutting
tone of Dinah Washington with the gutsiness of Gladys Knight. Busta
Rhymes set off one party chant after another, machine-gunning
syllables and racing around the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Net Aid is touted as the largest Web site to date, showing off
technology from Cisco Systems, which contributed more than $10
million to the site; it claims the ability to handle one million
connections a minute. The concerts were shown on the Internet,
through an electronic network 10 times larger than the previous
largest Webcasts (for Victoria's Secret and the opening of the 1998
Olympics), able to send out 125,000 video streams simultaneously.
But on a home computer with a 56K modem, sound and video quality
were still murky, and network traffic made connections difficult in
some areas. Douglas Graham, who oversaw the design and software of
the Web site for KPMG, ascribed the problems to local Internet
providers and high Internet use on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than Live Aid, the Net Aid concert drove home stark
contrasts between the haves, onstage and in the audience, and the
have-nots. Puff Daddy's songs celebrated material success _ the
Mercedes, the cell phones _ but then, in a burst of piousness,
insisted there's more to life than a platinum Rolex. He was the
concert's prime showman, with a white piano, a white-robed gospel
choir, puffs of flame and two guest hard-rock guitarists to show
he's keeping up with the metal-rap trend: Slash of Guns 'n' Roses
and Page, who let Puff Daddy turn Led Zeppelin's ``Kashmir'' into a
wounded lover's rant.
</P>
<P>
   Video clips, shown during equipment changes, detailed harrowing
situations and statistics: arms hacked off during Sierra Leone's
civil war, 22 million refugees, 800 million people chronically
undernourished, 1.3 billion people in extreme poverty. They made
for some bizarre juxtapositions. Immediately after a segment on
teen-age prostitution and drug addiction in Russia, a video clip of
the Corrs at Wembley was shown. ``It really doesn't matter if we
don't eat/It really doesn't matter if we never sleep,'' they sang,
`` 'Cause we are so young now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly absent from the concerts was any music from the countries
that Net Aid is intended to help most. Sting made an effort by
turning over a song (and his band) to Cheb Mami, an Algerian rai
singer with an expressive, fine-pointed voice. And Jean,
over-reaching his limited skills on guitar, tried to cover the
United States (with rap, rockabilly and blues) and the Caribbean
(with ``Guantanamera'' and a version of ``Hot, Hot, Hot'' that
turned the original soca into a Haitian compas). As cyberspace is
now, Net Aid was a sphere of the affluent, but one that envisions
affecting the whole world.

   HOLLYWOOD _ A year ago, Universal Pictures was a forlorn little
puppy. The studio's entire roster of summer movies had grossed just
$62 million. And to cap it all, Universal finished a lackluster
year by watching its two most expensive and important films of late
1998, ``Meet Joe Black'' and ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' tank at the
box office.
</P>
<P>
   It was a debacle. Casey Silver, the chairman of Universal's
movie division, was dismissed in November. And rumors permeated
Hollywood that Seagram, which owns Universal Studios, would sell
off the movie division or at least chop off a few more executive
heads.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it was as if somebody had flipped a switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams,'' the Robin Williams comedy about an
unconventional doctor, was released last Christmas Day and went on
to earn $135 million at the domestic box office and $200 million
worldwide. In May, Universal released ``The Mummy,'' a
special-effects-laden spin on the old horror staple; it made $155
million domestically and more than $400 million worldwide,
exceeding all expectations and creating a new movie franchise for
the studio.
</P>
<P>
   These were followed by ``Notting Hill,'' a romantic comedy with
Julia Roberts that earned $116 million domestically; ``American
Pie,'' a teen-age sex comedy, that earned $101 million
domestically, and ``Bowfinger,'' the Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy
comedy, which has taken in $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Oct. 2, something remarkable occurred, said Ron Meyer,
Universal Studios' president and chief operating officer. Someone
in America bought a ticket to a Universal movie that day, breaking
the 87-year-old studio's single-year domestic box-office record of
$709,652,731 _ a record that had stood since 1982, the year of
Steven Spielberg's ``E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.'' A month
earlier, the studio had also broken its three-year-old
international record of almost $910 million, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for studios to break box-office records;
ticket prices keep going up and such records can be affected by
luck and timing. And of course, a record year at the box office
does not automatically translate to record profits. As Meyer points
out, it is possible to buy a record year simply by releasing more
films than usual _ although Universal did not do so this year. And,
of course, profitability depends not only on how much the films
take in but how much they cost to make.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's ``Meet Joe Black,'' for instance, cost more than $90
million but grossed only $45 million at the domestic box office. By
comparison, this year's ``Mummy'' has long since recouped its $78
million cost.
</P>
<P>
   It is tricky to gauge from a single year's box office whether a
studio will be profitable for that year because it generally takes
three years for the bulk of a film's revenues to go through the
cycle of worldwide distribution, video and cable. But Meyer is
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a devastating year last year,'' he said, ``and we will
pay the price for that for the next several quarters. But we're on
our way to profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   The studio still has seven films to release this year, including
``End of Days,'' with Arnold Schwarzenegger; ``Man on the Moon,''
with Jim Carrey, and ``The Hurricane,'' with Denzel Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most intriguing about this year's performance for
Universal is that it comes so quickly on the heels of such a dismal
year _ and that it comes amid so many persistent whispers in
Hollywood that the studio lacks a defining vision; that its
corporate parent is less interested in movies than in its newly
expanded music division; that it might be sold or merged at any
moment, or that its top executives were about to depart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard those rumors and it's just ridiculous,'' said
Meyer, a founder of the Creative Artists Agency who came to run
Universal in 1995 after Seagram purchased the company from
Matsushita for $5.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors that Seagram and its chairman, Edgar Bronfman Jr.,
were more interested in music than film were sparked by Seagram's
deal in May 1998 to pay $10.4 billion to purchase Polygram, the
world's largest music company, which is now merging with
Universal's existing music division.
</P>
<P>
   But Seagram is not losing interest in movies, Meyer said. ``If
they felt that way, frankly, they would get out of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the notion that he would depart, Meyer expressed
exasperation. ``The rumors keep coming, every day it's a new name
who's coming to replace me,'' said Meyer, who added that he had no
intention of leaving or of changing the current top management
team, including Brian Mulligan and Stacey Snider, who replaced
Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Another persistent rumor is that Dreamworks SKG _ the studio
formed by Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen that has
most of its offices on Universal's lot, and whose films Universal
distributes abroad _ will merge with Universal. Not so, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are personally close friends of mine,'' he said. ``And
there is no talk of anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way to measure box-office performance for a studio _ a
way that takes into account both the films that succeed and those
that fail _ is to measure the studio's average revenues from each
film. In 1998, Universal's per-film revenue was $4.5 million; thus
far this year, it is $23 million, an increase of more than 400
percent. And the studio's market share has grown _ to 12.5 percent
this year, up from 2.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But is there any way to determine whether this indicates a
fundamental turnaround or simply a blip caused by the vicissitudes
of the movie business?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never tell,'' said Jessica Reif Cohen, a media and
entertainment analyst for Merrill Lynch. ``For some reason, these
studios tend to go in cycles. It's a hit-or-miss business and very
difficult to predict.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal executives fully expect that some people will find
irony in the fact that Universal is having its record year with a
roster of films that was developed while Silver was chairman of the
studio _ and that the hot streak began just a month after Silver
was dismissed. But Meyer has a ready response.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are clearly working better as a team this year,'' Meyer
said. ``Which is not to say that Casey Silver didn't make a
significant contribution to this year.'' But a lot of the other
executives who were developing films along with Silver, including
Ms. Snider, are still at the studio, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Michael Shamberg, president of Jersey Films, one of 31
production companies that has deals with Universal, said: ``Give
Casey credit for some of the films. But this management team has
made some good strategic decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Shamberg mentioned the decision to open two
movies _ ``The Mummy'' and ``Notting Hill'' _ just before and just
after the release of the hotly anticipated ``Star Wars: Episode
1,'' when many studios were moving their films as far as possible
from that George Lucas juggernaut. It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, who is still negotiating his final release from
Universal and has not yet announced his plans for the future, said
the performance of Universal's films ``reflects the hard work of a
lot of people, all of whom deserve to take bows. I feel
satisfaction that the studio is very successful and I'm pleased for
the filmmakers, the executives and the rank and file.''
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in understanding the future of Universal
Pictures, and the current executives' vision for the studio, need
only look at the films that resulted in the record-breaking
performance this year, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The year was built on a diverse roster of successful films
rather than one or two blockbusters, and on the fruits of deals
with a long list of production companies, not just one or two.
Indeed, Amblin Entertainment, which once, along with Imagine Films
Entertainment, constituted the bulk of Universal's film roster, did
not have a single Universal film this year, though there are
several in development.
</P>
<P>
   Among the films Universal has in the works for 2000 and beyond
are several high-profile sequels, including ``Jurassic Park 3,''
``Mad Max IV'' and ``Hannibal,'' the sequel to ``Silence of the
Lambs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snider said the deal had finally been made last week for the
screenwriter for ``Hannibal,'' who will be Steve Zallian,
screenwriter for ``Schindler's List.'' Ridley Scott will direct.
The original film's stars, Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, are
waiting for a finished script to decide whether to take part in the
sequel, she said.
</P>
<P>
   What made this record year possible, Ms. Snider said, was that
``all of our groups _ production, marketing and distribution _ kept
their eyes on the ball during some really tough times.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Davis, an entertainment industry analyst for Schroder and
Co., said the Universal team deserves credit. ``I think things are
working at Universal at the moment and some of the griping people
have had will go away,'' Davis said. ``Does that mean Universal is
the prime integrated machine that Disney is? No. But they're making
progress.''

SOME ARTS GROUPS SILENT ON MUSEUM DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Within a week after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani first
threatened to evict the Brooklyn Museum of Art over the
``Sensation'' exhibit, so many of the city's high-profile art
institutions signed a letter objecting to his actions that the
holdouts were conspicuous by their absence.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, signed by 22 of the 33 members of the Cultural
Institutions Group, which is made up of cultural organizations that
receive city financing, called the mayor's actions a ``dangerous
precedent'' that could cause ``lasting damage'' to cultural life in
New York. Those who signed represented a diverse group that
included the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Staten Island
Historical Society, the Bronx Zoo and the Queens Botanical Garden.
Ten nonmembers, including the Frick Collection, the Museum of
Modern Art, the Morgan Library and the Jewish Museum, also signed.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 member organizations _ among them Carnegie Hall and the
New York State Theater _ refused to sign. (The remaining member is
the Brooklyn Museum itself.) The missing signatures stood out even
more last week when cultural institutions as far off as the Seattle
Art Museum joined the Municipal Art Society's friend-of-the-court
brief supporting the Brooklyn Museum in its lawsuit to prevent the
mayor from withholding city money over art he finds offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the abstaining organizations would comment on the issue,
which has been a widespread and often impassioned topic of
conversation around the city. One of those queried, the Museum of
the City of New York, voiced support of the mayor, who has
excoriated a painting called ``The Holy Virgin Mary'' in which the
British artist Chris Ofili uses a shellacked clump of elephant dung
and cutouts from pornographic magazines. The museum's director,
Robert R. Macdonald, like the mayor, said he felt the work demeans
a religious image and should not be shown in a city-owned and
city-supported museum.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of other cultural centers were far more
circumspect in discussing their decisions on the protest letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while I have no comment, and this is one of those
times,'' said Howard J. Rubenstein, the high-profile public
relations man, who is a vice chairman of the board of the Museum of
Jewish Heritage _ A Living Memorial to the Holocaust, at the
southern tip of Manhattan. Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan
district attorney, who is chairman of the Holocaust museum, also
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Martin J. Oppenheimer, a lawyer who is board chairman at the New
York State Theater _ home to the City Ballet and the City Opera _
would not comment, although he said that did not necessarily mean
the board supported the mayor. ``You can't draw any conclusions,''
he said. ``We're very much in favor of the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center, which did not
sign the letter, also declined to comment. The center is not a
member of the Cultural Institutions Group.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Wada, a spokeswoman for Carnegie Hall, responded to an
inquiry by saying, ``The only statement we can make is that we have
no statement to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Hall, a century-old symbol of the city's cultural
riches, is the most prominent member of the Cultural Institutions
Group not to sign the letter. Beneath its silence, as for other
abstaining organizations, was a sharp debate with many viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Hall's decision, like the decisions of most of the
other institutions, was made at a hastily convened meeting of
administrators and board members. Sanford I. Weill, co-chairman of
Citigroup and Carnegie Hall's chairman, said through a spokesman
that he would not discuss the institution's position. But
conversations with board members indicated that the debate was
heated, not so much over whether the mayor's action was right or
wrong but over what should be done about it.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Allen, the president emeritus of the Harlem School of the
Arts, who has served on the Carnegie Hall board for 20 years, said
board members at last Wednesday's meeting were united in their
disapproval of the mayor's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody agreed that this is terrible, that he can't withdraw
funds like that,'' she said. ``We were astonished that anybody
would make up their mind about a work of art they hadn't even
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that state Sen. Roy Goodman, a Manhattan Republican and
longtime Giuliani supporter who has been a board member for 35
years, called the mayor's actions a violation of the First
Amendment, a description confirmed by Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, did the members decline to add Carnegie Hall's name
to the letter?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was hoping it was going to die by itself,'' Ms.
Allen said. ``We thought if we don't do something to add to the
publicity, maybe it will blow over. Everybody was sort of stunned
with the speed of this. We thought it would be better if we don't
take a position on something so stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, she added, the decision ``looks terrible for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allen was one of several board members interviewed who
objected to the mayor's position; none of those who thought it
would be wrong for Carnegie Hall to criticize him could be found to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake for Carnegie Hall, a leading cultural
institution, to remain mute,'' said Peter Jennings, the news anchor
and a board member, who said he did not hear about the meeting in
time to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Laura H. Pomerantz, a board member who is senior managing
director of Newmark &AMP; Co. Real Estate, would not discuss the
meeting but said, ``In my own personal opinion, everyone has the
right to hear and see what they choose to hear and see.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of at least one other abstaining center, the Staten
Island Children's Museum, had a similarly emotional discussion
before deciding to stay out of what Dina Rosenthal, the executive
director, called ``an issue between the Brooklyn Museum and the
mayor's office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it for quite a while,'' Ms. Rosenthal said.
``We were very, very torn about it. It was a very close vote.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Giuliani said the mayor did not call any groups
to pressure them about the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Two institutions, the Museum of the City of New York and the
Snug Harbor Cultural Center, explained their very different
decisions not to sign. Wayne Miller, the marketing director for the
Snug Harbor center, said the center abstained because of an
administrative gap: the former president has left, and the new one
has not yet started work. But, he added, the staff members'
feelings on the issue are running high. ``Most of us here think the
mayor is reaching beyond the executive post, and that this is
purely political,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of the City of New York was forthright in its support
for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demeaning of a religious symbol,'' Macdonald, the
director, said in a letter to Alan J. Friedman, the consortium's
director, outweighs the protection of ``free expression.''

STATIONS CHALLENGE DIGITAL-TV STANDARD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   (nk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing angry opposition, nearly 300 of the nation's
1,600 television stations filed a petition with the Federal
Communications Commission on Friday, formally requesting a revision
in the nation's digital-television standard that was approved
almost three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Sinclair Broadcasting of Baltimore, which owns or
operates 59 stations nationwide, the stations argue that the
present technical standard is flawed because the digital receivers
now on the market cannot easily receive a viewable picture in
anything short of ideal circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   That problem ``will likely lead to the failure of digital
television in this country,'' David Smith, Sinclair's chairman,
said in a satellite news conference beamed to other television
station owners on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But his opponents, primarily equipment manufacturers and
executives from other affected industries, describe just as dire an
outcome if the technical standard were to be reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reopening the standard will at the very least cause delay and
could completely derail the broadcasters' transition to digital
television,'' said Gary Shapiro, head of the Consumer Electronics
Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair, which operates more stations than any other company,
and the other station owners, which include Barry Diller's USA
Networks, but no stations from the major broadcast networks, drew
their conclusions from a series of tests Sinclair ran in Baltimore
over the summer comparing the American system with a European
alternative. A report on those tests, which Sinclair posted on the
Internet last week, shows that in almost every case the European
system was able to receive digital broadcasts when the American
system could not.
</P>
<P>
   The petition asks the FCC to modify the standard so that
broadcasters can choose to use either the American standard or the
European alternative. This would mean, though, that today's digital
receivers would not be able to pick up broadcasts from stations
that chose the new system. About 50,000 consumers have bought
digital television sets, though many of them have been sold without
digital receivers that can be purchased separately.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has not said what it will do with the broadcasters'
petition, although the most likely action would be to request
public comments over a several-month period before deciding what
subsequent steps, if any, to take.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's engineering staff issued a report 10 days ago, saying
the agency should leave the standard as it is. But other FCC
officials, including at least one commissioner, have said that the
staff report was not the last word and the commission should keep
an open mind.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC approved the nation's digital television standard in
December 1996, following aggressive lobbying from the broadcasting
industry. Digital broadcasts provide razor-sharp pictures and
high-resolution digital sound.
</P>
<P>
   The first digital receivers went on the market in August 1998,
and the first digital broadcasts began on Nov. 1. Three weeks from
Monday, every network affiliate station in the nation's 30 largest
cities, more than 120 stations in all, is supposed to begin
broadcasting on its second, digital channel. And sometime in the
next decade, under the government's rules, conventional analog
broadcasting is to end, leaving only digital.
</P>
<P>
   But Sinclair and the others say in their petition that the
system is so unreliable that the transition plan cannot work. The
Microsoft Corp. told Sinclair in a written statement on Friday that
it supported the petition but added that it would be inappropriate
to sign, because Microsoft did not own television stations.
Microsoft is thought to favor the European standard, because it is
better suited for transmitting signals to handheld, computerlike
devices.
</P>
<P>
   But a variety of manufacturers, retailers and network-television
executives all say they vehemently oppose changing the standard.
``We support the 8-VSB position,'' said Robert Seidel, a vice
president with CBS, using the technical name for the present
digital transmission standard. ``This is not the time to change
horses.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the opponents acknowledge that the Sinclair tests exposed
serious problems with the equipment now on the market but add that
future products will be much improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution to this problem is months away,'' said Craig
Tanner, executive director of the Advanced Television Systems
Committee, the industry group most responsible for maintaining and
promoting the present standard. ``I don't know if it's four months,
six, eight or 13 months.''
</P>
<P>
   But during a closed meeting of Tanner's group last Wednesday,
participants were not so sanguine, according to notes taken by one
unidentified participant that were circulated on the Internet later
in the week. They show industry representatives pessimistic that
the problems can be solved in the near future, and divided and
uncertain about how to counter the Sinclair petition. The
circumstances under which the private notes came to be made public
have not been determined, but Tanner confirmed that they were
genuine.
</P>
<P>
   One participant is quoted as saying, ``There is no clear
evidence that anything we are doing will really solve the
problem.'' Responding to that, a representative from the Zenith
Corp., which designed the transmission standard, is quoted as
saying: ``We have to push DTV and stop any negative comments.''
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, including Motorola and NxtWave
Communications, a start-up, are now demonstrating second-generation
products that solve the problems, according to the companies. The
meeting participants say that while the new chips offer
improvements, they still fall far short of the European system.
</P>
<P>
   The note taker summarized the sense of the meeting by writing:
``There is no real plan as to how to go forward over the next 18
months. The group is not well focused on action plans and reaction
to the Sinclair activity. Some of the group are hoping that the
problem goes away.''

   BUSH-CONSERVATIVE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Seven months into his
presidential campaign, George W. Bush is discovering the bumps in
the middle of the political road. While Bush is getting traction
with his effort to show that his self-styled ``compassionate
conservative'' label is not oxymoronic, the strategy also invites
attacks from the party's right lane. (Herman, Austin

   REFORM-PARTY _ For a political party all but declared dead 10
months ago, the Reform Party is garnering its share of attention
this month. Jack Gargan, the Floridian who heads the party, is
courting the likes of Jesse Ventura and Donald Trump. The party
``old liners'' are courting the likes of Pat Bucahan. Mike Murphy,
the GOP strategist, wonders why a party that isn't expected to

   HEPATITISC-PRISON _ Out of 42,000 people in Georgia prisons, 54
have hepatitis C. While that might seem a low count, Department of
Corrections health officials expect the number to increase almost
sixfold _ to about 300 _ by the end of next June. After that, their
numbers will continue to rise exponentially; how high is anybody's
guess because inmate lifestyles, such as intravenous drug use, make
them vunerable. (Cook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   METRIC _ So the guys at Lockheed speak English measure, the
people
</P>
<P>
   talking to their spacecraft speak metric and as a result the
multibillion dollar thing goes up like a fireball. Didn't their
teachers ever tell them, ``If you don't learn metric now, you're
going to be in a load of trouble when the whole world uses nothing
but.'' Do teachers still say that? On paper, the U.S. government is
still on a course towards complete conversion, but is anyone in the
classroom, or anywhere else taking that seriously? We'll talk to
some teachers, look at the law, etc. And all in time for next week
... National Metric Week. (Isger, Palm Beach Post)

LIMON DANCE CO.: THE BOXER AS ANTIHERO IN AND OUT OF THE RING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jose Limon was identified with epic themes in his
choreography. But many of his contemporaries in the modern dance of
the 1940s favored the equivalent of the urban short story,
especially if it had a social-protest subtext.
</P>
<P>
   Human insight links the separate genres, and the Limon Dance
Company has come up with a winner in its company premiere and
revival of Sophie Maslow's 1948 ``Champion,'' a terse tale about an
antihero, a man of the people who exploits the people.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maslow, who began her distinguished career in Martha
Graham's company in the 1930s, has often drawn inspiration from
life around her. One of her celebrated works is ``Dust Bowl
Ballads'' (1941), set to songs by Woody Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   The springboard for ``Champion'' was a story by Ring
Lardner &UR;  &LR; about a boxer, a public hero who is a heel in private
life. An outright period piece, ``Champion'' nonetheless came
across with exciting pungency when the Limon company performed it
last Friday night at the Joyce Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The work is more than a historical curiosity, and no one will
find the theme unfamiliar. How many pop stars lead a less than
exemplary life today, even if, unlike the Champion, they don't
steal from a crippled kid brother or beat up a hard-working mother?
To make Ms. Maslow's story complete, the protagonist here also
seduces a groupie (there is a shotgun wedding) and steals his
manager's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, Ms. Maslow has something to teach us, mainly the
art of emotional distillation through movement. ``Champion'' has
not been performed since 1950, and because there was no dance
notation or film of the work, Ms. Maslow and Donald McKayle have
reconstructed the original through memory and made some changes.
More dancers have been added, and the original jazz-tinctured score
by Samuel Matlowsky has been ``adapted and arranged,'' as the
program puts it, by David LaMarche, the company's music director
and conductor. Matlowsky asked that his name be omitted from this
production.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever changes were made, ``Champion'' remains true to a
mainstream modern-dance esthetic of the 1940s that knew how to
telegraph psychological states through significant gesture. The
point is that the gesture is the movement; gesture is not imposed
on top of dance movement.
</P>
<P>
   This is a method that choreographers who seek to express
narrative content today fail to understand after years of working
with formal plotless dances. The Limon company has ventured
successfully into the style of psychological portraits in the past
by reviving Daniel Nagrin's bad-boy solos of the 1940's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Champion'' is the kind of piece no young choreographer today
could do. It is both stylized and realistic at the same time, and
its moral lessons, although mordant, are lessons. In short,
didactic.
</P>
<P>
   The witty conceit of the piece is to suggest a blow-by-blow
account of the champion's life by a sports announcer. Charley
Hayward, an actor, spits out his ringside narration brilliantly and
gutsily from a balcony while on stage the danced images offer a
negative contrast to the fighter's public adulation.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Vollet Kingston's costumes are a contemporary version of
originals that once suggested different walks of life for a crowd
that opens and closes the piece.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers have caught the spirit of the work, but Jonathan
Reidel stands out in the title role. In his shoulder-rotating
swagger and powerful stride he has the gait of a born bully and
manages to make his eyes burn like embers. Bradon McDonald as the
brother and Nina Watt as the mother do well with stock roles.
</P>
<P>
   Each round in the fight gushily described by the announcer is
equated with an episode in the hero's life. ``The Gym,'' a lively
segment, has McDonald, Robert Regala, Zhen Jun Zhang and the
impressive and intense Raphael Boumaila do some stylized feisty
shadow boxing around Carlos Orta, the manager. A group of women
fans leans forward.
</P>
<P>
   Reidel's seduction of Kimiye Corwin, who is instantly
transformed into his bride, takes place to a sardonic waltz and is
followed by the hero's further womanizing. Natalie Desch, excellent
as always in her clarity, is the slinky sophisticated girlfriend
who loses out to Carla Maxwell, as the manager's wife. Miss Maxwell
and Reidel depict an adult passion within a stylized tango. Ted
Sullivan's lighting adds the right drama to a suite of vignettes
that have the power of truth.
</P>
<P>
   The program included repeats of two Limon pieces, ``The Winged''
and ``The Moor's Pavane,'' with Orta as the Othello figure
surrounded by a new cast: Ms. Watt, Reidel and Ms. Ford. All did
well, although more projection could help. On the other hand the
company was outstanding in its communal fervor last Saturday
afternoon in Limon's ``There Is A Time.''

 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After it was over, the stage at last cleared and the
audience buzzing on its way out after 10 full minutes of standing
applause, Arthur Miller stood in the wings backstage at the Civic
Opera House here, with an expression of stunned quietude.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the company of just a few friends _ a noisy
celebration was already under way elsewhere _ and no one was
speaking much. Miller, 83, who for the first time had just seen and
heard the adaptation by Lyric Opera of Chicago of his 1955 play,
``A View From the Bridge,'' had a hard time expressing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea it would be so . . . '' he began, and then he
faltered, searching for the right word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such, of course, is opera.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was, indeed, a big night. The critics had yet to weigh
in, and OK, there was a trickle of grumblers who hurried from the
theater as soon as the curtain fell. But in the aftermath of the
world premiere of ``A View From the Bridge,'' more than four years
after it was commissioned from the composer William Bolcom and the
librettist Arnold Weinstein, the creators and performers were
ebullient, thrilled by the enthusiasm of an overall audience
reaction that seemed to confirm their highest hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty happy,'' said Wendall Harrington, the projection
artist whose mammoth slides recreated scenes of Red Hook, Brooklyn,
circa 1950, for the show's set. ``It's a little scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Russell Davies, the conductor, was less ambivalent. ``We
bet on the right horse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the relief-filled end. For many of the creators,
however, as well as several hundred members of the audience and
dozens of critics and reporters, opening night began in the
morning, at a public symposium at a theater not far from the opera
house, and just across the street from the Hilton, where President
Clinton had spent the night.
</P>
<P>
   His departure delayed the start of the symposium, which was on
the subject of the creation of the opera. The panelists included
Miller, Davies, Bolcom, Weinstein, the director Frank Galati and
the general director of Lyric Opera, William Mason. The discussion
was lively, as these things go, with a minimum of mutual praise and
generally meaty answers to questions posed by the moderator, Norman
Pellegrino, a local radio broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   For the benefit of those who had never seen the original play,
Galati, sitting next to Miller and looking a little awestruck, gave
a rather nuanced and dramatic synopsis of the plot, which is about
a Brooklyn dockworker named Eddie Carbone, who has agreed to harbor
his wife's cousins, Marco and Rodolpho, illegal immigrants from
Italy, in his home. Rodolpho falls in love with Eddie's niece,
Catherine, who returns his affections, and Eddie, provoked by his
own discomforting desire for her, reveals the presence of Rodolpho
and Marco to the immigration bureau. In a final, violent
confrontation with Marco, Eddie is killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was that OK?'' Galati asked Miller, who patted him on the
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who has done few interviews with regard to the opera,
spoke infrequently during the symposium, but what he revealed was
deliciously intimate. He was never an opera buff, he said, but he
was once musical. As a teen-ager, he said, he sang on the radio,
with a blind pianist as an accompanist who Miller said described
him as ``the new Al Jolson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I quit,'' he said, although he added, ``I had a
very good voice, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The lyrics Miller wrote for one aria in the opera, ``A Ship
Called Hunger,'' in which Marco sings in anguish about the plight
of the immigrant, had their roots, he said, in a visit he made to
Italy just after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suffering in that place was terrible,'' he said. ``It's
all forgotten now.'' But the aria, he said, was a way of making
vivid his memory. During the visit, ``I suddenly realized that I
hadn't seen a fat person,'' he said. ``Everyone was very thin, and
they were leaning on something all the time.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The story told by the play itself, he said, was based on one
that he had heard in Brooklyn, a neighborhood legend; he did not
know the family. He did not know how the story ended; all he knew
was that the uncle had called the immigration service.
</P>
<P>
   It was during an off-Broadway production of the play in the
mid-1960s, however, that he got some further input. A cast member,
Richard Castellano (who later came to fame as Clemenza in ``The
Godfather''), had noticed that a working-class man had come to see
the show several times and each time remained in his seat when it
was over, crying. Finally, after one show, Miller said, Castellano
talked to the man, who told him, in Italian, that he knew the
family whose story the play told.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened in the Bronx, the guy said,'' Miller recalled
hearing from Castellano. ``And he said it's all true except for the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   According to this telling, ``Eddie went to lie down for nap on a
Sunday afternoon,'' Miller said, ``and the girl came in and stabbed
him in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   During the symposium, the opera house itself was busy. There had
been a performance of ``Falstaff'' the previous night, and
stagehands spent the morning striking and storing the ``Falstaff''
set and installing the one for ``View.'' In a rehearsal room,
meanwhile, the cast of Handel's ``Alcina,'' which opens here on
Oct. 30, was singing through the score.
</P>
<P>
   By the afternoon the carpenters backstage were watching Big Ten
football, but the lighting crew was at work. Some 200 lights had to
be refocused for the evening performance. Because the set for
``View'' includes huge projections on three screens onstage, the
lighting needs to be particularly precise _ no washes, no splashes
of light across the stage _ to keep as much light off the screens
as possible so the images on them remain vivid.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the lighting designer, Duane Schuler, was
making subtle changes in the cues for the first act finale. In the
scene Marco challenges Eddie to lift a chair by one leg, which he
cannot do. In a particularly dramatic visual moment Marco then
lifts the chair himself, a demonstration to Eddie of his physical
superiority.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the dress rehearsal, everyone felt we needed more of a
focus on Eddie and Marco,'' Schuler said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the theater, he experimented with new cues, calling
them via walkie-talkie to the control room in the rear of the
orchestra, to the light board operator, Jim Stenstrom, and to a
Lyric electrician, John Clarke, who was operating the slide
projectors. The new cues darkened the sides of the stage more
quickly, obscuring the places where other characters would be
standing; brightened a square of light in center stage for Marco
and Eddie, and almost imperceptibly quickened the fade of the
images on the projected screens. The effect was subtle but evident.
The two main characters would be isolated in a harsh square of
light, just before the stage went dark for intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The singers arrived by 6 p.m. for a 7:30 curtain. A flurry of
preparation in the dressing rooms. Makeup, wigs. At 6:45 Kim
Josephson, who plays Eddie; Gregory Turay, who plays Rodolpho, and
Juliana Rambaldi, who plays Catherine, were behind the closed
curtain on the set running through one of the opera's fight scenes:
``the smoochie-smoochie'' fight, as it became known, because during
it, Eddie ends up kissing both Rodolpho and Catherine on the lips.
</P>
<P>
   The run-through was for safety's sake, said Nicolas Sandys, the
fight director, to re-establish the choreography in the singers'
muscle memory. (The other fights were run through during
intermission.) Balance was particularly tricky for this fight,
which is on the part of the set that is raised a step up and has a
slightly raked floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opera singers tend to work forward and upward when they are
singing,'' Sandys said. ``We don't want them stumbling.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein, the crotchety librettist, watched the run-through,
then left to find his seat in the auditorium. ``Listen,'' he said,
offering his style of encouragement. ``everyone have a reasonable
time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was over all remarkably easygoing, with just one slight upset
backstage: one of the chorus members didn't show up on time,
causing the chorus master, Donald Palumbo, to begin sweating
noticeably. (The singer arrived with mere minutes to spare.)
Otherwise the mood in the dressing rooms was only mildly electric.
Davies, the conductor, a baseball fan buoyed by the Mets victory
that afternoon, went from room to room, ``just checking everyone's
temperature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Turay, who earlier in the week had said that he was having
trouble hearing his voice in the theater, where he was performing
for the first time, said he thought he had found his proper level.
</P>
<P>
   ``When in doub as loud as you can,'' he said with a
shrug. And Ms. Rambaldi accepted a diction note from the assistant
director, Amy Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's hungry, when his back hurts, Ms. Hutchison said,
quoting the libretto, and emphasizing, like Professor Higgins to
Eliza Dolittle, the repeated consonant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been eliding the H's a lot,'' Ms. Rambaldi
explained, just before the director, Galati, burst into the room
for a last-second message. ``Can I just say I love you?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At intermission the mood was cautiously optimistic. So far, so
good, was the catch phrase. At least one performer was already
looking to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get it produced again, then it'll be good,'' said
Timothy Nolen, the baritone who plays Alfieri, the neighborhood
lawyer who narrates the piece. ``If it's not done again, the whole
thing is a waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolcom, jittery, spoke hopefully, seeking a bit of reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty happy, pretty happy,'' he said. ``I'm kind of numb.
There were some tiny little train wrecks. Kim came in late on one
entrance, but he covered it, which is known in vaudeville as a
save.''
</P>
<P>
   Galati, who was found wandering the lobby as the second act
began, looked particularly nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the first act; that's all I can stand,'' he said.
``There were a few wobbly spots. Juliana was late on her first
entrance; I'm dying to know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   One especially confident participant was Catherine Malfitano,
the veteran soprano who plays Beatrice, Eddie's wife. Relaxing in
her dressing room in a blue polka-dot bathrobe, waiting for her
second-act entrance, she was passing the time writing
congratulatory notes to her fellow cast members.
</P>
<P>
   ``In dress rehearsal I made a word mistake,'' she said. ``And
that was good. You worry when the dress is perfect. Tonight it's
going so well; we were really looking at each other, really
connecting, eyeball to eyeball.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost supernaturally calm, she was looking forward to the rest
of the evening. ``I keep thinking about Arthur Miller,'' she said.
``What's he thinking, sitting there?''
</P>
<P>
   In the wings after the show Miller eventually found his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be a dozen different musical styles, and yet it's
all one piece,'' he said, sounding like the novice opera goer he
admits to being, and a convert to the form.
</P>
<P>
   So he is no critic. On this night, his opinion was pretty
weighty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a marvelous piece,'' the playwright said, quietly.  &QL;

 &HT;    NBA'S HEAT CAUSES STIR AMONG SURPRISED BELIEVERS AT WAILING WALL
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (s) Sports categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox Newspapers(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ They wore bandanas and team ball caps instead of the
customary yarmulkes. They reached far above the other worshipers
when pressing their messages to God in the cracks of the
2,000-year-old Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Miami Heat came to Jerusalem Sunday and turned heads
even among the believers who did not know them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to find out who that guy is,'' yelled Jay Stern, a
20-year-old religious student from Montreal, trying to decipher an
autograph from Heat star center Alonzo Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, dressed in the black suit and fedora worn by many
Orthodox Jews, was in the sparse crowd when two buses bearing The
Heat entourage rolled past the security gates onto the large,
usually pedestrian, plaza at the Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat are in Israel to play an exhibition game Monday night
against perennial Israeli champions Maccabi Tel Aviv. The visit to
the Wall(CQ) _ accompanied by crew-cut body guards often afforded
visiting celebrities _ was part a short tour of Jerusalem between
practices and team meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is not even on my mind right now,'' Mourning said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall forms part of the retaining base of the temple built by
Herod the Great and destroyed in 70 A.D. It is one of the holiest
sites in Judaism. It is regularly visited by tourists of all
religions.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wall, Morning was lead in a short Hebrew prayer by an
elderly rabbi known for his unsolicited blessings of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   He joined his teammates and other worshipers in placing
handwritten prayers between the stones. The players declined to say
what they had written, but said they were thinking of family and
good health, not hoops, in their notes to God.
</P>
<P>
   Still, pressure for a Heat championship followed the team on its
travels.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of those gathered at the Wall _ many religious
immigrants from western countries _ did not know of the Heat,
Israelis in general are avid basketball fans.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli reporters in a press conference Saturday night asked
Heat coach Pat Riley the questions he might expect back home: Will
this finally be the Heat's year? What happened in their play-off
loss last season? Why didn't they make more moves in the
off-season?
</P>
<P>
   The game is expected to sell out the 10,000-seat arena in Tel
Aviv. Though a soccer game took top billing, Israeli sports reports
Sunday night offered a feature on ``legendary coach Pat Riley'' and
commercials hyped the match up.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat agreed to play the exhibition in 1996 as part of a deal

 &HT;    NBA'S HEAT CAUSES STIR AMONG SURPRISED BELIEVERS AT WAILING WALL
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (s) Sports categories.

   JERUSALEM _ They wore bandanas and team ball caps instead of the
customary yarmulkes. They reached far above the other worshipers
when pressing their messages to God in the cracks of the
2,000-year-old Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Miami Heat came to Jerusalem Sunday and turned heads
even among the believers who did not know them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to find out who that guy is,'' yelled Jay Stern, a
20-year-old religious student from Montreal, trying to decipher an
autograph from Heat star center Alonzo Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, dressed in the black suit and fedora worn by many
Orthodox Jews, was in the sparse crowd when two buses bearing The
Heat entourage rolled past the security gates onto the large,
usually pedestrian, plaza at the Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat are in Israel to play an exhibition game Monday night
against perennial Israeli champions Maccabi Tel Aviv. The visit to
the Wall(CQ) _ accompanied by crew-cut body guards often afforded
visiting celebrities _ was part a short tour of Jerusalem between
practices and team meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is not even on my mind right now,'' Mourning said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall forms part of the retaining base of the temple built by
Herod the Great and destroyed in 70 A.D. It is one of the holiest
sites in Judaism. It is regularly visited by tourists of all
religions.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wall, Morning was lead in a short Hebrew prayer by an
elderly rabbi known for his unsolicited blessings of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   He joined his teammates and other worshipers in placing
handwritten prayers between the stones. The players declined to say
what they had written, but said they were thinking of family and
good health, not hoops, in their notes to God.
</P>
<P>
   Still, pressure for a Heat championship followed the team on its
travels.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of those gathered at the Wall _ many religious
immigrants from western countries _ did not know of the Heat,
Israelis in general are avid basketball fans.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli reporters in a press conference Saturday night asked
Heat coach Pat Riley the questions he might expect back home: Will
this finally be the Heat's year? What happened in their play-off
loss last season? Why didn't they make more moves in the
off-season?
</P>
<P>
   The game is expected to sell out the 10,000-seat arena in Tel
Aviv. Though a soccer game took top billing, Israeli sports reports
Sunday night offered a feature on ``legendary coach Pat Riley'' and
commercials hyped the match up.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat agreed to play the exhibition in 1996 as part of a deal
to win rights from the Tel Aviv team for draft pick Martin
Muursepp. It was also looked forward to by Heat founder Ted Arison,
a billionaire American-Israeli who died on Oct. 1.

JETS' JOHNSON EXPECTS A PRIME-TIME PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, you think Monday Night Football is pressure? Keyshawn
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure is having my NFL draft party at the House of Blues on
Sunset Boulevard, inviting 3,000 people _ and then taking my
midterm the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Johnson is grinning, flashing what looks like three rows of
white teeth. He does that often when he contemplates the actions of
ordinary football players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear guys talk about overcoming adversity,'' he said. ``I
sit there and laugh and say, `You don't know about pressure until
you've lived in South Central L.A.'''
</P>
<P>
   If prime time were a 16-game season, Johnson would be averaging
98 catches and more than 1,100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But he probably could have told you that himself. And he would
be right. He knows his stats.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night is his moment, and he expects to be at his best.
The Jets are playing their first Monday night game at home in seven
years, in the glow of the bright lights of the big city, the
opponent is the highly regarded Jacksonville Jaguars, and Johnson
understands how important a victory is for his 1-3 club.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he expects his ``A'' game Monday night. He will go against
the Jaguars' cornerback Aaron Beasley, who leads the American
Football Conference with three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go against the `A' players I go with my `A' game,''
Johnson said. ``When I play against lesser players, I go down to
their level.''
</P>
<P>
   It is in prime-time that Johnson pushes the envelope _ and
defensive backs _ with his 6-foot-3-inch frame.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to his rookie season of 1996, Johnson has played in
eight of these ``spotlight games:'' five on Sunday or Monday nights
in prime time, a network Saturday game and two playoff games. He
averages six catches and 71 yards in those network appearances _
compared to 4.5 receptions and 65 yards for all the other games he
has played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relaxed in pressure games,'' Johnson said. ``When I relax,
my concentration is higher. I've been like that pretty much all the
time in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In Johnson's final performance at Southern California in 1996,
he established a Rose Bowl record of 216 receiving yards against
Northwestern. It was part of a 12-catch, one-touchdown day.
</P>
<P>
   As a Jets' rookie eight months later, he was the lightning rod
on a woeful team that was invited to play in only one prime-time
game. It was against Washington on a Sunday night. With the Jets
trailing by 8 points, Johnson outleaped a defender in the end zone
and hauled in an alley-oop pass from Neil O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   The officials conferred. There was no replay then. They spent 10
minutes discussing it, and then ruled he had interfered with the
defender _ no touchdown. But the next day, in a rare event, the
league apologized to the Jets. Johnson had indeed made a legitimate
touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   That was the start of his network appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Jets faced the Jaguars, Johnson couldn't wait.
He knew he would make things happen. He spoke during the week of
how he would be the most important person in that game, how he
wanted to be, and how, if anyone was logical about it, he should be
expected to star. It was his first playoff game in the pros, and it
came last January.
</P>
<P>
   He produced not only an extraordinary game, he turned it into an
event. By then Johnson had tired of comparisons to Jerry Rice or
Michael Irvin. Johnson explainecontinues to explain _ that
he uses skills beyond those plThat he blocks. That he runs.
He even plays defense.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Jaguars he ran for a touchdown on a 10-yard reverse,
he scored a touchdown on a 21-yard pass from Vinny Testaverde, he
produced an interception when he was used as a defender against a
desperation pass and also made a fumble recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Chrebet has been lauded as the Jets' clutch third-down
receiver, and with good reason. Chrebet has led the league in that
category and has always been among the best. But last season
Johnson tied for the league lead on third-down catches with seven
touchdowns. And with Testaverde, Johnson finally went to the Pro
Bowl last season.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Johnson led AFC receivers with 10 touchdowns, was
third with 83 receptions and fourth with 1,131 yards. This season
he is ahead of that pace in catches (22) and yards (366) and has
the best average of his career at 16.6 yards a catch.
</P>
<P>
   In only three-plus seasons, Johnson has caught passes from seven
Jets' quarterbacks: O'Donnell, Frank Reich, Glenn Foley, Ray Lucas,
Testaverde, Tom Tupa and now Rick Mirer.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Johnson about having to catch passes from all those
quarterbacks, and he knows there have been seven. He waited for
Mirer to catch up to him, to realize what could happen with their
collaboration. Johnson also points out that since he became a Jet,
he has drawn more penalties by defenders than any of his teammates.
He knows that he has been flagged only twice for holding the last
two years, while being asked to block for other teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Why such prime-time excellence?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe my focus changes,'' he said. ``I make mistakes in
regular games, but maybe they don't show. Maybe my mind doesn't
stray in front of a national audience out there rooting for me, and
most of the time in prime time I'm going against the top guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells understands what Johnson is saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are relaxed in big games,'' Parcells said. ``I
know I am. ``You know they're sharp. I told my team, you're
prepared for this week. They know it's a big game. What separates
people in football is their ability to do it. They don't always get
it done, but the mind and will are there. Some people's will is
diminished by adversity. You've got to get those guys off your team
pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mirer was looking for Johnson last Sunday in the fourth
quarter at Denver, with the Jets trailing, the quarterback tossed
four passes to him. Johnson caught two, but two more resulted in
penalties on cornerback Dale Carter. A total of 76 yards on the
80-yard scoring march involved Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know,'' Mirer said later, ``that when you throw
the ball up, something good is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, just how did Johnson do in that midterm exam after
his big draft party (he was the No. 1 pick over all) in Los Angeles
the night before?
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a B-minus,'' he said. ``Passed sociology.'' &QL;

<P>
   ROTFRONT, Kyrgyzstan _ With the stroke of a pen, Irene Pauls can
change her life forever.
</P>
<P>
   Because she is descended from German immigrants, Ms. Pauls is
eligible to move to Germany whenever she pleases. The German
government will give her a plane ticket, help in finding a home and
a job, and the prospect of a higher living standard than most
citizens of this remote and mountainous former Soviet republic
could ever imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally I'm tempted,'' Ms. Pauls said in fluent German as
she paused along Rotfront's tidy main street. ``My whole family and
my husband's whole family have gone. They're always writing to tell
us we should go, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What holds me back is that in Germany, we'll be penned up in
an apartment, maybe in a big city,'' she said. ``Here we live in a
beautiful place with clean air. The children have the whole
outdoors as a playground, plus animals to play with. There are
plenty of problems here, but still, it's my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pauls and the 300 other ethnic Germans who live in this
well-kept town are part of one of the world's most rapidly
disappearing ethnic minorities: Germans in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   These Germans, whose ancestors moved eastward for a variety of
reasons over the last 250 years, have made substantial
contributions to their adopted communities and nations. Many have
distinguished themselves by hard work, thrift and orderliness.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union went to war with Germany nearly 60 years
ago, ethnic Germans here found themselves under deep and sometimes
violent suspicion. For decades afterward they suffered insults and
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have the last laugh. While their former tormentors are
mired in poverty, the Germans canp and leave for one of the
world's most prosperous countries.
</P>
<P>
   Most already have. There were 100,000 ethnic Germans in this
land when Kyrgyzstan became independent in 1991, but only 11,000
remain.
</P>
<P>
   The doors to Germany were always open to these people, but
during the Soviet period, they were not allowed to leave. Now that
they are free to go, they are doing so in droves _ not just from
Kyrgyzstan but from across the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of the nearly 4 million ethnic Germans who
were living in the Soviet Union when it collapsed in 1991 have
moved to Germany. Most have integrated well, relying on language
skills and social patterns passed down through generations.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Kyrgyzstan, ethnic Germans live scattered across the
country. Rotfront is their largest community, but even here they
constitute only about one-third of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Residents still call the town Bergtal _ Mountain Valley _ its
original name. The Soviet authorities ordered it changed to
Rotfront, which means ``Red Front,'' after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we worked hard, we were always considered
enemies,'' said Paul Neuman, who left with his wife in 1993, when
he was 64, and who had returned here for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our teachers beat us and told us we were fascists,'' Neuman
recalled during his visit. ``We couldn't get into high schools or
universities. My brother married a Russian girl and took her name
so people wouldn't know he was German. But in the last few years,
things have gotten a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kyrgyz government is doing all it can to persuade remaining
Germans not to leave. President Askar Akayev visits Rotfront
regularly and always appeals to residents to stay and to contribute
to Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
   A sign of the esteem in which Germans are now held here may be
found in real estate classified advertisements. The phrase ``built
by Germans'' or ``formerly occupied by Germans'' is presumed to
denote a solid, well-maintained house that can command a higher
price than a comparable one built by Kyrgyz or Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The German government, which prefers to help ethnic Germans
improve their lives where they are rather than to bring them to
already crowded Germany, gives them various forms of aid. When
residents of Rotfront wanted to buy a flour mill recently, for
example, the German foreign aid agency provided a loan guarantee
and located a used mill that a German company wanted to sell.
</P>
<P>
   With flour from the mill, people here make bread for a
flourishing bakery. They also make butter, cheese and other dairy
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``From childhood, we've been taught to work and to earn,'' said
Abraham Falk, 45, who is the elected leader of the ethnic Germans
in Rotfront. ``That made a lot of people jealous of us, especially
in Soviet times, when it was considered wrong to have goals of your
own. But now, people are starting to learn from us. You can see the
changes starting in other villages near here.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk's seven brothers and sisters are all in Germany, and they
write regularly urging him to come. Their appeals have become
especially urgent in recent weeks, as a military conflict has
broken out in Kyrgyzstan between the army and fundamentalist
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   People in Rotfront do not fear that the conflict will spread to
this part of the country, but they worry that the army may draft
their sons, violating the pacifist religious beliefs that many of
them hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serving Christ is the main reason I stay here,'' said Falk,
who like many ethnic Germans in Kyrgyzstan is a practicing
Mennonite in this largely Muslim land. ``I think I'm doing
something positive by maintaining a Christian witness in this part
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   This month a pastor from Germany is visiting Rotfront, and part
of his mission is to persuade ethnic Germans to stay where they are
rather than move to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many who go are not happy,'' the pastor, Wolfgang Buehne, said
after delivering a Sunday sermon. ``They've learned that material
wealth is an illusion, and that earning more money doesn't fulfill
their inner needs. They go to Germany to gain something, but they
also lose something that may be much more valuable.''

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is very little
difference between Nebraska (No. 1) and Florida State (2), and the
difference between Alabama (7) and Tennessee (12) is somewhat
larger.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative records and average margin of victory of each
team's opponents do not include games against the ranked team.

 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies hoping to do business on the Web are being bombarded
with more ``solutions'' than ever _ all promising to provide
services that address the problem of how to set up shop online.
</P>
<P>
   And within the e-commerce sphere, the segment that ``solutions
providers'' seem to think needs the most help is the small-business
category. In fact, they may be right. According to the U.S. Small
Business Administration, only 30 percent of the nation's 24 million
small businesses accept orders on the Web, and far fewer can
process credit card transactions.
</P>
<P>
   But as more of those companies develop a full-scale Internet
presence _ and as everyone who ever had a lemonade stand decides to
sell something on the Web _e-commerce software and service
providers are competing more furiously for market share.
</P>
<P>
   One increasingly popular approach is to offer ``all-in-one''
e-commerce packages, in which merchants pay a nominal monthly fee
for software that enables them to build a site that is then hosted
by a third party _ sparing the client the cost of Web servers and
fast Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say such services generally fall short of providing
everything businesses need to succeed on the Web, which is, of
course, what many promise to do. Still, all-in-one packages have
proved to be a good way to test the Internet waters, according to
many business people who have used them. And as more competitors
enter the market, analysts say, the quality of low-priced
e-commerce services should improve.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Simon, for one, can attest to the wide array of low-cost
e-commerce packages available. Last year, Ms. Simon decided to
build a Web site, www.blindsdepot.com, to extend the reach of her
window-treatments business, which she had previously run by herself
selling door to door.
</P>
<P>
   A technology neophyte, Ms. Simon looked first at one of the
market leaders in one-stop e-commerce setup, Yahoo Stores. As with
other companies, Yahoo enables users to build a Web site in minutes
by filling out a series of forms online. For $100 a month, digital
entrepreneurs can post their store on Yahoo's site and offer as
many as 50 products for sale. The more products offered for sale,
the higher Yahoo's monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   Like its competitors, which range from established companies
like IBM to Internet service providers like Hiway Technologies and
other portal sites, Yahoo offers a host of additional features. It
aggregates orders and sends them via fax to the store owner for
processing, encrypts credit card numbers during processing and
offers a shopping cart feature, so customers can pay for multiple
products at once.
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Simon could not get from Yahoo _ or any e-commerce
provider, for that matter _ was placement high up on the results
pages of search engines. Seeking more shoppers, Ms. Simon opted for
an all-in-one package provided by iMall, which guarantees placement
on its shopping site, www.imall.com. When that also failed to
generate sales, she built a store using software provided by
Concentric Network, an Internet service provider that hosted the
site for $50 a month, and she set about learning how to manipulate
the search engines for better placement.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Concentric software tools were somewhat limited for
her purposes, Ms. Simon said, so she spent about $500 to build a
more sophisticated site with ShopSite software, from Open Market.
With the help of a consultant, she also learned how to increase her
site's visibility on search engines. The payoff, at last, came in
March, when sales started to roll. ``I'm making much more than
before,'' Ms. Simon said, though she would not disclose specific
numbers. ``And I'm working much less.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Staff, chief economist with Zona Research, a unit of
Intelliquest, said that ``there are literally dozens of features
that are needed to make an e-commerce site work well'' beyond those
offered by the one-stop e-commerce companies. Among other things,
Staff said, small businesses need technologies to analyze customer
activity on the site, gauge the effectiveness of advertisements,
personalize the site for each visitor, build incentive programs,
offer coupons and instant discounts, confirm orders and returns and
automate e-mail responses. ``And then the real issue becomes how to
get well known with consumers,'' Staff said.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard at least, e-commerce service providers feel their
customers' pain. According to Andrew Beebe, chief executive of
Bigstep.com, which provides e-commerce services to businesses,
profitability and visibility are difficult to achieve in this
category. ``There are a lot of people doing this,'' he said, ``and
they're making a lot of noise.''
</P>
<P>
   As for profitability, Beebe said his company, which began
operations last month, ``is not making any money at all right
now.'' The plan, at least, is to provide free help to small
businesses starting e-commerce sites, then sell them more advanced
technology services along the lines of what Staff, of Zona,
described. With 20,000 small businesses currently signed up and
hundreds more being added daily, Beebe said he can negotiate
discounts from e-commerce technology providers and extract a margin
with every sale to his customers. ``But this really is going to be
a tight-margin game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially likely if his competitors keep driving the
price of services down. ``Every time someone else thinks they're
going to sell something, we're going to give it away,'' said Serge
Wilson, chief executive of Freemerchant.com, which provides
e-commerce services completely free of charge. Wilson, whose
company has signed up 20,000 merchants, earns money by offering
suppliers like the Office Max retail chain access to Freemerchant
store owners.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson sees his service as an ideal entree for people who are
not sure they want to commit thousands of dollars to an Internet
business. ``A certain percentage of our merchants will never sell
successfully,'' he said. ``It takes the right product, and time and
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   It also takes more expertise in a given category than many
e-commerce newbies are willing to develop, said Larry Erlich,
founder of Domainregistry.com, who provides consulting services to
small businesses. ``Almost without fail, the people who try to
start an e-commerce site try something they have absolutely no
expertise in,'' he said. ``They're usually involved in a business
they could probably make some money with on the Web, but they want
to do something else. It's clicks and wishes.''

 `DATELINE': ONE WOMAN'S PUSH TO UNDO JUSTICE THAT WAS TOO
QUICK  (Eds.: Viewing date is for New York area. Check local
listings.) 
(jw) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to eyewitness testimony, you can't always believe
your eyes. Such is the lesson of Monday night's ``Dateline'' report
on a Greenwich Village murder in November 1990 that brought a quick
arrest and second-degree murder conviction for an 18-year-old man,
whom seven witnesses told a jury they had seen at the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   By the program's cautionary account, the only offense committed
by the teen-ager, Luis Rojas, was to fit the description of the
murderer's accomplice as a young Hispanic male wearing a bright
orange jacket. Rojas, in a jacket with an orange lining, was picked
up on the subway and, largely owing to the eyewitnesses, was found
guilty and sentenced to 15 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew him as a student with no record of violence came
to his defense, and a teacher's pleas moved Priscilla Read
Chenoweth, a 69-year-old legal editor, to act. Most of Monday's
hour is given to the evidence she gathered with the help of a
couple of former New York detectives: evidence suggesting that the
police, prosecutors and Rojas' lawyer failed in their professional
duties.
</P>
<P>
   The harshest criticism is of the arresting officers, who took
Rojas back to the crime scene within minutes of the murder. Several
bystanders, still shaken by the shooting, had an opportunity to see
him in his orange-lined jacket and handcuffs and would testify
against him. He was further identified in a carelessly arranged
line-up. Such procedures ran squarely contrary to police department
guidelines on gathering reliable eyewitness testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The young man who first implicated Rojas as the killer's
accomplice tells Stone Phillips, the program's reporter, that he is
still sure of his identification. ``I remember the face,'' the
witness says. But when another of his identifications had proved
faulty, he changed his story to say that Rojas was the one who
fired the murder gun. The program's strong suggestion is that the
air of certainty of this witness influenced others to join him.
</P>
<P>
   Given the evidence gathered by Ms. Chenoweth's investigators, an
appeals court came down hard on the police for their handling of
the case and on Rojas' lawyer for a sorry defense. In a retrial, a
jury acquitted. By then Rojas had spent 4{ years in a
maximum-security prison, and Ms. Chenoweth had spent $50,000 of her
retirement savings.

SING IT WITH ME: STAND BY YOUR HASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is only one thing wrong with country songs or bluegrass
music: they're fattening.
</P>
<P>
   Arlo Guthrie told the tale of ``Alice's Restaurant.'' Bob Dylan
rhapsodized about ``Country Pie.'' ``Home Grown Tomatoes'' was
written by Guy Clark, and Dave Akeman asked the musical question,
``How Many Biscuits Can You Eat?'' You wouldn't believe how many
biscuits I can eat, but that's another song.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Rodgers wrote about ``Peach-Picking Time in Georgia'';
Hank Williams recalled eating endless bowls of ``Jambalaya,'' with
side dishes of crawfish pie and file gumbo. Even songs about
starvation like, ``Take a Cold Tater and Wait'' make you hungry.
</P>
<P>
   John Prine is famous for his musical ode to ``Fish and
Whistle,'' but he is really a roast-beef hash kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Lundy, a former country music critic from Louisville,
wrote a cookbook containing ``memories and melodies from country
music stars.'' She called it ``Shuck Beans, Stack Cakes and Honest
Fried Chicken.'' She also shares Prine's lust for roast-beef hash.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Prine left his family home to return to Nashville, his
mother did more than pack him a lunch. She furnished him with ``big
Tupperware things of hash,'' Prine recalls in the book. ``She asks
me what I want for birthdays and Christmas: I say `10 pounds of
hash.'''
</P>
<P>
   I am unable to carry a tune in a wheelbarrow. But I share
Prine's passion for hash, whether it is constructed out of beef,
roast turkey, sockeye salmon or Puget Sound clams. You might call
this recipe of mine ...
</P>
<P>
   Nashville Hash
</P>
<P>
   3 cups diced cooked beef
</P>
<P>
   2 cups diced raw potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup chopped green peppers
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoon minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups homemade beef gravy or 1 10-ounce can
</P>
<P>
   Lundy's mother insists the onions must be sauteed in the hash
pan before the meat and potatoes are added. But this version cooks
so long in the oven that you get the same result.
</P>
<P>
   All you do is moosh all the ingredients together in a greased
oven dish and shove it into a 375-degree oven. Cook 45 minutes
covered, remove cover and return hash to the oven for another 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This is supposed to serve four modest appetites. Two is more
like it.
</P>
<P>
   Terminal Turkey
</P>
<P>
   3 cups diced leftover turkey
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup soft bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup chopped green pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup cream or milk
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sage
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Good grinding of fresh pepper
</P>
<P>
   Toss the turkey, crumbs, green pepper, onion, parsley and
seasonings into a big bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In a saucepan melt 2 tablespoons butter and blend in the flour.
Stirring, pour in the cream. When this mess has thickened, gloop it
into the bowl and run your fingers through everything for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a large frying
pan. When it is bubbling, spread the turkey mixture over the bottom
of the skillet and cook, uncovered, for 25 minutes, running a
spatula under the bottom crust a few times to keep the hash from
burning.
</P>
<P>
   Again, this will serve two although Prine could probably polish
off the beef and turkey hash by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but how many biscuits can he eat? An even better question
is this: How many hush puppies can he pop?
</P>
<P>
   Baked Hush Puppies
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup yellow cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup flour
</P>
<P>
   One and one-half teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of ground red pepper
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup finely chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   1 egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup milk
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   Grease six cups of a small muffin pan. Blend together the
cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and ground red pepper.
Stir in the onion.
</P>
<P>
   In another bowl, beat the egg, milk and oil. Add the cornmeal
mixture and stir until just blended.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon batter into muffin cups, filling one-half to two-thirds
full. Bake until golden, about 15 to 20 minutes, in a preheated,
425-degree oven.

MILLENNIUM SYMPHONIES: COMPOSED FOR WALT DISNEY CO. 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Think big. Be happy. Probably these words were not in
the contracts Aaron Jay Kernis and Michael Torke signed with the
Walt Disney Co. to write ``millennium symphonies,'' but they might
as well have been. Both composers took the opportunity to write for
a large orchestra with choir, boys' choir and soloists, and both
were encouraged also to be affirmative in ways that only the common
chord knows: their works both, curiously enough, ended in D major.
</P>
<P>
   But they took very different routes to get there. Kernis gave
himself the heavier task in planning immense structures _ a
10-minute first movement and a half-hour second _ and aiming for
seriousness. Such grand optimism has come rarely from composers in
the last half-century outside the works of Messiaen, who had not
only an unwavering faith to support him but also a vast imagination
for sound and a harmonic language that embraced major chords from a
new angle.
</P>
<P>
   Kernis, in his ``Garden of Light,'' tried to get there with
harmonies and colors and exultant rhythms that, however rich and
sometimes dazzling, related to other music, from Scriabin through
Bernstein, rather than to millennial regeneration, and he was not
helped by a text full of bromides. The hoped-for variety of the
second movement (Mahler's Eighth Symphony seems to have been a
model) was stymied by bland words and by the composer's
determination to be simple, to hold a tight rein on his melodic
invention and eliminate the unruly counterpoints that often give
his music character and interest.
</P>
<P>
   Torke's ``Four Seasons'' offered shorter segments _ vignettes of
recent American life for each of the 12 months, running roughly
five minutes each _ and a considerable dose of humor, helped by the
quick, strong images of Philip Littell's text, although the wit was
as much musical as verbal. In one section, for example, a comic new
meaning for Minimalism was found in the slight terrors of life in
the new postwar suburbs: ``I can't find my house,'' sang the tenor,
to a little phrase that was being repeated over and over by the
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four Seasons'' also included a controlled riot of electric
guitar sounds from orchestral ensembles, a touching ``Letter to
God'' set against a melody whose relaxed character was energized by
some typical Torkean torsions and a sweet scene of teen-age
romantic fantasies. It all ended with an unashamedly infantile
finale, after the boys had come rushing back into the hall to lead
everyone on the platform in variations on the playground chant
``nah nah nahnah nah.'' It was like those sheets of stamps for the
decades you can get from the Post Office: fun, varied, smartly
designed, made not for the millennium but to be used now.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Masur conducted the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher
Hall over the weekend, with the New York Choral Artists and the
American Boychoir, in resounding and remarkably assured
performances of both works. The soloists included Margaret Lloyd,
Mary Phillips, Anthony Dean Griffey, Dean Ely, Jubilant Sykes and
Lili Thomas.

`THE BEAUTY PART': PERELMAN AIMS A SHOTGUN AT SOCIETY'S VARIED
FOIBLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(ms) 
 By WILBORN HAMPTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a humorist writing for The New Yorker, S.J.
Perelman always had a reserved seat at the Algonquin round table;
as a screenwriter he wrote zany Marx brothers classics like ``Horse
Feathers'' and the film adaptation of ``Around the World in 80
Days;'' as a playwright he was a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to a real hit on Broadway was a collaboration
with Ogden Nash on the book for ``One Touch of Venus.'' His last
play, a 1962 comedy called ``The Beauty Part,'' featured Bert Lahr
playing five different roles. It opened during a newspaper strike
and a blizzard and survived neither. In hopes of rediscovering a
long-neglected classic, the Peccadillo Theater Company is staging a
revival. The striking critics and bad weather may have been a
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beauty Part'' is little more than a series of skits strung
together in which Perelman skewers Hollywood, modern artists, the
judiciary, television, book publishing and faddish magazines. The
story line _ plot would be too strong a word _ that holds these
spoofs together is a quest by young Lance Weatherwax to discover
his artistic talent. He drops out of his Ivy League college,
renounces the wealth of his Park Avenue parents and tries
everything _ painting, writing, the movies, even advertising _ in
an effort to become an ``artist'' and win the girl of his dreams, a
Greenwich Village gold digger named April Monkhood. What he finds,
of course, is a world of hypocrisy and greed.
</P>
<P>
   The writing is in the faux hip that Perelman employed elsewhere
with success. But what reads funny on the page does not always play
funny on the stage, and the dialogue often sounds more like
captions for Thurber cartoons than anything one might actually say.
``The Beauty Part'' at times resembles a sort of low-rent ``Thurber
Carnival,'' only angrier.
</P>
<P>
   It is that bitterness that runs through the play that tends to
undermine the comedy. It takes a real clown to find the sympathy in
such broadly drawn characters and turn the ire into humor, and Dan
Wackerman, the Peccadillo director, does not have a Bert Lahr among
his cast of 13 actors who tackle the more than 40 different roles.
There are a couple of bright spots. Nicole Ravenna delivers a
vivacious and energetic performance as April, the material girl who
fires Lance's artistic impulses, and Philip Levy finds a way to
make the unscrupulous Hollywood huckster Harry Hubris a genuinely
comic figure. Jeff Patterson is an acceptably naive boy next door
as Lance.
</P>
<P>
   A group of eight jazz dancers not only provide entertainment
during the 11 scene changes but also become the sets themselves by
holding up doors, cabinets, tables and chairs for the actors to
use. As scenery it is clumsy, but the dancing is diverting.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Composers searching for opera subjects have to be wary
about turning automatically to stage plays, especially great plays
by well-respected authors. There are some obvious questions to ask
first: Why tamper with something that already works? What will
music add to it?
</P>
<P>
   Andre Previn grappled with this in composing his opera based on
Tennessee Williams' ``Streetcar Named Desire.'' The language of
this iconic masterpiece is so richly poetic and allusive, and the
escapist, anguished and brutal resonances of the characters are so
palpable and close the surface, that there is little any composer
could add, let alone someone of Previn's modest gifts.
</P>
<P>
   William Bolcom faced these questions also when he first
considered making an opera of Arthur Miller's 1955 play, ``A View
From the Bridge.'' But he was emboldened to do so by the playwright
himself, who wound up collaborating on a text for the opera with
Bolcom's longtime lyricist and librettist, Arnold Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   That opera, more than four years in the making, was given its
premiere on Saturday night by the Lyric Opera of Chicago in a
strikingly designed, musically accomplished production with an
excellent cast. At its conclusion the audience responded with a
prolonged, cheering ovation, and Miller _ no opera buff, he admits
_ seemed especially awed. Although it does not break new ground in
the genre, or even attempt to, ``A View From the Bridge'' is an
admirable and often affecting work that convincingly solves the
problem of translating this play into an opera.
</P>
<P>
   Miller always said that ``A View From the Bridge'' was his most
operatic play. The story could be a modern-day Verdi tragedy. Eddie
Carbone, a workaday, hotheaded but decent-hearted longshoreman in
Red Hook, Brooklyn, and his steadfast wife, Beatrice, have raised
her sister's orphaned niece, Catherine, a spirited and blooming
woman of 17. Like some overprotective Rigoletto in a Brooklyn
tenement, Eddie has kept Catherine close to home and away from
young men. Not so deeply buried in his fatherly love is longing for
Catherine.
</P>
<P>
   The precarious balance of the small family is toppled when
Beatrice's cousins, illegal immigrants from Sicily, arrive one day.
The brawny Marco wants to earn money for his wife and sickly
children back home, and his winsome, charming younger brother,
Rodolpho, soon becomes enamored of Catherine, sending Eddie into
fits of twisted jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Like an ill-fated character in ``La Forza del Destino,'' Eddie
brings about his own demise. Breaking a sacred code of the
neighborhood by reporting the men to the immigration service, he is
shunned by his neighbors and cursed by Mho provokes a fight.
Eddie pulls a knife. Marco plunges it into the crazed man's gut as
the neighbors watch helplessly.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says the play is filled with ``big block emotions.'' The
complexities of the characters are never fully explained, which is
why some critics consider the play an involving but lesser work.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ There is, Texas coach Mack Brown said, a defining
moment for every team in every season.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, in a game that frequently lives on in legend long
after the final gun, the Longhorns might have found theirs in a
38-28 come-from-behind victory over Oklahoma before the 54th
consecutive sellout crowd in the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was critical for us because we're trying to
establish a personality,'' Brown said. ``To go two games down in
the Big 12 South with a week off and Nebraska coming in would be
really tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the thing our football team did today was play as a
team. Coach \RDarrell\S Royal always said you play as one heartbeat
and that's how you win. We didn't do that last week. We didn't do
that in the fourth quarter against North Carolina State. Today, we
played as a team. This game can help this young team win other
games.''
</P>
<P>
   A Texas team has not come from 17 points down to victory in 34
years, since a 21-17 victory over Texas A&AMP;M in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game does everything for team confidence,'' said senior
wide receiver Ryan Nunez, who caught passes for two touchdowns and
a two-point conversion among his five receptions for 51 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electricity in that stadium today was unreal. To bounce
back after a loss \Rlast week to Kansas State\S and after being
down 17 points today _ I just can't give us enough credit for the
way we played as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams combined for a series-record 883 yards total offense
and Texas posted a series-high 553. But the 23rd-ranked Longhorns
(5-2, 2-1 Big 12) were stunned by the Sooners' 17-point,
first-quarter scoring burst highlighted by long touchdown runs
after the catch by receivers Antwone Savage and Jarrail Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But as Texas' defense finally corralled OU's offense _ holding
OU to 38 yards in the second quarter _ the Longhorns chipped into
the deficit with Kris Stockton field goals of 46, 41 and 37 yards.
Then just before the half, they struck quickly on a 61-yard,
two-play scoring drive that changed the game's momentum and tied
the after receiving the second-half kickoff to take its first lead
at 24-17 on a 21-yard run by halfback Hodges Mitchell, who had a
career game with 204 yards on 30 workhorse carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offensive players and coaches did a tremendous job of
taking the ball down and scoring with very little time left,''
Brown said. ``I thought that was a tremendous key to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas struck again on an Applewhite-to-Kwame Cavil pass for 48
yards and a 31-20 lead, and OU answered with a 4-yard pass from
Patrick Fletcher to kicker Tim Duncan on a fake field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   And Texas' crowning moment came when the Longhorns broke the
bonds of the worst-possible field position _ in the OU end of the
bowl _ to march 99 yards to the clinching touchdown on an 18-yard
pass from Applewhite to Nunez with 8:16 to play. The drive consumed
5:29.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the difference in the game,'' Brown said. ``We've got
the ball on about our 6-inch line. And to take a 99-yard drive and
use that much of the clock showed so much character for an
offensive team that has not been able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell popped the first play from the 1 for 35 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they put us at the 1-yard line they were thinking, `We
stop them here, we're going to win.''' Mitchell said, ``We knew if
we went 99 yards, Oklahoma's will would be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   OU held faint hope when cornerback Mike Woods recovered
Mitchell's fumble at the Sooner 39 with 2:50 to play. But Texas
cornerback Ahmad Brooks killed it when he picked off a Heupel pass
at the UT 15 with 1:20 left and Texas ran the table.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners (3-2, 1-1) now contemplate a season stalled by
consecutive losses to Notre Dame and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to point the blame at the players or the
coaches,'' OU rookie coach Bob Stoops said. ``We need to get
better, to where we can make the plays that make the difference in
games like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it's obvious we can play with anyone in this
league.''

SAFETY BLITZ HELPS TAKE AIR OUT OF OU

<P>
   DALLAS _ After watching Oklahoma roll to 17 points on its first
three possessions, Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese began a
regular series of safety blitzes. The Longhorns' pass rushers,
during the final three quartrers, included three defensive linemen,
a linebacker and a safety from Texas' 3-2-6 alignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first quarter, we never touched the quarterback,''
Reese said. ``Once we started bringing the safety, we got to him.
We had to. They'd been picking us like a chicken until that
point.'' \Nname:_ Jimmy Burch \Nsubheds:Offensive showcase Texas
and Oklahoma combined for 883 yards of total offense yesterday,
including 553 by the Longhorns _ their highest output against
Oklahoma in the series' 94-game history.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' 38 points is the most it has scored against OU since the
Longhorns routed the Sooners, 41-9, in 1970. Meanwhile, first-year
Oklahoma quarterback Josh Heupel now has 1,669 passing yards in
five games, good for fourth on the school's career list. \Nname:_
Nathan Sanders \Nsubheds:Pass and run shows Some teams win with the
running game, some with the passing game. Fans of the Texas-OU
rivalry have seen both in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Oklahoma's DeMond Parker rushed for 291 yards and
Texas' Ricky Williams had 223 yards, making it only the third time
in NCAA history that two backs from opposing teams rushed for more
than 200 yards in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday showed what a difference two years makes, as the game
featured two 300-yard passers in OU's Josh Heupel (311 yards) and
Texas' Major Applewhite (328 yards). Texas running back Hodges
Mitchell also rushed for 204 yards. \Nname: _ Nathan Sanders
\Nsubheds:New-look Sooners Oklahoma rushed the ball 18 times in the
game for a total of 15 yards. It was the fewest rushes Oklahoma has
ever had in a ganst Texas. The previous low was 30 rushing
attempts in 1992 when Oklahoma fell behind early in a 34-24 loss to
the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners were credited with two rushes in the first quarter
when they built up a 17-3 lead. One of the rushes was a 19-yard
quarterbac
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners threw the ball 49 times in the game, completing 32
for 315 yards. \Nname:_ John Miller \Nsubheds:Back-breaking drives
In each of the past two weeks, the Sooners have given up long
drives that changed the momentum of the game in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Last week against Notre Dame, the Sooners led 30-14, but allowed
the Fighting Irish to mount a comeback. Notre Dame scored the
go-ahead touchdown after putting together a 98-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 31-28 yesterday to Texas, the Sooners pinned the
Longhorns back to their own 1-yard line after a 43-yard Jeff
Ferguson punt with 13:45 left in the game. Hodges Mitchell gave the
Longhorns breathing room with a 35-yard run first play of
the drive. That sparked a 12-9-yard drive that ended with an
18-yard touchdown pass from Major Applewhite to Ryan Nunez with
8:16 left to play, giving Texas a 38-28 lead. \Nname:_ John Miller
\Nsubheds:Briefly Texas played much of the game with six defensive
backs, giving freshman Roderick Babers his first career start and
cornerback Joe Walker his first start in four games. Walker had a
second-quarter interception, his first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma was the first team in 15 games to score a touchdown on
its opening drive against the Texas defense.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams combined for 883 yards total offense, most in
series history. The previous mark was 850 in 1992. Texas' 553 yards
were the most the Longhorns have ever amassed against the Sooners.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams combined to throw 95 passes. In a four-year
stretch from 1973-76, the teams combined for 56 passes. \Nname:_

LOAIZA MADE ONE MISTAKE THAT HURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ One hundred pitches. One devastating mistake.ink about that. Think long and hard about that.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Esteban Loaiza will.
</P>
<P>
   ``One pitch cost us the game,'' Loaiza said. ``It's going to be
hard for me to forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's Darryl Strawberry unleashed the fury of his
left-handed swing and launched Loaiza's sinking, two-seam fastball
into The Ballpark in Arlington's sea of red.
</P>
<P>
   The three-run, first-inning home run stood the test of nine
innings and will be remembered as the decisive and only blow landed
during the Yankees' 3-0 victory in Game 3 of the Division Series on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got his arms extended and went to the opposite field
with it,'' Loaiza said of the 1-0, two-out pitch. ``He took a good
hack at it. I wish I could have that one inning back, and maybe
we'd still be playing right now. We're going to be thinking about
this all winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Few, though, will remember how well the Rangers pitched during
this Division Series despite being swept in three games by the
Yankees for the second time in as many Octobers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' potent lineup will be scorned for scoring only one
run and hitting .152 during this series. Forgotten will be the
rotation's 3.93 earned-run average after being ridiculed most of
the regular season for posting the American League's second-worst
mark (5.49).
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys rose to occasion again,'' pitching coach Dick Bosman
said. ``I couldn't be prouder of those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, their maligned rotation pitches best when it matters most.
</P>
<P>
   It delivered during the Rangers' make-or-break, September series
with the Anaheim Angels in 1998 and again the next month during the
Division Series against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The rotation rallied again this season during the Rangers'
all-important September series against the Oakland Athletics before
its effort this October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know we can pitch,'' said right-hander Rick Helling,
who lost Game 2 despite allowing only two runs during a 61/3-inning
appearance. ``We believe in ourselves. I don't think you can
underestimate that.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, you have to be arrogant to a certain degree to be a
professional athlete. There are going to be times when no one
believes in you except yourself. We read all the time about how bad
we are, about our ERA's and the fact that we don't have an ace.
Well, we've done a pretty decent job the past two years.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say much,'' Loaiza said. ``I pitched the game I wanted
to pitch.'' nn

 CHICAGO: lesser work.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Yet that very lack of specificity is what made the play
adaptable to operatic treatment. Music can fill in those big block
emotions. Miller urged his collaborators to cut and change lines
and reconfigure scenes as necessary to make the play an opera. He
specifically encouraged Bolcom to turn the neighbors of Red Hook,
who in most productions observe the family drama from the outskirts
of the stage, into a fully engaged operatic chorus. The play's
narrator, the lawyer Alfieri, here becomes the leader of that
chorus. It works very well in Weinstein's and Miller's deft
libretto.
</P>
<P>
   But operas are remembered, or not, for their music. Bolcom has
said that his goal in this score is to create ``grand opera
Brooklynized,'' and this he achieves. Although there are rootless
atonal passages and thickly layered orchestral sonorities that
recall Messiaen, the musical language is essentially tonal and the
melodic writing, for all the darting intervalic zigs and zags, is
essentially lyrical, as befits a contemporary work that evokes the
sensibility of Italian opera.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bolcom's ear for harmony is acute and interesting. His
chords are often thick with notes and pungent with dissonance,
especially when played on the piano from the piano-vocal score.
That biting quality is softened by the orchestration, not always
for the better. Dissonant notes are tucked neatly into rich
sonorities. I often found myself wishing that Bolcom had preserved
the astringency of his harmony.
</P>
<P>
   The most pronounced characteristic of the score is its bold mix
of styles. Bolcom's penchant for incorporating vernacular American
song and dance forms into his concert works and operas has divided
critics. Some find it vibrant and authentic. (Few composers today
have his direct experience as a pianist and arranger of that
vernacular music.) Others think it self-consciously clever and
superficial. In his last full-length opera, ``McTeague,'' a grim
tale of an avaricious couple, a work also commissioned and given
its premiere, in 1992, by the Lyric Opera, the mix of ragtime,
blues, waltzes, barbershop quartet, Italianate arias and aggressive
modernist angst put off some critics.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A View From the Bridge'' the musical styles that collide
are less wide ranging and overall more subtly rendered than in
``McTeague.'' The excitable Rodolpho sings a clackety sort of
hyper-aria about his dream of one day owning a motorcycle,
concluding with a tenorial high C, a cue for the audience to
applaud in the grand tradition. A group of dock workers, drinking
on the job at Christmastime, break into doo-wop.
</P>
<P>
   The pop standard ``Paper Doll'' is heard on the phonograph in
Eddie's house as Rodolpho and Catherine dance, and also, during a
comic moment, in an emotive, soggy, soaring version that Rodolpho
sings in his idea of American jazz style. Touches like these flesh
out characters and bring variety to the score.
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling music comes when anxious, ominous orchestral
writing provides a subtext for sung dialogue between characters, as
in the passage when Eddie tries to convince Beatrice that the
blond, flamboyant Rodolpho is not only a ``hit and run guy'' just
interested in gaining American citizenship by marrying Catherine,
but also not ``right,'' meaning sexually. (Eddie's evidence is that
Rodolpho is a good cook, mends dresses and sings in a high tenor
voice.) Here Eddie's punchy vocal lines are buttressed by
insinuating orchestral music with softly piercing chords and
asymmetrical (or ``off'') measures of seven beats.
</P>
<P>
   That said, dramatically and musically Bolcom is almost too fixed
on his goal of creating Brooklynized grand opera. Often it sounds
like Bolcomized Italian verismo. There are mellifluous arias for
the lovesick Rodolpho and the aflutter Catherine and an impassioned
sort of Mama Lucia monologue for Beatrice. The most overtly Verdian
moment is a basso aria of aggrievement and retribution for Marco
(with new words by Miller) that actually explains this pivotal
character more convincingly than in the play. But I wish Bolcom had
taken more chances.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the chorus of neighbors could have been used more
pervasively. There are moments when the chorus members line up,
ominously intone some lines like ``Eddie never knew he had a
destiny,'' then leave. It can get melodramatic, like something out
of the musical ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   And Brooklynized grand opera is not entirely new. Gian-Carlo
Menotti tried it in his under-appreciated opera ``The Saint of
Bleecker Street'' (well, same city, different borough, but pretty
close). Even ``West Wide Story'' is in the general esthetic
vicinity. ``A View From the Bridge'' is maybe too quick to please,
too willing to give away its musical secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But such quibbling comes close to criticizing the opera for what
it is not rather that acknowledging it for the serious, skillful
and often captivating work it is.
</P>
<P>
   The production could not have been better. The set by Santo
Loquasto places the Carbone family in the shadow of the Brooklyn
Bridge; black-and-white images of the neighborhood, the docks and
far-off Italy are projected on large, intersecting background
screens.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Frank Galati, has drawn memorable performances
from the fine cast, headed by the robust baritone Kim Josephson as
Eddie, whose bluster is a pitiable cover for his weakness, and the
intense soprano Catherine Malfitano as Beatrice, whose compliance
in the face of her husband's domestic rule does not mask her steely
willpower. The radiant soprano Juliana Rambaldi was the vulnerable
Catherine, who learns too late that Eddie will baby her as long as
she acts like a baby. The impressive young tenor Gregory Turay was
an ardent, endearing Rodolpho and the strong bass-baritone Mark
McCrory was all smoldering righteousness as Marco. The baritone
Timothy Nolen was a stentorian Alfieri.
</P>
<P>
   Bolcom set words felicitously, but this cast deserves much
praise for making them clear. Dennis Russell Davies conducted a
richly colored and supplely paced account of the score.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``A View From the Bridge'' ranks in the pantheon of opera
is a boring question. Let history decide. For now we have a new
work of integrity and skill that reached people and much deserves a
hearing beyond the eight additional performances it will receive
here through Nov. 5.

   CHANGE IS SOUGHT IN DIGITAL TV
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 300 of the nation's 1,600 television stations have filed
a petition with the Federal Communications Commission reque
revision in the nation's digital TV standard. The stations contend
that the standard is flawed because the digital receivers on the
market cannot easily receive a viewable picture in anything short
of ideal circumstances.

   BRITISH PAPERS TAKE BRAWL TO WEB
</P>
<P>
   The no-holds-barred competition among Britain's broadsheet
newspapers has taken a new turn, and the fabled wars of what used
to be known as Fleet Street have spilled into cyberspace. The
Financial Times, for example, is creating an integrated newsroom
where journalists will work to feed the Web site, FT.com, as well
as the newspaper. The Web site itself will be reinvented as a fully
fledged Internet portal. Indeed, Britain's online broadsheet
newspapers are promoting a range of interconnected offerings
designed to lure just about everyone from job seekers to movie
buffs to high-flying executives.

<P>
   HELPING TO SET UP SHOP ON THE WEB
</P>
<P>
   As more companies develop a full-scale Internet presence,
e-commerce software and service providers are competing more
furiously for market share. One increasingly popular approach is to
offer an ``all-in-one'' package, in which merchants pay a nominal
monthly fee for software that enables them to build a site that is
then run by a third party. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report.

   EASING OF EXPORT RULES HAS LIMITS
</P>
<P>
   Under plans to relax restrictions on exports of data-scrambling
software, a key issue that escaped notice was that the new policies
affect only shrink-wrapped software, not the original source code _
the lines of instructions that programmers actually write.

   NOTES SUBPOENAED IN MURDER CASE

   TECHNOLOGY INVESTORS LOOK TO AFRICA
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 800 million people in nearly 50 countries speaking
hundreds of dialects and often in conflict with one another, Africa
has attracted almost no technology investment. But that is
beginning to change as Worldspace, a Washington company, broadcasts
digital radio programming from a satellite to the African
continent.

BRAVES' JORDAN PLANS TO KEEP HIS BAT HOT AGAINST THE METS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Brian Jordan left the St. Louis Cardinals and signed with
the Atlanta Braves before this season, he envisioned winning a
championship in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Jordan is determined to reach his goal. He hit .474
during the National League Division Series, carrying Atlanta's
offense, and is a major reason the Braves will be facing the New
York Mets in the league championship series beginning Tuesday night
at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I signed to come here,'' said Jordan, who was 8
for 17 with a home run and 8 runs batted in as Atlanta eliminated
the Houston Astros, 3 games to 1, in the division series. ``This
team, year after year, is in the postseason. They have a great
organization, and I'm happy to be back in the postseason. This is
it, either you are going to win, or you're going home. The way I
see it, I'm going to lay it on the line. I'm going to put my body
out there and may the best man win. Hopefully, we'll come out on
top.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be difficult for the Mets to win unless they figure out
how to contain Jordan. Batting cleanup behind Chipper Jones, Jordan
made the Astros regret their decision to pitch around Jones. While
Jones drew a team-high five walks during the series, which ended
with Atlanta's 7-5 victory on Saturday, Jordan kept getting clutch
hits and driving in runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have seen that before. The Braves beat the Mets 9 out
of 12 times during the regular season, and the hitting of Jones and
Jordan was a major reason why Atlanta dominated. Jordan hit .359
against New York during the regular season, with 3 triples, 3 home
runs and 13 RBIs, while Jones was even more devastating against the
Mets, hitting .400 with 7 home runs and 16 RBIs
</P>
<P>
   In a crucial three-game sweep of the Mets in September, Jones
almost single-handedly won the series, hitting four home runs.
Another performance like that will send the Mets packing, but if
the Mets pitch around Jones, Jordan has served notice that he will
be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at my best when I've got runners in scoring position,''
said Jordan, who drove in a career-high 115 runs during the regular
season despite a wrist injury that limited his power in the second
half of the season. ``If you get some guys out there for me, I'm
going to come through for you.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jones and Jordan are a formidable one-two offensive punch,
pitching is the constant in Atlanta's success. Every starter the
Mets will face during the NLCS will be capable of a dominant
performance. Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and Tom Glavine are all Cy
Young Award winners, but Atlanta's best pitcher at the moment may
be 24-year-old Kevin Millwood, who was 18-7 this season and threw a
one-hitter against Houston in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``After about the first four or five starts this year, Kevin
really got on a roll where he was just dominating every game,''
said Bobby Cox, Atlanta's manager. ``I don't know how many games
Kevin went into this year with no-hitters in the fourth inning, the
fifth inning, or the sixth inning. It was almost a routine deal
that you'd look up on the scoreboard and the other team didn't have
any hits. That's a good indication of how he was throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how Cox sets up his rotation against the Mets, he will
feel confident. Glavine was 3-0 against the Mets this year, Maddux
was 3-1 and Millwood was 1-0. Smoltz was the only starter in
Atlanta's four-man playoff rotation who lost to the Mets all
season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John Rocker has emerged as a dominant relief pitcher
for the Braves. Against Houston, Rocker escaped a base-loaded,
nobody-out jam in the 10th inning of Game 3, which proved to be the
turning point of the series. Then in the clinching victory, Rocker
shut down another Astros rally and recorded the final four outs of
the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of heroes this year, but if I had to pick one,
I'd say John Rocker,'' said Smoltz. ``I've never seen a guy
dominate in crucial situations like he has.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves will feel more pressure in the championship
series than the Mets will. This is Atlanta's eighth appearance in
the NLCS this decade, but Atlanta has won only one World Series in
that time, beating the Cleveland Indians in 1995. The Braves have
grown accustomed to lofty expectations, and they will take a
business-like approach into the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a belief from spring training that we are going
to do whatever it takes to win a World Series,'' said Smoltz.
``There's very few organizations that year in and year out have the
mindset to do whatever it takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't make the playoffs, it's easy to forget. But if
you keep going to the playoffs like we have, it's more of a sore
thumb if you don't win it all.''
</P>
<P>
   But once again, the Braves find themselves one series away from
a potential World Series berth. This time, the Mets are standing in
Atlanta's way. But the Braves appear ready for the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mets are a good club and so are the Braves,'' said Cox.
``It should be a great series.''

YANKEES' WILLIAMS AND HIS DEFENSE REST FOR A FEW DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Bernie Williams was among the last to depart
the sweet-smelling visitors' clubhouse here, a room soggy from the
champagne and beer sprayed and spilt in celebration following the
Yankees' mastery of the Texas Rangers in the Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had avoided the most tempestuous portion of the
post-game party last Saturday night, and that is his way. He mostly
keeps to himself in words and thought, and what he believed when
the series began was that defense would be the difference between
winning or losing. Williams then turned this into a self-fulfilling
prophecy with three spectacular games in center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees returned home Sunday, and there were no formal
workouts planned for Monday. They will practice Tuesday, in
preparation for the four-of-seven American League Championship
Series that is scheduled to begin Wednesday, at Yankee Stadium; the
Yankees will play the winner of the Division Series between the
Cleveland Indians and the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, said Sunday that he is not sure
what his pitching rotation will be for the next round of playoffs.
David Cone had been scheduled to work Game 4 against Texas _ a game
that became unnecessary when the Yankees swept the Rangers in three
games, limiting Texas to one run and a .152 batting average _ and
is available to open the ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   If Torre employs the same strategy he did last year, when the
Yankees swept Texas in the first round, then he will revert back to
the rotation he used to start the playoffs. Orlando Hernandez would
be scheduled to pitch Games 1 and 5, Andy Pettitte Games 2 and 6,
Roger Clemens Games 3 and 7, and Cone Game 4. ``I don't know why
you'd change anything,'' Cone said. ``Whatever Joe decides is fine.
All of his decisions have worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees probably will not know until Tuesday or Wednesday
whether right fielder Paul O'Neill will be available to play in the
first games of the next round. They do not even know if he will be
able to play for the rest of the postseason, because of the bruised
ribs that forced him to the bench for Game 3 of the Division
Series. O'Neill said Saturday that unless he improves quickly, he
is not sure if he will be able to play.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was far more than able against the Rangers. To Johnny
Oates, the Texas manager, the Yankees' center fielder was
difference between losing and winning. After the Rangers' Game 3
loss, Oates referred to the sliding catch Williams made in Game 1
of the series. If Juan Gonzalez's liner had fallen in, Oates said,
``It would have been a whole different series. That play set the
tone, I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams provided a wide range of choices for his best
defensive play in the series. Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher,
believes that Williams' sliding stop of Ivan Rodriguez's bounding
ball and quick throw to second in the sixth inning of Game 2 _
which prevented Rodriguez from stretching a lead-off single into a
double _ was the pivotal moment of the playoff. The score was tied
1-1 at the time and Juan Gonzalez followed Rodriguez by bouncing
into a double play. ``If they get a run there,'' said Posada, ``who
knows what happens after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in Game 3, the Yankees established a 3-0 lead in the first
inning, on Darryl Strawberry's home run, and Roger Clemens fought
to protect this advantage. Royce Clayton, the Rangers' No. 8
batter, opened the bottom of the fifth with a long drive that some
of the Texas players thought would clear the center-field fence
easily.
</P>
<P>
   But in his sprinter's stride, Williams dashed toward the wall,
made the catch about two steps from the fence and slammed into the
padding, chest first. ``He was so quick getting to it that he was
able to catch it and still sort of brace himself to hit the wall,''
Torre marveled afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the idea in my mind that the series was going to be won
on the defensive side, rather than the offensive side,'' Williams
said. ``I knew these guys could hit, and I had to be on my toes and
catch everything that I could out there. It worked out well,
because I was able to get a lot of good jumps on balls in really
crucial situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams made another running catch to take away a hit from
Clayton in the seventh inning. All of the Yankees seemed to play
well defensively in the series. Posada and Joe Girardi, the
catchers, were lauded by some of the club's staff for studying the
scouting reports on the Rangers, formulating a plan of attack with
the pitchers and then exploiting the Texas weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, whose throwing problems had been a concern when
the series began, played well defensively with the exception of a
fumbled grounder in Game 2. He threw with confidence, particularly
as he finished double plays. First baseman Tino Martinez made a
leaping catch to start a double play in Game 1 and the left side of
the Yankees' infield played flawlessly. One of the Yankees'
greatest weaknesses, their inability to prevent opposing base
runners from stealing, ne a factor, because the Rangers
mustered just 14 hits in three games.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenges to the Yankees' defense could be much greater
in the ALCS, especially if Cleveland advances. Kenny Lofton, Omar
Vizquel and Roberto Alomar are all capable of creating havoc on the
bases, and most of the Indians do not hit with the reckless abandon
that the Rangers have.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are not graced with great base-stealers, but they
are aggressive, and Fenway Park's outfield is difficult to
navigate, with its odd angles and dimensions. If O'Neill is out of
the lineup, Ricky Ledee could be playing Fenway's right field,
perhaps the most difficult outfield spot in the majors because of
its huge space and curling fence line. Williams knows this: Defense
could decide the Yankees' next series as well.

<P>
   YOSHII MAY OPEN AGAINST MADDOX
</P>
<P>
   Mets Manager Bobby Valentine still has not officially announced
his pitching rotation for the National League Championship Series,
but Masato Yoshii will almost certainly start Game 1 Tuesday night
against Greg Maddux. Al Leiter would be available for Games 3 and 7
on his regular rest, meaning that Valentine would have to juggle
the order in which Kenny Rogers and Rick Reed pitch. The rotation
for the division series was Yoshii, Rogers, Reed, Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said that he was planning to discuss the rotation with
the pitching coach Dave Wallace, but a few things are certain: Orel
Hershiser and Octavio Dotel will remain in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz will also face the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to be doing anything radical,''
Valentine said. ``It will probably be a little bit of change
somewhere in the rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   GAME-TIME DECISION ON PIAZZA
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza continued to receive treatment on his inflamed left
thumb Sunday and hoped to swing a bat during Monday night's workout
in Atlanta to help determine his availability for Tuesday night's
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who have to submit their 25-man roster for this round
by Tuesday morning, may add Mike Kinkade, an infielder who spent
most of the minor league season catching. General Manager Steve
Phillips said the team would stick with 11 pitchers on the roster,
meaning an extra position player would be dropped but he would not
specify who it might be.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mets hope Piazza can return, they would add the
extra catcher if for some reason he could not return for
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   TARDY BENITEZ IS FINED
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez, who arrived about a half-hour before last
Saturday's game, will be fined for his tardiness. The team
stretched at 11:45 a.m. and Valentine was told that Benitez had at
to arrive by 12:30 p.m. for the 1:10 game. Benitez, who lives about
40 minutes from Shea Stadium, said he was stuck in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you time it late, you're going to be late,'' Valentine
said. ``I'm sure he left late and I'm sure he was not there on time
because he left the house late. It wasn't the greatest news before
a game. I was on pins and needles making the decision to have him
go out there, not because they hit two balls solid but because I
was unsure of his condition. The explanation could be as simple as
bad planning and hopefully it won't be anything worse than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez gave up a two-run double to the first batter he faced,
Jay Bell, but pitched one and one-third innings.
</P>
<P>
   SUSPENSION LIKELY FOR ROJAS
</P>
<P>
   The third-base coach Cookie Rojas is likely to receive a two- or
three-game suspension in the wake of his furious argument with the
left-field umpire Charlie Williams, after which Rojas said Williams
had cursed him.
</P>
<P>
   Mets General Manager Steve Phillips said he had not heard
anything from the National League President Leonard Coleman, but
the league is expected to announce the punishment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the replays during the game,'' Phillips said. ``It
seemed to me the contact was from the umpire to Cookie first. It's
hard to predict how the president will rule on this.''
</P>
<P>
   TICKETS GO ON SALE
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for National League Championship Series games to be
played at Shea Stadium next weekend will go on sale Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Numbered wristbands will be distributed to fans at Shea Stadium
at 7 a.m. Tuesday, and the Mets will randomly select the starting
number and announce it at 9:15 a.m. Only cash will be accepted at
the ball park.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone sales start at 10 a.m., and only American Express,
Discover, MasterCard and Visa will be accepted. There is a service
charge of $6 per ticket for phone orders.
</P>
<P>
   Most tickets are priced at $50 to $70. Each fan may purchase a
maximum of eight tickets a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are home for Games 3 Friday at 8:12 p.m., Game 4
Saturday at 7:42 p.m. and Game 5, if necessary, Sunday at 4:09
p.m. &QL;

 &HT;    One-day rain delay no sweat for Burton
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Jeff Burton's specialty this season has been
winning races in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Burton won both of the rain-shortened events at Darlington. And
he may find himself looking through a wet windshield again today at
Lowe's Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Light showers are expected for the UAW-GM Quality 500, which has
been rescheduled for 11 a.m. today. The race was postponed on
Sunday because of inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rain affects your strategy for a race,'' Burton said.
``You can win big with your decisions, or you can lose big.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's postponement was the first of the season for NASCAR
officials. It was also the first time since 1960 the Charlotte
track has had to reschedule a Winston Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   With many drivers already complaining about Charlotte's
traditional Wednesday qualifying _ two days earlier than normal for
a Sunday race _ the postponement has made a long week even longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous that we're at Charlotte as long as we are
anyway,'' Burton said. ``To have to be at a race track for six days
with one of those being a rain day is ridiculous, and that's just
part of a whole deal about being here so long. These guys are away
from home enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who is fifth in the Winston Cup points standings, has
won five races, second best on the circuit behind Jeff Gordon
(six). The Ford No. 99 driver was successful twice at Darlington
with his team's rain strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can win races in the rain by using certain strategies,''
Burton said. ``However, if it doesn't rain or it stops and you've
used that strategy, then you're in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rain changes really everything because if it starts sprinkling
halfway through a race and you need to pit for fuel, you are like,
`I can't pit for fuel. I've got to sit out here and wait and hope
my car doesn't run out of fuel because the race could be called at
any moment.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes things 100 percent.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE CHAMPAGNE IS NOT STALE FOR THE YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Yankees sipped, sprayed and splashed champagne on another
methodical sort of night in Arlington, Texas, a scene that was so
familiar to them it was eerie. Once again, the Yankees ejected the
Rangers from the Division Series in three games. Once again, Darryl
Strawberry was the focus of a wet celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three weeks ago, Tim Raines stood on a folding table in
the middle of the clubhouse, requested silence and then hoisted a
bottle of bubbly to toast Strawberry, who was in the hospital
preparing for colon cancer surgery the next day. The Yankees had
Strawberry's No. 39 on their caps and they had bulges in their
throats as they chanted his name.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, the Yankees toasted Strawberry in person by
showering the Prodigal Yankee with some non-alcoholic champagne
after his three-run homer had helped guide them past the powerless
Rangers, 3-0. Strawberry has amazingly evolved into a critical
component on a team that looks real special again. Does this
slightly updated script seem like a repeat from last October?
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, these Yankee uniforms bring out unbelievable
stories,'' said Chuck Knoblauch. ``It's almost spooky sometimes how
things work out here. It's that Yankee mystique, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a different team, but the Yankees accomplished the same
expected result. This is a different season, but the Yankees have
the same lofty goals. This is not 1998 and no season will ever
duplicate that magical march, but do not underestimate these
Yankees. Do not doubt that they can defend their World Series
championship and probably will over the Braves. A Subway Series
would be phenomenal for New York, but the Braves have halted the
Mets in almost the same manner as the Yankees humbled the Rangers
so realism needs to be exhibited, too.
</P>
<P>
   The ease in which the Yankees dispatched the Rangers, a team
that won 95 games yet looks like a scared Class AAA club against
them, is incredible. With Orlando Hernandez, Andy Pettitte and
Roger Clemens mesmerizing the Rangers and stifling them on one run,
the Yankees emphatically reminded everyone that they should be
considered the premier team in baseball until proven otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are always putting the word vulnerable in front of
the team,'' said Derek Jeter. ``It's still the same team we had
last year. We didn't win the same number of games, but we know
we're capable of doing a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though players sometimes create their own motivation by
selectively remembering critical comments, some Yankees felt they
have not received proper respect this year. Texas Manager Johnny
Oates, who cannot push his disappearing team past the first round,
called the Yankees ``human'' before El Duque tossed a pitch in Game
1. Oates might have been trying to spark his players, but he would
have been better off waiting until Texas won a game before he
tweaked the Yankees for not being among the best teams of all-time
for a second straight season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we didn't win 114 games in the regular season and
people say we lost our swagger and lost this and lost that,'' said
Tino Martinez. ``But we never had a cockiness. We always had a
business-like approach and found ways to win. We haven't changed
that. People wrote us off a little, but we have just as much
confidence as we ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   And they should. The Yankees have better pitching than the
Indians or the Red Sox and Joe Torre should not tinker with the
rotation for the ALCS. While Torre has said David Cone could start
Game 1 in what seems like a verbal bouquet to a proud pitcher, Cone
should remain behind Hernandez, Pettitte and Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   If Paul O'Neill's bruised ribs prevent him from playing, that
would be a serious loss. But the Yankees looked formidable as they
played terrific defense, received enough offense from Bernie
Williams and Strawberry and watched Mariano Rivera, who may be the
best pitcher in the major leagues behind Pedro Martinez, powerfully
finish two games in the Division Series. The Yankees' body language
seemingly snapped, ``OK, who's next?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost felt like everyone was writing us off by saying we
could be beat this year,'' said Knoblauch. ``Any team can be beat,
but I still don't understand why I heard it so much. Because we
didn't win 114 games? We got almost the same pitchers and the same
lineup. It's strange. It motivates us.''
</P>
<P>
   The motivation for the 1999 Yankees, who had 16 fewer victories
during the regular season than in 1998, is to duplicate the final
result of 1998, imitating the 1961 (109 victories) and 1962 (96)
Yankees and the 1927 (110) and 1928 (101) Yankees. Even if the
Yankees might not be as dominating as in 1998, a World Series title
is all that matters. That is why Jeter should have choked on
champagne when he was asked if another exhilarating October felt
stale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it look like it's getting old?'' asked Jeter, his shirt
soaked and his eyes darting around the clubhouse in self-defense.
``It's not getting old. I hope it lasts forever.''

A NETS' SCRIMMAGE REVEALS ENCOURAGING BENCH STRENGTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ More than 200 people filed into the
bleachers at the Atlantic City Convention Center on Sunday, eagerly
awaiting a demonstration of basketball prowess by Stephon Marbury
and Keith Van Horn of the New Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Nets' intrasquad scrimmage materialized, the crowd oly youngsters found themselves cheering for three other Nets
whose play was both surprising and encouraging in its
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Newman, who will turn 36 next month; Gheorghe Muresan,
who has played less than two minutes the last two seasons, and
Elliot Perry, who the Nets have attempted to trade on numerous
occasions, were the surprise stars of an exhibition in which
Marbury and Van Horn were relegated to the periphery.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' reserves blasted the starters, 56-33, in a 24-minute
scrimmage that served as the official close of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   And while no one put much stock in the embarrassing result _
except perhaps a custodian attendant who insisted that ``the Nets
should start their bench'' _ everyone was thrilled with the
performance of a second unit that appears to give the Nets great
depth.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, who scored only 4 points on 2-of-7 shooting, said the
reserves were due for a victory because the starters had been
pounding them all week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was great that they beat us and showed what they can
do,'' he said. ``The two most encouraging players were Johnny
Newman and Gheorghe Muresan. It's nice to know that we'll have guys
like that coming off the bench, so when the first five comes out,
there won't be any slippage.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman, the journeyman small forward playing for the sixth team
of his 14-year National Basketball Association career, was
dazzling, scoring a game-high 18 points on nearly flawless offense.
He hit a 3-pointer, finished strong on the fast break, lofted a
nifty finger roll over Jim McIlvaine and was active on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been more than what we anticipated,'' General Manager
John Nash said of Newman. ``We wanted him for his leadership
qualities and his character, but as a player we would not have
predicted that he had as much as he's shown. He was fresh as a
daisy at the end while some of our younger guys were wheezing.''
</P>
<P>
   With his streaky scoring ability, Newman would seem to be a
great player off the bench, but he has been so productive
throughout camp that he could wind up nudging Scott Burrell for the
starter's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intention is always to be a starter,'' said Newman, who
insists that his age is not a factor. ``I take care of myself. I
don't let my body go down in the off season. There's nothing bad or
illegal in my extracurricular activities and my night life is very
conservative. So I'm able to come out and compete.''
</P>
<P>
   While Newman and Perry (10 points and 3 assists) dominated the
perimeter, Muresan _ who is listed as 7 feet 7 inches and 303
pounds _ ruled play inside.
</P>
<P>
   After missing two days with a strained left groin, he returned
to exhibit many of the qualities that enabled him to average 14.5
points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.2 blocks for the Washington Bullets four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though Newman did most of the scoring, Muresan was arguably the
game's most valuable player. His soft shooting touch was missing,
but he was still able to score 10 points on 5-of-10 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Muresan also led all rebounders and moved relatively smoothly
while changing the trajectory of several shots to help hold the
Nets' starters scoreless from the post.
</P>
<P>
   Few players can keep Muresan from establishing post position on
the low block, and his size and shooting accuracy make him nearly
unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, his presence in the lane limits almost all
penetration by the opponent. If Muresan can maintain his health and
improve his conditioning, he could be the find of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how he impacts games when he's on the floor,'' said
Nash, who signed Mure the final two games last season. ``He
immy improves a team defensively because players won't
contest him. He's not quite where he was in Washington but he's
getting there.''

<P>
   CHERVLENNAYA, Russia _ In the dead of night, without lights, a
convoy of cars drove along a narrow track, over the Terek River and
into a small village. Out of the dark, voices called a low greeting
from the roadside. ``Allah-u-Akbar,'' the rallying cry of the
Chechen forces. The men, quiet and serious, returned the greeting.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcements of Chechen fighters were heading in Saturday
night to relieve their comrades and strengthen the resistance to
the Russian advance in northern Chechnya. After indicating last
week that they were ceding the northern bank of the Terek River to
the superior might of the Russian forces, the Chechens say they
have regrouped and seized back a number of villages north of the
river like this one.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin contends that his military
operation is going well, while the Chechens insist that they have
beaten back the advance and imposed heavy casualties on the
Russians. Chechen fighters described particularly heavy fighting in
this village, where the Terek River dips south, coming within 15
miles of the capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians invaded Chechnya in 1994 to crush a bid for
independence. They withdrew in humiliating defeat 21 months later,
agreeing to defer any decision on Chechnya's status for five years.
Negotiations continued but Chechnya became engulfed in a wave of
crime that aggravated relations with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians renewed military action in recent weeks, spurred by
a violent uprising in neighboring Dagestan that was led by Islamic
militants who crossed into Dagestan from Chechnya and by bomb
explosions that killed almost 300 people in Moscow and Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Turpal-Ali Atgeriyev, minister for state security and commander
of the northeastern region for the Chechen forces, said his troops
had engaged the Russians four times and killed more than 200
Russian soldiers since the Russians crossed into Chechnya. He said
that although the Russians had not put out such figures, Russian
officers conceded that this was true in a meeting with him last
week. The figures could not be independently verified.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his candle-lit office in the blacked out town of
Gudermes, he said Chechen casualties in his area had reached 16
dead and many wounded. Overall in the fighting of the last few
weeks, about 45 Chechen fighters have been killed, another top
commander, Shamil Basayev, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening in Chervlennaya suggests that Russian forces
may face an even greater challenge this time than in the previous
war here in their attempt to occupy land _ even in the northern
part of Chechnya. In 1994, they seized control of all the land down
to the Terek River and beyond, reaching to within just 10 miles of
Grozny without a fight. At the strategic railway junction, a few
miles east of this village, they set up a large army base
untroubled by any rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they met with resistance as soon as they arrived at
the first villages on the edge of the steppe. Heavy fighting began
in Chervlennaya last Monday and lasted for two days until the
Chechens pulled out across the Terek. Atgeriyev said his men then
crossed the river and attacked again on Thursday, and that after
more fierce fighting, the Chechens had forced the Russians back
several miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very heavy fighting, and there was nowhere to dig in,''
said Idris Gaibov, a Chechen field commander who fought there. ``A
lot of Russians were killed in Chervlennaya _ easily a hundred. So
much that I thought they would hit us heavily with planes and
helicopters.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Russians had failed to secure several bridges over
the Terek, which had left the way open to the Chechen forces. After
the Chechens hit a Russian post on the edge of the village,
destroying two armored vehicles and killing their crews, the
Russian forces pulled back under cover of helicopter gunfire late
Saturday afternoon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our task is to clear them out of the whole region and push
them right back to the border,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the bunker of a building near the front line on
Saturday night, Gaibov could barely talk from exhaustion. Fighters
lay the entire length of the basement, sleeping between shifts on
the front line. Outside, flares fired from the Russian positions
lit up the sky, and the thump of mortars sounded throughout the
night. Russian jets roared low over the village, causing fighters
to run for cover, but the jets did not unleash any bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The village is already showing signs of Russian shelling, with
broken roofs and shell craters in the street. Very few civilians
remain.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has said the Russian aim in Chechnya is twofold: to take
control of the northern regions of Chechnya, down to and even
beyond the Terek, and to pursue and destroy Chechen ``terrorists''
and their bases.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Chechens proved elusive in the last war, and last week's
fighting indicates that nothing has changed. They are fighting in
highly mobile small groups, and they pull out and disperse when the
battles get too heavy.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Chechens said, 11 of their men attacked the
Russian post at the Chervlennaya railway junction. ``You don't need
a big group,'' said one of the fighters, who goes by the nom de
guerre Rizhi. ``We went with 11 men, and 11 came back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens on the front line are experienced fighters. Some of
the commanders have Soviet Army training, and the rest fought for
two years in the previous war. Their spirits high, the men joked
and kidded as they headed off to the front, blasting Western pop
music from their car radios.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens say they have few actual training camps or bases.
They tend simply to gather at a commander's house minutes before a
planned operation, and disperse again to their homes afterward. On
Saturday night, a group of several dozen gathered and quickly broke
up again, some setting off on foot across the fields, others
heading on toward the river, each carrying his own weapons and
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see our spirit? It will never fall,'' said a senior
commander, Aslanbek Izmailov, watching the men go. ``This is not
even the beginning. There will soon be a sea of blood and, God
willing, it will not be ours.''

ERITREA'S BIG LEAP FALLS VICTIM TO WAR

<P>
   MASSAWA, Eritrea _ There were only two tourists here on a recent
day, a pair of sunburned French women wandering alone in the dusty
streets surrounded by Ottoman buildings in a centuries-long slide
into rubble. Many residents of this port city were off fighting at
the front. And the port itself was not doing well, handling just
over half as much cargo as it should.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the way things were supposed to work in the tiny but
determined nation of Eritrea, the youngest country in Africa. For
five years after winning independence in 1993, Eritrea was one of
the continent's brightest spots. Its economy grew by about 7
percent a year. Investment flooded in, and hopes were high for
fishing, tourism and trade.
</P>
<P>
   But its once-thunderous economic growth has become yet another
victim of the war it has waged since May 1998 with its southern
neighbor, Ethiopia, which is itself in an economic slump over the
war.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell exactly how bad the economy is. Eritrea is a
proud nation not eager to give any satisfaction to Ethiopia, which
is eight times the size of Eritrea and seemed aimed at crushing
Eritrea economically if it could not do so militarily.
</P>
<P>
   So officials here emphasize the good. Privatization of
state-owned businesses is moving along. The nation still has little
debt. Inflation, while rising, has not spun out of control.
Eritrea, in short, has not collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials concede reluctantly that the war _ particularly
bloody and, nearly everyone agrees, particularly pointless _ has at
a minimum cost the momentum that had been pushing Eritrea forward
so impressively. And, experts say, the longer the war drags out,
the harder it will be for the nation to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace is important not only for the Eritrean economy but any
economy,'' said Tewolde Woldemichael, director general of the
nation's Department of Trade. ``I don't think any economy can
afford to conduct war and go at the pace it deserves to as far as
development goes.''
</P>
<P>
   John Weakliam, a banker who lives in Eritrea and is generally
optimistic about its prospects, said, ``The economy is frozen.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been signs before the war that Eritrea could not
sustain such high levels of growth. But that slowdown became more
pronounced in 1998 after the war began. Economic growth dropped to
4 percent last year, and experts predict it will be lower for 1999.
Imports and exports are down, as are housing construction and
foreign investment. Tourism, a small but growing industry, has all
but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In Massawa, an island city on the Red Sea that has weathered
occupations by the Turks, Egyptians and Italians, the story of
rejuvenation, followed by war-induced stagnation, is especially
striking. Since the early 1990s, Eritreans had worked with their
characteristic energy to rebuild the port, Eritrea's biggest. It
had been all but destroyed when Eritrea was still part of Ethiopia,
at the end of the rebellion against the regime of Haile Mariam
Mengistu that succeeded in overthrowing him in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The current leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea fought side by side
as rebel leaders against the Mengistu regime. Afterward, they
became economically intertwined, to the point of uncomfortable
dependence.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia was landlocked after Eritrea split off in 1993, largely
with Ethiopia's blessing, and had to rely on the port in the
southern Eritrean city of Assab. In turn, Eritrea, which does not
grow enough food to feed itself, relied on Ethiopia for up to
two-thirds of its trade, much of it in food.
</P>
<P>
   By last year, despite old machinery and a shallow harbor, the
port processed nearly 1 million tons of cargo, some of it food aid
and construction materials going on to northern Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, business at the port started to decline. The
amount of cargo is 60 percent off target, said Araia Tsegai, the
port manager. And, of course, nothing is going into Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war has had an effect,'' Tsegai said.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea _ which
experts estimate has killed 50,000 or more fighters on both sides _
began as an economic dispute between former friends.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea introduced its own currency in 1997 over Ethiopia's
objections, creating tensions and making trade more difficult.
Their relationship had become so sour by mid-1998 that when a
dispute arose over an ill-defined border in the Badme region, the
two nations went to war.
</P>
<P>
   The battles were fierce, if intermittent, and hopes had been
high late this summer that a peace deal would be reached. But weeks
later, Eritrea is still alone in its final acceptance of a peace
accord brokered by the Organization of African Unity. Ethiopia,
while accepting the plan's outlines, has not signed off on the
details. The worry is that, without a final deal, fighting may
resume now that the dry season has begun.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When a peace agreement finally is signed, the big question will
be how quickly Eritrea can rebuild its economy. The fighting has
been contained along sparsely occupied border lands, so physical
reconstruction is not the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts argue that it will take a long time because Eritrea
has spent so much on the war rather than on building its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of millions of dollars or more were spent on military
hardware, including at least six fighter planes. No one knows
exactly how many young Eritrean men and women have died fighting,
which means fewer people to earn money and rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say that all the positive results that had been
obtained by Eritreans in their seven years of independence have
been nullified by 15 months of war,'' said a Western diplomat in
the capital, Asmara. ``The bill has not arrived. It will be a huge
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that no lasting damage has been done because
Eritrea itself has so much going for it.
</P>
<P>
   Although a years-long search for oil has not panned out so far,
the nation has other natural resources, like gold, copper and
marble. An American government analysis shows that Eritrea's waters
in the Red Sea can produce 69,000 tons of fish a year, but only
5,000 tons are now sold.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are Eritreans themselves, who have shown themsel be well organized, hard working and single-mindedly committed to
building their new nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this country is able to do is send 10 percent of its
population to fight within days,'' said Weakliam, the banker.
``These people will come back, lay down their guns and go back to
work as if nothing ever happened.''

18-YEAR-OLD ROOKIE CENTER LIFTS ISLANDERS TO VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Sometimes, it is hard to believe that Tim
Connolly, the Islanders' rookie center, is just 18. He seems so
much older when he is faking a veteran defenseman or making a
snappy pass or shooting the puck past one of the league's top
goaltenders.
</P>
<P>
   This year's first-round draft pick did all of that and more
Sunday afternoon. But perhaps most importantly, he gave the 14,523
fans at the home opener a reason to come back to Nassau Coliseum
this season. Connolly scored a dazzling goal, his first in the
National Hockey League, and he also recorded his first assist to
help the Islanders beat the Colorado Avalanche, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   After putting his team ahead by 2-1 early in the second period,
Connolly, who was selected by the Islanders with the fifth pick
over all in June, set up the game-winning goal. The goal, scored on
the power play by Mariusz Czerkawski later in the same period, gave
the Islanders (1-1-0) a commanding 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The pass was pretty, but it was Connolly's spectacular goal that
will be remembered by Islanders fans, who gave Connolly a warm
welcome when he was introduced before the game. Islanders fans, it
seems, have found their new favorite player.
</P>
<P>
   On the play, Connolly, a center, was fed the puck in the corner
by Mark Lawrence. Connolly then faked defenseman Aaron Miller,
before skating between the circles, where he faked Chris Drury to
his knees. But the most impressive part of the play was Connolly's
patience, the way he waited for the clean shot, which he eventually
got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up watching Patrick Roy,'' said Connolly, who after the
game was presented with the puck by his linemate Gino Odjick, ``and
to score my first goal against him was unbelievable. It's also
relieving getting that first goal out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Islanders forward Claude Lapointe, who scored the Islanders'
fourth goal on a breakaway late in the game, said: ``He's
impressing a lot of people. He's only 18, but it seems like he's
been playing in the league for a few years, at least.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders were coming off of a long layoff between games,
and they had fresher legs than the Avalanche, who is without Peter
Forsberg (shoulder surgery) indefinitely. The visiting team looked
tired and disorganized at times. But the Islanders played above and
beyond their expectations for 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was extremely impressed,'' Islanders Coach Butch Goring
said. ``I was worried about how we were going to perform after the
eight days off. But to my surprise, we had some good jump. We
played aphysical, good forechecking game.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy, the Colorado goalie, made 27 saves; Felix Potvin made 14
stops for the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   The customary opening day pre-game ceremony was classy and
sentimental, from the player introductions to Mike Bossy, the
former Islander great, coming out to a standing ovation before
dropping the puck in a ceremonial face-off. Later, Bob Nystrom,
Mike Bossy, Wayne Merrick and Al Arbour, all of whom were a part of
the Stanley Cup teams of the 1980's, welcomed home their old
friend, Goring, the Islanders' first year coach, in a video
tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the pre-game activities were not the game's only
fireworks. The Islanders blew away the Avalanche early in the game,
out-shooting the visitors by 12-2. Although the score was 1-1 at
the end of the first period, it seemed like a victory for the
Islanders, who have struggled in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh scored on the power play on
Colorado's first shot of the game at 3 minutes 37 seconds. The
Avalanche did not get off another shot until 13:14. During the
Colorado cold streak, Mats Lindgren scored the Islanders' first
goal on the power play at 12:22 to tie the game at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders took a 3-2 lead in the second period and had
out-shot the Avalanche by 24-8. The Islanders got the goals from
Connolly at 1:28 of the second period and Czerkwski on the power
play at 3:25 to take a 3-1 lead. Colorado's Alex Tanguay pulled the
Avalanche within 3-2, scoring on the power play at 16:59 of the
second period.
</P>
<P>
   Lapointe added an insurance goal on a breakaway with 54 seconds
remaining in the game to make the score 4-2. &QL;

 &HT;    Forwards get boost from more ice time
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It wasn't what Curt Fraser expected would be the cure
to his team's struggling offense _ and it may not be the long-term
solution.
</P>
<P>
   But after scoring five goals against an improbable opponent
(Stanley Cup finalist Buffalo), including four against a
sometimes-impossible goaltender (Dominik Hasek), the Thrashers on
Saturday night came to the realization that less might be more.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser suited up only 11 forwards and carried an extra
defenseman (seven total) for the first time, which gave more ice to
the primary three forward lines. That hardly was the only reason
the Thrashers _ after scoring only two goals in the previous four
outings, including two exhibitions _ managed a 5-5 tie with
Buffalo, but Fraser is convinced it was a significant contributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running four lines is very important for us because we need to
get everybody involved in the offense,'' Fraser said. ``But right
now we need to find ways to win. With the (television) timeouts and
all the stoppages in play, guys like (Patrik) Stefan and (Ray)
Ferraro aren't getting enough ice time. This gives them a chance to
generate a little more offense for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro struggled for the third consecutive game, going
pointless and picking up two minor penalties, one of which led to a
Sabres power-play goal. Fraser's abbreviated analysis: ``He's
getting frustrated. We can't have that.'' Andrew Brunette, one of
Ferraro's linemates, scored his first goal of the year, which
Fraser hopes jumpstarts the center.
</P>
<P>
   But the Thrashers were aided by strong play from two other
trios: The Stefan-Kelly Buchberger-Nelson Emerson line accounted
for three goals and four assists. The new combination of Per
Svartvadet-Johan Garpenlov-Denny Lambert started the game and
produced a goal and three assists and several scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser alternated wingers with fourth-line center Mike
Stapleton, even using defenseman Yannick Tremblay twice. Tremblay
responded with his best game of the year, assisting on two goals.
``He's really the only defenseman we have with the ability to jump
into (an offensive rush),'' Fraser said. ``Dressing seven
defensemen gives us a lot more flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   What Fraser hasn't solved yet are the problems with his team's
play in its own end. Facing New Jersey, Detroit and Buffalo is not
a friendly way to open a season, but 16 goals allowed in three
games is not acceptable to the coach. Goaltending by Damian Rhodes
and Norm Maracle has been inconsistent. Rhodes made some key saves
to preserve the tie down the stretch but allowed a bad goal by
Curtis Brown early in the third period to start a Sabres rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early, and we started against three of the best teams in
the league,'' Fraser said. ``Everybody makes mistakes, including
goaltenders. We have to let them grow this year, just like the rest
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's hope is its next growth spurt comes on Long Island.
The team opens a three-game trip Thursday against the New York
Islanders, who appear to be the most beatable opponent thus far.
The trip continues with games against Tampa Bay and the New York
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be good for us to get on the road,'' Fraser said. ``We
can relax a little. We won't be playing in front of everybody who
we're worried about trying to impress.''

<P>
   NABLUS, West Bank _ Inside the casbah, two men hustled past the
bullet-pocked refrigerator cases into the Abu Salhieh family
butcher shop. The butcher raised his meat cleaver in joy. The men
hauled a lamb slaughtered in celebration: After 23 days in the
hospital, the butcher's younger brother was about to be released.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Abu Salhieh, although he cannot yet walk, survived a
shootout that stunned this northern Palestinian city. It began as a
petty dispute, with two youths harassing women from the Abu Salhieh
family during a wedding march. But it escalated into a full-fledged
battle between the largest, most radical refugee camp in the West
Bank and city folk in this commercial town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Chicago,'' said the butcher, Mohammed Abu Salhieh,
43.
</P>
<P>
   What most shook not only Nablus but the Palestinian Authority
was the vast number of automatic weapons that poured into the
streets. At the climax, after Abu Salhieh was gunned down in the
butcher shop, the usually tranquil town square filled with 1,000
men, many firing wantonly in a brazen exhibition of illegal arms.
</P>
<P>
   In a limited sense, the violent episode in Nablus accomplished
what the latest peace agreement had not. It propelled Palestinian
officials into starting to hunt down thousands, if not tens of
thousands, of illegal weapons whose seizure has been required by
every peace accord since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the crackdown, focused on the Balata refugee camp and its
thriving black market, did not go smoothly and ultimately went only
so far. After an ugly showdown with the camp's youth that evoked
scenes from the intifada, the Palestinian uprising against Israel
several years ago, the Palestinian officers arrested 17 men they
said were arms dealers.
</P>
<P>
   They did succeed in putting out the word, which seeped through
rutted streets where weapons had been worn as freely as cell
phones, that the guns must be locked away; the authorities, for the
meantime, mean business.
</P>
<P>
   Those same authorities did not, however, actually confiscate
many weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It is Israel that has traditionally seen the accumulation of
weapons in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a threat. But this
crackdown, in response to an internal crisis, made clear that the
Palestinians, too, recognized the proliferation of weapons as a
threat to security _ their own.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the problem represents a true challenge for Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, who risks a backlash if he comes
down too hard on his own people. Complicating the picture, it is
not just civilians, but also Arafat's outsized security forces, who
have been amassing and abusing illegal guns.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly concerned about what they see as the militarization
of Palestinian society, several Palestinian officials and human
rights groups have been sounding alarms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot close our eyes and pretend this phenomenon does not
exist,'' said Hasem Khader, a Palestinian legislator from the
Balata camp. ``It is frightening and dangerous, and if it is not
too late, something must be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, in Nablus it was not the quest to meet their
obligations under the latest peace deal that pushed the security
officials into action. Instead, they moved to calm the anxieties of
ordinary Palestinians, and since they succeeded _ somewhat _ they
proclaimed their crackdown a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, if you come to Nablus now, you will not see a single
weapon on a citizen,'' said a senior Palestinian security official.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli security experts and some Palestinians said the
incident showed that the Palestinian Authority had limited ability
and limited desire to confiscate weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, they were not pushed by us, but faced by
internal problems they had to solve,'' said Shlomo Dror, spokesman
for the coordinator of Israeli government activities in the West
Bank and Gaza. ``And even in this case, they were not willing to go
to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   One action taken recently by the West Bank Palestinian governors
cut deeply into the local way of life. They decreed that guns may
not be shot off at weddings, as is the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot find any excuse for the shooting of a weapon at a
party,'' said Tayer Naserala, an assistant to the Nablus governor.
``But the intifada gave them the idea. When we saw an armed person
with a rifle challenging the occupation, we were filled with joy.
Now the joy is associated with the weapon in any context.''
</P>
<P>
   Only several hundred weapons are held legally in the West Bank
and Gaza. The far larger illegal cache, the Israelis guess, numbers
30,000 to 40,000 weapons. Pistols, grenades and M-16 and
Kalashnikov assault rifles are smuggled into Gaza and the West Bank
from Jordan and Egypt, stolen from Israeli soldiers or purchased
from Israeli criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Prices average $500 to $2,000 a gun, and dealers are easily
found. Nablus residents said they sometimes used to wander into the
Balata camp and see M-16's openly displayed on kaffiyehs as if in a
produce market.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Muhammad Daraghmeh, a Palestinian reporter,
discovered a clothing store in the heart of Nablus that sold
submachine guns as well as blue jeans. A dealer there offered
M-16's for about $2,000 apiece and said he had bought the weapons
in Ramallah, moving about 20 a month for some $3,000 profit.
</P>
<P>
   Many arms dealers are former intifada fighters. Schooled at a
young age in violence, they spent their early adult years in jail
and emerged, totally unprepared, into a limited job market.
</P>
<P>
   They are hungry for quick cash, and some of their best customers
belong to Arafat's power base _ to members of his political party,
Al Fatah, and to agents of his seven security forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Palestinian needs a weapon to continue our struggle,''
said Jihad Izzat, a Fatah leader in the Balata camp. ``The
authorities promised that the weapons of Fatah will be considered
the weapons of the movements, nationalist weapons. They will never
be confiscated.''
</P>
<P>
   When they do attempt confiscations, as the showdown at Balata
taught them, Palestinian officers have to be careful to avoid
tactics that recall those of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not go to make searches in every house like in the
occupation,'' the senior Palestinian security official said. ``We
are dealing with our people. We have to wait to see weapons at
demonstrations or to get information from intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinians find that insufficient. LAW, a Palestinian
human rights group in Ramallah, has documented 20 deaths due to
firearms abuses since the arrival of the Palestinian Authority in
1994. Its report also notes a marked increase in weapons abuses in
the last few months, by security officers and ``by the public in
displays of power and bravado.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian authorities themselves are unnerved by the
spread of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Some 19,000 Palestinians live in Balata, a squalid place that
has become a long-term transient home for people who still aspire,
increasingly despairingly, to return to their houses in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In his office in the camp, Khader, the legislator, said that
``the Palestinian revolution started with a revolver.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Weapons became a part of our character,'' he said. ``Now they
are so much more freely available and so much cheaper. So everyone,
as they can afford a house, can afford a weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees, he said, are growing certain that Palestinian leaders
will sell out their aspirations during the final negotiations with
the Israelis. Some buy weapons for personal security, some with
criminal intent and some for nationalist reasons and to keep pace
with Jewish settlers, many of whom are armed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the camp, he added ominously, some are accumulating
weapons out of concern that they will have to stand up against the
government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The feud in Nablus began on Sept. 16 when two camp youths drove
into a nice neighborhood in town during a wedding march by the Abu
Salhieh family. The youths plowed their car through the procession
and ``looked the wrong way at our women,'' said Mahyoub Abu
Salhieh, an engineer and member of the preventive security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Chased off, the youths returned later with their friends from
the security forces. ``We wanted to apologize,'' said Mohammed
Dandan, a camp resident and intelligence agent. The family invited
the men to take hot coffee laced with cardamom.
</P>
<P>
   But the pleasantries broke down. Dandan, whose eyes are still
bloodshot and his face bruised, ended up severely beaten by an Abu
Salhieh cousin. middle of the night, 40 masked men from the
camp returned to shoot up the butcher's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This annoyed us,'' the butcher said. ``We have weapons too.''
Palestinian officials mediated a cease-fire, so Bashar Abu Salhieh
went to open the butcher shop the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   He was chopping lamb on a large tree stump when nine masked men
stormed the casbah, waving M-16's and telling shoppers to run for
cover. They left 17 bullet holes in the store. Several dum-dum
bullets e in Bashar's body, according to medical reports.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken away by ambulance. Rumor spread that he had been
killed. Merchants closed their stores and began to hunt the
presumed killers. Within a half-hour, they were joined by about
1,000 men at the fountain in the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our control, really,'' Mahyoub Al Salhieh said. ``We
were ready to shoot and kill. Lots of weapons were being fired. But
then we found out from the governor that Bashar had survived. We
tried to calm the crowd, but it was beyond us. The authorities had
to intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Salhieh family turned their eight weapons over to the
security forces. Arafat ordered forces into the streets to calm
things down.
</P>
<P>
   In Balata, rumors spread that the forces would go house to
house. Within an hour, the youths had gathered, hurling stones and
burning tires as they used to do against the Israeli soldiers. The
showdown lasted several days as refugee camp leaders from the rest
of the West Bank showed up in solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those eventually arrested were Fatah members in the
security apparatus, which was apparently meant as a signal: No one
is immune.

SEA LAUNCHING OF A SATELLITE IS SUCCESSFUL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (rk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ushering in a new era in rocketry, a multinational
company has launched a communications satellite into space from a
platform floating in the Pacific Ocean, the first such launching
from sea rather than from land.
</P>
<P>
   The 200 foot-tall rocket lifted off from the launch pad _ a
converted offshore oil drilling platform _ at 11:28 p.m. Eastern
time Saturday from a location on the equator about 1,400 miles
southeast of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement is significant because the use of the offshore
platform allows launchings to be conducted at the equator, where
the rotation of the earth's surface is the fastest. The rotation
gives the rocket a boost, allowing it to use less fuel or to carry
a heavier payload than a similar rocket launched from a higher
latitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything came off exactly the way we planned it,'' Allen B.
Ashby, president of the Sea Launch Co., the multinational launching
venture, said late Saturday from the company's home port in Long
Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Launch is led by the Boeing Co. The other partners are
Kvaerner Maritime, a Norwegian ship builder, and rocket builders
from Russia and the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   The launching is a welcome event for the satellite industry,
which has found it more difficult recently to get satellites into
space.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year or so, there have been six big failures of
American rockets. At the same time, it has become more cumbersome
for American satellite companies to use foreign rockets because of
tighter national security restrictions that took effect after
reports that two American satellite companies might have helped
China improve its rocket and missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good to get a new reliable source of launch
vehicle services,'' said Eddy W. Hartenstein, president of DirecTV,
the owner of the satellite launched Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications companies are planning to launch hundreds of
communications satellites over the next decade to provide
telephone, television, Internet and other services.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement is also a bright spot for Boeing. It comes after
the company's new Delta III rocket failed in its first two
launchings.
</P>
<P>
   To convince a nervous satellite industry that its concept would
work, Sea Launch hoisted a dummy satellite into orbit in March. But
Saturday's launching was the first of a real commercial satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Launch already has 18 launchings planned over the next five
years. Thirteen of them are for Hughes Electronics, the nation's
largest satellite company and the parent of DirecTV, and five are
for Loral Space and Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Launch has worked five years on its project, and has
invested more than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The initial launching took place almost a year behind schedule,
partly because the project was suspended last year by the State
Department while it investigated whether Boeing had transferred
sensitive data to its Russian and Ukrainian partners in violation
of arms export laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Ukraine's Yuzhnoye design bureau and Yuzhmash production
plant, which developed the first two stages of Sea Launch's Zenit
rocket, once made the Soviet Union's most deadly missile. The
Russian partner in Sea Launch, RSC Energia, built the third stage
of the rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing agreed to pay a $10 million fine in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, the Sea Launch president, said Boeing did not endanger
national security but that it had not always gotten the proper
clearances before exchanging data with the foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
   The launch pad, built by Kvaerner, is nearly the size of two
football fields and stands 20 stories tall. It traveled to the
launch site from Long Beach, a journey that took about 10 days. A
crew of 300 people managed the launching.
</P>
<P>
   The 7,600-pound satellite will replace an older DirecTV
satellite that beams dozens of channels of television to dish
antennas at customers' homes. The new satellite will have extra
capacity, allowing DirecTV to also transmit local broadcast
channels and better compete with cable television.
</P>
<P>
   The DirecTV satellite will be in geosynchronous orbit 22,300
miles over the equator.

AFL-CIO WILL ENDORSE GORE, LABOR LEADER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GORE-CAMPAIGN, IOWA-GORE-BRADLEY) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The president of the AFL-CIO, John Sweeney, said
Sunday that Vice President Al Gore would receive the endorsement of
the powerful labor federation at its convention this week because
two-thirds of the delegates were now committed to Gore's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Friday, union leaders said it was too close to
say whether Gore would win the federation's support this week. But
Sweeney said in an interview that the matter was clinched this
weekend when several large unions swung into the Gore column,
although only after Sweeney made an emotional appeal to labor
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The 700 convention delegates are scheduled to vote on an
endorsement on Wednesday. For months, Gore and his opponent for the
Democratic presidential nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, have feverishly lobbied labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In one-on-one meetings and at meetings of the federation's
executive board, Sweeney repeatedly argued that Gore was going to
win the nomination, so labor would be wise to support him sooner
rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has a terrific track record,'' Sweeney said in an
interview Sunday. ``He had an 88 percent pro-labor voting record in
the Senate, and as vice president, he's been in the forefront on a
lot of the social issues that matter to working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney and other Gore supporters in labor say they want to
avoid a lengthy, divisive primary that could deplete Gore's
campaign treasury and weaken him in an eventual showdown with a
Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lehane, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said the
campaign had not received any official word that an endorsement was
clinched.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to work very hard to earn the support of organized
labor,'' he said. ``The Democratic Party is about working people
and the heart and soul of that is organized labor. Clearly we would
be honored to receive the support of organized labor, and we'll
continue working for that this week.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, Gore was expected to gain an early endorsement from
the labor federation, so his failure to win labor's backing would
have been a stinging setback to an already stumbling campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But now it appears that Gore will not only be spared a major
embarrassment, but will gain what many political experts say is the
single most important endorsement a candidate can receive, because
few other organizations can mobilize the way the 13 million-member
federation can.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO produces millions of campaign leaflets, organizes
tens of thousands of volunteers, registers hundreds of thousands of
voters and coordinates union efforts across the nation. The
federation's endorsement is distinct from, but builds upon, the
endorsements made by the federation's 68 member unions.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, it looked as if Gore would have a hard time
nailing down a two-thirds majority because leaders of three of the
federation's largest unions, all with more than 1 million members _
the Teamsters, the auto workers and the food and commercial workers
_ said they opposed an early endorsement. In addition, another
giant union, the Service Employees International Union, with nearly
1.3 million members, was sitting on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO officials said Sunday that the United Food and
Commercial Workers and the service employees agreed to line up
behind Gore at Sweeney's urging. ``If we're going to be effective,
we have to have a united labor movement,'' Sweeney said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, several union presidents said that the most
crucial factor in Gore's effort to win the labor endorsement was
how hard Sweeney would push for it. Many leaders said they trust
Sweeney's judgment and want to avoid divisions, adding that they
would be willing to follow him if he insisted that endorsing Gore
now was the wisest course for the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   John Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees, said in an interview Sunday that his 250,000-member
union was trying to stay out of the political tug of war. But,
referring to Sweeney, he added, ``If my leader asks me to make an
endorsement, I'll follow my leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the Los Angeles convention, Sweeney
has met with dozens of union leaders, assessing their political
leanings, lobbying them for Gore and weighing whether there is
enough support to clinch a Gore endorsement. At an executive board
meeting late Friday, he made his biggest pitch yet for Gore, saying
he wanted the endorsement to happen and that Gore has been a solid
friend of labor on numerous issues, including a patients' bill of
rights and a higher minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Several unions held meetings this weekend at which their
delegates decided their position on an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been confident that Al Gore would receive our
endorsement,'' Sweeney said Sunday. ``But there's a process I have
to follow. I don't want to get too far out in front of the
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Those opposed to an endorsement have argued that there should be
no rush to endorse Gore with his campaign faltering and recent
polls showing Bradley doing better against a hypothetical
Republican opponent than Gore would. Several union officials
asserted that a big advantage of holding offat it might
press Gore and Bradley to move closer to labor on trade and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's too early,'' said Michael Mathis, political
director of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. ``We're
trying to make very clear that we're not against Gore. We're not
for Bradley. It's just too early.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Three of the largest unions in the AFL-CIO _ the Communications
Workers of America, the American Federation of Teachers and the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees _ have
endorsed Gore and have lobbied aggressively for a quick
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should make an endorsement. That's the right thing to do,''
said Jay Mazur, a Gore supporter who is president of the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. ``There won't be
another opportunity to bring all the delegates together. We can't
talk about having influence in the Democratic Party and then stand
on the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Many union leaders noted that the federation had never endorsed
a presidential candidate so long before the November election. But
other officials said it was important to act earlier than in
previous years because the primary schedule had been moved up so
much.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rosenthal, the AFL-CIO's political director, said he would
move quickly after the Wednesday endorsement to get labor's
political troops working for Gore. ``We're beginning meetings right
away with our Iowa and New Hampshire leadership, and in New York,
California, Ohio and a number of the other early-primary states
where there is a big union membership,'' Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Several union presidents said that at a recent meeting of the
federation's political committee, James Hoffa, the Teamsters'
president, had said that unions might look impotent if they
endorsed someone now without securing more concessions from
candidates. But Sandra Feldman, president of the teachers'
federation, countered that unions would look impotent if they
stayed on the sidelines while others determined who the Democratic
nominee would be.

U.S. AND ALLIES DIVIDED OVER HARDSHIP AID TO YUGOSLAVIA
</HEADLINE>
   (jw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With winter fast approaching, the United States and
its allies are deeply divided over whether to increase the
isolation of Yugoslavia and its leader, Slobodan Milosevic, or to
offer some aid to ease the hardship of the people in the hope of
encouraging a more vital opposition.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a meeting Monday of the European Union's 15
foreign ministers in Luxembourg, the Clinton administration has
outlined its strong opposition to plans by the group to provide
heating oil and other aid to certain Yugoslav cites controlled by
opposition parties, American and European officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, the European Union would initially supply two
cities with about $5 million in heating oil to help cope with
shortages caused by destruction of Yugoslavia's petroleum
refineries during NATO's air war over Kosovo. That aid would be the
first part of a broader package that would eventually include food,
medicine and even small-scale public works projects, European
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials have said they fear that the assistance
could shore up Milosevic by alleviating public discontent, which
they hope could lead to protests in Yugoslavia, early elections, or
even Milosevic's ouster or resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has laid out the Clinton
administration's objections in a series of discussions with her
European counterparts, including Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of
Britain and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned about proposals that may have appropriate
humanitarian goals but may lead to developments that directly or
indirectly support the regime,'' State Department spokesman James
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over providing aid highlights the difficult
situation facing the United States in the wake of NATO's air war
over Kosovo last spring, which left Milosevic politically battered
but still clinging to power. The quarrel also underscores
Washington's philosophical differences with the Europeans over how
to isolate and weaken Milosevic's government further.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States has said it supports aid to relieve the
suffering of ordinary people in Yugoslavia, it has ruled out any
aid for reconstruction in the nation as long as Milosevic remains
in power.
</P>
<P>
   Many American allies in Europe, however, view things
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans don't necessarily see isolation as the only way
to do away with Milosevic,'' said Ivo Daalder, a former National
Security Council aide who now studies the Balkans for the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration wants to keep the pressure on,'' he added.
``They're afraid, one, that if you divide the allies from us,
Milosevic will exploit these divisions and, secondly, that the
allies are weaker than we are, as on Iraq and Iran, and will
undermine the sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the war ended, Yugoslavia has remained under strict
sanctions that prohibit trade, even as millions of dollars of aid
has poured into Kosovo, which is technically still a province of
Serbia, but increasingly is being administered by the United
Nations as a separate entity.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions against Yugoslavia, coupled with NATO's
destruction of bridges, refineries and factories, have caused the
country's already feeble economy to collapse. There are shortages
of foods, and spiraling inflation is making even basic items
unaffordable for many.
</P>
<P>
   In a report on Sept. 20, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs says that as winter sets in, Serbia faces
severe shortages of electricity, heating oil and coal. Electricity
supplies, it warned, could fall 40 percent to 50 percent below its
requirements as winter progresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall impact of such shortages is expected to be
increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in urban areas,''
the report said. ``The most vulnerable will be the elderly, the
very young, the sick and the urban poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the United States, based on its own analysis, did not
believe that the energy shortage would be substantial, but the
Europeans have shown more willingness to consider ways to respond
to the warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has been trying to tailor a relief program
that would not directly support Milosevic, who has been charged
with war crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague. During
a meeting last month, the group's humanitarian office pledged
roughly $40 million in aid.
</P>
<P>
   European officials said they planned to provide aid only if they
could guarantee that it would not end up in the hands of
Milosevic's government. The $5 million worth of heating oil being
considered under the initial plan would, for example, go to two
cities in southeastern Serbia _ Nis and Pirot, which are governed
by opponents of Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Daalder said such plans had potential downsides, especially
since energy, like money, could easily be diverted to the central
government. ``These localities don't have real power other than
political power,'' he said. ``They don't have police or security
power. How do you assure it doesn't get stolen or simply taken
away?''
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting in Luxembourg, the foreign ministers are
expected to discuss ways to ensure that Milosevic's central
government could not redirect the assistance _ something that Dr.
Albright demanded in her discussions with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to prove they are democratic forces,'' one European
diplomat said of potential aid recipients, ``and we have to be sure
these funds are not siphoned off to the government of Slobodan
Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat said that directing aid to cities, rather than
denying it, could shore up the opposition leaders by showing the
people of Serbia that the international community was prepared to
help those committed to democracy. Otherwise, European officials
have argued, the democratic opposition is left looking as if it is
in partnership only with Western countries that first bombed
Yugoslavia and now want to make Serbs suffer still more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give them some glimmer of hope if they chose another
path, they might chose the other,'' the official said. ``It is a
carrot-and-a-stick question. The EU sees more profit in the carrot
than the stick.''

ONCE-DISCREDITED COMMUNISTS PLACE THIRD IN BERLIN VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the
successor to East Germany's Communist Party drew on a groundswell
of disillusionment about the transition to capitalism to surge
Sunday night to its best showing yet in city elections.
</P>
<P>
   Just a month after Berlin became the official capital of
reunified Germany, the center of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
self-proclaimed ``Berlin Republic,'' the Party of Democratic
Socialism won about 40 percent of all votes in the formerly
Communist eastern half of Berlin, and some 18 percent citywide.
</P>
<P>
   The once-discredited former Communists are still third behind
the center-right Christian Democrats, who retained the mayor's
office and won almost half the votes, and the center-left Social
Democrats, who won barely 22 percent _ a far cry from their
domination of West Berlin's politics under Willy Brandt in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's election seemed emblematic of the polarization of
Berlin, and perhaps of Germany itself. West of the line where the
wall once ran, the Christian Democrats appeared to have generated
their best result since World War II by capturing about 48.9
percent of the vote. East of the wall, the buoyant and
reinvigorated former Communists increased their share from 36.3
percent to 39.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The retooled Communists even advanced their hold in the western
part of the city, where they remain bit players but doubled their
vote share from 2.4 to 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The results mark another setback for Schroeder and his Social
Democrats, whose support slipped to its lowest ebb ever in a city
that after 1945 became known for blending a tough, proletarian edge
with a vibrant intellectual liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, Schroeder's party has had stinging
defeats in state elections around the country. Criticized for its
confusion and more recently for its advocacy of unpopular cuts in
social spending, the Social Democrats were ousted from power in the
industrial region of Saarland, long a stronghold, lost substantial
ground in the eastern states of Brandenburg, Thuringia and Saxony,
and even saw support decline sharply in local elections in its
traditional industrial stronghold of North-Rhine Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
   For practical purposes, Sunday's election will leave Berlin's
local Parliament essentially unchanged. The Christian Democrats
will continue in a ``grand coalition'' with Social Democrats
because neither will gain a majority of seats in the city
Parliament. Eberhard Diepgen, a Christian Democrat who has held the
job for eight years, will continue as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   In massive apartment blocks in the eastern district of Marzahn,
however, the rising support for the former Communists was on full
display.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have people at the top who have attracted a great deal of
sympathy and convinced people that they can make government work
for them,'' said Bernd Wodicka, a 48-year-old civil engineer who
voted for the Party of Democratic Socialism for the second time in
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately after the wall, I had no interest in voting for
them,'' said Wodicka, referring to the Nov. 9, 1989, fall of the
Berlin wall. But he said he had become convinced that both of
Germany's two mainstream parties were steering the country toward
nothing less than ``bankruptcy, misfortune and breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Berlin has long since lost all but a few remnants of
the wall, the infamous ``wall in the mind'' remains intact, if not
in some ways reinforced. The eastern side of the city remains
populated by people who were either part of the old government or
built their careers in the very specific ways of the old East
German Communist system.
</P>
<P>
   The homes and buildings of eastern Berlin may have undergone
extensive outward renovation _ most of the drab old concrete
apartment towers now sport bright colors and fancy new facades _
but unemployment continually hovers around 14 percent, and the chic
and glitz surrounding the new German Parliament and the shopping
complexes at Potsdamer Platz are still miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of Gregor Gysi, the former Communist Party
has managed to retain much of its original base and reinvent itself
as a smart, even fashionable party that speaks to the genuine
interests of easterners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good result,'' Gysi exulted Sunday evening.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Communist parties now play a significant role in the
politics of many west European nations _ as indeed the reform
Communists do in other former Soviet-bloc countries _ Gysi said
Germany's mainstream parties have no choice but to heed his group
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Social Democrats are only used to reacting to pressure
from the right,'' he said. ``But now they have to react to pressure
from the left as well. It is normal in many other countries, and
they have to get used to the idea of it being normal here too.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Momper, the Social Democratic candidate for Mayor,
acknowledged his party's setback but expressed relief that the
party had avoided the much steeper declines recorded in the earlier
state elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a defeat and we absolutely cannot gloss over that,''
Momper said shortly after the first projections were announced.
``But the second point is that we have stopped the national
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains far from clear. The Social Democrats' loss was not
as bad as many experts had predicted in recent days, but they still
appeared to have slipped slightly from what had already been their
worst-ever result in Berlin city elections four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The results also seemed to reinforce a more chronic weakness of
Schroeder's party in the former eastern states. It did not help
that Momper, who was the mayor of Berlin from 1989 , was
strongly against a formal reunification of the city.
</P>
<P>
   While the votes of residents of the former East Germany
apparently helped Schroeder to his victory last year over
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the same East Germans seem now to be
disillusioned that Schroeder has not made good on promises of
reducing unemployment. In eastern states like Thuringia and Saxony,
voters are increasingly choosing between the conservatives of the
Christian Democratic Union and the more authentically ``eastern''
Party of Democratic Socialism.

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Donna Brazile, who was just named Al Gore's new
campaign manager, did not supply a terse, ``that was a long time
ago, in another country'' response when asked about the night she
stepped down from another presidential campaign, Michael Dukakis',
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   She had agreed to resign after it had hit the news wires that
she had prodded reporters, with some way-out-of-school comments, to
check out rumors about Vice President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, she called her mother in Louisiana and told her
that it looked like the two of them would be spending lots of time
together, making gumbo and sitting on the porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Jean,' _ I called my mom Jean _ `I got fired.' I
said, `I called the vice president a racist, a liar and a
philanderer.' '' (In fact, her comments had been limited to that
third thing she mentioned.) ``And she said, `Is that all?' But I
thought I'd failed my mother,'' Ms. Brazile said, looking for a
split second as though she might cry. ``I've tried never to bring
dishonor to my family and that was hard.''
</P>
<P>
   When her mother, a domestic worker with no health insurance,
died several weeks later in the same New Orleans charity hospital
where Ms. Brazile and her eight siblings were born, Ms. Brazile
said she used her last paycheck from the Dukakis campaign to bury
her. Grieving and ashamed, she lost 40 pounds and, as a Roman
Catholic, she said, ``I did penance. That's what I called it and
that's what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   e months, she lived in a Washington homeless shelter
while working for Mitch Snyder, an advocate for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   She recovered, though, became chief of staff for Eleanor Holmes
Norton, the District of Columbia delegate, and today suffers no
obvious lack of confidence in her abilities.
</P>
<P>
   At 39, Ms. Brazile is not the sort of person you might meet at a
party and then not remember when you run into her again in an
airport nine years later. When Matt Drudge, publisher of The Drudge
Report, the gossipy Web site, recently referred to her as a ``smear
queen,'' she remarked, ``Well, he got the queen part right. I am a
diva.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which might explain why Ms. Brazile seemed so genuinely
unfazed by the problems facing Al Gore's presidential campaign. She
knows about coming back.
</P>
<P>
   And if her candidate's bio was perhaps a little thin in the
overcoming adversity department, hers was full to bursting. Her
father, she noted, was wounded in the Korean War, run over by an
18-wheeler, had his back broken when he was hit by a crane, and
after suffering a heart attack on a bus, got off and checked
himself into a hospital. Yet he was still around to remark of her
recent promotion: ``Gift from God, Donna, but also another job.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Kenner, La., outside New Orleans and ``across two train
tracks, that's how poor we were,'' just a block from the
Mississippi River, Ms. Brazile said she grew up praying hurricanes
away, because her family didn't have the money for a new roof.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Lionel, worked mostly as a janitor, usually holding
more than one job, and her mother was up every morning early enough
to straighten her six daughters' hair before she had to leave to go
clean house.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Ms. Brazile herself rose at 5:30 a.m. to read the
newspaper to her grandmother, who she said ``gave me a thirst for
knowledge.'' While she was at it, she clipped coupons.
</P>
<P>
   And at a young age, got interested in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom used to call me Nosy Nancy, always sticking my nose
into grown folks' business.'' When she was 9, she heard that a City
Coandidate had promised to pave their roads, improve their
schools and _ this is important _ get a playground built in their
neighborhood, so she became a junior volunteer in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I organized all the kids, and told them that if he won, we'd
get a playground. Which we did. So that was my first job in
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Louisiana State University, she was hired
by Coretta Scott King to help organize a 20th-anniversary
reenactment of Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she worked for the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who she said
taught her to make a proper entrance by arriving late, and Rep.
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., to whom she pledged eternal gratitude
because ``he asked me what I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   As she prepares to turn 40, this was supposed to be the year
that Ms. Brazile also got a personal life. ``I was going to buy
myself a Jeep, have a relationship that lasted more than two weeks
_ usually it's two weeks and you bore the hell out of me _ and lose
weight. I had it all in my diary.''
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, she heard that the vice president would be
dropping by headquarters to address the troops, and Ms. Brazile
decided to make one of her patented entrances by arriving late.
Stepping off the elevator, the first thing she heard was a gaggle
of colleagues yelling, ``Donna! Donna! And I'm like, `Oooooh,
drama!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gore wanted to see her privately, and assuming she was about to
be fired, Ms. Brazile was already planning a vacation. ``When
you've already been fired once, the thrill is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gore elevated her to campaign manager from political
director and announced a shake-up that included relocating his
entire campaign to Nashville from Washington. She called a
subsequent briefing on the state of the campaign ``a tour of
Goreworld that made me lose my appetite; my lunch is in the trash
over there.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said she was taking the job because she believed that Al
Gore was the only candidate who really cared about making life
better for Americans left behind by the bull market, uninsured
domestic workers like her mother. Having grown up poor and on a
budget, Ms. Brazile said, will make cutting campaign spending no
big thing.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Coelho, Gore's campaign chairman, called her the best
grass-roots organizer around and if it was a shake-up that Gore
wanted, then Ms. Brazile seemed wildly qualified.

   GALLUP, N.M. _ They are old men now, drifting into town in their
boots, blue jeans and silver belt buckles. Like other aging
veterans of World War II, they meet once a month on Saturday
mornings for a blend of poignant and prosaic duties: planning
parades, disbursing money for the funeral expenses of one old
comrade and a small scholarship for the son of another, and
reviewing the coffee budget, which is $21.69 this month.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 50 years ago, the 15 men in the Chamber of
Commerce hall by the railroad tracks here were young U.S. Marines
who fought fiercely for the flag of a country that had given their
people nothing but grief. And the embroidery on the battered red
and yellow caps covering their grizzled heads and tanned faces
proclaims their proud name: Navajo Code Talkers.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the toughest battles of the South Pacific, 400 of
these men _ most of them barely out of high school on the
reservation just north of here, part of it in New Mexico and part
in Arizona _ transmitted thousands of radio messages in a code
based on their intricate and unwritten language, in which fighter
planes became ``hummingbirds,'' dive bombers ``chicken hawks'' and
submarines ``iron fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Japanese repeatedly broke other American military
codes, they never came close to cracking the Navajos', which
remains one of the handful of codes in military history that were
never deciphered.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Navajos' secret was considered so valuable that it
was kept classified until 1968. And their singular contribution to
the wartime efforts of what has been called ``the greatest
generation'' went largely unheralded. Fewer than half the code
talkers are still alive. But suddenly, it seems, their story is
popping up everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It was the subject of a recent documentary on television's
History Channel. It is celebrated in ``The Code Book'' (Doubleday,
1999), Simon Singh's history of cryptography. The Smithsonian
Institution has asked for help in putting together a display about
the code talkers in its new museum of Indian history on the Mall in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Not one but two Hollywood films are in the works. One is being
developed in cooperation with the code talkers by a group of Native
American filmmakers and Gale Anne Hurd, the producer of the
``Terminator'' movies and ``Armageddon.'' The other is being
developed by John Woo, the action-adventure director from Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that they've seen these documents, everyone wants to
interview code talkers,'' said Samuel Billison, president of the
Navajo Code Talkers Association and a member of his tribe's
governing council, who fought at Iwo Jima. ``There's a lot of
interest, and not just in the United States. I just got a call from
Italy the other day.''
</P>
<P>
   The code talkers' achievements are the stuff of high drama.
Their work was the brainchild of Philip Johnston, a World War I
veteran and engineer who had grown up as the son of missionaries on
the Navajo reservation and learned the language as a child. In
1942, he persuaded Marine officers in San Diego to test the idea,
and after a period of bureaucratic indecision, 29 initial recruits
were inducted and began training.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the idea was not simply to transmit messages
in Navajo, a singsong and subtly inflected descendant of northern
Asian languages that is easily susceptible to mispronunciation, but
to create a unique code based on Navajo words. Military terminology
created a special challenge; hence the avian equivalents for
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   To enable other words (``Guadalcanal,'' for example) to be
spelled out, each letter of the English alphabet was assigned a
Navajo equivalent (``a'' was ``ant,'' or ``wol-la-chee''). To keep
the Japanese from deciphering the code by analyzing the frequency
of common letters like ``e,'' alternative words representing the
same letter were added to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   The system worked beautifully. In the first 48 hours of the
bloody battle of Iwo Jima alone, Navajos sent and decoded 800
messages without a single error. The presence of the Indian
Marines, some of whom looked and sounded decidedly Asian, in the
Pacific Theater caused some complications; more than once, code
talkers were briefly mistaken for Japanese soldiers by their
American comrades.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the similarities had almost comic consequences, as
when Paul H. Blatchford, a code talker from Fort Defiance, Ariz.,
was mistaken for Japanese by an enemy soldier who heard him on the
radio in Iwo Jima.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Where are you from?''' recalled Blatchford, an
electrical engineer who at 82 is the oldest surviving code talker.
``He said, `Talk English,' and he thought we were Japanese. One of
my buddies heard me and he said, `What the hell are you talking
about?' I lied and told the Japanese guy that the Japanese
artillery was not hitting our guns, and said, `Tell your guy to
move about 15 degrees to the east.'''
</P>
<P>
   The war was a transforming experience for men like Blatchford
and like Billison, who came home and went to school on the G.I.
Bill of Rights, ultimately earning a doctorate in school
administration from the University of Arizona and spending 30 years
as a teacher and administrator in public and Indian schools.
</P>
<P>
   But postwar life was not easy for everyone, and today the code
talkers got the news that one of the original 29 recruits, Alfred
Leonard, had recently died in Seattle without enough money to have
his body shipped back to the reservation for burial.
</P>
<P>
   So the association wrote a check for $467 (which reduced its
general fund balance to an even $2,000), collected another $90 in
cash in a baseball cap passed around the table, and gave it all to
Leonard's nephew. Later, a $500 scholarship grant to help the son
of a member attend vocational school in Albuquerque depleted their
shoestring balance still further.
</P>
<P>
   Another code talker, John Brown, expressed soft-spoken alarm at
recent statements by New Mexico's Republican governor, Gary E.
Johnson, questioning the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts
against drugs and floating the notion of decriminalizing, or even
legalizing, drugs so they could be regulated like alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be an appropriate time to defend our Navajo
youths and other youths against some of this publicity,'' Brown
said before the group passed a unanimous resolution deploring the
governor's comments. ``He's got some bad advice for the
youngsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the association was formed in 1971, code talkers have
marched in parades from presidential inaugurals to the Tournament
of Roses _ though these days, more ride than walk. President Ronald
Reagan designated Aug. 14 Navajo Code Talkers Day in 1982, and
members of the group regularly appear before school and veterans'
groups to tell their story. But their wartime experiences also
remain painful and private for many of the veterans, and when
Sunday's meeting ended, most scattered quietly, declining to stop
and talk with a visiting reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Billison said some members are wary of having their story
exploited without compensation, and he pointed to one of the
Hollywood proposals as a prime example. Woo, the action director,
is reportedly trying to persuade Nicolas Cage, who was in Woo's hit
movie ``Face/Off,'' to star in ``Windtalkers,'' the story of a code
talker and his Marine bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, the Navajos had bodyguards charged with
protecting them from capture by the Japanese, with standing orders
to kill them if necessary to protect the code, though none ever had
to. Cage would play a bodyguard assigned to a code talker.
</P>
<P>
   But Billison thinks that is a backward way to tell the story,
and he has drafted a letter asking Cage not to take the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to reconsider,'' he said, ``for the dignity of the
Navajo.''

AMERICANS ALARMED OVER EUROPEAN UNION'S DEFENSE PLAN
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ A plan to create a defense arm for the
15-nation European Union is stirring fears among American civilian
and military officials in NATO about unnecessary replication the
allies can ill afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is in the European court, but it could be a lively
period,'' said one senior NATO diplomat, making clear that the
United States is looking to the allies to keep commitments to
modernize and streamline the forces they earmark for NATO rather
than to create duplicate structures.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Solana, who stepped down as NATO's secretary-general on
Oct. 6 and will take up a new job as the European Union's first
coordinator for foreign and security policy later in October, said,
``Duplication is the last thing we should do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be silly, and it's only a danger if people are not
sensible,'' Solana said. ``What we should aim for is the basis of a
new equilibrium between Europe and the United States and Canada,
and I think it would be a mistake not to be careful with our
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   European Union leaders decided in Cologne, Germany, in June to
take concrete steps by the end of next year to build up a capacity
for ``autonomous action, backed up by credible military forces'' in
future regional crises like those in Kosovo and Bosnia, even if
their biggest NATO ally, the United States, decided to stay out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cologne decisions did create some concern in Washington,''
a senior NATO diplomat said. High-ranking American military
officers have also expressed concern about a French plan for a
European general staff and a council of 15 European Union
ambassadors, which some diplomats thought was intended to keep
Solana from making European defense policy more deferential to NATO
than the French would like.
</P>
<P>
   A French ``action plan'' that President Jacques Chirac sent at
the end of July to the other European Union countries, including
four that do not belong to NATO, proposed both civilian and
military standing committees for a new European defense system. The
plan also called for ``a European military staff progressively
organized to assume the triple functions of oversight, analysis and
planning.''
</P>
<P>
   American ears pricked up at this news. ``We're somewhat
skeptical when we hear about a need for a separate European command
structure,'' a senior NATO official said. But diplomats and defense
experts here say that many of the other allies do not like the
French plan either, and it has not been adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our partners hate it,'' said Francois Heisbourg, a former
adviser to the French Defense Ministry who often writes about
military affairs. But, he added, ``It is unacceptable for Europeans
to be spending 60 percent as much as Americans spend on defense but
getting in return only a small fraction of the defense capability
the Americans get for their money.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants the European allies to carry out a
``defense capabilities initiative'' within NATO to reshape the
alliance's fighting forces, some still designed to defend home
territory from the now nonexistent threat of foreign invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the new NATO policy is to make all allied armies
rapidly deployable to crisis areas on the periphery of Europe, like
Bosnia and Kosovo, and to equip them with the kind of sophisticated
intelligence-gathering and battlefield information systems that,
along with precision-guided munitions, the United States used
during the bombing of Kosovo last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Allied defense ministers, some smarting from comparisons of
European and American contributions to the Kosovo campaign that
found Europe far behind in the most sophisticated technologies,
adopted the plan in September. It is far from clear that the
Europeans are prepared to spend the enormous sums necessary to
carry it out.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Germany, with the biggest armed forces of any European ally,
would need up to $22 billion during the next 10 years to adapt its
forces, Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping says, but Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder is asking him to cut $10 billion from the
military budget by 2003 instead.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said he thinks that Europeans generally should try to
achieve ``more added value in better coordination and
implementation of defense pol' which is the broad purpose of
his new job.
</P>
<P>
   Another key European Union official, Christopher Patten of Great
Britain, the organization's new commissioner for external affairs,
also said that American anxieties about Europe's new defense thrust
were misplaced. During an interview in his office here, Patten said
that he and Solana would be ``playing at different ends of the
keyboard, but, I hope, playing the same tune.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is to make sure the European voice is
heard at the same strong decibel level as when the European Union
speaks as the world's biggest trade bloc and the biggest foreign
aid donor,'' Patten said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo has made us think, and so it should, about how to
coordinate research and development, about the European armaments
industry, and our spending priorities, but it also makes us think
about other areas where we could also be coherent, such as conflict
management, peacekeeping and conflict resolution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Increased cooperation among the member countries on defense,
Patten said, could only strengthen the European component of the
alliance, not weaken it. ``I don't think the debate will be
resolved anywhere else but within NATO,'' he added.

 WASHINGTON: presidential restraint.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But wasn't the move to Nashville just a gimmick, just a piece of
tactical repackaging like Bob Dole's decision four years ago to
quit the Senate? And didn't it smack of panic? Some may see it that
way, Gore acknowledged. But he said that for him it was ``a move
into a much more comfortable situation, a liberating move that will
let me be me, and it will also insure that none of the people with
a halfhearted commitment to my campaign will remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is true, he wisecracks with reporters, but if they reach
for their pens, Gore is quick to say, ``Don't use that.'' Clearly,
he still worries about how he and his office will look in print.
Now, it is true, he appeals with real intensity for the support of
those who are listening to him. In a house in Manchester, N.H.,
last week, his appeal was so fervent _ ``You will decide here in
New Hampshire who will be the next president'' _ that a lawyer in
the crowd said that he had to remind himself that this was October
1999, and not February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Gore took pot-shots at George W. Bush, the
most likely Republican presidential nominee, noting tartly that the
Texas governor was prescribing for national education when his own
state ranks 45th of 50 in SAT scores. And Gore encourages
surrogates to go after Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   At the Columbia County, N.Y., farm of state Attorney General
Eliot Spitzer, Spitzer warmed up the crowd by calling Bradley a
quitter.
</P>
<P>
   He compared Bradley's decision to leave the Senate to that of a
basketball player who tells the coach at half-time of a hard-fought
game, ``I'm quitting. I'm tired. I don't want to fight.'' Who do
you want as captain, Spitzer asked, ``the guy who quit, who ran,
who didn't know how to fight, or Al Gore?''
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday night Gore was saying much the same things.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is something unintense about the intensity. Gore says
again and again, ``I care passionately about this,'' but he does
not speak with much passion about the subject in question. He talks
about the poverty from which his parents sprang, but he does not
talk much about poverty today, except in broad generalities.
</P>
<P>
   What he does is propose sweeping new federal programs to help
the disabled, the sick, the poor and other needy groups. He pledged
in Manchester, for example, to bring about ``the largest increase
in special education ever,'' which he later conceded would cost
billions of dollars. Clinton's much-heralded declaration that ``the
era of big government is over'' seemed long ago and far away.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's only right that it came down to this.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Braves have duked it out in the National League
East all season long, so perhaps they should determine who will
represent the league in the World Series. This passionate rivalry
commanded baseball's imagination in the last two weeks of the
season. It's only fitting that it will do the same in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way it should be,'' Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone
said. ``The Big Apple and the South. We've all felt all along
they're a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are back from near extinction, a tough road they hold
the Braves responsible for after they lost five of six to Atlanta
in the last 10 days of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets won the wildcard by winning their last three games of
the regular season and a one-game playoff against the Reds for
their first trip to the postseason since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Outspoken Mets manager Bobby Valentine said after his team's
Division Series victory against Arizona that he thinks the Braves
counted them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see what it's all about in the championship
series,'' Valentine said. ``I'm the guy with the big mouth, but
they're the ones playing the ghosts.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves are not surprised to see the Mets in the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a great team,'' John Smoltz said. ``I couldn't believe
the flak they were getting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have won nine of 12 games against New York and all
four series this season. But that doesn't make the Braves feel
secure, especially given the way the Mets are playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they made it as a wild-card team, I knew their momentum
would carry over,'' Brian Jordan said. ``It's going to be
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   If the last two series of the regular season were any
indication, that's an understatement. The Braves will host the Mets
at Turner Field for Games 1 and 2 Tuesday and Wednesday and then
head back to Shea Stadium for Games 3, 4 and 5 during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get the worst reception you can think of,''
Smoltz said. ``We've played the Yankees. We're going to get the
same treatment at Shea. They're going to try to dominate us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves are feeling a little tingle of destiny
themselves, after bouncing back from a Game 1 loss to take three
from the Astros in the Division Series, including the exciting Game
3 in 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we're not ready for it to end,'' Smoltz said.
``We're not ready for the magic to end.''

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ With eastern Mexico awash in brackish waters from
the region's worst flooding in decades, opposition politicians have
charged in to fan citizen anger. They said that the disaster had
been caused by government negligence and that relief efforts had
been sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of soldiers, sailors and civilian relief crews pulled
more bodies from lagoons, canals and swamps of Gulf Coast mud
Sunday after dozens of rivers, swelled by 10 days of heavy tropical
rains, overwhelmed hundreds of villages.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding washed out scores of highways and bridges, and
several communities were reported to remain cut off from outside
help.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the government Sunday put the official
death toll at 314. Unofficial tallies compiled by Mexican news
agencies put the dead at more than 400, with some estimates
reaching 600.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry reported death and destruction in a
coastal strip extending 500 miles along the southeastward curve of
the Gulf Coast, from northern Veracruz and Hidalgo into Puebla and
south to Tabasco. About 200,000 people are homeless, the ministry
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Miguel Aleman of Veracruz said he doubted that there
had been a more sweeping disaster in his state in the last 400
years.
</P>
<P>
   The flood waters, which began to overflow a few causeways early
last week but swelled suddenly into a regional calamity as rains
from a tropical depression continued, appeared to have caught the
federal authorities by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   But by the weekend, 10,000 soldiers and sailors and hundreds of
other officials from nine Cabinet ministries were cranking up an
ambitious relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   The rising death toll made the calamity the worst that President
Ernesto Zedillo has experienced since he took office in 1994,
surpassing the hundreds killed in the states of Oaxaca and Guerrero
by Hurricane Pauline in 1997 and during devastating floods last
year in southern Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential candidates of the two main opposition parties
and even one candidate from the president's own party accused the
government of contributing to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   During helicopter and walking tours through communities in
Veracruz on Friday and Saturday, Zedillo heard calls from flood
victims for shipments of food, fresh water and other aid. On
Saturday in the town of Poza Rica in Veracruz, he encountered
crowds grumbling over the tardiness of government relief, said
David Najera, an aide to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some hard exchanges,'' Najera said. ``The people
were angry and they were looking for help. And they wanted the
president to ignore the mud and walk through their neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo waded knee-deep into the riverside muck that had poured
through dozens of homes so he could hear one woman's story at first
hand. Many in the bedraggled throng applauded that, Najera said.
``The people weren't angry at the president but at the government
in general, because they needed drinking water and none had
arrived,'' Najera said.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents accused government officials of opening the
sluice gates of regional dams to protect government-owned equipment
from being damaged by the the waters, greatly increasing the
destruction to private homes and businesses downriver.
</P>
<P>
   But Zedillo and the director of the National Water Commission
denied those reports. Many of the dams in question do not even have
sluice gates, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo flew back to the capital on Saturday night, his clothes
splattered with mud, in a presidential plane reeking of slime. He
rested Sunday but has tentatively scheduled a new tour of the
disaster zone for Monday, Najera said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One vivid incident on Friday, when Zedillo toured a devastated
neighborhood in the coastal town of Gutierrez Zamora in Veracruz,
received widespread news coverage and provoked criticism from
opposition politicians.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, a crowd of citizens surrounded the president,
demanding that the government quicken the flow of water, food and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   One primary school teacher, Leonardo de Luna Martinez,
questioned Zedillo so loudly and insistently about how the
government would deal with local merchants who speculated with food
prices during the disaster that the president finally shouted back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shut up and let me talk!'' said Zedillo. ``I'm the president
of the republic!''
</P>
<P>
   Abashed at the presidential tongue-lashing, de Luna moved to the
rear of the crowd, witnesses said. He later apologized to the
president for appearing to heckle him and received a presidential
apology in return, Najera said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Reforma reported Sunday that de Luna later said he
considered Zedillo ``an authority who respects freedom of
expression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel proud that the president scolded me,'' the paper quoted
de Luna as saying.
</P>
<P>
   But Vicente Fox Quesada, the presidential candidate of the
center-right National Action Party, called Zedillo's outburst of
irritation with de Luna ``a lamentable attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm president, I'm not going to be like Zedillo and get
mad at the people,'' Fox said. Zedillo ``should have kept the dams,
waterways and reservoirs better maintained, and he should have
established a national disaster fund. Now when the disasters come,
he walks around very remorseful and paternalistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who did not visit the disaster zone, made his comments to
reporters in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential candidate of the
center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution, lashed out at
Zedillo and his predecessors from the long-governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party for cutting money for social programs,
including the maintenance of riverside dikes and drainage systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cases like these, they should have carried out engineering
projects to help prevent this kind of flooding,'' Cardenas told
local reporters during a campaign tour in Oaxaca.
</P>
<P>
   Several other politicians, including Roberto Madrazo Pintado, a
presidential candidate from Zedillo's party, weighed in with
similar criticism of the government's handling of the floods.
</P>
<P>
   But Najera said, ``The president is just doing his best to
attend to the situation, and he's not going to get into a political

VALENTINE PREPARES HIS GHOSTS TO RESPOND TO THE TALKATIVE BRAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the Mets clinched a trip to the National League
Championship Series, Bobby Valentine spoke of the ghosts the
Atlanta Braves would face: a Mets' team that Chipper Jones mocked
less than two weeks ago but which has risen from the ashes of its
self-immolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were supposed to be dead, right?'' Valentine asked as he
searched for a full bottle of champagne in the Mets' clubhouse last
Saturday afternoon. ``Our fans were supposed to change gear.
They're supposed to be watching football.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just three weeks ago _ it seems at least three months _
that the Mets made their fateful trip to Atlanta, beginning an
odyssey of despair that nearly detoured them from the playoffs, of
which they are now the darling. The Yankee caps are still in the
closets, defying the biting suggestion of Jones _ who rained home
runs on the Mets as the Braves beat them in five of six games in 10
days _ that the Mets' fans might as well switch allegiances to the
Yankees because their team's season was over.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in preparation for Game 1 Tuesday night, Valentine
engaged in a bit of trash-talking, essentially telling Jones: In
your face, pal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't personal with me, it was personal with anybody
associated with the Mets, the fans and players alike,'' Valentine
said of Jones' remarks. ``It was a premature statement and an
incorrect statement. I think he was very confident he wouldn't have
to deal with the fans again this year. Guess what, he's going to
have to deal with them again this year.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more. Valentine raced on, conjuring images of slights
by the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we really love the Braves,'' Valentine said
sarcastically. ``They have nothing but our love and admiration. I
see no reason that we should have any affection for them. We have
great respect for them. I think we still have to earn our respect.
They've shown us very little. There's been a lot of comments. If
the comments and actions they've made over the years were in New
York, as a New York team, they'd be well known and documented. A
lot has slipped by.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for an example, he said: ``I don't want to get into
specifics. We know it and those who have been watching know it.
We'll just go on to earn our respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The enmity between the Braves and Mets is actually
well-documented, and it was heightened in the last few weeks of the
season by flippant remarks from Jones, reliever John Rocker _ who
announced his hatred of all things New York _ and Valentine
himself. When asked about his manager-of-the-year vote, Valentine
said it would go to Braves Manager Bobby Cox ``because he had to
manage this year.''
</P>
<P>
   While these teams poke each other in the eyes, though, the fact
remains that the Mets were a miserable 3-9 against the Braves this
season. Their final six meetings were particularly abysmal,
bracketing the miserable streak that left them two games behind in
the wild-card race with three to play. The Mets inexplicably beat
up on Greg Maddux in their lone victory, scoring nine runs, but
they scored a total of 12 runs in the five losses. For futility, it
was hard to top the heart of the lineup. Robin Ventura went 4 for
23 (.174), Edgardo Alfonzo was 4 for 25 (.160) and John Olerud was
3 for 26 (.115). Only Mike Piazza held fast to his average, batting
.304 (7 for 23).
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the Mets are riding a wave of good feeling from
their recovery in the season's final weekend and their 3-games-to-1
elimination of Arizona in the division series. After Saturday's 4-3
victory over the Diamondbacks, Valentine was maniacally hugging the
same players he had said were not too smart or professional in a
magazine interview last week. And they are convinced that things
will be different this time in Atlanta. With the slight bit of
swagger that comes from beating Randy Johnson and dismissing a team
that had 100 regular-season victories, the Mets figure that they
are the loosest _ and hence, most dangerous _ team left in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Steve Phillips said before the Mets made the
playoffs that the minimum goal at the start of spring training had
been to get to the postseason. By that standard _ by any standard,
really _ their race into the NLCS has been a raging success,
especially in light of how close they came to letting the Braves
destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've tried too hard against them,'' Phillips said.
``We pressed a little bit. I think we'll go in as loose as we
could, compared to any point in the year. They've handed it to us
all year and they're supposed to do it again. But it feels
different. The pressure was on then to get them. Now we're going in
with nothing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The players have been more sanguine. In the glee of their
champagne-scented celebration, they were careful with their words,
pointing out the Braves' extraordinary success, giving deference to
the Braves' domination of them this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been the situation all decade that you had to go
through Atlanta,'' Al Leiter said. ``For the most part, they've had
our number. Now, it's the ultimate challenge for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was having none of it. Jones has cooled off since the
Mets left town, and he batted .231 against Houston in the division
series with one run batted in and no extra-base hits. But he still
haunts Mets fans, who remember the September home runs and who
wonder, still, if it's really necessary to pitch to the probable
most valuable player in the National League. Valentine had one
zinger left, and he was going to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't thin playing against Chipper Jones,'' Valentine
said. ``I saw the last series and I saw the series at the end of
the year and I didn't see Chipper doing all the damage and I saw
people pitching to him and getting him out. I don't think he's
going to be as magical ever again as he was in that one series. I
don't think anybody could be.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A SUBWAY SERIES HAS BEEN ON TRACK SINCE 1921 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If it's not too early to dream about a Subway Series,
as every Noo Yawker worth a MetroCard is doing, it's not too early
to remember what a Subway Series was really like _ all 13.
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers attended the last one in 1956 when Don Larsen pitched
a perfect game against the Brooklyn Dodgers at Yankee Stadium, but
hardly a man is now alive who saw the first one in 1921 when the
Giants were the Yankees' landlord at the Polo Grounds in upper
Manhattan where an apartment complex now rises.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the Yankees won 10, the Giants two, the Dodgers one as
Subway Series names defined much of New York baseball, for better
or for worse:
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Tommy
Henrich, Joe Page, Billy Martin, Don Larsen for the Yankees; Frank
Frisch, Carl Hubbell and Eddie Stanky for the Giants; Mickey Owen,
Hugh Casey, Jackie Robinson, Harry (Cookie) Lavagetto, Al
Gionfriddo, Johnny Podres and Sandy Amoros for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   And as both a Giants center fielder and a Yankee manager, Casey
Stengel.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the term Subway Series would have been a
misnomer. In 1921 there wasn't a subway stop, as such, beneath the
Polo Grounds, but an elevated line extended to Eighth Avenue at
West 157th Street ouhe center-field bleachers and Giants'
offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had played on that site since 1891, and in 1913 the
Yankees moved there. After the Yankees acquired Babe Ruth from the
Boston Red Sox in 1920 and soon were outdrawing the Giants, John
McGraw, the Giants' manager, evicted the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Needing their own ball park, the Yankees built Yankee Stadium,
which opened in 1923 after they had lost the first two Subway
Series to the Giants with all of the games at the Polo Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1921, the Yankees had a 3-2 lead after Game 5, but with the
Babe suddenly out with a bad knee and an infected arm, the Giants
won three straight in the last five-of-nine Series.
</P>
<P>
   In 1922, the Giants, sparked by Frisch, swept as the Babe batted
.118 with no homers. In 1923, with the opener at the new Yankee
Stadium in the Bronx across the Harlem River, he hit three homers
as the Yankees won their first of 24 World Series championships.
</P>
<P>
   Stengel, then the Giants' center fielder, hit two memorable
homers in that 1923 duel _ hobbling on a loose shoe on an
inside-the-park drive to left center at the Stadium, and later
thumbing his nose at the Yankee dugout as he trotted around third
base.
</P>
<P>
   From 1936 through 1956, the Yankees would win 9 of 10 Subway
Series, losing only to the Dodgers in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, DiMaggio's rookie season, the Yankees pummeled the
Giants, 18-4 in Game 2 and 13-5 in the Game 6 finale, both at the
Polo Grounds. In 1937, they routed Hubbell, then baseball's best
left-hander, with a 7-run sixth inning in the 8-1 opener at the
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, the Dodgers momentarily appeared to have squared the
Series at 2-2 when Henrich swung and missed a third strike, but
Casey's curveball skidded past Owen. Henrich ran to first before
the Dodger catcher's throw got there. The game wasn't over.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio singled. Charlie Keller doubled. Bill Dickey walked.
Joe Gordon doubled. The Yankees won, 7-4, and according to Flatbush
lore, a man with a dog on his lap tossed the dog out a nearby open
window.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, Yankee right-hander Floyd (Bill) Bevens had a no-hitter
with two out in the ninth at Ebbets Field in Game 4, but with
Gionfriddo and Eddie Miksis, pinch-running for teammates who had
walked, on base, Lavagetto doubled for a stunning 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 6, Gionfriddo raced to the left-field bullpen at the
Stadium to snatch a home run away from DiMaggio, who in a rare
display of emotion kicked the dirt near second base. In Game 7,
five shutout relief innings by Page preserved another tray of
Yankee rings.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1949 opener, Stengel's first as Yankee manager, Henrich
led off the ninth with a homer off Don Newcombe for a 1-0 victory.
Preacher Roe blanked the Yankees, 1-0, the next day for the only
Dodger victory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, the Giants were in a Subway Series for the last time.
Stanky kicked the ball out Phil Rizzuto's glove, but the Yankees
won in six. DiMaggio hit his last home run (at the Polo Grounds)
and Mantle, then a rookie, twisted a knee in a Stadium outfield
drain.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees frustrated the Dodgers again in 1952 when Martin
sprinted to catch Robinson's bases-loaded pop fly that first
baseman Joe Collins had lost in the sun, and in 1953 when Martin
batted .500 on 12 hits for manager Stengel's record fifth
consecutive title.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 Amoros made the catch near the left-field foul line at
the Stadium for the double play that preserved Podres' 2-0 shutout
in Game 7 for the Dodgers' only Series triumph representing
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The next year Larsen's perfect game in Game 5 upstaged Yogi
Berra's two homers off Newcombe that ignited a 9-0 rout in Game 7
at Ebbets Field. Two years later the Dodgers and Giants were ifornia; six years later the expansion Mets had adopted a blend
of ancestral colors _ Dodgers' blue and Giants' orange.
</P>
<P>
   And now, together in the post-season for the first time, the
Mets and Yankees eawithin four championship series victories
of a Subway Series. Get your MetroCard here!

 &HT;    Conversion to metric system still inching along
 &HT;    By Sonja Isger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A bunch of space engineers sent the Mars
Climate Orbiter to a fiery demise earlier this month because they
gave the $125 million contraption bad directions. The engineers
plotting its path used kilometers, meters and the like. Another
group of scientists fed them information about how fast the craft
should go using miles, yards and inches ... and someone failed to
convert.
</P>
<P>
   Can you hear their third-grade teachers now, clucking their
tongues in a collective I-told-you-so loud enough to rattle
launchpads across the country?
</P>
<P>
   ``Learn metric or else.'' That was their mantra, particularly in
the 1970s when the metric push was most visible. ``Learn it now,
because when you grow up, they won't use pounds and inches.''
</P>
<P>
   They had the U.S. government's word on it. More than once, but
most recently in 1988, the government has declared the metric
system ``the preferred system of measure in the U.S.'' It is the
system we are supposed to use in commerce and trade and the one our
scientists use. (It was NASA's engineers who used metric during the
Mars debacle; the contractor used English measure.)
</P>
<P>
   But today, the rush toward metric has slowed to a creep. We buy
cola by the liter but rain still falls in inches. We measure the
size of a car's engine in liters, but fill the gas tank by the
gallon. Our athletes race by the meter, but a long jumper's mark is
counted off in feet and inches.
</P>
<P>
   Industry has probably come the farthest toward conversion, said
Lorelle Young, president of the nonprofit U.S. Metric Association.
Prompted by a more global economy, businesses have retooled their
factories so that the widgets they make here can work with widgets
made in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the classroom, teachers have dropped the doomsday speech.
But Florida's standards and statewide exams such as the FCAT
continue to strap teachers with teaching two systems _ a method
that one researcher says wastes hundreds of days in math class.
</P>
<P>
   The students at Poinciana Elementary, a science, math and
technology magnet in Boynton Beach, don't begin with inches or
centimeters, they begin with paper clips.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might use them to measure their desk tops,'' said math
resource teacher Nancy Higgins. They'll talk about how whatever
units you want to use, the unit has to be the same size for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Which then brings them to the book ``How big is a foot?,'' a
clever tale of a king who wants to have a bed made for his queen
and must find a way to describe the dimensions to an apprentice
carpenter. The king chooses his big foot, but when the apprentice
uses his much smaller foot ... voila, the bed is too small. To
resolve the disparity, the king has a cast of his foot made and it
becomes the standard measure of the kingdom. (Indeed, body parts
are the base of what became the English system of measure.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we explain it was pretty arbitrary to have a foot as a
standard of measure,'' Higgins said. From there they learn about
the less arbitrary metric system, that unlike its English
counterpart is neatly broken into units of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Across the district, similar lessons abound. District elementary
and middle school teachers say they set aside between three and six
weeks to cover both systems and let kids work in each.
</P>
<P>
   Carver Middle in Delray Beach is one of several schools to host
a metric Olympics where students fling a paper-plate discus or lob
a cotton ball shot put, each time estimating and then measuring
their efforts metrically.
</P>
<P>
   And most students embrace metric.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much easier,'' said Middle School of the Arts math
department Chair Cheryl Gobel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask people how many cups are in a quart, see how many
answers you get,'' said the metric association's Young.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a researcher with the Americanutes for Research
in Washington concluded that if teachers had to teach only one
system _ metric _ between 75 and 201 days of math would be cleared
for something else. First, because teachers wouldn't have to
duplicate lessons and second because metric is mathematically less
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   By high school, most text books and teachers do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use nothing but metric in high school science,'' said
Atlantic High biology teacher Fred Hock. ``If they do something in
inches, we make them do it again, because in science, metric is
basically universal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Students grasp the concept very well, but like any other
concept, if they don't use it, they lose it,'' said Theresa
Newkirk, math resource teacher at Belvedere Elementary in West Palm
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts outside the classroom haven't exactly made metric
inroads. It seems every time there's a national step to move toward
conversion, a step backward is soon to follow.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, the U.S. Metric Board, which was supposed to oversee a
conversion called for in 1975, was disbanded to save money.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Florida legislators thought they'd move ahead of the
curve, erecting dual speed limit signs that announced 55 mph and 80
km. But they came down a year later, and the national push to
convert every sign by 1996 died in 1994 after more than 2,200
people wrote the highway administration opposing the plan. The
biggest gripe: the estimated $200 million price tag nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as educators prepare for National Metric Week this week,
the students in Claire Greene's fourth-grade class at Poinciana
Elementary wonder what's wrong with all the grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all astounded when the Mars thing blew up because of
the mix-up between the different units. They couldn't believe it. I
said, `You kids could've done a better job.'''
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Post researcher Lynne Palombo contributed to this
report.

TROUBLE COMES IN DIFFERENT SIZES FOR COYOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Theo Fleury's style is that of a gnat, buzzing
through traffic in a general attempt to annoy, it is only natural
that Todd Harvey's approach has a little more sting. After all, the
6-foot, 200-pound Harvey is six inches taller and 20 pounds heavier
than his diminutive Rangers teammate.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleury sees similarities between his game and Harvey's: Both
are pests.
</P>
<P>
   And the Phoenix Coyotes seemed to be more concerned with Fleury
and Harvey than with anything else on the Madison Square Garden ice
Sunday afternoon, as the Rangers rallied for a 4-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're similar guys,'' Fleury said. ``We have to try to
play with emotion, play on the edge a little bit. When you play
like that, you walk a kind of tightrope. They want you to play that
way, but you can't take penalties. You have to play smart. And
that's something we both bring to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   hough he didn't score a point, Fleury _ who was stopped on
breakaways _ was his usual pesky self. And Harvey twice made plays
that changed the complexion of the game for the the Rangers
(2-2-1).
</P>
<P>
   As much as the Rangers will need production from Fleury, who has
one goal this season (despite putting 23 shots on goal thus far,
including seven in Sunday), they will also need Harvey to continue
to perform the way he did Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey outhustled Phoenix defenseman Todd Gill to a puck in the
corner, delivered an energizing hit on the Coyote and earned an
assist on Mike Knuble's goal at 12 minutes 33 seconds of the second
period. The goal tied the score at 1-1. It could also be argued
that Harvey deserved an assist on the game's deciding goal, even
though he was not directly involved in the play.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie Mike York scored at 7:04 of the final period to give
the Rangers a 3-1 lead. Skating on an odd-man rush, York took a
drop pass from Brian Leetch and drilled a slap shot from the top of
the left-wing circle that beat Phoenix goaltender Mikhail
Shtalenkov.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey set up the odd-man rush by engaging not one, but two
Coyotes in front of the Phoenix bench. While York was scoring,
Harvey could be seen arguing with the Coyotes' captain Keith
Tkachuk. The two were joined by Rick Tocchet, creating a situation
that interrupted a Phoenix line change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of ran into each other and a few words were
exchanged,'' Harvey said of his initial encounter with Tkachuk.
``And then Tocchet came in. I guess we had a man advantage, because
there were two of them and only one of me. I didn't see how the
goal scored. I knew the play was going on, but I didn't know what
was going on. I was concentrating on keeping my teeth in my
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Coach Bobby Francis said: ``Harvey floated the bait and
we chomped down on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleury admired the play of his teammates. ``On York's goal, Todd
was out on the edge,'' he said. ``But he pulls back, we score a
goal, and that's the difference in the hockey game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers Coach John Muckler boiled the difference down to one
word: emotion. And it was Fleury and Harvey who sparked it Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his teammates, Fleury had a productive first period.
</P>
<P>
   One moment he was yapping at Tkachuk and Tocchet, like a Jack
Russell terrier standing up to a pair of Great Danes. Another
moment Tkachuk was stuffing him into the Phoenix net.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleury's finest moment came midway through the period, when
he absorbed a crushing hit into the glass by Travis Green. Fleury
and Green came down together. When both got back on their skates,
Green was missing his helmet and his stick.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Graves who scored a third-period power-play goal to give
the Rangers a 2-1 lead _ skated in and pounced on Green in
retaliation. Shane Doan hurried over to join the scrum. Fleury
faked like he was going to hit Doan high, then, in a move out of
the Three Stooges, he stooped down and applied a low bridge. Doan
went flying and the Garden went wild. ``It was either that or get
cross-checked in the face,'' Fleury said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the referees are going to let him get away with theatrics
like that, he's going to be very successful here,'' Francis said,
fuming.
</P>
<P>
   And if other teams are going to let Fleury and Harvey get under
their skin, the Rangers could be very successful, too. &QL;

IN RUSSIAN POLITICS, MONOPOLY POWER-PLAYS SEEN AS PART OF THE GAME
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Even by Russian standards, last month's power play at
the top of Transneft, the country's fourth largest monopoly, was
unusually nasty. In the highly charged atmosphere of Russia's
yearlong election season, however, the battle was perhaps just the
most public example of the fight between political clans over
sources of power and money.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 14, the day after he was crudely and maybe illegally
ousted as the general director of Transneft, Russia's
state-controlled oil pipeline monopoly, Dmitri Savelyev was called
to an unusual meeting with Roman Abramovich, a young Russian oil
baron and close friend of President Boris N. Yeltsin's family.
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting in the coffee shop of the ritzy Baltschug
hotel, according to Savelyev, Abramovich gave the ousted executive
some blunt advice: give up and keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He suggested that I leave voluntarily; he said I was trying to
fight the system,'' Savelyev recalled in a recent interview. ``When
he understood I wouldn't agree, he said that there was no sense in
putting up a struggle. The result will be the same, but you will
harm yourself. Because there are lots of ways to force a person to
keep silence.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, as a phalanx of armed police officers surrounded
Transneft's Moscow headquarters, Savelyev's successor,
Vainshtok, assumed management of the state-controlled company,
which controls some 29,000 miles of pipeline linking Russia's oil
industry with domestic and foreign customers, and had a turnover in
1998 of $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For Yuliya Latynina, a Russian economic journalist who closely
tracks the intertwining of the country's business and politics, the
Transneft case is a harbinger of abrupt management changes pending
at several other government-controlled oil and gas companies _ the
country's real moneymaking concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite evident that certain groups are looking for
sources of cash for the campaign,'' she said, referring to the
December parliamentary and June presidential elections. ``There are
many guys who would like to have a nontransparent company in their
pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Latynina and others, the Kremlin's aggressive
political team already has set its sights on Rosneft and Slavneft,
two government-controlled oil companies. Some say that a fight over
control at Gazprom, Russia's giant gas company, may not be over.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, the experts say, is not only to gain access to cash,
but to use critically placed state companies to reward and punish
private companies and regional governors who have moved closer to
the Kremlin's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   As the tussle for power intensifies, such assumptions become
harder to prove. All sides engage in disinformation and
mudslinging, using newspapers and television stations, which _ with
rare exceptions _ serve the interests of competing media barons.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this endless arcane intrigues and a random sprinkling of
``kompromat,'' or compromising material, and you have a country in
the throes of ``fin de regime'' fever, where a struggle for power
is being waged without ideology, rules or scruples.
</P>
<P>
   ``The different clans are really fighting, but they are fighting
not for elections, but for more money,'' said Andrei Piontkovsky, a
political analyst. ``They understand that Yeltsin's time is ending,
and they are trying to get as much money as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoting a recent interview with Mikhail Khodorkovsky, another
Russian oil baron, Piontkovsky said, ``The only real business in
Russia is politics, and by that, he meant closeness to the
presidential family.''
</P>
<P>
   To some Western analysts, the pattern suggests that the fight
over state assets has not been checked by a wave of business
scandals that spread beyond Russia's borders, tarnishing the
reputations of its businessmen and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people hoped that with elections coming up, this was a
great chance to change the situation,'' said James Fenker, an
analyst at Troika Dialogue, a Moscow-based investment group. ``But
instead, it looks as though all those people who are fingered by
corruption haven't booked their tickets out.''
</P>
<P>
   The hostile takeover at Transneft, in which the government holds
75 percent of the shares, became notable mainly because it happened
in the open.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring Abramovich, Savelyev did not remain silent. Not only
has he taken his case to court, he has held a news conference and
gone on television, accusing those who fired him of flouting a law
that requires 45 days' notice for management changes at joint stock
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Various political figures came to Savelyev's defense, notably
Anatoly B. Chubais, the architect of Russia's privatization schemes
and now head of the country's electricity monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Savelyev, 31, was himself a political appointee, becoming head
of Transneft in the spring of 1998 at the behest of Sergei V.
Kiriyenko, a former business partner who was then prime minister.
He replaced a longtime director who is still under investigation
concerning the distribution of Transneft preferred shares to the
company's top management.
</P>
<P>
   Savelyev survived the eight-month government of Prime Minister
Yevgeny M. Primakov, but his fate became uncertain with the
appointment last spring of Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai Y.
Aksyonenko, who is widely believed to have the support of Yeltsin's
inner circle _ a tiny group made up of Yeltsin, his daughter,
Tatyana Dyachenko, the business mogul Boris A. Berezovsky and his
associate, Abramovich, who owns a major share in Sibneft, an oil
company that is one of Transneft's main customers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After an attempt to oust Savelyev backfired in June, Aksyonenko
and an ally, Viktor Kalyuzhny, the fuel and energy minister, moved
swiftly last month, acting when Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin
was out of the country. They simply summoned a smattering of
government representatives who sit on Transneft's board to vote
Savelyev out.
</P>
<P>
   Savelyev was informed of the decision on Sept. 13, and told
Aksyonenko he would leave only if proper legal procedures were
followed. The meeting with Abramovich, who holds no formal position
at Transneft, followed the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return to Moscow, Putin made no attempt to reverse the
changeover at Transneft.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to Savelyev, Aksyonenko ``did not even try to invent a
reason'' for his dismissal. After the fact, Kalyuzhny was quoted as
saying that the government was dissatisfied with the dividends from
and the lack of openness at Transneft.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Vainshtok, a former executive of a wholly owned
subsidiary of Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, declined to
speculate on why his predecessor had been removed. ``I have not
asked these questions,'' he said. ``I am a completely apolitical
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Vainshtok refuses to criticize the previous management. But in
the last week, several documents were leaked to newspapers and
television stations, indicating that on the day he was fired,
Savelyev transferred $700,000 from a Transneft account to a
personal account, purportedly to buy an apartment in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Savelyev responded that money for the purchase of an apartment
had been promised in his original contract, and that he did not
recall when the transfer was actually made. Now, he said, he has
already written a letter asking that the money be donated to an
orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   In Savelyev's view, the takeover at Transneft was not only
political but also commercial. He said certain oil companies,
including Lukoil and Sibneft, were trying to take control of a
company that is one of Russia's most vital public utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Savelyev agreed that scandal has surrounded the privatization of
Russia's oil industry, which began in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, at least certain rules were obeyed, ``people
talked about privatization, about investment projects and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today they simply discharge managers or heads of ministries
and appoint their own people,'' he said. ``The redistribution of
property is being carried out quietly. But in my case it was not so
quiet.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WARRICK LEAVES RACE FOR THE HEISMAN WIDE OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are a host of ways for players to get knocked out of the
running for the Heisman Trophy: season-ending injuries, the poor
record of a candidate's team, statistics that do not quite meet
standards set by opinion-makers, or a poor performance in a big
game.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's Peter Warrick may have introduced a new way last
week: felony arrest. Last Thursday, the all-American wide receiver
was arrested on a single charge of grand theft for his role in a
scheme to underpay for clothes at a Tallahassee, Fla., department
store.
</P>
<P>
   In the span of five days, he verbally dismissed a police
investigation on how he and a teammate allegedly bought $412.38 of
designer label clothing for $21.40 with this memorable defense:
``It's not like I killed the nt.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted he knew the transaction with a 19-year-old store
clerk was wrong, and Florida State suspended him indefinitely from
the football team. Last Saturday, he apologized on national
television and watched from the sideline as his teammates outlasted
rival Miami, 31-21.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it was a rather eventful week for the dazzling pass
catcher who had been the Heisman Trophy front runner. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Warrick's immediate football fate is in the hands of the
Florida justice system, his university and his coach, Bobby Bowden.
Warrick's lawyer, John Kenny, said he would try to expedite the
legal process _ normally it would take at least six weeks to go to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's athletic director, Dave Hart, said, ``The door
certainly is open for Peter to return.'' Under the athletic
department's code of conduct, however, Warrick's status cannot be
decided until the legal issues are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, however, made it clear where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself pleading for a misdemeanor, and I'm not used to
pleading for misdemeanors,'' Bowden said after beating Miami,
running their record to 6-0 and climbing to No. 2 in The New York
Times' computer rankings. ``I just didn't want to lose the talent.
It shook me. It shook our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal and moral arguments of how the State of Florida and
the university handle Warrick's college future are already a hot
button for print and broadcast pundits and talk-radio devotees. Let
them have at it.
</P>
<P>
   Here, let's address the Heisman Trophy race, which before
Warrick's troubles was muddled and barely interesting. Even if he
returns, his coach doesn't think he has much of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell him to take a very back seat, a very back seat,''
Bowden said Sunday. ``You go out there and play the very best you
can play and don't even think about the Heisman.''
</P>
<P>
   So who is left? Until last weekend, Wisconsin running back Ron
Dayne and Purdue quarterback Drew Brees were hanging in there, and
Georgia Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton seemed to be gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   But Dayne managed just 80 yards on 25 carries in Wisconsin's
20-15 overtime victory over Minnesota. Dayne has had a productive
college career at running back, but the Badgers are 4-2 and he has
had too many duds this season _for example, zero yards in the
second half against Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   For the second week in a row, Brees was also just ordinary. He
was 24 of 39 for 205 yards and no touchdowns as the Boilermakers
lost their second straight, this time to Ohio State, 25-22.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton fared better and is probably now the favorite, though a
lukewarm one. He led the Yellow Jackets to a 31-24 overtime victory
over North Carolina, but he also struggled, fumbling twice and
throwing two interceptions. He is exciting and usually efficient,
but Georgia Tech (4-1, No. 12 in the Times ranking) already lost to
Florida State and does not have a true showcase game left on its
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   So throw the race open _ at least that's what the Virginia Tech
all-American defensive end Corey Moore wants to do. He watched the
Hokies' freshman quarterback, Mike Vick, throw four touchdowns and
run for another in a single half of a 58-20 pasting of Rutgers and
declared: ``Mike right now is good enough to be considered for the
Heisman.''
</P>
<P>
   Any other year, Moore's statement could be dismissed. But maybe
now is a good time for Heisman voters and the public to remember
the criteria employed by the late Southern Methodist great, Doak
Walker. He won it in 1948 and, 38 years later, talked about how he
cast his vote in an article for The New York Times. ``First, I look
at the record of the team. I believe that's a fair standard borne
out by the years,'' Walker wrote. ``I also look at how much that
individual has produced for that team. I try to find out if he has
been a good leader. If he kept his nose clean. If he is a good
citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   He also fretted that the public may have become confused because
of the preeminence of professional football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people have been misled into thinking that
the award should go to the collegiate player who is the best pro
prospect. And that's simply not the way it should be. A good number
of Heisman winners have never played pro ball, or have not played
well in the pros for very long. Many have, but that is not why any
of us received the award,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   So why not Vick? The national title aspirations of Virginia Tech
(5-0, No. 10 in the Times ranking) rest on the strong left arm and
sure feet of their freshman quarterback. Or what about Marshall
quarterback Chad Pennington? No one has penciled the Thundering
Herd into the Bowl Championship Series championship game, but they
are 5-0 and ranked No. 16 by the Times because of his 1,569 passing
yards and 14 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Michigan State quarterback Bill Burke. He threw
for 400 yards and 2 touchdowns to upset Michigan, 34-31. The
Spartans are 6-0 and ranked No. 5 by The Times computer because he
has thrown for more than 1,300 yards and 13 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   In short, maybe it's time for a good player from a good team to
win the most coveted award in college football. And when he does,
it is not fair if he is overshadowed by the great player from the
great team who took himself out of the race. &QL;

RAMS SHOW MERCY TO 49ERS ONLY AT THE GAME'S END 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ At the end, rather than try for 50 points, they took
a knee at the San Francisco 49ers' 1-yard line. The St. Louis Rams
decided that 42 points were enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams had already brought the 49ers to their knees in a
humbling, piercing exorcism that served as a football game.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis ripped San Francisco, 42-20, and emerged Sunday as the
only unbeaten team in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   What the 65,872 fans in the Trans World Dome saw was a shootout
where the Rams sped like jets and the 49ers crawled like a tour
bus.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams led, 21-3, after the first quarter and instead of
trying to figure out a way to hold on, they kept firing, making the
49ers look silly. It was lopsided and embarrassing and often
comical.
</P>
<P>
   It was what the 49ers used to do the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   And the 49ers had smacked them good, winning 17 straight against
the Rams during the last 10 years, dating back to the Rams' days in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday the Rams _ moving to 4-0 and matching their victory
total for all of last season _ stood firm and tall and brought the
49ers to their knees. It was similar to an old schoolyard tussle
where the loser's arm is bent behind his back while the winner
demands that he yell and then spell out: U-N-C-L-E!
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be the team that dug ourselves into a hole and
never stopped digging,'' Mike Jones, a Rams linebacker, said.
``This time we felt like we could take it to them. When they came
off the field, I could see in their eyes that they were kind of
baffled.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffled, blitzed, disgusted, beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no need to try to score again at the end because the
game was won and we won it fairly'' said Dick Vermeil, who is in
his third season as the Rams' coach. ``I think they know that.''
</P>
<P>
   His players awarded him a game ball _ ``a meaningful gift,'' he
called it, ``because it took me two and a half years to beat the
49ers.'' And the Rams' owners, Georgia Frontiere and Stan Kronke,
got one, too.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rams, it was a dream completed, a nightmare squashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my sixth year here and I've seen a lot of those 17
losses to the 49ers,'' safety Keith Lyle said. ``This locker room
was celebrating because this game was not won by gimmicks. We
earned it. A lot of guys were almost in tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Rams cornerback Todd Lyght, a nine-year veteran, said: ``This is
the biggest win of my professional career. I have been with this
organization since 1991 and they have beaten us every time we faced
them. I know we can go from here and do some great things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams feel that way because they are in first place in the
National Conference West, have a quarterback in Kurt Warner who is
playing sensational football, a receiver in Isaac Bruce who is
matching Warner, a defense that made three interceptions Sunday and
a special teams that scored on a 97-yard kickoff return.
</P>
<P>
   Warner to Bruce was the signature of this game.
</P>
<P>
   The two connected on touchdown passes of 13, 5, 45 and 42 yards.
Three of the scores came in the first quarter _ all against the
49er cornerback Darnell Walker _ and that established the tone for
the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, Warner was 9 for 9 and passed for 177
yards and 3 touchdowns. He finished 20 of 23 for 323 yards with 5
touchdown passes and was intercepted once.
</P>
<P>
   Warner has 14 touchdown passes, the most any quarterback in
league history has thrown in his first four games of a season. His
quarterback rating for the game was 140.2. For the season, it is a
gaudy 136.0; a score of 100.0 is deemed superior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt I could make the long throws, the short throws
and the intermediate ones and I made them today,'' Warner said.
``The only way you can find out if a player can play is if he
plays. The league hadn't seen that much of me actually in a
football game. I've never had the chance to play until now.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers saw enough. Warner _ the former Arena League and World
League quarterback _ outdueled the 49ers' Jeff Garcia, who for the
second week replaced Steve Young at quarterback while Young
recovers from a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very good team,'' said Steve Mariucci, the 49ers'
coach, whose team fell to 3-2. ``Kurt Warner was terrific. I was
impressed with their offensive line. We've got a ways to go before
we beat that team.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers trailed, 28-20, with 1 minute 42 seconds left in the
third quarter. Seven seconds later, Tony Horne returned a kickoff
97 yards for a touchdown, and then early in the fourth quarter
Bruce scored again, spinning the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just went out and attacked in every way in this game,''
Bruce, who made five catches for 134 yards, said. ``We got
everybody's best from them today. They caught a hot team.''

 &HT;    Reform Party struggles with fresh attention, internal conflicts
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On the edge of irrelevance just a few
months ago, the Reform Party is back with a cast of characters that
is grabbing headlines and bringing new attention to a party that
seemed close to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not getting much attention and now suddenly we're
everywhere,'' says Jack Gargan, the Cedar Key retiree who will
become the party's national chairman in January. ``You can't turn
on the television or pick up a newspaper without seeing something
about the Reform Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting attention had been a problem for the party because it
was disintegrating. Ross Perot, the quixotic founder, had so
alienated some leading members of the party that they formed a
splinter group called the American Reform Party. Meanwhile,
membership was plummeting, the party was unfocused and the 20
percent vote it got nationwide in the 1992 presidential election
dwindled to less than 9 percent four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Even the election of Jesse Ventura as governor of Minnesota last
year failed to unite the party. Instead, factions developed around
Ventura and Perot. Gargan became national chairman with the help of
Ventura in a power struggle with Perot for control of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem we have as a party right now is Jack
Gargan,'' says David Goldman, a Sarasota attorney and chairman of
the Florida Reform Party. ``He has attempted to undermine the
presidential process and that's not the job of a chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Gargan says Goldman is complaining because he is aligned with
Perot, who opposed Gargan's selection as national chairman. Goldman
says that's not true, he just wants the party to abide by its
rules.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes.
</P>
<P>
   While the party is basking in the attention it is getting from
the possibility of having Pat Buchanan, Donald Trump and even
Ventura and Perot as presidential candidates, it is a party rife
with internal bickering.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not going to win a single state and if it wasn't for
the circus that is going on now, no one would pay any attention to
them,'' said Mike Murphy, a Republican political strategist who
worked for Bob Dole in 1996. ``Look at those people who want to run
as Reform Party candidates. It's like something you would see in
the waiting room of a psychiatrist's office.''
</P>
<P>
   On this point, Gargan and Goldman can set aside their
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reform Party is the only party where independent people
who want to see change can come and have the potential of being a
successful candidate,'' says Goldman. ``We're a grass-roots party,
not a party of elitists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a party where people can tell it like it is,'' says
Gargan. ``We don't have candidates who only want to say what they
think people want to hear. We have candidates who speak the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   A change to the Florida Constitution means that the Reform Party
will get a spot on the ballot next year without having to get
signatures on a statewide petition. Florida voters gave Perot 20
percent of the vote in 1992. But Perot's support began to fade in
Florida just as it did in the rest of the nation. By 1996, he got
only about 9 percent of the Florida vote.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, interest in the Reform Party began to wane.
Loyal supporters who gave countless hours of volunteer time
organizing congressional districts complained that Perot was trying
to control too much from his Dallas, Texas, headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, the Florida Reform Party, as in most states, had become
largely an Internet party. But even state Web pages are often
woefully out of date. With support crumbling, it appeared that the
Reform Party would have little influence on the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   That started to change with Ventura's surprise victory in the
Minnesota governor's race. As the party's top elected official,
Ventura attempted to ease Perot out of the way, suggesting that the
Texas billionaire was doing more harm than good. A sign of
Ventura's growing power was his success in making Gargan the
national chairman over Perot's objections.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Buchanan. Frustrated with his failing campaign
for the GOP nomination, Buchanan and Perot began courting each
other. Ventura countered with Trump.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan and Goldman both say that their party jobs require them
to remain neutral. But Gargan speaks fondly of Ventura, who has
hinted he might enter the race next summer. And Goldman thinks
highly of Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a party that is going to be lucky if it gets 3 or 4
percent in the next election,'' says Murphy. ``They probably would
not be a factor at all next year if it wasn't for the fact that you
suddenly have some huge egos out there who couldn't make it in any
other party.''
</P>
<P>
   That assessment is way off the mark, says Gargan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, there are a lot of people out there very frustrated with
the other parties. People are seething and they want change.''
</P>
<P>
   Gargan wants all of the Reform Party's factions to work out
their differences. He sees Perot as the party's elder statesman and
Ventura as ``the man who saved the party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can win the election next year,'' Gargan says. ``I
really do. That's not something I could have said a year ago.''

TWO HORSE-OF-THE-YEAR CANDIDATES ARE UPSET ON SLOPPY TRACK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the mud and the mist of Belmont Park, two of the
top candidates for Horse of the Year tumbled from the pinnacle
Sunday: Behrens ran second to River Keen in the $1 million Jockey
Club Gold Cup and the great filly Silverbulletday ran second to
Beautiful Pleasure in the $500,000 Beldame.
</P>
<P>
   The upsets scrambled the standings just four weeks before the
same horses meet again in the Breeders' Cup championships at
Gulfstream Park. And a third stakes race at Belmont Sunday produced
a hot new contender among 2-year-old fillies, Surfside, who won the
Frizette by a nose over Darling My Darling.
</P>
<P>
   But for stunning effect, this will be remembered as the day when
Behrens and Silverbulletday were outrun on a sloppy track.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, widely considered the best race horse in the country
and the favorite for the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic, had won
four straight races and probably gave his best performance in the
Whitney at Saratoga in August when he was nosed out in a classic
duel by Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday he was forced to make a late rush to salvage second place
by a head in the Gold Cup, but still crossed three-and-a-quarter
lengths behind River Keen.
</P>
<P>
   And there is some melodrama there, too. River Keen is a
7-year-old bred in Ireland who was claimed last December for
$100,000 by Hugo Reynolds. He is on a roll, finishing second in the
Pacific Classic in August and first in the Woodward in September.
And in his first workout after the Woodward he developed a cracked
hoof.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost scratched this horse because he was dead lame last
night,'' Bob Baffert, River Keen's trainer, said by telephone from
California. ``It looked like he got a bit of an infection in there.
But we worked on it.''
</P>
<P>
   River Keen responded so well that he ran the mile and a quarter
in 2:01 2/5 under Chris Antley, taking the lead after
three-quarters of a mile and widening it to the finish. He paid $26
for a $2 bet, and earned a cool $600,000. Lemon Drop Kid, who won
the Belmont Stakes and the Travers, never fired on the wet track
and finished fifth behind Almuwatakel and Stephen Got Even.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behrens showed me that he is courageous,'' James Bond, his
trainer, said. ``He didn't like that surface at all, and he still
got second. They won't beat him in the Breeders' Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Ieldame, only five fillies were entered, probably because
of the forbidding presence of Silverbulletday. The 3-year-old star
had won 14 of her 16 starts and 11 straight against other fillies.
But this was the first time she raced against older fillies, and
one of them, the 4-year-old Beautiful Pleasure, took the lead at
the start and kept it.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful Pleasure won more than a race; she also won a share of
the lead among fillies and mares, a contest that will be decided in
the Breeders' Cup. But in her last two starts, she has outrun
Banshee Breeze on a sloppy Saratoga track and Silverbulletday on a
sloppy Belmont track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made Silverbulletday commit to our style rather than us
committing to her style,'' John Ward Jr., who trains Beautiful
Pleasure for John C. Oxley, said. ``Beautiful Pleasure has earned
herself a spot in the Breeders' Cup Distaff.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Chavez, the jockey on Beautiful Pleasure, put it
succinctly. ``When a horse runs in the slop and has speed,'' he
said, ``it's very tough to beat. And I had a lot of speed today.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey, the rider on Silverbulletday, said: ``She got
outrun. Beautiful Pleasure loves to be on the lead, and she loves
the slop.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mud, Beautiful Pleasure flashed the mile and
one-eighth in 1:47 3/5. She returned $6.80 for a $2 bet to win, and
went home with $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the Frizette, another wire-to-wire performance was given by
Surfside, who fought a duel down the stretch with Darling My
Darling. She seemed to surrender the lead in the final furlong, but
regained it with a second effort directed by Pat Day, and won by a
head.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third victory in four starts for Surfside, and the
sixth in the Frizette for her trainer, D. Wayne Lukas. She is a
daughter of Seattle Slew and Flanders, and she promptly set her
sights on Chilukki, the undefeated West Coast filly who won her
fifth straight on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned about the weather,'' Lukas said. ``But I think
she won on class and breeding. Unless something comes up in the
next 30 days, I have no excuses.'' &QL;

FORD'S DEAL WITH AUTO WORKERS HAS AN UNUSUAL TWIST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich.)   (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ In difficult labor talks with Ford Motor Co., the
United Automobile Workers union finally agreed to an unusual
compromise: It would allow the company to spin off its giant auto
parts unit as long as Ford did not spin off workers with it, people
briefed on the deal said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 30 consecutive hours of negotiations, the union and
the company reached a tentative agreement Saturday afternoon on a
four-year contract for Ford's 101,000 unionized workers, averting a
potential strike. Under the deal, workers, who are expected to
ratify the agreement later this month, would receive annual raises
of 3 percent on top of adjustments for inflation, plus signing
bonuses of $1,350.
</P>
<P>
   To clinch the deal, Ford was forced to agree that the 23,500
workers at its Visteon Automotive Systems unit would remain Ford
employees _ with pensions and even paychecks from Ford _ even after
the company was spun off, the people said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like the janitors working in a commercial building _
they work for you but are paid by a different company,'' one of
those briefed on the terms of the labor agreement said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Girsky, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
said the quirky compromise was necessary to prevent Ford's
historically strong labor relations from disintegrating into strife
that could cause costly strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a perfect solution?'' he said. ``No, but it is probably
the best solution they could've come up with. Effectively, Visteon
will be renting employees from Ford.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford has been eager to follow in the footsteps of General Motors
Corp., which spun off its Delphi Automotive Systems unit in May.
Ford had explored selling Visteon to Delphi or to another parts
maker, the Lear Corp., but is leaning toward spinning it off.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the labor accord, a Visteon spinoff would
create a giant manufacturing company _ Visteon has about $17.8
billion in revenue and more than two dozen factories in the United
States alone _ with almost no blue-collar employees.
</P>
<P>
   While details remained unavailable Sunday, and neither the union
nor Ford would discuss them, those briefed on the contract terms
said that new workers hired for Visteon factories would most likely
be on Visteon's payroll, although they would have the same pay and
benefits of current Ford workers.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Visteon would simply reimburse Ford for
its payroll costs or whether Ford might win price breaks on Visteon
auto parts purchases that would offset the labor costs, or whether
there might be some other arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Ford wants to spin off its in-house supplier, in part because it
thinks that Visteon could win more work from rival automakers as an
independent company.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the agreement have left both sides frustrated. Ford
executives are grumbling because they expected the union to allow
them to spin off Visteon under the same terms that GM got after
spinning off Delphi without consulting the union.
</P>
<P>
   Under a contract reached on Sept. 28, the 48,000 former GM
workers who now receive paychecks from Delphi are paid the same
rates and receive the same benefits and pensions as GM workers.
They are allowed to switch back to GM jobs when such jobs become
available, and they are promised layoff pay and other benefits from
GM in the event that Delphi fails or runs into financial trouble
before 2007.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford could not get the same deal. The union found
unexpectedly strong, emotional opposition to a Visteon spinoff from
rank-and-file members and from some members of its bargaining team.
Talks with Ford took longer than expected and were clearly more
difficult than either side had bargained on. Last week, the
negotiations became so heated that they dissolved into shouting
matches on several occasions, according to one person briefed on
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   While local union officials had not been briefed Sunday on the
details of the agreement, some said they had heard that the deal
would allow Ford to spin off Visteon, with workers remaining Ford
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is still not acceptable to me,'' said Roger Caldwell,
president of UAW Local 845 in Plymouth, Mich., whose workers build
heaters and radiators for the Visteon unit.
</P>
<P>
   Because the contract includes big raises, and because less than
one-quarter of Ford's unionized employees work at Visteon, the
union's rank-and-file is expected to approve the contract when it
comes to a vote later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement effectively completes the UAW's drive this autumn
to negotiate fresh labor contracts with the nation's 400,000
unionized auto workers. On Sept. 16, the UAW reached a deal with
DaimlerChrysler AG. DaimlerChrysler and GM workers won the same big
raises as Ford workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Auto Workers union has also been negotiating new
contracts this fall. It has already reached an agreement with Ford
and DaimlerChrysler, and will begin negotiations with GM this week.

AFL-CIO MEMBERS TO GET ONLINE ACCESS AND DISCOUNTS
</HEADLINE>
   (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's labor movement, long a laggard on high-technology
matters, is taking a leap into cyberspace with a new AFL-CIO
program that will offer heavily discounted computers and online
service to 13 million union members.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, announced over the weekend, aims not only to make
online service more affordable for millions of union members, but
also to tie unions more closely to their members and to make it
easier to mobilize the rank and file in labor's struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders say this new online plan could create huge
political waves because it will enable union presidents, with the
click of a button, to send e-mail messages to hundreds of thousands
of their members, urging them in turn to e-mail members of
Congress, asking that they initiate, pass or defeat legislation,
among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America,
said, ``Can you imagine being able to instantly ask millions of
union members to refuse to buy a product or to bombard elected
officials with e-mail in protest?''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new program, the AFL-CIO is working with iBelong, a
start-up based in Waltham, Mass., to offer union members computers
for less than $700 and monthly online service for less than $14.95.
Labor federation officials say they hope that at least a million
members will subscribe to the online service, which will cost
roughly 30 percent less than what many online services now charge.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, said the new program
aims in part to bridge a digital division with wealth as its
demarcation. According to a recent Commerce Department report,
families with annual incomes of more than $75,000 are 20 times more
likely to have Internet access than the lowest-income families.
``We're helping bridge the gap between the technological haves and
have-nots,'' Sweeney said. ``We're also giving working families new
ways to connect with one another and to make their voices heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Shikhar Ghosh, chief executive and a founder of iBelong, which
specializes in customized Web entryways, said his company had a
different focus from most other online services, which create
virtual communities made up of strangers. Instead, he said, iBelong
was designing the new online service, called Workingfamilies.com,
to tie people closer together who already form a community by
sharing occupations or belonging to the same union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is creating pseudo-communities where you meet people
you don't know,'' he said. ``We're looking to build communities
where people already have very strong ties and affinities. We have
a chance to create a network that really becomes a center of your
membership life.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has 13 million members and represents more than 80
percent of the nation's unionized workers. It includes 68 unions
ranging from giants like the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
and the American Federation of Teachers, each with more than a
million members, to the United Farm Workers, with fewer than
50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new Internet service, scheduled to begin in December, will
be unusual in that members of each of the federation's 68 unions
will enter Web portals specific to their union when they go online.
</P>
<P>
   When these subscribers log on, they might find e-mail messages
from union officials, news about their workplace and contract
bargaining and news with an effect on their occupations. Ghosh said
the service will also provide chat rooms, the opportunity to have
buddies who subscribe to other online services and full access to
the Internet, including electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has solicited bids from Dell, Gateway and other
computer makers for discounted deals, to provide what they expect
will be hundreds of thousands of PC's to union members.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosh said he expected that this process would result in the
sale of computers that meet most families' needs for $600 to $800
each, excluding monitors. He said that for that amount, the
computers would include Pentium 450-megahertz chips, would have 32
megabytes of random access memory, a 4-gigabyte hard drive and one
year of technical support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gone out to get the really cheapest computer we can
get,'' Ghosh said. ``We're trying to get computers that will
include all the things an average family needs.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the labor federation's program would offer members
a range of computers at a range of prices with ``a couple of price
points that are extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghosh declined to disclose with which companies he was
negotiating to help provide the online service. He already has
deals to set up online services for the American Legion and the
alumni associations of Purdue University and the College of William
and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO officials and Ghosh said the online service would not
cost the labor federation any money. Rather, Ghosh said, iBelong is
putting up tens of millions of dollars to set up the customized
portals and to create a filtering service that will send different
types of information to members of different unions. His company
hopes to profit from the venture by selling advertising on the
service and by obtaining a percentage of sales made by e-commerce
companies that are given priority placements on the service.
</P>
<P>
   The labor federation would share that revenue, with the initial
profits being plowed back into selling the service to union
members, Ghosh and federation officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get a large number of people to come on board, you
make a large amount of money,'' said Ghosh. He added that the
AFL-CIO stood to earn a few million dollars a year from the deal,
while iBelong hoped to make ``tens of millions of dollars'' a year
in profit.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosh said the new service would have strict privacy protections
for subscribers, adding: ``The customers' privacy will be absolute.
Nobody will have a claim to sell any of the information to
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the online service would enable shoppers to
select union-made and American-made products and would help
identify products manufactured under sweatshop or anti-union
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most businesses the AFL-CIO deals with, iBelong is not
unionized. But Ghosh promised not to fight against unionization if
there ever is an organizing drive at his company.
</P>
<P>
   Many unions now have their own Web sites, but Bahr, the
communications workers' president, said the new system would be
vastly preferable. ``We're not tied into our members' homes,'' he
said. ``We're looking for a system that ties into 13 million homes.
Technology gives us the ability to do that.''

FLUTIE'S TRICKS FOOL THE STEELERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie's bag of
tricks is large. As they say in basketball, he creates. He
frustrates a defense with a run, bobbing and weaving his way
through linebackers and safeties who always seem to be surprised by
his speed. His passes are like good fastballs. His decisions are
rarely bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   When the Pittsburgh Steelers' coaches and players look at the
film of their game Sunday against Flutie and the Bills, it will
resemble a horror show. The Steelers will not see masks or axes or
people lost in the woods, just a little man wearing No. 7, slowly
draining them of life. Buffalo won its fourth straight game by
beating Pittsburgh, 24-21, before 71,038 at Ralph Wilson Stadium,
behind what Flutie called his best passing effort of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my best day throwing the ball this year,'' said
Flutie. ``I was seeing everything. I was being patient with my
throws.''
</P>
<P>
   But the afternoon was actually much more than that for Flutie.
He played a critical part, in one way or another, in each of
Buffalo's four scoring drives. Flutie's day was one of the most
impressive performances by a quarterback in the National Football
League this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Flutie was 8 of 8 passing for 127 yards and
one touchdown on first down. Overall, he finished the game 21 of 32
for 261 yards, 3 touchdowns and no interceptions. Pittsburgh
quarterback Kordell Stewart, who has struggled all season, also
played well, completing 21 of 29 passes for 216 yards and two
touchdowns. But unlike Flutie, Stewart threw a critical
interception that led to a Buffalo touchdown and a 24-14 Bills'
lead late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie finished with 39 yards rushing, which included a 21-yard
scramble on third-and-20, a crucial play that kept a Bills drive
alive. Later, kicker Steve Christie connected on a 29-yard field
goal for a 17-7 second-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Doug played a great game today,'' said Bills wide
receiver Eric Moulds, who had 6 catches for 122 yards and 1
touchdown. ``Last week against Miami he was in a slump until the
fourth quarter. Today we just spread them out, and that is when
Doug is at his best, because he can see a little bit clearer and he
made the plays when it counted.''
</P>
<P>
   It is time to start taking this Buffalo team seriously as a
contender in the American Football Conference East Division, thanks
to Flutie and to the Bills' defense, which is probably the best in
the AFC. How Buffalo got to this point _ tied with New England for
the division lead with a 4-1 record, after the Patriots lost to
Kansas City Sunday _ is contrary to the way it got to four Super
Bowls earlier this decade. Then they used a big, tough quarterback
in Jim Kelly to lead an explosive offense. Now, while the
5-foot-10-inch Flutie and the talented Moulds are among the top
offensive combinations in the conference, Buffalo's defense,
composed of young players and gritty veterans like Bruce Smith,
carries the team.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the Bills and Steelers coming into this
game were immeasurable. The Bills were riding an emotional high
from a victory Monday night at Miami. Then there were the 2-3
Steelers, who own a losing record after five games for the first
time in the 1990s. While their defense is formidable, offensively
Pih is confused. Stewart has played in a haze; running back
Jerome Bettis, nicknamed the Bus, has spent much of this season in
the repair shop with various injuries, and the team, because of
free agency, has lost a number of other offensive weapons.
</P>
<P>
   What truly hurts Pittsburgh _ and especially hurts Stewart _ is
the lack of a running game. Bettis, once one of the most feared
runners in football, had just 24 yards on 13 carries. The Steelers
had only 48 rushing yards overall.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie, on the other hand, now scares defenses, and a series
late in the second half demonstrated just how much. The Bills were
at the Pittsburgh 8-yard line, and Flutie started a first-down play
by rolling right and faking as if he were going to run. The
Steelers, scared silly after Flutie had burned them on runs all
day, overreacted, running to stop him as if he were stealing their
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, tight end Jay Riemersma, who had thrown a block
low on a Steelers lineman, lay on the ground as if he were done for
the play. Then Riemersma bounced up and began running the opposite
way. Flutie stopped in his tracks and threw across his body to the
tight end for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It was trickery designed to take advantage of Flutie's
play-faking ability and of the way he terrifies defenses. Flutie
and smart play calling _ a deadly combination.

   NEW YORK _ Akshay Ganesh, a 12-year-old seventh-grader who lives
on Staten Island, rolls out of bed every weekday about 6 a.m. He
has 20 minutes to eat breakfast and get dressed before heading out
the door to catch the S66 bus to catch the 7 a.m. ferry to
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming in a sea of suits, briefcases and crumpled newspapers,
he tries to avoid dozing off as he rides the ferry to Battery Park,
where he then dashes east across Whitehall Street to jump on an
uptown subway. At 14th Street, he switches to an eastbound train to
get to First Avenue. Two hours after waking up, he arrives at
school, the Institute for Collaborative Education in Gramercy Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commute's really a hassle,'' he said one day last week,
trying to stave off a yawn. ``But education is really important,
and I like the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Akshay's morning adventure, an act of educational ambition and
preadolescent bravery, is hardly unique these days for middle
school students. Throughout New York City, children as young as 10
are setting off at daybreak, climbing aboard buses and squeezing
onto the subway to travel long distances to get to class.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Francis, 12, stands on a gritty street corner in
Brooklyn, at 6:45 a.m. to catch the bus that will take her to the
subway that will get her to the Clinton School for Artists and
Writers on the West Side of Manhattan. Maria Theresa Alonzo, 12,
who lives in Queens, commutes four hours a day to attend the New
York City Lab School in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the sagas of high school students making near-epic
trips across the boroughs to get to the city's finest public high
schools have played out for decades. But now, driven by an
explosion in the number of higher-quality junior high schools
created by individual public school districts, younger and younger
children are taking up the often risky project in commuter gumption
to reap the educational rewards.
</P>
<P>
   For parents, the decision to allow their 11- and 12-year-olds to
travel on the subway for an hour or more to school requires them to
balance concerns about safety with desires for educational
benefits. For those who opt to hire private buses to pick up their
children, the decision can also be one of finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that crime is down, but I am still a little worried
about Akshay's safety in the afternoons,'' said Kala Ganesh, a
domestic-violence social worker who works in Manhattan. ``But what
do you do when you are looking for a great education and
opportunities?''
</P>
<P>
   About 30 new middle schools have cropped up in New York City
since 1991 _ increasing the number to 197 _ largely in response to
a public outcry over deplorable academic conditions. For years, the
city's middle schools have been described as the weakest link in
the system, one that pushed many families into private education.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new schools are trumpeting specialized programs in
such areas as science, mathematics and dance to compete with other
districts for the best students. Last year, Brooklyn's District 15
created eight new middle schools, including The Manuel de Dios
Unanue Journalism School and the New School for Research in the
Natural and Social Sciences.

</P>
<P>
   Manhattan's District 2, which began middle school choice in the
late 1980s, has long drawn students from around the city to the
Clinton School for Artists and Writers, the New York City Lab
School and others.
</P>
<P>
   But officials stepped up the effort when middle school choice
became citywide policy in 1993. The district _ which covers parts
of the Upper East and West Sides, the Lower East Side and Greenwich
Village _ went on to create the Salk School for Science and the New
York City Museum School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember `Field of Dreams,' build a ball field and they will
come?'' said Burton Sacks, chief executive director of community
school district affairs for the city's Board of Education,
recalling the movie. ``Build a program, and if parents feel
comfortable that their youngsters are going to get a quality
education, they will let them travel. We think that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennyson Lyttle, a big teen-ager with a soft voice, does not
mind getting up at 5:30 a.m. every weekday for a trip that would
make any adult cringe. He lives in Queens, near Kennedy
International Airport, and attends the Institute for Collaborative
Education in Manhattan. The 16-year-old 10th-grade student has been
making the trip since middle school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard waking up, and the trip is long, but it's worth it
because I like the school,'' he said, arriving at the front door a
few minutes after 8 a.m. last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Francis, 12, a seventh-grader at the Clinton School in
Manhattan, has a hard time most days waking up at 6 a.m. Her
mother, Marie Rose Bowman, has to call her at least a half-dozen
times, she said. But once she gets out of bed in the family's tiny
one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn, she gets dressed in 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind getting up,'' Mrs. Bowman, dressed in a
nightshirt, said one morning as she pulled Michelle's hair into a
ponytail while her daughter ate breakfast. ``I just go back to bed
after she leaves. You know, a child's education is important, and I
don't want her to go to school around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle, hovering over a toasted bagel with butter at the
kitchen table, was coming to life at about 6:30 a.m. ``There is a
school up the block,'' she said between bites of the bagel. ``It's
not that good. That's where my cousin goes. My cousin's mean. I
don't want to be like her.''
</P>
<P>
   When Michelle began attending the Clinton School last year, she
had to choose a different route after the first month because she
arrived late every day. ``I had to take two buses and three
trains,'' she said, rolling her eyes. ``Now, I take a bus and two
subways. It's much better, and I run into friends from school on
the subway all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns over safety have prompted some parents to arrange their
own transportation. Susan Weine, who lives in Park Slope, and five
other parents jointly chartered a small yellow school bus so that
their children would not have to ride the subway before daybreak.
The parents each pay about $2,300 a year for the door-to-door
service, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weine's 10-year-old daughter, Sarah Ransom, is in the sixth
grade at the Institute for Collaborative Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's costly, but convenient,'' Ms. Weine said of the bus
service. ``But the jury's still out on whether all of this is worth
it. Now that we're in it and I see how stressful the long hours are
for everyone in the family, I wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason she picked Collaborative was that it runs
through the 12th grade. ``The search ran my life,'' Ms. Weine said
of her three-month effort to find the perfect school. ``I saw 11
schools and took a lot of time off work to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ellen Driesen of Brooklyn, helped her daughter, Rebecca,
12, choose a middle school last year, it reminded her of searching
for a college. The two scoured dozens of schools in Brooklyn's
District 15 and Manhattan's District 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were all of these choices,'' Mrs. Driesen said one
morning while waiting for Rebecca to finish dressing. They settled
on the Clinton School for Artists and Writers, which means that
Rebecca must take a bus and two subway trains. Mrs. Driesen goes
with her on the first stage of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   One day recently, they managed to get two seats on the packed
B61 bus, parting ways at the Jay Street-Borough Hall stop. Before
moving on, Mrs. Driesen watched her lanky daughter disappear
through the turnstile to the train.
</P>
<P>
   Once alone, Rebecca's soft features transformed from carefree
adolescent into don't-mess-with-me-I'm-from-Brooklyn.

   NEW YORK _ This is the time when grown-ups in blue plastic
helmets look perfectly normal on crowded city streets. When
friends, lovers, family members and co-workers find themselves
discovering ugly things about one another. When perfect strangers
launch into passionate debates at the sight of the letters N and Y.
</P>
<P>
   New York hasn't experienced this in a long, long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   It's still too early to count on a Subway Series. (You don't
want to jinx it, do you?) There are details to take care of in
Atlanta and Cleveland _ or better still, in Boston. But the buzz is
building with every lopsided Yankees and heart-stopping Mets win.
</P>
<P>
   And so is the anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Valentino, 24, was passing through midtown Manhattan on
his way from Glen Ridge, N.J., to Shea Stadium on Friday afternoon,
when he ran into Karrien Bell, 22, a student from Newark. At any
other time, these two would have hardly noticed each other. But
Valentino was wearing an old Mets helmet he had dug out of his
closet and worn every game day for the last two weeks. Bell was in
a new, bright blue Yankees jacket and a turned-around Yankees cap.
And neither man was in a rush.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, this tiny piece of West 40th Street and Broadway might
as well have been a corner tavern and these two friendly old
antagonists. ``The most popular ride is the bandwagon,'' Valentino
was saying, sneering through his smile.
</P>
<P>
   Bell denied being a front-runner, saying he simply preferred the
better team. Then, candidly, he voiced his deepest fear: ``If the
Mets face the Yankees in the Series, they're going to win,'' he
said. ``They're more hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't make Valentino feel much better. ``If they don't,''
he said, ``I'll probably dig a hole and bury myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing would be better for New York, the saying goes, than a
New York-New York championship matchup. But nothing would be worse
for the egos of more New Yorkers. Because one team would have to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to anybody wearing a blue hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't deny the Yankees are a fantastic team,'' said
Christine Bracco, 27, a lifelong Mets fan from Bensonhurst,
Brooklyn, who cheered herself hoarse in the mezzanine at Shea after
Todd Pratt's home run Saturday that won the Mets a trip to Atlanta.
``But the fans they have taken that for granted. They just are so
arrogant. You've got all your Wall Street boys with cigars and
suits, bragging like they've been fans for life. And they don't
even acknowledge that other teams exist.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Bracco sounds hurt, her wounds are fresh. Her
ex-boyfriend, Michael Farkas, is just as avid a Yankees fan. The
two parted company amicably last week, but neither denied that
their escalating baseball rivalry had been a factor in their
breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Farkas, a Brooklyn homicide prosecutor who so despises the Mets
that he rooted for the Boston Red Sox in the 1986 World Series,
says he cannot decide who are worse, the Mets or their fans. ``I
can't get over their pretty-boy attitude of the '80s,'' he said.
``I have nothing to hate about them now, except for their decrepit
stadium and ugly pastel colors. But if you grow up with hate, it's
hard to let it go. I really saw the Mets bandwagon take off in the
1980s, and that flew in the face of the history and tradition of
the Yankees. It was demeaning to baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   As any fan will explain, there are serious differences between
the followers of New York's two contenders _ beyond the fact that
Shea Stadium remains a nice place to take the kids, while the
loudest louts in the loges at Yankee Stadium have lowered the
overall tone nearly to the level of the Bleacher Creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Mets fans, in the unanimous, unbiased opinion of tens of Yankees
fans interviewed this week, are a pathetic bunch of loser punks who
will never get over their insecurities, just as their forebears
never got over their misplaced loyalty to the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to put them in their place, sweep them and get them out
of my hair, once and for all,'' said Vinnie Minichello, 39, an
accountant from Brooklyn who wore full-dress Yankees regalia to
Shea Stadium on Friday night, taunted everyone around him in the
upper deck, yet somehow made it out alive. (``He's adopted,'' his
father, Frank, kept telling people apologetically, and
untruthfully.)
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Yankees fans, according to a similarly exhaustive
informal survey of Mets fans, are a big-headed blight on the Bronx
who lack the constitution, heart and humanity to root for an
underdog, the common sense to be repulsed by the designated hitter
rule, and the adventurousness to value the unexpected over the
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too easy to be a Yankee fan,'' said Peter Badini, 53, of
Bedford Hills, N.Y., who lingered at Shea with his son after the
last game of the regular season. ``Five-nothing, 6-0, 7-0 _ it's
boring. With the Mets, it's always an uh-oh.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the fans' self-images are rich with fantasy: Mets fans see
themselves as monks, willing to endure lasting deprivation for the
sake of a future reward _ ``It makes the victories that much
sweeter,'' Badini said _ while Yankees fans like to think they are
priests guarding the flame of an ancient tradition, that they are
winners just as much as their team. It's enough to make you wonder
who's hiding what.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, people read into their chosen teams exactly what they
want, or need. So David Rosenthal, whose older brother was a
Yankees fan, needed no other reason as a boy to root for the
fledgling Mets. Coming of age in the 1960s, he began to see the
youthful Mets as the counterculture's answer to the conservative,
corporate Yankees, who at the time were owned by CBS. The Mets had
heart, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees hurt the ones they loved,'' said Rosenthal, now
the publisher of Simon &AMP; Schuster's trade division. ``They fired
Casey, they fired Yogi after they won the pennant in '64, then they
traded Roger Maris to the Cardinals, they traded Moose Skowron to
the Dodgers. The Yankees treated the ones we loved with an air of
disrespect, and that was hideous. And the Mets continued to employ
losers past their prime, which was endearing. They hired Yogi, Duke
Snider and Willie Mays in their senescence. So those of us who grew
up in the '60s got to live in the '50s all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Richard Wessler, 63, a Yankees fan who grew up in
the Midwest, suggests that people who root for the Mets because
they prefer an underdog are more likely underachievers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this comes from the immigrant experience, where the
immigrants are the underdogs initially, and then in a generation or
two, they make it and become winners,'' he said. ``But some people
make it better than others. The Yankees have got it made, year
after year. It's easier to identify with them if you've got it
made, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Wessler, the chairman of the psychology department at Pace
University, favors the blue-collar/white-collar analogy. Suggest
that watching the Yankees win all the time is boring, for example,
and he says: ``Like being a millionaire's boring. We're like
spoiled children. We're used to getting what we want: victory.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``Like a good working man, the Mets are sometimes fully
employed, but sometimes they're completely out of work. If you've
made it to a full lunch pail most of the time, but you're still a
lunch pail kind of guy, you're probably still identifying with the
underdog, and maybe feeling a little sorry for yourself that you
haven't made it to the upper echelons, to the elite. Met fans are
dealing with more uncertainty in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there are some hoary cliches, and some red herrings,
at work here. It may be convenient right now to deride the Yankees
as machinelike and invincible and lionize the Mets as thrilling
underdogs. But to do so overlooks the Yankees' long absences from
postseason play, from 1965 to 1975 and from 1982 to 1994 _ absences
during which the Mets played in three World Series and won two, the
second as the dominant power in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The supposedly deep-rooted personalities of the two teams have
changed significantly every few years, as well. What resemblance
did the hapless Mets of the early 1960s bear to the swaggering men
about town of the late 1980s, or the dysfunctional firecracker
throwers of the early 1990s? How do today's Yankees, admired for
their sublimated egos, in any way look like the creatures that
inhabited the Bronx Zoo of the 1970's?
</P>
<P>
   What was convenient about those asynchronous swings was that
whichever team did well had the New York stage all to itself. And
fans of the other team could lick their wounds in the shadows, the
Mets' by invoking the wait-till-next-year motto of the old Dodgers,
the Yankees' by reminding themselves and everyone around them of
their team's past glories.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, there is nowhere to hide.
</P>
<P>
   So we have every self-loving Yankees fan idolizing and
identifying with Joe Torre, that supremely confident Buddha of the
bench, conqueror of cancer, tamer of Steinbrenner, owner of two
World Series rings, coolly and methodically and all but inexorably
leading his men toward a third.
</P>
<P>
   And we have every self-loathing Mets fan simultaneously hating
and loving Bobby Valentine, that headline-grabbing,
costume-wearing, bubble-blowing manager with exactly nothing to his
credit thus far but longevity, the only man jumpier than Turk
Wendell, outpacing and outthinking and outblundering his opponut somehow still inspiring his men to survive.
</P>
<P>
   If all this keeps up, the ultimate New York psychodrama could
start at Shea Stadium on Saturday, Oct. 23.

   AFTER YANKEES CELEBRATE, A RASH OF PROBLEMS
</P>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Yankees were supposed to be celebrating
after they completed a sweep of Texas in the division series, but
Derek Jeter and some of his teammates were not smiling. They were
comparing rashes.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared as if some of the players reacted to the champagne
or beer being poured during the post-game celebration. Jeter, Luis
Sojo and at least a half-dozen other players suddenly were covered
with deep red rashes on their chests and shoulders. ``It's because
of that cheap stuff,'' one player said, referring to the quality of
the champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will presumably have medical concerns far greater
than skin rashes this week as they prepare for the start of the
American League Championship Series on Wednesday. Paul O'Neill has
bruised ribs and will go to Yankee Stadium on Monday for treatment.
Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said Sunday that if
O'Neill does not feel any relief _ he is extremely sore and has had
shortness of breath _ then he will go for more extensive tests in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a question about whether O'Neill will be able to
play, then the Yankees are likely to add outfielder Shane Spencer
to their postseason roster by Wednesday. The natural switch would
seem to be swapping Spencer for Clay Bellinger, the utility
infielder.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees also have the option of inserting Spencer in place
of the veteran Jim Leyritz, who has played sparingly and generally
struggled since joining the team in a trade before the July 31
deadline. But Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, usually sticks with
players who have helped him win, and Leyritz's home run in Game 4
of the 1996 World Series was the Yankees' most important hit in the
last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said he and Torre had spoken of the possibility of
adding Spencer, ``but not in detail.'' The Yankees now have only
three healthy, full-time outfielders on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens hobbled around the Yankees' clubhouse after Game 3
Saturday with a large ice pack wrapped around the lower part of his
right knee, but that was treatment for the calf injury that came
when Tom Goodwin laced a ground ball against the side of Clemens'
leg; the pain worsened as the game progressed and stiffness set
in. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A GAME OF NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   With Roger Clemens and Darryl Strawberry dominating the news of
Game 3, other factors were overlooked:
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers were stunned by their offensive failures. In
the last two years, they have scored two runs in six playoff games
against the Yankees. After batting .141 in 1998, they hit .152 in
this year's playoff. ``It's very hard to take _ very hard to
take,'' said Mark McLemore, the Rangers' second baseman. ``We came
into this year with a better ball club and the same thing happened
again. It's tough to deal with.'' The Rangers went 0 for 12 with
runners in scoring position in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera, the Yankees' closer, entered Game 3 in the
eighth inning and got the last six outs. He has surrendered just
two earned runs in 38 innings in the post-season in his career, for
an 0.47 earned run average _ the lowest of any pitcher in major
league history with 30 or more innings. ``There's always hope until
the last out,'' said Rusty Greer, the Texas left fielder. ``Rivera
didn't allow us any more, though. He's a great closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter had two hits in four at-bats in Game 3 and finished with a
.455 average for the series, leading the Yankees in hits (five) and
runs scored (three).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' pitchers allowed 23 base runners in 27 innings,
giving up 14 hits and nine walks, and Torre used only five of his
10 pitchers. The right-hander Hideki Irabu has been on the
post-season roster for the Yankees' last four series and has not
pitched an inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee hitters had a generally punchless series against
Texas in 1998, and did so again this year, batting .235 as a team,
with 10 walks and 14 runs scored. But nine of their 23 hits were
for extra bases; Texas had just three extra-base hits. &QL;

LARAMIE BRACES FOR TRIAL IN MATTHEW SHEPARD'S SLAYING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wyo.)   (jw) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARAMIE, Wyo. _ The rail fence remains, a lonely span of timber
at the end of a rutted limestone trail, separating only one side of
prairie from the other.
</P>
<P>
   It was here a year ago that Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old
political science student at the University of Wyoming, was beaten
by two men, tied to the fence and left to die, perhaps because he
was gay. He was found unconscious 18 hours later by a bicyclist and
taken to a hospital, where he lived four more days.
</P>
<P>
   The brutality of the crime turned it into a national rallying
cry for hate-crime laws to recognize a victim's sexual orientation,
along with race, religion annal origin, as a basis for
prosecution. Fewer than half the states have passed such expanded
measures, and eight, including Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws at
all. A federal bill that would include sexual orientation is under
consideration by a House-Senate conference.
</P>
<P>
   But criminal justice in this old cowboy town gallops ahead.
Russell Henderson, 22, one of the men charged with kidnapping,
aggravated robbery and murder in the death of Shepard pleaded
guilty in April and received consecutive life sentences in a deal
that spared him a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday, here in the county district court building, jury
selection begins in the trial of the second man, Aaron James
McKinney, 22, who is facing the same charges and a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   While testimony is expected to provide a detailed account of
events leading to Shepard's death, it might never explain with
certainty why, as prosecutors charge, Henderson and McKinney preyed
on Shepard the night of Oct. 6, 1998, luring him out of the
Fireside Lounge on the pretense that they were gay, driving him out
of town, binding him in ropes, robbing him of $20 and his wallet,
beating him with the butt of a gun and leaving him tied to the
fence.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional theory is that Shepard's sexual orientation
offended the two in some way, and they felt a need to punish him.
In presiding over the plea bargain of Henderson, District Judge
Jeffrey Donnell said Shepard died in ``part because of his
lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judge also suggested that the crime might have been
committed for other reasons, because Henderson's statement to the
court included no mention of Shepard's homosexuality or how he and
McKinney convinced Shepard to leave the Fireside with them.
</P>
<P>
   Some explanation might emerge in the trial of McKinney, which
could include testimony by Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   But Calvin Rerucha, the prosecutor, declined to discuss any
aspect of the McKinney case, citing an order by the judge, Barton
Voigt. And neither of McKinney's lawyers returned a telephone call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   For gay and lesbian organizations, the motive was unequivocal:
Shepard was killed because he was gay. ``The evidence is crystal
clear,'' said David M. Smith, senior strategist for the Human
Rights Campaign, a national advocacy group for gay and lesbian
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But questions linger in the minds of others. The victim's
mother, Judy Shepard, said in an interview that there are elements
of her son's death she may never understand. ``I don't think there
will ever be answers to all my questions,'' Ms. Shepard said.  &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his greatest fear was that McKinney's lawyers would
wage a successful ``panic defense,'' a tactic designed to build
sympathy with the jury and lessen the penalty by portraying the
defendant as someone so offended by homosexuality that, when
approached by a gay man, he panicked and responded with violence.
</P>
<P>
   Many in this town of 27,000, where Henderson and McKinney
repaired roofs for a living, worry that it is now viewed by the
rest of the country as an outpost of intolerance and bigotry, an
image testimony could cement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think if you live in Laramie you come from a broken
home filled with hatred,'' said Joseph Bushnell, a retired
restaurant manager who now works as a computer consultant. ``Like
everybody here's from the other side of the tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Glaser, Bushnell's colleague at the computer company, said,
`'It's unfortunate the way we've been cast.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little to suggest that the Shepard killing was anything
more than a brutal but isolated event. Once a railroad town,
Laramie now exists pretty much like any other working-class city of
its size in the Rocky Mountain West, with a mix of shops, bars and
restaurants in the downtown area and strip malls beyond. The
university adds a touch of diversity to a town that is
overwhelmingly white and heterosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Crime appears to be no worse than anywhere else. Police here say
they respond to garden-variety offenses, many of them the
byproducts of too much alcohol. Murders are rare, maybe one a year,
and murders of a minority member or gay person are rarer still.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing in Laramie's recent past has resonated so widely as
the killing of Shepard, and that could say as much about the macho
nature of Western culture in Wyoming, the least populated state in
the country, as Shepard's sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the cowboy is king. At least the cowboy image is king. The
silhouetted bucking-bronco rider that serves as Wyoming's official
state symbol adorns almost everything, from neon lights over bars
to restaurant logos to license plates. Even if the number of real
cowboys is declining as farm prices fall, the image endures.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, a slightly built man at 5-foot-2, would not have been
mistaken for a cowboy. He was born in Casper, Wyo., where his
father worked as an oil rig safety inspector, but he studied in
Switzerland before returning to the United States to attend the
university here. He spoke several languages and wanted to become a
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson and McKinney were high school dropouts. McKinney was
known around town as something of a bully, and the Laramie police
say that after the two left Shepard on the fence, McKinney
assaulted a Hispanic man back in town with the same gun he used to
beat Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell, the computer consultant, said he had lived in the West
all his life, the last 10 years in Laramie. He said he knew Shepard
informally; they attended the same church now and again, St.
Matthew's Episcopal.
</P>
<P>
   He said most people in Laramie really did not know what drove
the two men to kill Shepard. ``Maybe he hit on them or maybe it was
a different type of thing and it wasn't sex,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it really doesn't matter why. He could have been a
homosexual, Jewish, black, whatever. He was a human being, and the
biggest percentage of people here have a great deal of sympathy for
human life. No matter what his preference was, to take a human
being's life is wrong.''

REPUBLICANS WEIGH RISKS OF ACROSS-THE-BOARD SPENDING CUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., S.C., Fla., Miss., Texas)  (EDS: This story, which was eliminated earlier, has been
restored.) 
(mk) 
 By TIM WEINER and RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Running out of weapons in their politically charged
fight to finance the government without using Social Security
money, Republicans in Congress are turning to the crudest of fiscal
tools, an across-the-board cut in spending.
</P>
<P>
   That blunt instrument would be a last-ditch choice for
Republican leaders. The political risks are such that analysts are
skeptical Congress will use it. But party leaders say they support
the idea, and 54 Republican senators passed a nonbinding resolution
in favor of it last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are drawing the line,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R- Okla.,
the majority whip. ``If necessary, and hopefully it will not be
necessary, we will implement across-the-board reductions.''
</P>
<P>
   That would avoid the difficulty of cutting specific programs by
spreading the pain. And Republicans say they will do whatever is
necessary not to reach the point at which government spending for
the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 dips into excess Social Security
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are well aware that the cuts could generate
widespread public opposition and draw intense attacks from
President Clinton and Democrats in Congress. And because
Republicans are talking about exempting the military and veterans'
programs from the cuts, the reductions could fall even harder on
domestic and social programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This approach is a sign of desperation,'' said Rep. John
Spratt, D-S.C., the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts would be so painful that many Republican lawmakers have
no stomach for them. But they say they have few alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican spending bills increase money for the Pentagon,
while freezing or cutting some domestic programs. So an
across-the-board cut would mean some real reductions in social
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to cut 6 percent out of education, health care,
medical research?'' asked Rep. C.W. ``Bill'' Young, R-Fla., the
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. ``But if the
leadership directs us to do it, we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The House speaker, Dennis Hastert, and the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., say the cuts must be made if the
alternative is tapping Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an indication of how desperate they are up on Capitol
Hill for a way out of their appropriations problem,'' said Stanley
Collender, head of the federal budget consulting group at
Fleischman Hillard, a public relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts could also aid the Democrats' argument that the
Republican majority in Congress cannot meet its most basic
responsibility of setting priorities and passing spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``An across-the-board cut is the ultimate confession of policy
failure,'' said Robert Bixby, policy director of the Concord
Coalition, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group. ``It's the meat
cleaver approach.''
</P>
<P>
   One difficulty would be the pressure to exempt the military,
veterans and other favorites. ``As soon as you talk about
across-the-board cuts, everybody jumps up and salutes it, and then
their second point is, `But I have this very special program,'''
said the House majority leader, Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives outside of Congress said the approach is not
ideal, but better than raising tobacco taxes, as Clinton has
proposed, or breaking the Republicans' pledge not to use Social
Security revenues for general government operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the least bad of several bad choices,'' said
Peter Sperry, a budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative research organization.
</P>
<P>
   Spending some Social Security money would have no direct effect
on the retirement system's long-term financial condition and little
or no economic impact. But it has immense political significance
for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has still not finished work on six of the 13 spending
bills needed to finance the government, now operating under
temporary spending authority that expires Oct. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are trying to limit overall spending outlays for
government agencies to $592 billion for fiscal 2000 _ roughly the
same as fiscal 1999 _ and they are using every accounting device
available.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Pentagon spending bill delays payments to
military contractors from late September 2000 to early October
2000, shifting $1.25 billion of spending into fiscal 2001,
congressional aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Republicans are weighing whether to delay federal
workers' paychecks for late September until early October 2000,
shifting about $3.6 billion in spending into the next year, those
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' only alternatives to this kind of creative
bookkeeping are cutting their spending bills or tapping the Social
Security money.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the Republicans will achieve their goal on
time and on budget. But it will be hard. Congress is on track to
use at least $8 billion of the Social Security surplus, House
Republican estimates show.
</P>
<P>
   To bring outlays down by $8 billion in fiscal 2000, Congress
would have to pass and Clinton would have to sign into law
across-the-board cuts of 2.7 percent, or $15.2 billion in budget
authority, the Republicans estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Budget authority, which pays for one or more years of spending,
must be cut deeper to yield savings in outlays, which cover only
one year.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 2.7 percent cut, the military would have to furlough
close to 100,000 personnel, disband an Army division and a Navy
carrier battle group and deny health care to many veterans, House
Democrats say. If military and veterans programs were exempted, the
cuts on all other programs would be 6.3 percent, Republicans and
Democrats say.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the cuts might have to be even deeper. The Congressional
Budget Office and the White House have both judged the Republicans
to be on track to spend at least $19.2 billion of the Social
Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid that, the cuts would have to be 6.9 percent if the
military and veterans are included and 16.1 percent if not,
Democrats on the House Budget Committee say.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The precise effect across-the-board cuts would have on specific
programs is hard to predict. But the cuts would almost certainly
shake every branch of the government, from national parks to
national security, and force thousands of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   They would cut off money for food and education to hundreds of
thousands of poor children, cancel millions of home-delivered meals
for the elderly and hobble federal law enforcement, the White House
says.
</P>
<P>
   The White House budget director, Jacob Lew, said in an interview
that in many ways a 2.7 percent cut would be the worst of both
worlds, failing to protect the Social Security surplus while
hurting the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This idea hasn't been floated lightly, and we're taking it
seriously,'' he said. ``But it's a silly way to make policy.''

GORE, BRADLEY WOO LABOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ James P. Hoffa, the president of the Teamsters
union, received a long-awaited telephone call a week ago. It was
Vice President Al Gore, who had avoided getting close to a union
long associated with corruption, suggesting that the two men should
meet soon.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is whether Gore has reached out to Hoffa too
late. This week, the AFL-CIO is slated to decide at a Los Angeles
convention whether to endorse Gore, and Hoffa is leading the push
for a delay.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, meanwhile, has been
cultivating Hoffa for months and recently. While there is little
chance that Bradley will win the AFL-CIO endorsement, a delayed
endorsement of Gore would be a major setback and embarrassment for
the vice president, raising questions about whether he has taken
the crucial labor support for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is going to be endorsed. The question is when,'' AFL-CIO
president John J. Sweeney, who backs Gore, said in an interview.
``There is nobody, with maybe one or two exceptions, among top
leadership who is expressing an interest in endorsing Bradley. But
people are listening to what is happening locally. They want to be
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, who once ran for office as a Republican, clearly is the
major stumbling block to a quick Gore endorsement. The Teamsters
are operating under federal supervision, and Hoffa's top priority
has been to persuade the Clinton administration to lift that
restriction. Hoffa is the son of former Teamsters president James
R. ``Jimmy'' Hoffa, whose body has never been found. When the
younger Hoffa won the presidency of the Teamsters, he raised
questions about whether the Clinton administration was meddling in
the election on behalf of his opponent, Ron Carey, who was
considered more friendly to Democrats than Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hoffa said recently that he supports the policies of
Republican presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan, who opposes
various free-trade deals. Hoffa was perceived as being so close to
Buchanan that he felt compelled to issue a statement last month
denying that he would seek to join Buchanan as a vice presidential
candidate on the Reform Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton last week spoke to the Teamsters and met
with Hoffa in New York City, the two men said they didn't discuss a
possible endorsement of Gore. The vice president, meanwhile, has
found it difficult to form a bond with Hoffa, apparently worrying
about leaving any impression that he would use his influence to end
the federal supervision of the Teamsters or block free-trade deals
in exchange for an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Moldea, author of ``The Hoffa Wars'' and a longtime observer
of the Teamsters, said Hoffa has signaled to the Democrats that he
wouldn't support the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Moldea said, Hoffa can't afford to alienate Gore since he
needs the adminstration's help in ending federal supervision. Thus,
it is in Hoffa's interest to seek as much leverage as possible with
Clinton and Gore while the vice president is seeking the AFL-CIO
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the Gore campaign has assumed it would snare the
backing of the AFL-CIO easily. That means far more than most
endorsements because it carries with it millions of dollars in
labor support and advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   But organized labor is not entirely organized when it comes to
backing presidential candidates. Several unions, most notably the
Teamstethe United Auto Workers, have differences with both
Gore and Bradley over the two candidates' support of free-trade
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, meanwhile, has courted the Teamsters by backing the
union's call for a delay in allowing Mexican trucks to cross the US
border because of a lack of inspectors. That has prompted questions
about whether Bradley is backing away from his support for the
North American Free Trade Agreement, which he helped pass as a
senator.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, in an interview, strongly denied that he is
stepping away from NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAFTA was something that I helped conceive, quite frankly,''
Bradley said. ``I was the point man in getting it passed. I think
it is of the dimension of something like the Louisiana Purchase.
When it happened, it changed America, changed what America will
become. I strongly support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley called his stance on the Mexican truck inspections
``this little thing. This is a small bump but the path is clear.
You don't want unsafe trucks coming into the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bradley said he doesn't know if he and Gore have any
disagreement on labor matters. ``I don't know what his positions
are,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president is
``reviewing'' the truck issue amid indications that the Clinton
administration will side with the Teamsters. Gore, meanwhile, is
vigorously wooing labor. At a local Teamsters union meeting
Thursday night in Kentucky, Gore said that he had a higher rating
as a senator on labor issues than Bradley, even though he comes
from the right-to-work state of Tennessee and Bradley comes from
the pro-labor state of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   All of this sets the stage for a tense round of lobbying next
week at the AFL-CIO convention.  &UR; Tomorrow &LR; , the organization's
political committee, composed of 10 leaders of various affiliates,
is slated to make a recommendation on an endorsement. That
recommendation will be passed to a 54-member executive council,
which is slated to act Wednesday on a possible endorsement. Hoffa
is a member of that council. If the council agrees on an
endorsement, it will be passed to the convention's 700 delegates,
who then would vote on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, some AFL-CIO officials said it would take a
two-thirds vote of the board to win an endorsement, but they said
last week that only a majority is necessary, thus significantly
increasing Gore's chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters, meanwhile, are playing their hand carefully,
hoping to use their leverage for maximum effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very impressed by Bradley's effort to build
relationships with us,'' Teamsters spokesman Chip Roth said. At the
same time, he said, ``It may be that we would eventually endorse
the vice president.'' Roth added pointedly: ``The vice president
has not endorsed the Teamster position on the border-crossing
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, plans to be in Los Angeles this week, ready to
appear at the AFL-CIO convention and accept an endorsement that he
hopes will be a crucial boost to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bradley, who also plans to be in the Los Angeles area
next week, he said, ``If they endorse me, I'll be there.''

POPE MAY OR MAY NOT VISIT BUT IRAQIS REJOICE ANYWAY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ The very idea is raising hackles in the West.
The plan might not come off at all. But in this capital, the
expected visit is being hailed as a gift from heaven: the Pope is
coming.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Iraqi church leaders tell it, the agenda is almost
complete _ arrival as early as December, a greeting from President
Saddam Hussein, a pilgrimage to an ancient holy site, and an
outdoor Mass in Baghdad. Somewhere along the line, they say, Pope
John Paul II would visit hospitals, to show compassion for ordinary
Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that no journey has yet been announced, or that
Britain and the United States are warning that such a visit could
prove unwise. Iraq these days seems determined to redeem itself in
the eyes of the world, so what could be better than a visit from
the world's most famous messenger of mercy?
</P>
<P>
   The plan is not all fanciful. Over the summer, the pope said he
had a ``strong yearning'' to visit holy sites in the Middle East
this year and early next, to herald the coming of Christianity's
third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   And though he omitted any mention of them, his prepared text
listed several possible stops, including Ur, the ancient city in
southern Iraq that is said to have been the birthplace of the
biblical prophet Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Iraq's friends and enemies around the world have
been abuzz, wondering whether the pope will decide to make a trip
that could be seen as coddling one of the world's most repressive
dictators.
</P>
<P>
   But Baghdad itself is the kind of place where even rumors tend
to sprout into established fact. And, in the eyes of many Iraqis,
the prospect of an occasion that might (a) elevate Iraq's standing
and (b) stick a thumb in the eye of the outside world has already
blossomed into certainty that the pope will visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that he will speak for us in explaining our
suffering to the world,'' said Dr. Hikmat Dinga, 34, a physician in
a private clinic. Iraq has a population of 24 million, but no more
than 800,000 are Christians, and only a few of them are Roman
Catholics. Nearly all of the Christians _ from Chaldean to Syrian
to Armenian Catholics _ look to Rome for guidance, though, and so
Vatican officials have suggested that a trip would be at least in
part a matter of ministering to the flock.
</P>
<P>
   While Christians do have religious freedom in Saddam's Iraq, it
is the state that is omnipresent. No Christian leader, or indeed
other Iraqi, dares to challenge Saddam's authority in public.
Whether out of faith or pragmatism, most project a sense of
unabashed allegiance in meetings with foreign journalists, which
are almost always supervised by representatives of Iraq's Ministry
of Information.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent meeting with one Christian leader, Archbishop Matti
Shaba Mattuka of the Syrian Catholic Church, visitors noted that
the walls of his reception room reflected a careful balancing act.
An elegant portrait of the pope was hanging above the Archbishop's
head, but on the wall opposite, there was a much larger piece of
art: a mass-produced rug depicting Saddam in full military dress.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have criticized the visit believe that it would be
impossible to separate religion from politics on any papal journey
to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made the point that Iraq has a history of exploiting
high-level visits in an attempt to legitimize its brutal
policies,'' a British Foreign Office spokesman said of its message
to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has said the United States has expressed a
similar concern about the trip's being manipulated for political
ends. Jewish organizations and Iraqi opposition leaders have also
appealed to the Vatican, asking that the pope at least refrain from
a meeting with Saddam if he does decide to make the journey.
</P>
<P>
   As cast by church officials, the highlight of the trip would lie
far from this capital, most familiar to Westerners as the target of
periodic bombardment by the United States and its allies in the
conflict that has smoldered since the Persian Gulf War of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it takes place in December, as church leaders here
expect, or sometime next spring, as others say, the main stop, they
say, would be the visit to Ur, the ancient city 240 miles south of
Baghdad. Abraham, described in the Old Testament as coming from Ur
and as the first man to worship God, is remembered as the father of
Christianity, Judaism and Islam. But, as Iraqi officials point out,
logistics and protocol would almost certainly dictate that a papal
trip could not begin and end in the Iraqi desert.
</P>
<P>
   Only Baghdad would have the capacity to house a papal
delegation. And it would be difficult for the pope to snub Saddam
here. As Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister, put it obliquely
the other day, the pope's status as a head of state would dictate
that his reception satisfy ``certain obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials like Aziz, himself a Christian, who scent the prospect
of a public relations coup seem to find it hard to contain their
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a person like the pope comes to Iraq, he brings a lot of
people with him, a lot of media, looking at the situation, and that
will be good,'' Aziz said. ``Even people who completely hate Iraq,
when they return, they will say something less bad.''

<P>
   Iraqi church officials are already talking about a Mass in a
Baghdad stadium that could hold ``tens of thousands of people.''
They also say they are convinced that the pope will make at least
two hospital visits, to show his concern over the plight of the
Iraqi civilians who have had to endure years of U.N. sanctions from
the Gulf War era.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope the pope's visit would help convince those responsible
for imposing the sanctions of lifting them,'' said Archbishop
Emmanuel Delli of the Chaldean Church, who has been among those
involved in organizing the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the pope does share Iraqis' enthusiasm for an Iraqi
visit, those who oppose the idea could have one more card to play.
Under the current U.N. sanctions, travel to Iraq is permitted only
overland, and it seems inconceivable that the 79-year-old Pope, who
appears increasingly frail, would try to weather the 14-hour trip
to Baghdad from Jordan's capital, Amman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope has been to Cuba, where he visited Fidel Castro, who
hampered and hindered the church's activities,'' Mattuka said. ``So
why shouldn't he come here?''

COMMENTARY: CLINTON'S CONSUMER RIP-OFF
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE , Fla. _ ``You want to buy this new cable service
that's much faster than your old modem,'' my son the information
architect told me. Not wanting to become the slowpoke pundit, I
called my local cable company and ordered ExpressNet. A new black
box cost $150 and the monthly fee was $25.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, a disembodied voice called to say that the
superspeed Internet connecting service had merged with a Texas
conglomerate and if I didn't agree to the doubling of the monthly
rate, my service would end and I would be stuck with a useless $150
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   I again called my local cable monopoly. Although I never reached
a human being, its complaint software signaled that I could
continue for six months at the original rate, after which it was
double or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   This minor outrage came to mind in watching the gee-whiz,
ain't-these-big-numbers-fun accounts on television news of the
latest combinations of corporate colossi.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom, which last year bought MCI, was now swallowing up
Sprint for $115 billion. This, analysts assure us, will allow the
new supergiant to compete with AT&AMP;T, which already is plunking down
$58 billion for Mediaone with the smiling approval of roundheeled
Clintonites at the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Why are we going from four giants in telecommunications down to
two? Because, the voice with the corporate-government smile tells
us, that will help competition. Now each giant will be able to
hedge its bets in cable, phone line and wireless, not knowing which
form will win out. The merger-manic mantra: In conglomeration there
is strength.
</P>
<P>
   That's what they said a long generation ago when business
empire-builders boosted their egos by boosting their stock to buy
the earnings of unrelated companies. A good manager could manage
anything, they said, achieving vast economies of scale. As
stockholders discovered to their loss, that turned out to be
baloney.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but now, say the biggest-is-best philosophers, we're merging
within the field we know best. And if we don't combine quickly, the
Europeans and Asians will, stealing world business domination from
us. The urgency of ``globalization,'' say today's mergermaniacs,
destroys all notions of diverse competition, and only the huge,
heavily capitalized multinational can survive.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we see the old Seven Sisters of oil working their way
down toward two big sisters having fun with fungibility, and why
our former Big Seven accounting firms are headed to a Big Two.
Unchecked international combines can crush unions, water down
professional ethics, circumvent national regulation and stick it to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two startling, counterintuitive thoughts: The fewer
companies there are to compete, the less competition there is. And
as competition shrinks, prices go up and service declines for the
consumer. (Say these reactionary words at the annual World Economic
Forum in Davos, and listen to the global wheeler-dealers guffaw.)
</P>
<P>
   Who is supposed to protect business and the consumer from the
power of trusts? Republican Teddy Roosevelt believed it to be the
federal government, but the antitrust division of Janet Reno's
Justice Department is so transfixed by its cases against Microsoft
and overseas vitamin companies that it has little time to enforce
antitrust law in dozens of other combinations that restrain free
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Our other great protector of the public interest in diverse
sources is supposed to be the FCC. When MCI merged with Worldcom
last year, the chairman appointed by President Clinton, William
Kennard, took no action but direld that the industry was
``just a merger away from undue concentration.'' Now that is
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Why will the FCC, after asking for some minor divestiture,
ultimately welcome a two-giant waltz? For the same reason that the
broadcasters' lobby was able to steal tens of billions in the
public's bandwidth assets over the past few years: Clinton wants no
part of a communication consumer's ``bill of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates Bradley, Bush and Gore look shyly away lest
trust-luster contributions dry up. Only John McCain dares to say:
``Anybody who glances at increases in cable rates, phone rates,
mergers and lack of competition clearly knows that the special
interests are protected in Washington and the public interest is
submerged.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's populist message comes to you by my old, slow modem.

COMMENTARY: CHEATING THE SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The numbers are stark. The system is unfair. New York City kids
account for 38 percent of the state's public school enrollment but
get only 34 percent of the state's school aid.
</P>
<P>
   The annual per-pupil expenditure on behalf of children in the
city is roughly $8,100. The statewide average is about $9,200. This
translates into hundreds of millions of lost education dollars each
year.
</P>
<P>
   With so much less money to spend, it's no wonder city schools
are hurting. In the city there are fewer than eight computers per
100 students, and most are antiquated. Head out to the suburbs and
you will find twice as many computers, most of them up to date.
</P>
<P>
   City schools have about 90 library books per 100 students.
Downstate suburban districts have about 235 per 100.
</P>
<P>
   Only a nitwit would think this steady shortfall of money makes
no difference. Teacher salaries in New York City are among the
lowest in the state. The number of uncertified teachers in the city
is among the highest. And the teacher turnover rate is the highest.
</P>
<P>
   The blunt truth is that the state is quick to smile on the
children of the suburbs, particularly the wealthy downstate suburbs
of Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties. The motley million or
so kids in the New York City school system, most of them black or
Hispanic and many of them poor, are another matter entirely. They
are shamelessly ripped off by the state, year after year after
year. In the eyes of the power brokers, they are not as worthy of
state aid as their suburban counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been living with this for a very long period of
time,'' said Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, who noted that the
annual per-pupil allocations in Nassau and Suffolk were,
respectively, about $12,000 and $11,700 _ far higher than the
city's $8,100.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of inequitable distribution begs for a challenge,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't gotten a lot of attention, but that challenge is under
way. An advocacy group that calls itself the Campaign for Fiscal
Equity has sued the state in an effort to force changes in the
funding formulas. A trial of that suit is to begin Tuesday in state
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking for an insight into how the New York City kids
are viewed by the state need look no further than the outside law
firm hired to fight the lawsuit. It's a firm from down South _
Sutherland, Asbill &AMP; Brennan of Atlanta, Ga. _ that has built a
national reputation for fighting orders to desegregate public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   What a great idea to bring that outfit into New York and pay it
millions of taxpayer dollars (some $5 million to date) to undermine
the interests of the ethnic minorities and newly arrived immigrants
in the city's public schools. If you want to keep some poor kids
down, this is the way to do it. Call in the experts.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals has ruled that the state is not required to
provide the same level of education funding for students throughout
the state. But under the state Constitution all students have a
right to a sound basic education. In its lawsuit, the Campaign for
Fiscal Equity charges that the state, by relentlessly underfunding
the city's school system, is failing to meet its obligation to
provide a sound basic education for the city's kids. The suit also
argues that because such a preponderance of the city's students are
from ethnic minority groups, the inequities may be racially
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals has allowed those claims to go to trial,
and has indicated that it will impose remedies if the Campaign for
Fiscal Equity proves its case.
</P>
<P>
   Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of
Teachers, which is supporting the lawsuit, noted that the state is
raising its educational standards and demanding a higher level of
performance from all students.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they expect the same level of performance, which is a good
thing,'' she said, ``then we have to have the wherewithal to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to public school funding, said Ms. Weingarten,
``what tends to happen in this society is that the kids who are
wealthy get more and the kids who are poor get less.''
</P>
<P>
   That fundamental inequity is compounded by the fact that
youngsters who come from disadvantaged backgrounds and immigrants
struggling to learn a new language often need more in the way of
educational resources, not less. To provide less money for such
youngsters is not just unfair, it's perverse.

GOVERNOR RAISES BIG BUCKS FOR HIMSELF, BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At a pace never before seen in Massachusetts, Governor
Paul Cellucci is raising huge cash for his campaign war chest while
also leading a record-setting fund-raising drive for Republican
presidential hopeful George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has already surpassed his own fund-raising goals for
1999, collecting $1.3 million since January. His campaign quickly
revised its expected take for the year to $1.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   And Cellucci's push for Bush is even more successful, generating
$1.5 million from Massachusetts donors this year, $100,000 more
than the national Bush campaign had sought from the Democratically
dominated state for the entire two-year election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The sums inspire awe among the governor's political colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But amassing cash at such a clip eats into the governor's time.
Cellucci is now holding three to seven events for contributors per
week, from small breakfasts with downtown business representatives
to 300-person parties.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the focus on fund-raising is distracting Cellucci
from the tasks of governing and setting a bold vision for the
state.
</P>
<P>
   And others worry Cellucci's seeking of contributions for Bush
from corporations and special interests sends a subtle signal that
their access to the administration, and even to state contracts,
could be imperiled if they do not give.
</P>
<P>
   Some targets of the aggressive solicitations said they feel they
have little choice but to contribute. But they would not be quoted
for attribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This exceeds anything we have ever seen,'' said George
Pillsbury, director of the Massachusetts Money and Politics
Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really another way the money arms race is accelerating.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has also led an effort to raise huge soft-money
donations, some more than $100,000 each, for national Republican
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's fund-raising success is even dwarfing that of former
governor William F. Weld, who reached new heights for fund-raising
in a Massachusetts campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The money Weld raised for former California Governor Pete
Wilson, then a presidential hopeful, was a fraction of what
Cellucci is piling up for Bush, though Wilson shut down his
campaign after a frustrating several months.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the most ever raised for a Republican
presidential candidate in Massachusetts was $1.1 million for the
1987-1988 election cycle for then-Vice President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's dogged fund-raising for the younger Bush has
intensified speculation that the governor would join a Bush
administration. But some close to Cellucci brush aside the rumors,
saying Cellucci feels loyal to the Bush family and embraces the
Texas governor's blend of fiscal conservatism and inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Cellucci's appointees and advisers have written checks
for the Bush effort, including Stephen Tocco, who heads the board
of higher education; Peter Blute, who until recently was director
of Massport; Matthew Amorello, Cellucci's Highway chief; Robert
Cordy, who heads Cellucci's judicial screening committee; political
strategist Ray Howell, who holds a Massport contract; and Jeffrey
Locke, whom Cellucci made interim Department of Social Services
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many individuals from EMC Corp., a high-tech firm in
Hopkinton, which has supported Weld and Cellucci, donated to Bush.
Arthur Remillard, who heads Commece Insurance and has also helped
Weld and Cellucci, is another Bush donor.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Gray, who runs Cellucci's political operations, dismissed
the idea that donors are seeking access to Cellucci by giving. He
pointed out that with Bush a formidable front-runner in the polls,
many in Massachusetts want to back him.
</P>
<P>
   And Gray said donations to the governor are coming from business
leaders and citizens who support Cellucci's public policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who share our agenda are people we listen to,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big givers to the Cellucci campaign fund are major
Boston law firms, which often seek influence with the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers at Choate Hall &AMP; Stewart raised nearly $8,000 for
Cellucci at an early August fund-raiser, at a time when one of
their partners, Thomas F. Maffei, was a candidate for a Supreme
Judicial Court appointment. Maffei's name never made it past
Cellucci's screening panel.
</P>
<P>
   The state's construction industry, real estate interests, and
Boston's financial houses are also major sources of Cellucci
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said the governor's fund-raising reflects the broad base of
support the governor has in Massachusetts, and he scoffed at the
idea that it is excessive. Gray noted top state Democrats are doing
much the same thing, but that a far higher percentage of Cellucci's
funds are from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the top Democrats are federal officeholders who can
collect $1,000 individual donations, while state candidates are
limited to $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't any different from what Ted Kennedy or John Kerry
are doing,'' Gray said, referring to the Bay State's two US
senators. ``We're in fact working under a state law that has far
more restrictions than the federal regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury and other reformers won voter approval last year of a
ballot initiative that will provide public funding for candidates
for state office. The law will provide about $14 million in state
funds for campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci and several other major officeholders, including
Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly, a Democrat, have opted out of
the system and say they will raise their own funds.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said Cellucci does not believe public funds should be used
for campaigns. He also said Cellucci's political viability depends
on his ability to raise money to fund an ongoing political
operation. Candidates who agree to accept public funds must then
restrict their fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unilateral disarmament, because a federal officeholder
who wants to run for governor or a rich businessman who wants to
spend an unlimited amount of cash on his campaign can fund
political activities,'' Gray said.

VICE PRESIDENT PLEADS FOR HELP IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore came to the
first-in-the-nation caucus state this weekend and pleaded for his
political life.
</P>
<P>
   This is a crucial time for the vice president as he attempts to
right his listing candidacy. In Iowa, Gore's support remains
strong; in New Hampshire, he has been slipping in the polls while
Bradley has been rising. A win in Iowa could propel him to the top
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need your help,'' Gore told several hundred supporters at a
rally on the banks of the Des Moines River. ``You have a chance to
make a decisive and powerful statement that will echo and
reverberate all over the entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Gore's performance at the annual Jefferson Jackson
Democratic dinner Saturday also included a rapid-fire attack of
Bill Bradley's qualifications as a Democrat, as well as his loyalty
to farmers, teachers and working people.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more to the assault on the former New Jersey
senator than that. In his rhetoric, Gore has begun trying to defuse
Bradley's appeal by adopting the former senator's words and ideas
on the stump, echoing his opponent's call for racial unity and for
lifting the political process to a higher plane with a positive
vision for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's appropriating our language,'' charged Anita Dunn,
Bradley's communications director. ``Maybe he's decided it's a
successful approach. For Bill Bradley it's genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one Gore adviser acknowledged frankly, ``We flipped the
dialectic.'' The tactic, he said, was meant to defuse Bradley's
momentum and help position Gore as the hungry underdog.
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, Bradley has offered himself to voters as a
different kind of candidate running a different sort of campaign.
``Wouldn't it be refreshing to have more than sound bites and photo
ops when you're choosing a candidate for president?'' one black and
white poster for Bradley asks.
</P>
<P>
   His speeches on the campaign trail are consistent for his
stories of growing up in the small town of Crystal City, Mo., for
his talk about his mother and his father, for the values that
shaped him and the dreams he has for the future of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on the other hand, only recently began talking about his
mother and father, telling stories of growing up in the small town
of Carthage, Tenn., of the values that shaped him and his hopes for
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   A senior strategist for the vice president called the recent
polls in New Hampshire ``a wake-up call'' to the candidate and the
campaign, resulting in a new approach by Gore to better relate to
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere Bradley goes, he tells voters that racial unity is a
top priority for him. For Gore, the subject of race in his speeches
is a more recent addition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I'm for bringing the races together,'' Gore said at
the rally. On Saturday night and in several other recent speeches,
he told of his father taking him into the basement of a rich
neighbor's home and showing him the slave rings on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bradley says he talks about race everywhere he goes,
Gore told the Iowans here that he talks about the farm crisis
everywhere he goes. (In fact, it is a subject that rarely comes up
when he visits New Hampshire.)
</P>
<P>
   On another topic, campaigns and elections, Bradley has said that
politicians must honor and respect the people by offering a
positive vision and refraining from mudslinging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes discipline to be positive because it's easy to slip
the other way,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore opened his new campaign headquarters in Nashville
recently, he too, said he wanted to run a different kind of
campaign, offer a positive vision for the future and draw in people
who felt disenfranchised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire opening statement was Bill Bradley,'' said Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has called for debates with Bradley using loftier
language than he is known for. ``Why not use this campaign as a way
to elevate the election process to make it worthy of our
democracy?'' he now asks.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign views Gore's changing stump speech with
disdain, the mark of a politician who does not know what he's all
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Bill Bradley, the themes he's talking about and where he
needs to go haven't been grafted on him by pollsters for this
race,'' Dunn said, suggesting that Gore has borrowed the outline of
his new narrative from Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   One Gore official, however, disputes the notion that the vice
president has somehow begun copying Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys obviously have 75 percent of their issues
overlap,'' said a senior Gore strategist. ``They're running for the
Democratic nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to talking about debates and enobling the
electoral process, the strategist said Bradley should take it as a
compliment. ``I don't think we mimicked Bradley,'' he said. ``The
vice president agrees with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But primarily, Gore's visit to Iowa this weekend was a flat-out
appeal for help.
</P>
<P>
   Gore asked not just for people's votes. He also asked voters to
talk to their neighbors about him, to organize more support, to
drive friends and family to the caucus sites come January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a fork in the road,'' Gore said. ``A lot's going to
be decided by this election. And I need your help in these caucuses
because you have the opportunity to say more and do more and speak
more loudly and decisively than anybody else in the United States
of America.''

COLT'S TO CUT SALE OF HANDGUNS, HOPING TO LIMIT LIABILITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Colt's Manufacturing Co., which invented the six-shooter, the
companion of cowboys and Texas Rangers, is abandoning much of its
144-year-old retail gun business in an effort to limit its
liability in lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's, once the purveyor of the Colt .45, the ``Peacemaker''
romanticized in countless western movies, now plans to make far
fewer weapons and sell them mainly to law enforcement agencies and
the military. But it will effectively stop selling handguns to
civilians, except to gun collectors.
</P>
<P>
   One senior executive said the company was canceling seven
product lines partly because of trouble paying suppliers. But the
executive blamed the litigation for that problem, saying the
company could no longer get loans to finance manufacturing because
the lawsuits ``could be worth zero, or a trillion dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in West Hartford, Conn., faces 28 lawsuits
from cities, counties and others who hope to punish gun makers with
a strategy similar to the one used against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The change could mean laying off hundreds of the 700 workers at
the Colt's factory in West Hartford, said the a senior executive,
who refused to be named because employees have not yet been told of
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   This winter's pared-down line is to include designer sidearms,
with grips of rosewood and antelope horn.
</P>
<P>
   ``These certainly could be used for self-defense, but they
aren't made for that,'' Joseph Cartabona, Colt's director of
handguns, said yesterday. ``You take these to the range on the
weekend for target shooting, or maybe for cowboy-action shooting,
which is getting to be very, very big. They dress up like Annie
Oakley and Wild Bill and shoot'' while on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Thtrategy is reported inthe issue of Newsweek on
newsstands this week. The company sent a letter about the change to
its 19 distributors last week, and they are now notifying 3,000
dealers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the company has received warm and wide
attention for its ``smart gun'' prototype developed in 1996, which
uses a radio signal to prevent unauthorized people from firing it.
To help further insulate the company from legal liability, current
and former executives said, it plans to create a separate company,
perhaps to be called iColt, that would license the smart gun's
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of firearms manufacturers, hoping to avoid
having to turn over embarrassing documents like ones that became
public in tobacco litigation, met in Washington last month to
discuss possible settlement terms with lawyers for the cities and
counties suing them. Gun executives who attended the meeting have
said that the measures being considered include mandatory safety
devices and tighter restrictions on gun retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's officials say they have poured money into legal fees that
otherwise would be going to research and development. Sales to
civilian consumers, through dealers, were about 30 percent of
Colt's business, with the rest coming from military and law
enforcement sales, according to the company executive.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Ezell, president of the Institute for Research on Small
Arms, a nonprofit group based in Alexandria, Va., said concern
about litigation was only a part of the company's many business
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 19th century, the revolver was the peacemaker, and Colt
was the master marketer,'' she said. ``But there are so many
competitors that are doing a really good job, and their name has
not been enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the company's president, Steven Sliwa, resigned
to start the venture that is expected to introduce the Smart Gun
technology. He was replaced by William Keys, a retired Marine Corps
lieutenant general who had served on the board of New Colt Holding
Corp., which owns Colt's. Sliwa had been president for 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 30 million Colt's pistols and rifles have been sold
since Samuel Colt got a patent in 1836 for a firearm equipped with
a revolving cylinder containing five or six bullets, the Uzi of its
day. Until then, the state of the art was a single-shot flintlock
pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Today's company is the successor of Colt's Patent Fire Arms
Manufacturing Co., incorporated in 1855. Colt is said to have
thought of the revolver after watching a capstan, or circular
hoist, while serving as a seaman.
</P>
<P>
   Colt was a shrewd showman and salesman who offered engraving and
gold inlay for his firearms. He often entered his finer pieces in
international trade fairs, and presented special ones to European
kings and Russian czars.

IN VIRUS OUTBREAK, A GLIMPSE OF GAPS IN DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Sept. 23, nearly three weeks after Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani announced that New York was being attacked by a
mosquito-borne virus often found in the southern United States,
senior federal health officials convened a conference call to hear
some startling news.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist who initially identified the virus as St. Louis
encephalitis said he had changed his mind, according to an official
who was present. It was probably West Nile virus, a disease never
before seen in the Western hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned by the sudden turn, senior officials at the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention peppered their colleague
with questions. Was he sure? What testing was done? Was it
repeated?
</P>
<P>
   The officials decided not to inform New York of the new finding
immediately. They sent the scientist, Duane Gubler, back to his
laboratory in Fort Collins, Colo., to do more tests. He reconfirmed
the conclusion, and the next morning, calls went out to New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Federal public health officials were chagrined but not overly
worried by the sudden switch in diagnosis. West Nile virus is
slightly less virulent than St. Louis encephalitis. And the city
was already eradicating the mosquitoes that transmitted the
disease, whatever it was.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement caused concern among many of the scientists
and government officials who are working to strengthen the nation's
defenses against biological warfare. They saw the New York outbreak
as a dress rehearsal, a test of how public health officials could
detect and deal with the sudden spread of a disease not typically
found in the United States. To them, the missed diagnosis was
unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The encephalitis outbreak in New York is a powerful lesson for
public health authorities,'' said Alan Zelicoff, a senior scientist
at the Center for National Security and Arms Control at Sandia
National Laboratories in New Mexico. ``It is a sobering, not so
reassuring, demonstration of the inadequacies of the U.S. detection
network for emerging diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Local and federal officials agree that there is much to be
learned from New York's experience that can be applied equally to
defense against biological warfare and the emerging need to deal
with the global spread of virulent disease.
</P>
<P>
   While the public health system performed well in many regards,
officials point to several key missteps. For instance, in testing
samples from the initial victims, the CDC screened only for six
viruses common in this country. The scientists did not test for
several that have been linked to foreign epidemics or germ warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the scientist holding a key clue to the true
identity of the virus, a bird specialist who had noticed the
unexplained deaths of crows near the Bronx Zoo, could not get
anyone at the CDC to return her calls for a week. In the end, she
turned to several other government laboratories, including a
military research center, to confirm her suspicions that the CDC
had the wrong virus.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the myriad state, local and federal agencies involved
in the investigation did not always communicate well with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned about the need for, and benefits of,
improvements in laboratory coordination,'' said Scott Lillibridge,
who leads the CDC's Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Program.
``We've also learned how helpful surveillance can be, particularly
in beginning to track the beginning, extent or progress of an
infectious disease outbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several years, the federal government has invested
hundreds of millions of dollars on a national program to defend
against biological terrorism. Several officials said that in light
of New York's experiences, much more money should be invested in
the public health systems that detect epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 23, Dr. Deborah Asnis, an infectious disease specialist
at Flushing Hospital Medical Center in Queens, called the city's
Health Department with some distressing news _ two elderly patients
had come in with symptoms that looked like a neurological illness _
fever, muscle weakness and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcelle Layton, who heads the Health Department's Bureau of
Communicable Diseases, told Dr. Asnis to send samples to the state
Department of Health, and then called the CDC to warn them that
something _ maybe botulism _ was happening in New York City. As the
week went on, the number of sick people started to mount.
</P>
<P>
   The case was assigned to Gubler, one of the CDC's experts on
diseases spread by insects. His suspicions focused on St. Louis
encephalitis, which is often found in the southeastern United
States.
</P>
<P>
   To confirm his theory, Gubler tested the samples for antibodies
against six viruses transmitted by insects and commonly found in
the United States. The tests came back positive for St. Louis
encephalitis, which is a close relative of West Nile fever.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC announced on Sep. 3 that tests of blood and spinal fluid
had confirmed Gubler's suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor called a hasty news conference in Queens. His office
of emergency management took the helm and began a $6 million
campaign to wipe out New York's mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, New York City had practically cornered the nation's
supply of insect repellent, and 250,000 brochures about the disease
were printed and distributed, along with free repellent, by 500
city employees.
</P>
<P>
   And New Yorkers quickly began to debate which thing unknown to
their region they feared the most _ St. Louis encephalitis or
malathion, the insecticide that began to rain down from clacking
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bronx Zoo, officials were worrying about what seemed to
be a serious, but separate biological event. Since July, zoo
officials had been receiving calls from people in the Bronx and
Queens about dead birds. Four days after the city's St. Louis
encephalitis announcement, several exotic birds at the zoo were
dead. But not emus. And that made Tracey McNamara nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. McNamara, the head of the department of pathology at the
zoo, knew that St. Louis encephalitis, which is carried by birds
and transmitted through mosquitoes, does not normally kill the
birds.
</P>
<P>
   She considered the possibility that the birds were being killed
by another common form of encephalitis. But that disease is deadly
to emus, and the zoo's emus were thriving. Something much more
complicated was afoot, she reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The pathologist took to her lab, spending 12 hours a day
analyzing bird samples. What she found was so disturbing, she said,
that she called the CDC to alert them. The dead birds were bleeding
from the brain and had badly damaged hearts. Was a similar virus
infecting people?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had dead people and dead birds, and I thought we needed to
pursue this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also contacted the National Veterinary Services Lab in Ames,
Iowa, part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to study the
samples. Around the same time, Ward Stone, the chief wildlife
pathologist for the state Department of Environmental Conservation,
began noticing large numbers of dead crows, and alerted his
counterparts in New Jersey and Connecticut that something strange
was happening to the local bird population.
</P>
<P>
   While the CDC agreed to take some of Dr. McNamara's samples,
agency workers then did not return her daily calls for a week. ``I
got voice mail,'' she said. In fairness, she acknowledged, dead
people were taking precedence.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency seemed slow to grasp the possible link to the
birds' illness. Dr. McNamara is circumspect about criticizing her
colleagues at the CDC, but she said, ``I would say a lesson to be
learned was that there was some tunnel vision.''
</P>
<P>
   In the federal government's dress rehearsals of how a city might
detect and handle a sudden outbreak of disease, officials had
foreseen many different scenarios. But no one had anticipated an
outbreak in which crucial evidence would be uncovered by a wildlife
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``How we respond to introduced diseases in the wildlife
perspective is not very well resolved,'' said Michael Samuel, a
research project leader at the National Wildlife Health Center, a
unit of the Department of Interior, which is also researching New
York's outbreak. ``I don't know that we as a nation have a
contingency plan in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Ostroff, the acting deputy director for science and
public health at the CDC, said that confusion is a normal part of
an investigation of emerging disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who continues to maintain that there was some mistake
here doesn't understand the way science proceeds in outbreak
investigations,'' Ostroff said. ``You won't hear any apologies from
me.'' He said he was not aware of Dr. McNamara's repeated attempts
to reach CDC officials.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Bronx, Dr. McNamara was getting impatient. The
veterinary lab in Ames had already exhausted its capabilities, but
could not specifically identify the strange virus that was killing
the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. McNamara sent more samples to the CDC but she also put in a
call to the U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command,
looking for a favor. Could the laboratory, which does not usually
get involved with civilian requests, take a peek at her samples?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. McNamara, it turned out, had some chits to call in. She had
recently attended the wedding of the pathologist who performs such
tests. The lab agreed to take a look.
</P>
<P>
   The system was working, after a fashion. The military's finest
minds on bioterrorism had turned to New York's outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 21, Dr. McNamara sent the samples to the lab by
overnight mail. Within a day, the Army's unit, which is based in
Fort Detrick, Md., confirmed that a virus of a very different sort
was killing birds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the CDC was beginning to make the connections. On the
same day, officials at the agency called Dr. MacNamara and said
they wanted more material, which she sent out that evening.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 23, scientists at the Army lab told her that the tests
of bird samples for West Nile virus ``really lit up,'' Dr. McNamara
said.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC, with help from each of the labs involved, had come to
the same conclusion that same day. The next day, the agency
announced that birds were dying in New York City, and a West
Nile-like virus was the reason. The scientists strongly suspected
that the humans had been killed by the same virus, but had yet to
confirm it.
</P>
<P>
   The answer came, strangely enough, from California. The New York
State Department of Health, without telling CDC, sent some of the
brain tissue from people believed to have died of St. Louis
encephalitis to a lab run by Ian Lipkin, a scientist at the
University of California in Irvine who had bumped into state
scientists at a conference in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 24, Lipkin found that a form of West Nile virus _ which
scientists now believe is similar to a strain previously found in
Europe _ had sickened the New York patients. Soon after, the CDC
reached the same conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The words ``West Nile virus'' had little significance in New
York. But in Washington, they raised red flags among U.S.
intelligence officials who follow bioterrorism, according to a
report in this week's New Yorker magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a supposed associate of Saddam Hussein published a
book in Britain in which he claimed that the Iraqi leader had
threatened in 1997 to unleash a form of West Nile virus against his
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   A closer look at the Iraqi biological weapons program found no
evidence that Baghdad had ever experimented with the virus, and
intelligence officials, along with arms inspectors who had visited
Iraq's laboratories, concluded that the report was baseless.
</P>
<P>
   The eerie coincidence underscored what officials said was a new
reality. ``Sadly the world has changed. The threat of bioterrorism
is real and growing,'' said Dr. Margaret Hamburg, an assistant
secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services who was
previously head of the New York City Health Department. ``Whenever
a new or unexpected disease emerges in an outbreak such as this, it
would be irresponsible not to at least consider the possibility of
bioterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, the officials said, has been slow to spend money on
detecting outbreaks, even as it invests hundreds of millions in
other bio-defense efforts and vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   This year, lawmakers for the first time approved $120 million to
strengthen the CDC's programs for education and monitoring disease.
However, the $40 million set aside for improving state and local
health detection was only disbursed late last month, as a West
Nile-like virus was spreading through New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're spending hundreds of millions on questionable stockpiles
of vaccines and antibiotics,'' said Zelicoff, the scientist at the
Sandia Laboratory. ``We should be improving the ability of local
public health officials to recognize and report strange illnesses
to a central authority that can quickly tell them what to do about
it.''

CRACKDOWN ON BANKRUPTCY IS URGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The banking industry has descended on Capitol Hill
in recent months, begging for help recovering the $40 billion it
lost when 1.4 million Americans declared bankruptcy last year.
</P>
<P>
   What the industry wants: a crackdown on debtors who claim they
can't pay their bills.
</P>
<P>
   What it doesn't want: people like Juanita J., a 71-year-old
receptionist in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita, who asked that her last name not be used, is about to
file for bankruptcy, having lost her job as an administrative
assistant in 1995. She now makes enough money to get by, but if she
could only erase her $11,000 credit-card debt from buying clothes,
medicine, and food. And with the help of federal bankruptcy court,
she hopes to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only way I could see how I could lead a decent life
again,'' she said. ``If I didn't have bankruptcy to try and help
me, I just don't know where I'd end up.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit-card companies say they are sympathetic to personal
hardships that render some clients unable to pay their bills. But
they have grown increasingly impatient with the bankruptcy system,
which they say lets too many debtors wipe away credit-card debt
instead of attempting to pay it off.
</P>
<P>
   To end that practice, Congress has drafted a massive, 350-page
bill that would make it harder for debtors to escape their
credit-card bills. It would also allow the government to apply a
``means test'' to determine if applicants are as destitute as they
claim. The proposed bill, which the Senate hopes to debate this
month, is described by all sides as one of the most radical
bankruptcy proposals in years.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Credit-card companies say they are
absorbing millions of dollars from unpaid bills every year as the
number of bankruptcy applicants grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is a fundamental reform to the banking system,''
said Catherine Pulley, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers
Association, which supports the bill. ``Right now, our bankruptcy
system is in serious trouble. Right now, it's often used as a first
resort instead of a last.''
</P>
<P>
   What upsets many opponents of the measure, however, is the role
they believe the banking industry has played in creating the
mounting consumer debt. Consumer advocates blame the banks that
issue credit cards for extending thousands of dollars in credit to
many people who don't have the money to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, according to the Consumer Federation of America,
credit-card companies mailed 3.5 billion solicitations. At any
given point in 1998, the industry had extended $2.56 trillion in
debt, according to Travis Plunkett, spokesman for the consumer
federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that as the market has become more competitive,
credit-card issuers have become more aggressive and in many cases
just plain reckless in who they extend credit to,'' Plunkett said.
``Bankruptcy has risen as the extension of credit has risen, and
for the consumer credit industry to then go to Congress and
complain about the number of bankruptcies seems illogical to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pending Senate bill focuses on what should happen to
debtors who spend too much, not why they do it. The bill, sponsored
by Senators Robert Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, and Charles
E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, would address several broad
concerns, all designed to boost the advantage of credit-card
companies in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is how easy it is for average people to erase their
credit-card debt by filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7, known as
the ``clean slate'' provision because of its forgiving nature by
often erasing thousands of dollars in ``dischargeable'' debts.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Debtors who file under Chapter 7 are
required to liquidate most of their assets to be distributed among
their creditors, who are ranked by priority. ``Secured'' debts,
like mortgages, are top priority. So are ``public debts'' _ back
payments to the Internal Revenue Service, student loans, and
child-support payments. People keep paying those even after filing
for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   But credit-card debt is usually considered ``dischargeable,''
immediately erased after someone files for Chapter 7. There are
exceptions; people are prevented from charging a diamond necklace,
then declaring bankruptcy. But in almost every other case,
credit-card debt is wiped away.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, however, it would be much easier for
credit-card debt to survive bankruptcy proceedings. Any debt
accrued 90 days before filing, including interest, would have to be
repaid. Someone like Juanita, for example, could end up still owing
$1,000 on a credit card, just by charging her medicine and the
accumulating interest in the three months befong for
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   A second provision would stiffen the qualifications for Chapter
7, forcing more debtors to file under Chapter 13, where they must
submit a plan to repay creditors within a specific time frame
instead of having debt erased.
</P>
<P>
   Debtors would have to undergo a ``means test'' based on a
formula determined by the IRS. Currently, bankruptcy judges can use
their discretion to decide who qualifies by factoring in financial
burdens like medical bills and caring for elderly relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really would be a significant difference in the code,''
said Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law professor and bankruptcy
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the ``means test'' would be too inflexible and
harsh. For single mothers reliant on child support payments, it
could mean new obstacles in getting paid if the father files for
bankruptcy. ``It means alimony and child support recipients would
now have to compete with credit-card issuers for those same
dollars,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, the bill takes 1,000 cuts, all of which are
aimed at giving credit-card companies new leverage,'' said Gary
Klein, a consumer credit specialist at the National Consumer Law
Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The credit industry disagrees, saying the bill closes loopholes
for the rich. And support for tougher bankruptcy laws is not
limited to Republicans. US Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of
Massachusetts, voted in favor of a similar version in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people should have to pay their bills,'' said Frank, a
member of the House Banking Committee. ``I am for toughening
bankruptcy laws. It's only a minority who ever go bankrupt, and
those costs get passed on to the majority who pay their bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters had hoped the Senate bill would come to a vote in
late September, but Democrats blocked it, saying it ``lacked
balance'' _ too many restrictions on consumers and not enough on
the banking industry. Now, according to Senate aides involved in
the negotiations, a main stumbling block is a proposal that would
add a warning on credit-card bills spelling out the total bill _
calculating how long it would take to pay off the bill by paying
only the monthly minimum and listing what the total tab would be
with interest. The banking industry has largely opposed this
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   According to Juanita, however, such a warning could have helped
her. After being laid off at age 66, she spent two years living on
Social Security and credit cards, unaware the cards carried
interest rates as high as 19.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   She used the cards to buy food and pay medical bills, freeing up
cash to cover her $400 rent. Two years after losing her job,
Juanita reached the limit on her cards, leaving her with $11,000 in
debt. After getting a minimum-wage job, she tried cutting
unnecessary expenses, but even then she just barely made the
minimum monthly payment. After seeking credit counseling _ and
after months of what she described as harassing phone calls from
creditors _ Juanita decided to file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new legislation, she might not qualify to file under
Chapter 7 because she has a job. Juanita can't imagine being able
to handle a repayment plan required under Chapter 13 since now she
can cover only her expenses. So she wants to file for bankruptcy
before the legislation is voted on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to pay the bills off. But the way they were adding up
and going on. ... I would have never gotten out of it. There's just
no relief.''

ON BASEBALL: METS MIGHT BE ON THEIR WAY TO EQUAL RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets obviously are the stepchild of these
playoffs, the Yankees the preferred progeny. But the Mets' day is
coming. When the World Series begins in 12 days, the Mets will be
the Yankees' equal in the eyes of baseball and television
officials, who will have no choice but to show the Mets playing at
the same time and on the same network as the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   All right, so the Mets and Yankees have to get there first, and
the Mets will have a far more difficult task in getting there than
the Yankees. The way the Yankees have played postseason series in
recent years, they seem to have a pass to the World Series. Holding
the Texas Rangers, the American League's most potent slugging
machine, to one run a series in successive seasons is either a sign
of a great pitching staff working with a great scouting report or a
crying need for an immediate investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have to work for their success. Led by a manager who
seems to have a compulsive urge to induce other managers and even
some of his own players to despise him, they create obstacles for
themselves that they then have to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets recovered from a late-season losing streak just in time
to reach the postseason for the first time in 11 years. Though they
did not match their phenomenal 1998 achievement of 114 victories,
the Yankees cruised into their fifth successive postseason
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the television schedule for the four division series,
the Mets played two games that began after 11 p.m. New York time
and one game, the one in which they won the series against Arizona,
that was carried on ESPN's baby. Mets fans without cable or unable
to get New York's Channel 11 had to revert to practices of another
time, reading newspapers, to learn that their team had won their
first postseason series since the 1986 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, meanwhile, played a prime-time schedule that was so
desirable it had to be shared by two networks. If any Yankees fans
missed the final scores, it was only because the Yankees had so
much fun beating up on the Rangers, their favorite practice
dummies, that they took an inordinate amount of time doing it.
</P>
<P>
   As with the division series, the league championship series
stands to be a far more perilous road for the Mets to navigate than
for the Yankees. The Mets, after all, have to beat the Atlanta
Braves, the team that shoved them onto the precipice last month by
beating them five of six times in a 10-day span. How are the Mets
going to be able to beat the Braves four times in seven games?
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do too well this season against Atlanta,'' Todd
Pratt said in the immediate aftermath of his electrifying
series-ending home run Saturday. ``We said we wanted one more
chance. Now it's time to put up or shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   For inspiration, the Mets can look to the fate suffered by their
1988 predecessors, who beat the Los Angeles 10 times in 11 games
during the season, then lost the league playoff series to the
Dodgers. Actually, they don't have to go back that far. This season
the Mets lost seven of their nine games with Arizona but then
dispatched the Diamondbacks in the playoffs. So it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   But Greg Maddux, Kevin Millwood, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz
present a formidable array of pitchers for the Mets to overcome.
Sure, they beat Randy Johnson in the first game of the division
series, but they didn't have to face him every day. Maybe Chipper
Jones won't be so devastating with his bat this time, but ask the
Houston Astros about Brian Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves have had outstanding teams and formidable
pitchers every time they reached the league championship series,
which they have now done eight consecutive times, and they have
lost the series three times, including the last two. In other
words, there is a way to beat the Braves; the Mets just have to
find it. Again, if they seek inspiration, think of the Florida
Marlins only two years ago. They were a wild-card team, and they
beat the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees should be as formidable an opponent for whichever
team they face as the Braves will be for the Mets. Last year the
Cleveland Indians tossed a momentary fright into the Yankees by
winning two of the first three games with two more games to play in
Cleveland. But the Indians didn't win another game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have no guarantee that they will make it through to
the World Series this time, but like the Braves, they will enter
the American League series with the better pitching staff. Pitching
often dominates a post-season series. The Rangers keep finding that
out.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the Mets and the Yankees want to see
each other win so that they can revive what was once an annual
event _ the Subway Series. New York hasn't seen one since 1956,
when the Yankees defeated the Dodgers. This is the first time since
that year that two New York teams are in the post-season at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have both teams playing in the next 10 days, battling to
try and play each other is going to be exciting,'' Tino Martinez,
the Yankees' first baseman, said. ``Hopefully, we can do it and
hopefully they can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his first World Series experience last year, Chuck
Knoblauch said: ``It was crazy enough last year with just us being
in the World Series. With two of us in there, it would be scary. It
almost looks like it's heading that way. It would be crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry has played for both teams, the Mets the last
time they were in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to think how crazy would it be in New York more than
anything,'' he said of the possibility of a Yankees-Mets World
Series. ``We know we would have to play, but as far as the fans and
the rivalry between Mets fans and Yankee fans, you might not be
able to control that.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter wasn't sure if the entire city wouldn't get out of
control. ``The city would be kind of hectic,'' he said. ``It gets
crazy when one team is in it. I don't know if they'd be able to
handle it.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARAMIE, Wyo. _ The rail fence remains, a lonely span of timber
at the end of a rutted limestone trail, separating only one side of
prairie from the other.
</P>
<P>
   It was here a year ago that Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old
political science student at the University of Wyoming, was beaten
by two men, tied to the fence and left to die, perhaps because he
was gay. He was found unconscious 18 hours later by a bicyclist and
taken to a hospital, where he lived four more days.
</P>
<P>
   The brutality of the crime turned it into a national rallying
cry for hate-crime laws to recognize a victim's sexual orientation,
along with race, religion and national origin, as a basis for
prosecution. Fewer than half the states have passed such expanded
measures, and eight, including Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws at
all. A federal bill that would include sexual orientation is under
consideration by a House-Senate conference.
</P>
<P>
   But criminal justice in this old cowboy town gallops ahead.
Russell Henderson, 22, one of the men charged with kidnapping,
aggravated robbery and murder in the death of Shepard pleaded
guilty in April and received consecutive life sentences in a deal
that spared him a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday, here in the county district court building, jury
selection begins in the trial of the second man, Aaron James
McKinney, 22, who is facing the same charges and a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   While testimony is expected to provide a detailed account of
events leading to Shepard's death, it might never explain with
certainty why, as prosecutors charge, Henderson and McKinney preyed
on Shepard the night of Oct. 6, 1998, luring him out of the
Fireside Lounge on the pretense that they were gay, driving him out
of town, binding him in ropes, robbing him of $20 and his wallet,
beating him with the butt of a gun and leaving him tied to the
fence.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional theory is that Shepard's sexual orientation
offended the two in some way, and they felt a need to punish him.
In presiding over the plea bargain of Henderson, District Judge
Jeffrey Donnell said Shepard died in ``part because of his
lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judge also suggested that the crime might have been
committed for other reasons, because Henderson's statement to the
court included no mention of Shepard's homosexuality or how he and
McKinney convinced Shepard to leave the Fireside with them.
</P>
<P>
   Some explanation might emerge in the trial of McKinney, which
could include testimony by Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   But Calvin Rerucha, the prosecutor, declined to discuss any
aspect of the McKinney case, citing an order by the judge, Barton
Voigt. And neither of McKinney's lawyers returned a telephone call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   For gay and lesbian organizations, the motive was unequivocal:
Shepard was killed because he was gay. ``The evidence is crystal
clear,'' said David M. Smith, senior strategist for the Human
Rights Campaign, a national advocacy group for gay and lesbian
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But questions linger in the minds of others. The victim's
mother, Judy Shepard, said in an interview that there are elements
of her son's death she may never understand. ``I don't think there
will ever be answers to all my questions,'' Ms. Shepard said.  &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his greatest fear was that McKinney's lawyers would
wage a successful ``panic defense,'' a tactic designed to build
sympathy with the jury and lessen the penalty by portraying the
defendant as someone so offended by homosexuality that, when
approached by a gay man, he panicked and responded with violence.
</P>
<P>
   Many in this town of 27,000, where Henderson and McKinney
repaired roofs for a living, worry that it is now viewed by the
rest of the country as an outpost of intolerance and bigotry, an
image testimony could cement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think if you live in Laramie you come from a broken
home filled with hatred,'' said Joseph Bushnell, a retired
restaurant manager who now works as a computer consultant. ``Like
everybody here's from the other side of the tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Glaser, Bushnell's colleague at the computer company, said,
`'It's unfortunate the way we've been cast.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little to suggest that the Shepard killing was anything
more than a brutal but isolated event. Once a railroad town,
Laramie now exists pretty much like any other working-class city of
its size in the Rocky Mountain West, with a mix of shops, bars and
restaurants in the downtown area and strip malls beyond. The
university adds a touch of diversity to a town that is
overwhelmingly white and heterosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Crime appears to be no worse than anywhere else. Police here say
they respond to garden-variety offenses, many of them the
byproducts of too much alcohol. Murders are rare, maybe one a year,
and murders of a minority member or gay person are rarer still.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing in Laramie's recent past has resonated so widely as
the killing of Shepard, and that could say as much about the macho
nature of Western culture in Wyoming, the least populated state in
the country, as Shepard's sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the cowboy is king. At least the cowboy image is king. The
silhouetted bucking-bronco rider that serves as Wyoming's official
state symbol adorns almost everything, from neon lights over bars
to restaurant logos to license plates. Even if the number of real
cowboys is declining as farm prices fall, the image endures.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, a slightly built man at 5-foot-2, would not have been
mistaken for a cowboy. He was born in Casper, Wyo., where his
father worked as an oil rig safety inspector, but he studied in
Switzerland before returning to the United States to attend the
university here. He spoke several languages and wanted to become a
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson and McKinney were high school dropouts. McKinney was
known around town as something of a bully, and the Laramie police
say that after the two left Shepard on the fence, McKinney
assaulted a Hispanic man back in town with the same gun he used to
beat Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell, the computer consultant, said he had lived in the West
all his life, the last 10 years in Laramie. He said he knew Shepard
informally; they attended the same church now and again, St.
Matthew's Episcopal.
</P>
<P>
   He said most people in Laramie really did not know what drove
the two men to kill Shepard. ``Maybe he hit on them or maybe it was
a different type of thing and it wasn't sex,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it really doesn't matter why. He could have been a
homosexual, Jewish, black, whatever. He was a human being, and the
biggest percentage of people here have a great deal of sympathy for
human life. No matter what his preference was, to take a human
being's life is wrong.''

AFTER A 45-HOUR DRIVE, SPREWELL SHRUGS OFF HIS DETOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y._ A black Mercedes crawled through a half-full lot
until the driver behind the tinted windows rolled to a stop in a
no-parking zone.
</P>
<P>
   Out popped Latrell Sprewell, 20 minutes late. Inside the Knicks'
practice facility Sunday morning, Coach Jeff Van Gundy and General
Manager Scott Layden were waiting for him to arrive and provide an
explanation for dropping off the radar and missing all of training
camp. About 45 minutes later, Sprewell emerged and shrugged his
shoulders, as if to say, ``Why all the fuss?''
</P>
<P>
   While Sprewell understood the reason the team had to fine him
for his unexcused absences at camp _ a penalty that could reach
$40,000 _ he was not remorseful about his behavior. For one thing,
he did not find his actions so strange _ not his failure to tell
anyone of his plans to drive across the country after closing
arguments last Monday in a civil suit he faced in California, or
his refusal to return three days' worth of messages left by the
Knicks?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what agents are for,'' Sprewell said, referring to
Robert Gist. ``There was no particular reason. I really didn't call
anybody. I'm not denying I didn't call them back; I just didn't. I
thought my agent knew. But it's not like I told him, `I'm leaving
at this time, and I'm going to do this.' I'm not blaming him; it's
on me. I didn't really communicate to anybody. It's like, I'll get
there; I'll be there. It was not like I'm ditching camp. I had to
do the thing in court, and that was exhausting enough. Then, to
have to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   And drive and drive. With music as his only traveling companion,
Sprewell drove 32 hours from Oakland, Calif., to his hometown of
Milwaukee, where he pulled into the driveway at 3 a.m. last
Wednesday. On Thursday night, with his brother and a friend, he
loaded up his belongings and drove 13 more hours to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The effort could have been avoided. He was asked whether he
could have called a shipping company to move his belongings, but
made it clear that that he does things on his terms. That is how
Sprewell plays, how he drives, how he lives his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is me,'' said Sprewell, who has a $9.1 million annual
salary. ``Me, I like doing stuff myself. It can take two weeks to
ship stuff. If I can do it in a day, why wait?''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just a day, though. Sprewell missed all of the team's
training camp in Charleston, S.C., last week, and stood as a symbol
of insubordination. Although he plans to explain his actions to his
teammates, his conduct only intensifies the image of a player who
lacks respect for authority.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Sprewell choked Golden State Coach P.J. Carlesimo
and was suspended. Upon his return to the league as a Knick last
season, he grumbled about his role and often glared at Van Gundy
for playing him as sixth man. But Van Gundy and Layden made it
clear that the Knicks are not worried about Sprewell's pattern of
behavior as long as it doesn't effect his performance and the team
keeps finding a path to the National Basketball Association finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed to winning; we want him here,'' Layden said.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Knicks still intend to sign Sprewell to a
contract extension that could top $70 million. Instead of scolding
Sprewell more publicly Sunday, Layden and Van Gundy kept quiet
about the mood of the meeting and stepped around their enigmatic
guard's sensitivities. So far, Sprewell hasn't been offended. He
still wants to be a Knick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that way right now,'' Sprewell said. ``Things change,
but hopefully they won't.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sprewell has his way, he will be a starter this season. But
he also said his contract situation isn't solely contingent on his
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what the numbers look like,'' Sprewell said.
``Obviously, I want to do what's best for me.''
</P>
<P>
   With his absence last week, Sprewell set the team back in its
preparation and became a distraction as the subject of a scavenger
hunt. Privately, some members of the organization questioned the
message Sprewell was sending to his teammates about his commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to send a message,'' Sprewell said. ``People
are going to think what they want to think. I don't see any reason
why we can't hit the ground running. I'm a big part of what we do,
but I wasn't the sole reason why we got so far last year. Those
guys were a much bigger part of why we were there. We still have
time. It's not like the first game is tomorrow or in a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' first exhibition game is Tuesday. Although Sprewell
will play in Monday's open scrimmage at Madison Square Garden, Van
Gundy and Layden don't feel comfortable enough with his physical
conditioning to play him against Philadelphia one day after his
first practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit here and say I'm in great shape,'' said
Sprewell, who seemed fit at first glance today. ``But one thing
about me, it won't take long to get in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   In no time, Sprewell is likely to be embraced by his teammates
and the public. Last season, Sprewell proved he could counter a
negative image with a few menacing dunks to drive the crowds wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say, like I've always said, everyone will have their
own opinion,'' Sprewell said. ``I don't get upset about it. It
doesn't affect me.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he emerges from each scrape typically nonchalant.
Besides, if you ask him, he was never missing at all. He is just a
man who chooses his own route.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I was away,'' he said. ``I was on my way here.''

GIANTS TURN TO COLLINS, AND THE PROBLEMS GROW 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ They changed quarterbacks Sunday, but the Giants
could not change themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the mind-numbing reality of Giants football after Phil Simms,
another quarterback failed to jolt the offense from its slumber, a
trance-like sleepwalk that has made the Giants one of the National
Football League's worst offenses for five years running.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Collins made his Giants debut Sunday against the Arizona
Cardinals, but he inherited the same unimaginative attack that
produced the same predictable results.
</P>
<P>
   Ill-timed penalties, clumsy execution, a lack of poise and
questionable play-calling, it was all there in the Giants' 14-3
dreadful loss to the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' defense once again dominated a game that was lost
when the Cardinals went ahead by two touchdowns in the first half.
But neither Collins nor coach Jim Fassel had any answers for
rousing the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly embattled Fassel did not even have any answers
after the game, which is hardly a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm befuddled,'' said Fassel, whose Giants are 2-3 for a third
successive year. ``On offense, I don't know what's in their minds.
Right now, we're playing terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a refrain Fassel has issued after nearly every game this
year. Asked what was left for him to do, Fassel answered: ``I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins completed 24 of 38 passes for 202 passing yards,
although he fumbled while scrambling, which set up the first
touchdown by the Cardinals (2-3). And he was intercepted in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Collins also spent much of the day avoiding or overcoming
pressure as the Giants' offensive line played perhaps its worst
game of the season. Collins was sacked three times.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said he would not announce whether Collins or Kent Graham
would be his quarterback for next week's game with Dallas until at
least Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' offense noticeably stumbled twice Sunday in short
yardage situations that could have turned the game. On a
third-and-2 in the first quarter when the game was still scoreless,
Fassel sent fullback Charles Way _perhaps his slowest running back
_ on a pitch play around left end. Way did not gain any yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the third quarter, on a third-and-1 when the Giants
were desperately trying to get back into a game they trailed by
14-0, Fassel tried Gary Brown, another ball carrier best known for
his bull rushes up the middle, on the same play. It lost a yard.
Both drives ended in punts.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the calls, Fassel and Collins said it was a play
that had worked successfully for the Giants in past meetings with
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, it may be indicative of a Giants' offense that is
getting worse rather than better.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants also did not throw the ball downfield until late in
the game, when they were in a no-huddle offense and racked up most
of the 285 yards they produced for the game, as well as their lone
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   But Fassel dismissed the suggestion that play-calling had a
significant impact on the game, saying the Giants' lack of
execution doomed most plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter, you can call whatever you want,'' Fassel
said. ``If you're getting sacked or there's a penalty called, it
doesn't matter what you call.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point may have been the Giants' last serious
opportunity to get back in the game. Down by 11 points, the Giants
drove to the Cardinals' 3-yard line with six minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants could have gotten there sooner, and perhaps scored a
touchdown earlier, except for three penalties in the drive: one
each on tackles Scott Gragg and Romen Oben and a delay-of-game
penalty when Collins didn't call for the snap in time.
</P>
<P>
   On fourth down at the 3, Collins again lost track of the play
clock and the Giants were penalized five yards. On fourth-and-goal,
Collins and his receivers got mixed up when the Cardinals blitzed a
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Collins threw it one way, Ike Hilliard and Amani Toomer ran
opposite patterns away from Collins' throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything close to spectacular,'' Collins said. Of
the delay-of-game penalties, he said: ``That's nobody's fault but
mine. It's inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the Giants' offensive blundering was another brilliant
effort by the team's defense. It knocked Cardinals quarterback Jake
Plummer from the game with a hip pointer and bruised ribs. He was
limited to just 156 yards passing with a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, which had just 31 yards rushing, converted 2 of 13
third-down chances.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona did take advantage of Collins' first-quarter fumble.
Collins lost the ball when he was scrambling to his left; Arizona's
Andre Wadsworth knocked the ball free. With the Cardinals taking
over on the Giants' 30-yard line, Plummer was sacked on first down
but recovered to bring the Cardinals to the 1 with a 37-yard pass
to David Boston. He split Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn and Percy
Ellsworth on the play and turned each defender the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's quarterback sneak gave Arizona a 7-0 lead early in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona extended its lead just before the half ended when it
called a stop-and-go route for Boston. Giants cornerback Phillippi
Sparks fell on Boston's fake at the play's start, with Sparks also
losing his shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks recovered and was with Boston in the end zone. But Boston
is three inches taller than Sparks and was in position to jump
sooner. He wrestled away Plummer's pass from Sparks for the 11-yard
touchdown play in the corner of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' lone scoring opportunity of the first half was a
42-yard field-goal attempt, which Brad Daluiso missed wide right.
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter was more of the same for the Giants' offense,
with the ground game mildly successful _ Brown had 67 yards on 18
carries. Collins often had little time to throw as the defensive
ends Simeon Rice and Wadsworth frequently overran Oben and Gragg.
</P>
<P>
   Daluiso's 31-yard, fourth-quarter field goal was the only play
that kept the Giants from being shut out for the first time in
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who is going to be the quarterback and I'll
support any decision,'' said Collins, who quickly summed up the
doleful situation. ``We've got problems. I know that.'' &QL;

   PHILADELPHIA _ The Cowboys gave Philadelphia Eagles fans
something to cheer about yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, actually.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: Cheering erupted for an injured Michael Irvin,
diagnosed with trauma to the head and neck, and who lay motionless
on the turf of Veterans Stadium for more than 15 minutes. Irvin was
taken on a stretcher by ambulance to a local hospital and retained
overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit B: The final 1:07. This outbreak of cheering was purely
for the previously winless Eagles, producers of no offensive
touchdowns in 18 quarters, who came back from a 10-point,
fourth-quarter deficit to win, 13-10.
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that the Cowboys no longer are undefeated.
They're 3-1 and tied with Washington for the NFC East lead.
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that yesterday's game-winner for the Eagles
came on a 28-yard touchdown pass from Doug Pederson to Charles
Johnson, who split the Cowboys' safeties in zone coverage, then
dived across the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Also let the record show that a sporadic Cowboys offense, with
more turnovers (3) than scoring drives (2) in this game, allowed
the Eagles to hang around just long enough for them to steal their
first victory since Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you give a team that's hungry a chance to win in the
fourth quarter, you see a change in them,'' Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey said. ``That's exactly what happened to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The door of opportunity flung wide open with just over 31/2
minutes left in the game when Emmitt Smith was stuffed on
successive running plays, as the Cowboys twice failed to pick up
two yards from the Dallas 36. On fourth-and-four, the usually
reliable Toby Gowin shanked a 28-yard punt out of bounds at the
Eagles' 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed and upset that we couldn't make two yards
there,'' Gailey said. ``I thought we could make a first down,'' and
protect a 10-3 lead if not add to it.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Smith spoke of the obvious frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good team would close the deal,'' said Smith, who accounted
for 145 yards of offense (114 rushing, 31 receiving) but had only
14 rushing yards in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a ways to go as a ball club,'' Smith added. ``We have
to learn how to win when we have had success, and we have to close
the deal when we're up on somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   This Cowboys team reverted back to the form of last season when
the Cowboys lost games that they shouldn't have: 13-12 vs. Oakland,
13-12 at Chicago, 22-3 at New Orleans. These teams finished a
combined 18-30.
</P>
<P>
   With this victory, the Eagles become the first NFC East team to
defeat the Gailey-coached Cowboys in two seasons. Gailey brought a
10-0 divisional record into yesterday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Cowboys' three turnovers came inside the Philadelphia
25, including Smith's first-quarter fumble at the Eagles' 1. Aikman
had two interceptions, including a 24-yard pass intended for Rocket
Ismail that was picked off by cornerback Troy Vincent in the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our chances with good field position,'' said Aikman,
who finished 21-of-39 for 177 yards. He was sacked once, breaking a
string of nine quarters without a sack. ``We just weren't able to
establish anything as far as getting some momentum going.''
</P>
<P>
   But the low point came on third-and-two, with 31/2 minutes left,
when Smith never made it out the Cowboys' backfield. Linebackers
William Thomas and Jeremiah Trotter poured through the left side of
the Cowboys' offensive line, which added another patch in the
second quarter when center Mark Stepnoski (back contusion) had to
be replaced by first-year free agent Ben Fricke.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles went 62 yards the other way for only their fourth
offensive touchdown in five games this season. Pederson, 2-for-3
passing for 48 yards on the drive, finished the game a paltry
11-for-29 for 145 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles running back Duce Staley, who broke off a 19-yard run on
the game-winning drive, became the first 100-yard rusher (110 on 22
carries) against the Cowboys' defense since Stephen Davis (109 on
24 carries) in the season-opener at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the Eagles cut into the Cowboys' 10-0 lead with a
48-yard Norm Johnson field goal early in the fourth quarter, making
it 10-3 with 11:48 left, did Gailey stray from playing it close to
the vest. He ordered up a 50-yard field-goal attempt, on which
Richie Cunningham was wide left.
</P>
<P>
   With a short-field drive, as a result of the missed kick,
Johnson added a 28-yard field goal with 5:42 left, and gave the
Eagles a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this league, it's a fight every week,'' Gailey said. ``I
would hope we're hurt. I would hope we're upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Good chance they are.

EAGLES HANDED VICTORY WITH COWBOYS IN STUPOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Among the many manifestations of emotion
yesterday was a banner in the Veterans Stadium end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Embarrassed To Be A Fan,'' it read, simply.
</P>
<P>
   Must have been a Cowboys fan.
</P>
<P>
   For this was embarrassing. As well as humiliating. And
preposterous. And every other shameful adjective that a good fan
could muster after the Cowboys turned a leisurely Sunday stroll
into a 13-10 one-car collision.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Philadelphia defense seized the day. Yes, a nobody
named Doug Pederson, the league's second-lowest-ranked quarterback,
huffed and puffed and finally blew down the Cowboys' house of
straw.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was first-year Philly coach Andy Reid's first NFL win.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not quibble over the semantics. With coach Chan Gailey
leading the parade of lost sheep, the Cowboys kissed this game
away.
</P>
<P>
   They took a team that was almost willing to be beaten and handed
it a gift with all the trimmings. They took a no-class crowd, one
that cheered when a stretcher was wheeled out for Michael Irvin,
and sent them home happy.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Reid's first win may have been black magic. But he
outcoached Gailey, now, didn't he?
</P>
<P>
   ``To determine how good a team really is you have to go out
there when you're 3-0 and the Eagles are struggling,'' running back
Emmitt Smith said, standing outside of a Cowboys locker room that
seemed more resigned than angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good teams go out there and do what they have to do. They
close a team out early. We've got to learn how to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are good, but their ambitions have always been
loftier than that. And a team with Super Bowl ambitions cannot let
a mongrel like the Eagles bite it in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   A team with that kind of ambitions must take care of business.
It can't sit back and be satisfied with watching the punch-drunk,
punchless Eagles beat themselves. It can't think 10 points is
enough. It can't let a good, but not great, Philly defense dictate
its day.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly what Gailey did. The Cowboys never went for
the Philly jugular _ because, in large part, the play-calling never
went for the jugular.
</P>
<P>
   Once Irvin left the game, moreover, a pall seemed cast over the
Cowboys' bench. Which was understandable, to a degree. But the head
coach, of all people, has to bring his team's head back into focus.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey never did. In fact, he admitted, ``I don't even know what
happened the rest of that drive.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Gailey grumbled about his offense failing to
convert a third-and-two run up the middle in the game's final four
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's bad when you can't make two yards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what Gailey neglected to say was that he had also tried to
run it down the Eagles' throats on second-and-two _ with the same
result.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would not let us throw the ball deep,'' Gailey said,
explaining the day's other uninspired play-calling. ``We tried two
or three times.''
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, quarterback Troy Aikman observed, ``They
did a nice job of getting under our intermediate stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   So what was it _ the deep stuff or the intermediate stuff? Or
was the problem the running stuff, considering the patch-quilt
offensive line and Smith's resultant modest second half?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to look at the film,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   Say what? Week in and week out, without fail for eight seasons,
Aikman has stood in front of the cameras and notepads. And he has
never answered a question, to my recollection, with ``We're going
to have to look at the film.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is yesterday so discombobulated the Cowboys _ and
their head coach _ that they forgot what they came to do.
</P>
<P>
   They heard the crowd's cheers _ a new low, even for Philadelphia
_ as Irvin lay motionless on the turf, and, while it made the
Cowboys angry, they didn't respond. They heard the Philly fans boo
whenever Pederson took the field. They saw the banners, like the
one in the end zone that read, ``We want a refund.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys never could script an appropriate response.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they seemed to watch the clock like nervous schoolboyting for the 3 o'clock bell to ring. Maybe they hadn't done
their homework. Maybe the dog ate it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the dog was named Philadelphia.

STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN IN PHILADELPHIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ After he got over the disgusting sight of 66,000
fans cheering as his best friend lay motionless waiting for a
stretcher to carry him out of Veterans Stadium; and after he
learned that his best friend would be able to walk _ and most
likely play again _ Emmitt Smith could finally put a spin on a day
in which the bad news wasn't a 13-10 Cowboys loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have written the script to this,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The moon and the stars always align so surreal for
Cowboys-Eagles games. There was Barry Switzer and the
fourth-and-one game here on a frozen December day in 1995. There
was Troy Aikman's end-zone pass intercepted and returned 104 yards
for an Eagles score on the last play of a game in 1996. And there
was Tommy Hutton bobbling the snap to what would have been a
chip-shot, game-winning field goal for the Eagles on a Monday night
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was yesterday, albeit a yesterday that was
overshadowed by frightening circumstances. As Irvin said he was
having problems moving after catching a pass and landing on his
head in the first quarter, you couldn't help but think of the Daryl
Stingleys and the Mike Utleys who suffered head and neck injuries
while playing and never walked again.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as sickening a sight were the fans here in the City of
Brotherly Shove, who hoorayed Irvin's predicament, and booed the
sight of Deion Sanders praying over his fallen friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disgusted me to death,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   That was ``ignorant and stupid,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's scary moment wasn't the only ominous sign of things to
come here yesterday. The game was played in a steady drizzle and
you know what they say about Troy Aikman and the wet ball. Aikman
threw two interceptions and was incomplete on 18 of 39 pass
attempts. (Aikman, who has suffered at least two concussions on
this field, managed to avoid a third while playing behind an
offensive line that ended the game without two starters).
</P>
<P>
   On the same drive immediately following Irvin's injury, Smith,
who admitted that he was still ``filled with anger'' toward booing
Philadelphians, lost some of his focus and fumbled the ball away on
the Eagles' 1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the game, center Mark Stepnoski and cornerback Kevin
Smith went down with back injuries. The sequence of events
compromised the Cowboys' ability to throw, run, and play pass
defense.
</P>
<P>
   But if you know how bad the Eagles are, then you know the
Cowboys still should have walked away with a 40-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles have the worst offense in football. Before yesterday,
they hadn't scored an offensive touchdown since the first quarter
of the first game of the season, a span of 15 quarters. Starting
quarterback Doug Pederson was so unsure of himself after the club's
loss at New York last week that he suggested benching himself for
rookie Donovan McNabb might not be a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   For three quarters yesterday, Pederson looked like the man who
should be benched. He wildly overthrew and underthrew his
receivers. The passes that did get to the target were dropped. By
the end of the third quarter, the Eagles had more punts (8) than
points (0) or first downs (4).
</P>
<P>
   But then a funny thing happened on the way to the Cowboys' first
4-0 start in four years. Chan Gailey shut down the Cowboys
playbook, calling conservative plays instead of stretching the
Eagles defense. Then Eagles halfback Duce Staley started running
like Wilbert Montgomery and Pederson started completing passes
longer than an eyelash.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles finally put together three consecutive scoring drives
that netted 13 fourth-quarter points against a Cowboys defense that
couldn't make a play in the clutch. The winning score came on a
Pederson pass to Charles Johnson, who beat zone coverage on the
side vacated by Kevin Smith's injury.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Emmitt Smith emerged from the losing locker room with
a prayer for Irvin and a smile for the media. He wasn't willing to
make any excuses, and he definitely didn't believe that ghosts
float around during Cowboys-Eagles games.
</P>
<P>
   Or did he?
</P>
<P>
   ``...something weird always happens,'' he said, ``though you
don't have to necessarily believe in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe what?

AFL-CIO WILL ENDORSE GORE, LABOR LEADER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert new 9th graf with response from Bradley campaign;

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The president of the AFL-CIO, John Sweeney, said
Sunday that Vice President Al Gore would receive the endorsement of
the powerful labor federation at its convention this week because
two-thirds of the delegates were now committed to Gore's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Friday, union leaders said it was too close to
say whether Gore would win the federation's support this week. But
Sweeney said in an interview that the matter was clinched this
weekend when several large unions swung into the Gore column,
although only after Sweeney made an emotional appeal to labor
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The 700 convention delegates are scheduled to vote on an
endorsement on Wednesday. For months, Gore and his opponent for the
Democratic presidential nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, have feverishly lobbied labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In one-on-one meetings and at meetings of the federation's
executive board, Sweeney repeatedly argued that Gore was going to
win the nomination, so labor would be wise to support him sooner
rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has a terrific track record,'' Sweeney said in an
interview Sunday. ``He had an 88 percent pro-labor voting record in
the Senate, and as vice president, he's been in the forefront on a
lot of the social issues that matter to working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney and other Gore supporters in labor say they want to
avoid a lengthy, divisive primary that could deplete Gore's
campaign treasury and weaken him in an eventual showdown with a
Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lehane, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said the
campaign had not received any official word that an endorsement was
clinched.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to work very hard to earn the support of organized
labor,'' he said. ``The Democratic Party is about working people
and the heart and soul of that is organized labor. Clearly we would
be honored to receive the support of organized labor, and we'll
continue working for that this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for Bradley's campaign, Eric Hauser, said Sunday
night: ``It is not decided. We have been and are making the case to
labor, and we will have to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, Gore was expected to gain an early endorsement from
the labor federation, so his failure to win labor's backing would
have been a stinging setback to an already stumbling campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Labor officials did not rule out the possibility that several
unions could still reverse their positions and that Gore could
still come up short.
</P>
<P>
   But Sweeney's statement Sunday strongly suggested that Gore
would not only be spared a major embarrassment but would also gain
what many political experts say is the single most important
endorsement a candidate can receive. Few other organizations can
mobilize the way the labor federation can.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO produces millions of campaign leaflets, organizes
tens of thousands of volunteers, registers hundreds of thousands of
voters and coordinates union efforts across the nation. The
federation's endorsement is distinct from, but builds upon, the
endorsements made by the federation's 68 member unions.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, it looked as if Gore would have a hard time
nailing down a two-thirds majority because leaders of three of the
federation's largest unions, all with more than 1 million members _
the Teamsters, the auto workers and the food and commercial workers
_ said they opposed an early endorsement. In addition, another
giant union, the Service Employees International Union, with nearly
1.3 million members, was sitting on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO officials said Sunday that the United Food and
Commercial Workers and the service employees agreed to line up
behind Gore at Sweeney's urging. ``If we're going to be effective,
we have to have a united labor movement,'' Sweeney said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, several union presidents said that the most
crucial factor in Gore's effort to win the labor endorsement was
how hard Sweeney would push for it. Many leaders said they trust
Sweeney's judgment and want to avoid divisions, adding that they
would be willing to follow him if he insisted that endorsing Gore
now was the wisest course for the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   John Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees, said in an interview Sunday that his 250,000-member
union was trying to stay out of the political tug of war. But,
referring to Sweeney, he added, ``If my leader asks me to make an
endorsement, I'll follow my leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the Los Angeles convention, Sweeney
has met with dozens of union leaders, assessing their political
leanings, lobbying them for Gore and weighing whether there is
enough support to clinch a Gore endorsement. At an executive board
meeting late Friday, he made his biggest pitch yet for Gore, saying
he wanted the endorsement to happen and that Gore has been a solid
friend of labor on numerous issues, including a patients' bill of
rights and a higher minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Several unions held meetings this weekend at which their
delegates decided their position on an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been confident that Al Gore would receive our
endorsement,'' Sweeney said Sunday. ``But there's a process I have
to follow. I don't want to get too far out in front of the
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Those opposed to an endorsement have argued that there should be
no rush to endorse Gore with his campaign faltering and recent
polls showing Bradley doing better against a hypothetical
Republican opponent than Gore would. Several union officials
asserted that a big advantage of holding off was that it might
press Gore and Bradley to move closer to labor on trade and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's too early,'' said Michael Mathis, political
director of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. ``We're
trying to make very clear that we're not against Gore. We're not
for Bradley. It's just too early.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Three of the largest unions in the AFL-CIO _ the Communications
Workers of America, the American Federation of Teachers and the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees _ have
endorsed Gore and have lobbied aggressively for a quick
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should make an endorsement. That's the right thing to do,''
said Jay Mazur, a Gore supporter who is president of the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. ``There won't be
another opportunity to bring all the delegates together. We can't
talk about having influence in the Democratic Party and then stand
on the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Many union leaders noted that the federation had never endorsed
a presidential candidate so long before the November election. But
other officials said it was important to act earlier than in
previous years because the primary schedule had been moved up so
much.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rosenthal, the AFL-CIO's political director, said he would
move quickly after the Wednesday endorsement to get labor's
political troops working for Gore. ``We're beginning meetings right
away with our Iowa and New Hampshire leadership, and in New York,
California, Ohio and a number of the other early-primary states
where there is a big union membership,'' Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Several union presidents said that at a recent meeting of the
federation's political committee, James Hoffa, the Teamsters'
president, had said that unions might look impotent if they
endorsed someone now without securing more concessions from
candidates. But Sandra Feldman, president of the teachers'
federation, countered that unions would look impotent if they
stayed on the sidelines while others determined who the Democratic
nominee would be.

 BATTERY-MAKERS SCRAMBLING TO SATE THE GROWING HUNGER FOR  MORE
POWER &HT;       By HENRY NORR
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When IBM's mobile computing division tallied the
results of a recent customer-satisfaction survey, one message came
through loud and clear: Users of the company's ThinkPad notebooks
want longer _ much longer _ battery life. In fact, they raised the
issue more than twice as often as any other in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   That's a source of some frustration for Fran O'Sullivan, vice
president for development at the IBM mobile group in Raleigh, N.C.
As laptop computers go, the ThinkPad has a reputation for pretty
good battery life, and O'Sullivan said the battery's capacity has
increased 15 to 20 percent during the past year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, as fast as the company improves its batteries,
the extra energy is eaten up by larger screens, more power-hungry
processors, and new features like DVD drives and wireless modems.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, it would be easy enough to satisfy the unrelentingdemand for more power _ by building in bigger, heavier batteries.
But IBM's research also shows that customers aren't willing to make
that trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a growing ``satisfaction gap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What customers demand in terms of battery life is increasing,
and we're not reaching their expectations,'' O'Sullivan told
executives and engineers at Power '99, an annual battery-industry
conference held last week in Santa Clara, Calif. And the problem
isn't going away anytime soon: IBM expects nearly to double the
capacity of its batteries during the next two years, yet it reckons
that power demand will grow at roughly the same rate.
</P>
<P>
   Notebook computer-makers are hardly alone: Manufacturers of
cellular phones, digital cameras, personal digital assistants and
every other portable electronic gizmo are in the same boat.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's a painful paradox: High-tech manufacturers boast
that they move at warp speed, yet the battery industry still lives,
to a remarkable extent, on discoveries made decades ago. While
high-tech building blocks like microprocessors and hard drives
double in capability every year or two, battery-makers count
improvements of 10 or 15 percent per year as good &LR;   &LR; progress.
</P>
<P>
   The norm is still a 20-year lag between battery-related
scientific advances and mainstream products based on them,
according to Christina Lampe-Onerrud, associate director of
battery-industry studies at Arthur D. Little Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Some high-tech gadgets, such as most Palm organizers and Diamond
Multimedia's Rio line of MP3 digital music players, rely on
alkaline batteries, the current standard in consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   But for more complex devices, alkalines are rarely a good
solution despite their low per-unit cost, universal availability
and relatively benign impact on the environment. The main problem
is that devices like notebook computers, digital cameras and cell
phones devour power so quickly that users would need to replace
alkaline batteries every few days, if not hours.
</P>
<P>
   For such devices, there's an obvious need for rechargeable
batteries. While rechargeable alkalines have become common in
recent years, they're usually good for only 10 to 20 recharges, and
as they're charged and drained, their energy density _ power per
unit of weight _ declines rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they, too, would end up being an expensive
hassle in most high-tech products.
</P>
<P>
   That's forced tech manufacturers into a sometimes frantic search
for alternatives. Four solutions have come to the fore over the
past decade. &UR;  &LR; Today, lithium-ion is most popular in most high-tech
applications, but the other technologies still are in wide use.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the battery industry and its high-tech
customers eagerly have been looking ahead to a fifth rechargeable
technology, generally known as lithium polymer. Technically, it
should be called lithium  &LR; ion  &LR; polymer because it's really just a
variant of existing lithium ion technology; the main difference is
that it replaces the liquid electrolyte used in lithium ion
batteries with a gel.
</P>
<P>
   Because the gel is less flammable, the change will let
manufacturers create batteries with thinner walls and less
expensive safety circuitry than current lithium ion cells require.
The new material also will make it possible to design
custom-contoured and ultra-thin batteries _ Sharp Electronics
recently announced a laptop with a flat lithium polymer battery so
thin that it fits behind the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Not too far into the 21st century, ``we might even see lithium
polymer batteries so thin and flexible, they could be used as
wallpaper or printed on,'' said Lampe-Onerrud. It's not clear who
needs wallpaper batteries, but another futuristic possibility
sounds more promising: ``We could even have batteries built into
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other experts are more skeptical, though. ``Whatever
chemicals you use, whether it's polymer or anything else, how much
power you can get out of a battery depends on how much active
material there is,'' said Barry Huret, a longtime consultant to the
battery industry. ``If you make it thinner, you lose active
material. Or you have to make it wider or longer, but is that
really something people want?''
</P>
<P>
   Even in standard shapes, lithium polymer batteries have turned
out to be more difficult to manufacture than expected, and the
technology is just starting to reach the consumer market. But in
recent months, the major manufacturers have declared that they're
ready to begin volume production. The technology is especially
appealing in the cell phone industry, where thin is always in, and
in recent weeks, a slew of companies have announced new high-end
phones with lithium polymer batteries.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at last week's Power '99 conference, several speakers
proclaimed the year 2000 as ``the Year of Lithium Polymer.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one pretends that lithium polymer, at least in its
current form, will deliver what high-tech developers like IBM's
O'Sullivan want most: batteries that deliver significantly more
power without requiring extra space, weight and expense. Lab tests
of new polymer variants do show ``very high capacity,''
Lampe-Onerrud said. But since the chemistry on which the initial
polymer products are based is the sameas that in current lithium
ion cells, the transition won't produce any dramatic increase in
energy density.
</P>
<P>
   In Sharp's new lithium polymer laptop, for example, the company
had to make an important compromise to make the new battery viable:
It adopted a passive-matrix display, which saves power compared
with the active-matrix used in most quality notebooks today, but
doesn't match the latter in image quality.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most observers agree, no magic bullet that would
satisfy the ever-growing power demands of high-tech devices is even
on the horizon. That doesn't discourage Lampe-Onerrud, who expects
an accelerating series of incremental improvements in rechargeable
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot will happen in the next five to 10 years, more than in
the last five or 10,'' she said. More companies and countries will
enter the market, bringing new insights and innovations. Instead of
four or five chemical combinations for rechargeable batteries,
there could be 20, each appropriate for different types of
products.
</P>
<P>
   Again, however, other experts are not as sanguine. ``There's no
new electrolytic couple (combination of materials) that I've heard
of that will replace lithium ion in the foreseeable future,'' said
Huret. ``What I heard people saying (at the Power '99 conference)
is, `We're going to have to learn to live with what we have.'''
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan agrees: IBM projects that progress in battery-energy
density will level off after 2001. That's a scary prospect because
there's no sign that customers suddenly will lose their hunger for
new features, better performance and longer battery life in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of that prognosis, researchers are looking far and
wide for new approaches. Scientists at MIT have been studying the
possibility of using body heat or the motion of users' fingers as
they type to generate electricity. Seiko last week announced a
watch powered by body heat, but so far, no one's claiming to be
able to power a computer or phone that way.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the most likely scenario for the next decade seems
to be more of the same: Manufacturers of portable high-tech
products, whipsawed by demands for more features and longer battery
life, will continue to engage in a difficult balancing act. And
just like today, users who insist on taking the latest bells and
whistles on the road will be well advised to keep an eye on the
power gauge and a backup battery close at hand.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is the time when grown-ups in blue plastic
helmets look perfectly normal on crowded city streets. When
friends, lovers, family members and co-workers find themselves
discovering ugly things about one another. When perfect strangers
launch into passionate debates at the sight of the letters N and Y.
</P>
<P>
   New York hasn't experienced this in a long, long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   It's still too early to count on a Subway Series. (You don't
want to jinx it, do you?) There are details to take care of in
Atlanta and Cleveland _ or better still, in Boston. But the buzz is
building with every lopsided Yankees and heart-stopping Mets win.
</P>
<P>
   And so is the anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Valentino, 24, was passing through midtown Manhattan on
his way from Glen Ridge, N.J., to Shea Stadium on Friday afternoon,
when he ran into Karrien Bell, 22, a student from Newark. At any
other time, these two would have hardly noticed each other. But
Valentino was wearing an old Mets helmet he had dug out of his
closet and worn every game day for the last two weeks. Bell was in
a new, bright blue Yankees jacket and a turned-around Yankees cap.
And neither man was in a rush.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, this tiny piece of West 40th Street and Broadway might
as well have been a corner tavern and these two friendly old
antagonists. ``The most popular ride is the bandwagon,'' Valentino
was saying, sneering through his smile.
</P>
<P>
   Bell denied being a front-runner, saying he simply preferred the
better team. Then, candidly, he voiced his deepest fear: ``If the
Mets face the Yankees in the Series, they're going to win,'' he
said. ``They're more hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't make Valentino feel much better. ``If they don't,''
he said, ``I'll probably dig a hole and bury myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing would be better for New York, the saying goes, than a
New York-New York championship matchup. But nothing would be worse
for the egos of more New Yorkers. Because one team would have to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to anybody wearing a blue hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't deny the Yankees are a fantastic team,'' said
Christine Bracco, 27, a lifelong Mets fan from Bensonhurst,
Brooklyn, who cheered herself hoarse in the mezzanine at Shea after
Todd Pratt's home run Saturday that won the Mets a trip to Atlanta.
``But the fans they have take that for granted. They just are so
arrogant. You've got all your Wall Street boys with cigars and
suits, bragging like they've been fans for life. And they don't
even acknowledge that other teams exist.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Bracco sounds hurt, her wounds are fresh. Her
ex-boyfriend, Michael Farkas, is just as avid a Yankees fan. The
two parted company amicably last week, but neither denied that
their escalating baseball rivalry had been a factor in their
breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Farkas, a Brooklyn homicide prosecutor who so despises the Mets
that he rooted for the Boston Red Sox in the 1986 World Series,
says he cannot decide who are worse, the Mets or their fans. ``I
can't get over their pretty-boy attitude of the '80s,'' he said.
``I have nothing to hate about them now, except for their decrepit
stadium and ugly pastel colors. But if you grow up with hate, it's
hard to let it go. I really saw the Mets bandwagon take off in the
1980s, and that flew in the face of the history and tradition of
the Yankees. It was demeaning to baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   As any fan will explain, there are serious differences between
the followers of New York's two contenders _ beyond the fact that
Shea Stadium remains a nice place to take the kids, while the
loudest louts in the loges at Yankee Stadium have lowered the
overall tone nearly to the level of the Bleacher Creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Mets fans, in the unanimous, unbiased opinion of tens of Yankees
fans interviewed this week, are a pathetic bunch of loser punks who
will never get over their insecurities, just as their forebears
never got over their misplaced loyalty to the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to put them in their place, sweep them and get them out
of my hair, once and for all,'' said Vinnie Minichello, 39, an
accountant from Brooklyn who wore full-dress Yankees regalia to
Shea Stadium on Friday night, taunted everyone around him in the
upper deck, yet somehow made it out alive. (``He's adopted,'' his
father, Frank, kept telling people apologetically, and
untruthfully.)
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Yankees fans, according to a similarly exhaustive
informal survey of Mets fans, are a big-headed blight on the Bronx
who lack the constitution, heart and humanity to root for an
underdog, the common sense to be repulsed by the designated hitter
rule, and the adventurousness to value the unexpected over the
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too easy to be a Yankee fan,'' said Peter Badini, 53, of
Bedford Hills, N.Y., who lingered at Shea with his son after the
last game of the regular season. ``Five-nothing, 6-0, 7-0 _ it's
boring. With the Mets, it's always an uh-oh.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the fans' self-images are rich with fantasy: Mets fans see
themselves as monks, willing to endure lasting deprivation for the
sake of a future reward _ ``It makes the victories that much
sweeter,'' Badini said _ while Yankees fans like to think they are
priests guarding the flame of an ancient tradition, that they are
winners just as much as their team. It's enough to make you wonder
who's hiding what.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, people read into their chosen teams exactly what they
want, or need. So David Rosenthal, whose older brother was a
Yankees fan, needed no other reason as a boy to root for the
fledgling Mets. Coming of age in the 1960s, he began to see the
youthful Mets as the counterculture's answer to the conservative,
corporate Yankees, who at the time were owned by CBS. The Mets had
heart, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees hurt the ones they loved,'' said Rosenthal, now
the publisher of Simon &AMP; Schuster's trade division. ``They fired
Casey, they fired Yogi after they won the pennant in '64, then they
traded Roger Maris to the Cardinals, they traded Moose Skowron to
the Dodgers. The Yankees treated the ones we loved with an air of
disrespect, and that was hideous. And the Mets continued to employ
losers past their prime, which was endearing. They hired Yogi, Duke
Snider and Willie Mays in their senescence. So those of us who grew
up in the '60s got to live in the '50s all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Richard Wessler, 63, a Yankees fan who grew up in
the Midwest, suggests that people who root for the Mets because
they prefer an underdog are more likely underachievers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this comes from the immigrant experience, where the
immigrants are the underdogs initially, and then in a generation or
two, they make it and become winners,'' he said. ``But some people
make it better than others. The Yankees have got it made, year
after year. It's easier to identify with them if you've got it
made, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Wessler, the chairman of the psychology department at Pace
University, favors the blue-collar/white-collar analogy. Suggest
that watching the Yankees win all the time is boring, for example,
and he says: ``Like being a millionaire's boring. We're like
spoiled children. We're used to getting what we want: victory.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``Like a good working man, the Mets are sometimes fully
employed, but sometimes they're completely out of work. If you've
made it to a full lunch pail most of the time, but you're still a
lunch pail kind of guy, you're probably still identifying with the
underdog, and maybe feeling a little sorry for yourself that you
haven't made it to the upper echelons, to the elite. Met fans are
dealing with more uncertainty in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there are some hoary cliches, and some red herrings,
at work here. It may be convenient right now to deride the Yankees
as machinelike and invincible and lionize the Mets as thrilling
underdogs. But to do so overlooks the Yankees' long absences from
postseason play, from 1965 to 1975 and from 1982 to 1994 _ absences
during which the Mets played in three World Series and won two, the
second as the dominant power in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The supposedly deep-rooted personalities of the two teams have
changed significantly every few years, as well. What resemblance
did the hapless Mets of the early 1960s bear to the swaggering men
about town of the late 1980s, or the dysfunctional firecracker
throwers of the early 1990s? How do today's Yankees, admired for
their sublimated egos, in any way look like the creatures that
inhabited the Bronx Zoo of the 1970's?
</P>
<P>
   What was convenient about those asynchronous swings was that
whichever team did well had the New York stage all to itself. And
fans of the other team could lick their wounds in the shadows, the
Mets' by invoking the wait-till-next-year motto of the old Dodgers,
the Yankees' by reminding themselves and everyone around them of
their team's past glories.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, there is nowhere to hide.
</P>
<P>
   So we have every self-loving Yankees fan idolizing and
identifying with Joe Torre, that supremely confident Buddha of the
bench, conqueror of cancer, tamer of Steinbrenner, owner of two
World Series rings, coolly and methodically and all but inexorably
leading his men toward a third.
</P>
<P>
   And we have every self-loathing Mets fan simultaneously hating
and loving Bobby Valentine, that headline-grabbing,
costume-wearing, bubble-blowing manager with exactly nothing to his
credit thus far but longevity, the only man jumpier than Turk
Wendell, outpacing and outthinking and outblundering his opponents
but somehow still inspiring his men to survive.
</P>
<P>
   If all this keeps up, the ultimate New York psychodrama could
start at Shea Stadium on Saturday, Oct. 23.

AIRLINE'S HIGH-TECH CHECK-IN &HT;       By BENNY EVANGELISTA
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Before flying from San Jose to Portland, Ore.,
last month, Kathy Bloom got a taste of what airline passengers may
see in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom, a training manager for Santa Clara (Calif.) semiconductor
company IDT Inc., was in Salinas, Calif., visiting a plant on the
afternoon of her Alaska Airlines flight from San Jose International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Salinas, Bloom hopped on to a company computer,
logged on to the Internet, checked herself in for the flight and
printed out her own boarding pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I just took that with me to the airport, and I didn't
have to wait in line,'' Bloom said. ``I just walked up to the gate.
I thought it was slick.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, passengers like Bloom also might be able to print
out their own baggage tags from a PC, send the luggage through a
sophisticated bomb-detection scanner at the airport and board the
plane without having to stand in line or talk to an airline ticket
agent.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the vision of Alaska Airlines executives, who
are dreaming up and testing a wide variety of high-tech gadgets to
help speed passengers on and off planes.
</P>
<P>
   Using technology to automate processing passengers might be how
the airline industry deals with an increasing volume of traffic and
long lines. The number of passengers carried by U.S. airlines is
expected to grow from 614.2 million in 1998 to about 1 billion by
2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just expand ticket counters and add more space for
the queue,'' said Ed White, vice president of customer service for
Alaska Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska, a pioneer in electronic ticketing, is testing the first
online check-in system on a select group of employees of IDT Inc.,
which racks up frequent-flier miles by sending people between its
headquarters and a chip-fabrication plant in the Portland suburb of
Hillsboro.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska says the test has proven to be successful. It hopes to
make the service available to all customers as soon as next week
(week of October 17).
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's online check-in program works like this: A passenger
who already has purchased an electronic ticket online, through a
ticket agent or over the phone logs on to Alaska's Web site from a
home or office computer.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger types in an e-ticket confirmation number and
answers the standard questions required by the FAA about whether he
received something from a stranger to carry on board or left any of
his own luggage unattended. Online check-in can be done only on the
day of the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger then prints out a boarding pass and brings it to
the gate. The customer still must produce a picture identification
card, but the boarding pass has a bar code that verifies the seat
assignment in Alaska's computers.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska uses the same system for 250 self-service check-in kiosks
installed at airport terminals the carrier serves, including San
Francisco, Oakland (Calif.) and San Jose. Other airlines like
American, Delta and Continental also employ automatic check-in
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Online or kiosk check-in works if the passenger only has
carry-on baggage, but Alaska also is testing a new self-service
baggage check system in Anchorage. There, passengers also print out
their own bar-coded baggage tags and place their luggage in a
bomb-detection machine, which is monitored by an attendant.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Federal Aviation Administration has given Alaska the
green light. FAA spokeswoman Kirsti Dunn said safety inspectors who
have reviewed Alaska's plans say the carrier meets all FAA
requirements because its agents still look at passengers' photo
IDs. And luggage still must be scanned and matched to the
passengers boarding the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska also is testing a system to keep photos or fingerprints
of frequent fliers in a company database, so those passengers
wouldn't need to fumble with a driver's license at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime airline consumer advocate questioned the benefit of
using high-tech systems, which essentially shift the work of
airline employees to the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Perkins, consumer affairs advocate for the American Society
of Travel Agents, said, ``The idea of cutting down the amount of
time you spend in line is a worthwhile one.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``The idea of improving the passengers' lot by
having the passenger do more of the work is not necessarily a step
in the right direction. Sure, it'd be even better if you flew the
plane yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   A better low-tech solution might be to have more efficient
curbside baggage service, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not every airline believes that customers want more
self-service gadgets, and so far, no other carrier has plans to
start online or self-service baggage check-in.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines, in fact, has done away with its automated
check-in terminals because customers just were not using them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the airline is trying more ``low-tech'' choices, like
an extra line at the ticket counter for frequent fliers, said
United spokesman Matt Triaca. ``We've found that's what our
customers have preferred.''
</P>
<P>
   United did test a high-tech mobile check-in cart, about the size
of a hot-dog cart but ``sleeker,'' which helped ticket agents
reduce long lines at San Francisco International.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked so well, we're putting them in at all of our hub
airports,'' Triaca said.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins also said some airports were wary of the security
problems raised by allowing people to check in their own baggage or
print their own boarding passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a loophole, someone's going to try to exploit that
loophole,'' Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
   And, Perkins asked, will airlines try to shift the blame for
lost self-tagged baggage onto the passenger?
</P>
<P>
   White, who said the bar codes help Alaska Airlines keep better
track of baggage, said not all the new gadgets the airline has
tried have worked, such as a key-chain device that stored passenger
data and a wrist-mounted bar-code scanner for baggage handlers.
</P>
<P>
   But passengers could, in the future, be using wireless palm-top
devices to beam their ticket information into the airline
reservation systems.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, new airline technology is inevitable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about trying to automate the airport and eliminate
people,'' White said. ``This will take care of the simple and
routine transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still going to be people who need interaction with
our folks,'' he said. ``This is giving our people more time'' to
deal with those transactions.

SCHIZOPHRENIC BIOTECH STOCKS SOAR ON HOPE AND SWOON ON SCIENCE &HT;    By TOM ABATE
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While most of the stock market was in a summer
swoon, biotech stocks staged a strong rally in the third quarter,
according to two new studies.
</P>
<P>
   An index of 100 biotech stocks compiled by BioCentury newsletter
in San Carlos, Calif., rose 17 percent in the three months ending
September 30.
</P>
<P>
   That compares to a 6.6 percent decline in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index, a 5.8 percent drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
and a meager 2.2 percent gain for the Nasdaq composite.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise that the 12 biggest biotech companies, which
have been sizzling all year, posted a 15.4 percent gain for the
latest quarter, according to San Francisco merchant bank Burrill &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   What's more surprising is that midsize biotech stocks _ 20 firms
with market values ranging from $300 million to $1 billion _ gained
a robust 34.5 percent, according to Burrill's calculations
</P>
<P>
   Even tiny biotech firms, with market capitalizations below $100
million, gained an impressive 18 percent in BioCentury's quarterly
analysis. Even with that comeback, however, they were still off 5
percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BIOSCOPE (101533 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``We'd all like to think biotech's hot again,'' Burrill said,
``but the story really is that the top tier and the next tier are
doing better, while the small companies keep struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   A slight cooling in Wall Street's dot.com fever partly explains
biotech's rebound. Solid earnings by the top-tier firms, plus a
large number of prospective drugs pending Food Administration
approval, helped buoy investor confidence &LR;  in the sector &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   But with the vast majority of biotech firms still losing money,
and crawling through the FDA approval process, the industry lives
or dies on what we might kindly call hope.
</P>
<P>
   For example, shares of Avigen of Alameda, Calif., nearly doubled
in the quarter over excitement about its continuing trial of a gene
therapy for hemophilia. Never mind that Avigen has only tested its
therapy on a handful of patients, and hasn't said yet whether it
improved blood clotting. Investors figured the news had to be good,
otherwise the company would have halted the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Avigen has promised to report partial results of its study at a
scientific conference in December, and the news had better be good
or its stock chart will look like a bungee cord jump.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to California firms Xoma Ltd. of Berkeley
and Coulter Pharmaceuticals of South San Francisco, which faced
scientific setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Xoma had an anti-infection agent that didn't work in Phase III
trials. Coulter announced a delay in seeking FDA approval for a
cancer drug. Wall Street whacked their shares nearly in half during
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It is such sudden disappointments, arising from scientific
factors far beyond our ken, that makes biotech investing so risky _
especially for those who are simply chasing the momentum.
</P>

MORNINGSTAR OFFERS STOCK RATINGS
<TEXT>
<P>
   By HARRY DOMASH
</P>
<P>
   C. &LR; dk,1,18  &LR; Free service analyzes &QL; 
financial statements &QL; 
of public companies
</P>
<P>
   &LR; rt wrapper i  &LR; I n our heart of hearts, we know we should
examine a company's financial statements before making an
investment decision. Nevertheless, I'm sure most of us would rather
go to the dentist than dig into balance sheets and income
statements.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; x  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Now Morningstar is making us an offer we can't refuse. They will
do the green eyeshade work for us, for free.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; uncx  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Although Morningstar of Chicago ( &LR; www.morningstar.com &LR; ) is best
known for its mutual fund ratings, I doubt many investors realize
that the ratings are computer generated. There is no human
intervention in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar is applying that same principle to rating individual
stocks. Its computer analyzes just about every publicly traded
company's financial statements and gives the results in a format we
all understand: grades A through F.
</P>
<P>
   I'll use Tommy Hilfiger as an example, and compare Morningstar's
grades to what you would have seen if you actually had dug into the
financial statements. Then we'll compare Morningstar's grades for
Tommy Hilfiger with the grades for Sears.
</P>
<P>
   I used Market Guide ( &LR; www.marketguide.com &LR; ) as my source for
financial statements and related information.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; x  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Tommy Hilfiger is a well-known producer of casual clothing, shoes
and related merchandise. Its stock has suffered in recent months
(down 32 percent from its high on May 13) as market analysts have
forecast a slowdown in the retail sector.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; uncx  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Start by entering the ticker symbol or the first few letters of
the company name into the Quotes and Reports box on Morningstar's
home page. (If you entered the company name, click on the ticker
symbol.)
</P>
<P>
   Then click Snapshot on the menu on the left to display
Morningstar's analysis of Tommy Hilfiger. Company Basics describes
Hilfiger's business in considerable detail and is more interesting
than the usual cryptic outline.
</P>
<P>
   Before we get into Hilfiger's grades, look at the listing for
Stock Type, just below Industry and Sector on the right. Analysts
say companies go through stages as they progress from speculative
startup to maturity. Morningstar places each company in one of
eight parts of the cycle: speculative growth, aggressive growth,
classic growth, slow growth, cyclicals, hard asset or distressed.
You can use this stock-type rating to evaluate how a stock meets
your overall investment needs. For instance, you might find that
your portfolio is overweighted with speculative stocks.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of DOMASH11 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Morningstar classifies Tommy Hilfiger as an aggressive growth
company, meaning it has rapidly growing sales and earnings. The
rating makes sense because Hilfiger's sales and earnings rose, on
average, 51 percent, and 31 percent annually during the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar's Style Box is another aid for evaluating the
suitability of a stock. It gives you company size (small, medium or
large) and valuation (value, blend or growth) based on
price/earnings and price/book ratios. Morningstar classifies
Hilfiger as ``medium value,'' meaning it is a value-priced,
medium-size company.
</P>
<P>
   The Morningstar grades are just below the Style Box. Morningstar
grades each company in four categories: growth, profitability,
financial health and valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how Morningstar graded Hilfiger in these categories:
</P>
<P>
   &LR; x  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Growth: &LR;  A+. Morningstar looks at historical sales growth over
the past five years. Higher is better, and companies with
consistent, increasing growth rates score highest. Morningstar gave
Hilfiger the highest possible grade, an A+.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; uncx  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  When I looked at Hilfiger's growth using Market Guide, however, I
noticed that sales growth had slowed in the June quarter.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked about this, Morningstar said ``the bulk of the
grade is focused on the longer-term, just because there's so much
quarter-to-quarter fluctuation.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I think ignoring the latest quarter is a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; x  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Profitability: &LR;  A. Morningstar uses Return on Equity, a measure
of earnings compared with shareholder's equity, to measure
profitability. As in sales growth, higher is better, and a
consistent rising trend of ROE adds to the rating. Again,
Morningstar appears to give most weight to long-term results
because Hilfiger's latest reported ROE, according to Market Guide,
is 19.3 percent _ well below its 23.4 percent five-year average.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Financial Health &LR; : A_. Morningstar uses current levels and
trends of financial leverage (assets/equity), cash in the bank and
cash flows to rate financial health. It's not clear how these
factors are used to come up with a grade, so we can't tell if the
June quarter is included.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of DOMASH11 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  However, Market Guide says Hilfiger has $235 million in the bank,
$180 million of free cash flow in the last fiscal year, and
reasonable debt, so it's easy to see how the company earned a high
grade for financial health.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Valuation: &LR;  A_. Morningstar calculates fair value by adding the
current value of estimated future earnings to the book value and
then adjusting the result downward, based on how likely the company
is to achieve the predicted earnings. The valuation grade compares
the current stock price with the calculated fair value. Undervalued
stocks get the best grades.
</P>
<P>
   Using data as of October 1, Morningstar said Hilfiger was about
20 percent undervalued because the then-current $28.19 stock price
was about 20 percent below its $35.09 calculated fair value.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, Stock Selector ( &LR; www.stockselector.com &LR; ) came up
with a fair value for Hilfiger of $63.73 using the PEG method
described in our August 30 column.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's see how Morningstar grades Sears, a company beset by
problems. Sales are running below last year's, earnings growth
averaged less than 3 percent annually for the past three years, and
the company is shaking up management. The stock is down more than
45 percent from its July 1998 high. Morningstar's grades for Sears
are: Growth D+, Profitability C+, Financial Health C and Valuation
B.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar's grades make it easy to see that, based on
fundamental factors, Tommy Hilfiger is in much better shape than
Sears.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar's Honor Roll lists companies with A grades in each
of the four categories. To see the list, click Stocks on the top
menu bar, select Stock Selector, then click Preset Screens and
finally, select the Honor Roll from the drop-down menu.
</P>
<P>
   I may quibble with Morningstar's underweighting of the most
recent results, but it's giving us an analysis _ at no charge _
that most investors don't have either the time or the experience to
perform.

A MYSTERY IN LOUISIANA GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Ever since he began running for a second term,
Gov. Mike Foster of Louisiana has been dogged by one political
embarrassment and mix-up after another.
</P>
<P>
   At times, he says, he wonders whether running for office is
worth all the grief, especially when he could be down on some bayou
in Cajun country, where he grew up, hunting birds instead of votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people want me out of office,'' he said this week
while campaigning in New Orleans. ``A lot of them enjoy all this
grief I'm taking.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no exaggeration to say that the governor is taking some
political grief. What is perhaps more interesting is that despite
it, he remains a heavy favorite to win on Election Day, Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   That probably says as much about how the political game is
played in Louisiana as anything.
</P>
<P>
   The more curious and outlandish twists a contest takes here, the
more voters seem to like it, especially if there is a whiff of
corruption or dark dealing, real or imagined. As they say in
southern Louisiana, that's lagniappe, a little something extra
added to the recipe or moment at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's grief began with an incident in which the governor, a
Republican, ended up acknowledging that in his first run for
office, in 1995, he secretly bought the former Ku Klux Klan leader
David Duke's list of contributors and supporters for a whopping
$150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as the furor seemed to be dying down, along came a
federal grand jury and the state Ethics Board, asking a lot of
questions about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethics Board ordered the governor to pay a $20,000 fine for
not reporting the purchase as a campaign expenditure, but chose to
ignore accusations, denied by the governor, that what the $150,000
really bought was not access to supporters of a racist who is still
politically powerful but a promise by that racist not to jump into
the governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury wanted to know, and apparently still is
pondering, whether Duke ducked paying taxes on the $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Election Day just two weeks off, comes the strangest
and most curious campaign incident yet.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, several news organizations in Louisiana received
copies of an audio tape of a conversation the governor recently
held with a private investigator from New Orleans, Dwayne
Alexander. Who recorded the conversation and who distributed copies
of it remain a mystery, but neither the governor nor Alexander
questions the tape's authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   In the conversation, the governor, who has summoned Alexander to
his office, says he has learned that the investigator is ``spying''
on him. He demands to know who hired Alexander and why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hired to do a job,'' the investigator replies
elliptically.
</P>
<P>
   Foster tells Alexander that spying on a governor is unwise and
warns, ``If you're doing it, I don't think it's to either one of
our best interests.'' He says he will turn the tables on anyone who
tries to ``mess'' with him and will have ``a lot of fun messing
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the governor suggests that Alexander become a ``double
agent.''
</P>
<P>
   The tape ends there. But Alexander has since said he refused to
become a double agent, considers the incident over and has gone
about other work.
</P>
<P>
   Federal, state and local investigators have said they see no
reason to become involved in the dispute, that it is strictly an
issue between the governor and Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   As the governor tells it, he was ``just talking with Alexander,
no threats, just fooling around with him, feeling him out, trying
to figure out what he was up to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have to keep in mind that I've got a lot of
political enemies out there,'' Foster said on Wednesday while
talking to reporters on a visit to The Gambit Weekly, a local
tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   But probably he has nowhere near enough enemies to turn him out
of office on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all his problems, the governor has a lot going for him
besides the forgiving nature of Louisiana voters. As a result, his
challengers _ there are 11 in all _ are having big trouble finding
political traction, including the strongest of the candidates, Rep.
William J. Jefferson, a five-term Democrat from Louisiana's 2nd
Congressional District, which includes most of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the country, Louisiana, long beset by economic
difficulties, is now booming, and Foster is riding that boom. The
state's schools, among the nation's worst for many years, are now
beginning to improve, thanks in part to overhauls pushed by the
Foster administration. And the state's business and property
owners, once among the easiest targets in the land for personal
injury lawsuits, now enjoy extra safeguards, thanks to changes
pushed through by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Also, this being Louisiana, the race is not being run like most
races for governor.
</P>
<P>
   There are no primaries, only an initial contest in which all
Democrats, Republicans and independents run together. If no
candidate emerges from that with a clear majority, there will be a
runoff on Nov. 20 between the top two finishers.
</P>
<P>
   Few polls have been taken and those that have carry the usual
caveat that they were conducted for candidates. But, significantly,
not one released thus far shows the governor with less than 50
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Foster says he has ``high hopes'' he can win it all the first
time around.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson is banking on a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   A black candidate in a state whose population is 30 percent
black, Jefferson expects to get all of the black vote in the first
contest. He also predicts that he will pull enough white votes to
end up with 45 percent of the ballots cast, and he says he is
confident that the 10 other candidates together, even though little
known and short of money, will take 10 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The math on that leaves the governor with only 45 percent of
the vote at best, and that means a runoff,'' Jefferson said this
week after a campaign swing through the city. ``Come that runoff,
if I can hold my original vote and pick up roughly half of the
white vote that went to the 10 other guys, who will then be out of
the running, then I've got a real shot at being governor.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jefferson pulls it off, he will be the first black to win
statewide office in Louisiana since Reconstruction. If he falls
short, he can run again for Congress in 2000 or for mayor of New
Orleans _ his ultimate goal, many of his friends suggest.
</P>
<P>
   The big issues in the governor's race, as Jefferson sees them,
are the ``fiction'' that the governor has significantly improved
the state's schools and economy. Jefferson says that he has much of
the labor and teacher vote sewed up and that that would not be the
case if the governor had achieved all he said he had.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson says he expects to spend almost $1.5 million on his
campaign, about $1 million of it raised two weeks ago when
President Clinton came to town for a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   The governor says he will spend about $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's political professionals and political
scientists foresee an easy Foster victory, maybe not a clean-cut
win on Oct. 23, but a victory eventually, and probably a big one.
</P>
<P>
   Edward F. Renwick, who follows state political developments as
director of the Loyola University Institute of Politics in New
Orleans, says that while a reasonable mathematical case can be made
that the governor will fall short of winning 50 percent of the vote
in a crowded field on Oct. 23, he is as certain to win a runoff as
anything can be certain in Louisiana politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bet on it,'' Renwick says.

<P>
   CAMBRIA, Calif. _ All is peaceful and dark along this swath of
central California coastline nowadays. For some folks here,
especially those with bay-window views of the Pacific Ocean, that
just isn't right.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not the quietude. What has dismayed some of the
residents in this small colony of antique shops, three hours south
of San Francisco, is the unpunctuated darkness that has swallowed
their shoreline each night since that sad day in April when the
rays from the Piedras Blancas lighthouse went dark.
</P>
<P>
   Until that day, the rhythmic implosions of Pacific surf in these
parts had been accompanied, every eight seconds for the past 124
years, by a churning arm of light broadcast from the top of the old
lighthouse, towering over a craggy outcropping 13 miles to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   But strong April winds this year wobbled the gears that gave
life to the 50-year-old beacon and its 25 nautical mile beam.
Instead of repairing it, the U.S. Coast Guard station in Alameda
chose to save $20,000 and simply replace the light's 20-foot
housing with a weaker light, a simple dome roughly the size of a
police siren, that engineers bolted to a four-foot pole atop the
90-foot lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the change was inevitable. In this age of satellites and
geo-positioning software, when a mate can calculate his ship's
exact location by pushing a few numbers into a hand-held computer,
the lighthouses, like sextants, are now more essential to seafaring
nostalgia than navigation.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, to the dismay of some old souls around here, the new light
atop the whitewashed Piedras Blancas tower now blips every 10
seconds, instead of grinding around the dial, as it historically
has, every eight. Worse, the blip burrows through only 10 nautical
miles of Pacific darkness, three miles short of Cambria.
</P>
<P>
   Ask once whether they miss their light's nightly sweep, and
people in this unincorporated slice of San Luis Obispo County
shrug. Ask again, and deeper sentiments bubble up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The light is really beautiful _ was beautiful,'' recalled Hope
Fawl, a hotel receptionist who is a twilight regular on Cambria's
shoreline. ``It was a comforting feeling, something you looked for
when you went down to the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Fawl, most people who live beyond the range of the
retooled lighthouse understand the Coast Guard's need to cut fiscal
corners, and they do not complain. But they seem to know that to
the government, lighthouses are like soda fountains, features from
another era that don't fit into American life anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to a lighthouse than just shining out to sea,''
said LaVerne McDonnell, 71, who has lived in Cambria, a retirement
community of 6,100 residents just off Highway 1, since 1988. ``It's
a beautiful thing, it's something that you feel, it's not just
visual. The light gives you an emotional connection with the
land,'' she added. ``It's there, it's solid, its always flashing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their regrets, Cambrians haven't registered any official
complaints about the new light, which during the day barely
registers with the naked eye of a driver along Highway 1 or Route
46. There's good reason, it seems, for the dearth of protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who lived up there in the '40s and '50s, they've
all died,'' said Shirley Bianchi, the county supervisor, referring
to the steep golden hills north of William Randolph Hearst's famous
castle, where the bovine community outnumbers the human one. ``If
it had been in the middle of Cambria, I'm sure there would have
been a huge uproar.''
</P>
<P>
   This brings up an interesting point. The original light and lens
atop Piedras Blancas - the name means ``white rocks'' in Spanish,
an apt tribute by early explorers to the avian residue that still
cakes the huge stone escarpments that rise from the water a few
yards off shore near San Simeon _ now rests inside a towering glass
carapace in downtown Cambria.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the French-made Fresnel lens, one of only three of
its kind in the United States, illuminates the widely held belief
that American lighthouses have always meant more to the community
they served than the bureaucrats that built them.
</P>
<P>
   When the Pacific Lighthouse Board installed the light in 1874,
the 8,400-pound cast-iron casing, with its eight panes of crystal
and glass refractors and kerosene wick was an engineering marvel
that could produce the light of 1.4 million candles, according to
the Cambria Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kept in working order for decades by real live lighthouse
keepers, the light, which was switched to electricity in the 1930s,
performed more or less flawlessly until 1949, when either a storm
flooded it or something inside it cracked - the Historical Society
isn't sure which is accurate. Instead of repairing that lens, the
Coast Guard installed a new one and left the original for junk a
few yards from shore.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Cambria Lions Club rescued the rusted and
chipped lens and, with the Coast Guard's permission, mounted it on
a cement dais in town. Soon enough, Coast Guard officials in
Alameda, near Oakland, asked for the lens back. Giving away
government property, they explained, was not legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it was up there, they said, `We think we're not going to
give it back to you,' '' said Jerry McKinnon, 70, Cambria's
unofficial keeper of the lens, recalling local lore. ``We said,
`Why not? It's ours now.' They said it had an intrinsic value that
they wanted protected.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides eventually struck a deal: the government would
permanently lend the lens to Cambria if someone would insure it for
$2 million. ``What was worthless in 1949 became priceless in
1951,'' McKinnon, a former Navy engineer's mate who fought in the
Korean War, noted with a hint of irony.
</P>
<P>
   So even if the Piedras Blancas light is no longer a daily
feature in Cambria, the old Fresnel lens, resting under its glass
dome on Main Street, will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turn it on if there's somebody around,'' said McKinnon,
``like anybody who says, `I'd like to see it turned on.' ''

 FREE OFFICE FOR GROUP THAT PAID GOVERNOR'S FARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce of
New York and New Jersey paid for two trips by New York Gov. George
Pataki to Hungary a few years ago, the group was based in suburban
New Jersey and listed its address as its president's home.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it has more distinctive quarters: a small office on
the 63rd floor of 1 World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber pays no rent to the building's owner, the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey. The authority's executive
director, Robert E. Boyle, who was appointed by Pataki and is his
longtime friend, gave the furnished office to the chamber at no
charge. A similar space elsewhere in the trade center complex would
rent for roughly $6,000 a year without furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The authority also contributed $2,500 to help sponsor a trade
conference held by the chamber at the World Trade Center in 1997.
And it was not the only government agency connected to Pataki that
lent its name. The state's economic development arm also was a
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   When the governor accepted the trips in 1995 and 1996, his aides
said, the chamber was a nonprofit outfit that promoted trade with
Hungary and had nothing to gain from the Pataki administration in
return.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the governor, said Friday that
the governor had played no role in Boyle's decision to give the
chamber the office and the help with the conference. Asked whether
this assistance was linked to the trips, McKeon said, ``We are
pleased that we and the Port Authority have a good working
relationship with the chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   Monika Szarka-Elling, the chamber's president, did not respond
to two messages on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the World Trade Center address was listed on the
chamber's World Wide Web site (www.haccusa.org) as its primary
office. After The New York Times reported last month that three
large corporations with interests before the governor had made
sizable donations to the chamber and had been involved with the
Hungary trips, the address was removed from the Web site. The only
address that now appears is a post office box in Far Hills, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Morrison, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said the
authority had not offered free office space to other nonprofit
trade groups. He said Boyle gave the chamber the office _ which is
about 200 square feet _ because the chamber did valuable work, not
because it had paid for the governor's trips.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ms. Szarka-Elling approached Boyle in February 1998 and
asked for an office, and Boyle agreed. Morrison noted that the
office, which has no window, was in an area occupied by the Port
Authority staff, so even if the chamber did not use it, the
authority would not customarily rent it out. As such, the authority
did not lose money on the office, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would entertain similar requests from other nonprofit development groups,'' Morrison said, ``as long as the request is in
keeping with the Port Authority's mission to promote trade in the
Port of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Ethics Commission, which permitted the chamber to pay
for Pataki's trips to Hungary after determining that the chamber
had no business before the governor, is now considering whether to
investigate the financing of the trips.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three corporations that contributed to the chamber, the
tobacco giant Philip Morris gave the most _ $10,000 shortly before
the first trip, $10,000 a few weeks before the second and another
$10,000 a year later. The other two corporations are Bristol-Myers
Squibb, the pharmaceuticals conglomerate, and Pepsico.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides have said that he and others in the
administration were not aware of the donations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If it can be determined that the corporate donations were
intended to pay for the trips, that could be a violation of state
ethics rules barring the governor and other administration
officials from accepting gifts of $75 or more from companies doing
business with the state, even through a third party.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the chamber's use of the World Trade
Center office and the support for the trade conference would fall
under the ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority is not technically part of the Pataki
administration and the state government. It is a bi-state agency
that Pataki controls jointly with Gov. Christie Whitman of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The authority would not allow photographs of the office, which
has a desk, a circular table with four chairs, and a bookcase
adorned with a large photograph of Pataki.

FATIGUED BY TREATMENTS, O'CONNOR MISSES A CATHEDRAL MASS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Conceding the physical toll of radiation treatments,
Cardinal John O'Connor did not say Mass Sunday at St. Patrick's
Cathedral, but said in a message that he hoped to be back next
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been riding very high since my recent surgery, and
almost beginning to believe the nice things people have been saying
about me,'' the cardinal began a wry, five-paragraph missive read
to parishioners by Monsignor Jeremiah Monahan, the chancellor of
the archdiocese, at the 10:15 a.m. Mass.
</P>
<P>
   After entering Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center on Aug.
23, O'Connor underwent surgery to remove a small tumor on the
surface of his brain. After his release on Sept. 4, he began a
schedule of five weekly radiation treatments at the hospital to
minimize the possibility of the tumor recurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, but not without warning from the doctors, comes the
crash,'' he wrote. ``I used to think that I knew what it was to be
tired. After having received all but the final radiation treatment,
I now realize that at my most exhausted I could have run a marathon
compared with the tiredness that can come with radiation
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal is scheduled to undergo his final treatment Monday,
said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal ended his note to parishioners with a dash of
characteristic humor. ``Although my pride does not accept delays in
getting back to work fully, God always has the last word,'' he
wrote. ``I hope to see you next Sunday, when I feel as though I
will have reached my 300th birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his fatigue, the cardinal has not completely put aside
his public schedule, Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 4, O'Connor spoke at a dedication ceremony for St.
Vincent's Comprehensive Cancer Center in Manhattan. On Oct. 5, he
met with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas at his archdiocese residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is working every day at his residence,'' Zwilling said.
``He is celebrating Mass every day at his residence. He is still
very much in control of the archdiocese.''

A SATELLITE MODEL FOR STREAMING MEDIA;   
 ONLINE CREMATIONS  
 CREATIVE LABS ADOPTS WINDOWS AUDIO FORMAT
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla.)  (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Internet moves to broad band, the market for Internet
audio and video, so-called streaming media, is expected to explode.
But congestion associated with this bandwidth-hogging traffic can
crash Web sites, drown out conventional traffic and degrade the
quality of the sound or picture.
</P>
<P>
   And so iBEAM, a start-up backed by the likes of Intel, hopes to
address these problems with an ambitious plan to deliver
high-quality streaming media over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., begins formal
operations this week. It relies on a cable-television distribution
model: using satellite broadcast technology to take a single stream
of data and direct it to a network of server computers spread
around the Internet. The audio and video can be either delivered
live by satellite or stored on servers for delivery on demand.
</P>
<P>
   The iBEAM servers are at the edges of the Internet. So its
satellite approach, while not a remedy to congestion problems, at
least avoids the costs and congestion associated with so-called
Internet backbone networks. ``Our hope is that we will be as big as
traditional media,'' said Tom Gillis, iBEAM's assistant vice
president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than charging Internet service providers for the service,
iBEAM intends to charge only the content providers, which would
then recoup their expenditures with advertising revenues from
iBEAM's targeted advertising service. The company has already
equipped 60 Internet service providers with servers capable of Web
casting to a total audience of 300,000, with 90 more installations
expected later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many content providers have signed on, including BBC and
Bloomberg News, Gillis said, adding that MSNBC, Sony Tristar,
Warner Bros. and Warner Interactive were expected to join soon.
Gillis also said that iBEAM was in talks with the three big
television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that while iBEAM's approach was clever and
its partnerships impressive, they did not expect the satellite
distribution model to prevail in the long term. ``It's exciting,
but it's a stopgap,'' said Michael Kleeman, an independent
telecommunications industry consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, iBEAM has received more than $60 million in
investments from companies like Intel and Liberty Media and venture
capitalists like Accel Partners and Crosspoint Venture Partners,
and is close to announcing investments with Microsoft and Sony,
Gillis said.

   A Company Sells Cremations Online
</P>
<P>
   The Neptune Society, which sells cremations online, calls itself
``the hottest e-commerce Web site of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   And given the upward trajectory of Internet use and the aging of
the huge baby boom generation, Neptune Society executives may have
found a market niche. When the company began selling cremations on
the Web on Oct. 1 (www.neptunesociety.com), it said it was serving
a growing market in the most logical place.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 76 million baby boomers starting to age and pass away and
with baby boomers being one of the fastest-growing demographics on
the Internet, the Web is just a perfect place for us to be,'' said
Gary R. Loffredo, Neptune Society's vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   For those wondering exactly how to handle a cremation in
cyberspace, Loffredo explained that customers can pay for a future
service or arrange for one ``at the time of need.''
</P>
<P>
   In either case, customers can choose among options for
transportation of the body ($200), preparation of the body ($320)
and, of course, the cremation itself ($480 to $585, depending on
the container). Customers may have the ashes scattered at sea for
$75 to $575.
</P>
<P>
   Loffredo said the service was now available in California and
Florida and the company hoped to expand quickly. He attributed an
increase in sales last month to the memorial services held this
summer for John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren
Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   And in general, Loffredo said, cremation was growing in
popularity. Roughly 15 percent of those who died in the United
States in 1987 chose cremation, compared with 24 percent in 1997.
``And by 2010, it will be 42 percent,'' he said. ``What better
product to offer on line than the prepayment of the cremation
service?''

   Creative Labs Adopts Windows Audio Format
</P>
<P>
   Digging deeper into the digital music market, Microsoft said
last week that Creative Labs' Nomad II portable player, scheduled
for release in January, would be able to store and play music in
the Windows Media Audio format.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed several agreements Microsoft had
forged with equipment makers in this market. Diamond Multimedia,
the leading portable player manufacturer, announced future support
for Windows Media in June. Late last month, Cirrus Logic announced
that it was offering a new line of chips that would automatically
support the Windows Media format. Microsoft is trying to establish
Windows Media Audio as a de facto industry standard for digital
music formats that provide copyright protection. Currently, MP3,
the most popular digital audio format, does not provide such
protection all by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Labs, which says it is the No. 2 portable player maker,
would not say what brand of chip its new player would use. But
whatever the chip, the device would support Windows Media, the
company said. A company spokeswoman said the new Nomad would be
programmable, meaning that if Creative supported more software
formats in the future, customers would be able to update their
players to accept music in those formats.
</P>
<P>
   Is Microsoft sewing up the market for secure digital formats?
``Absolutely not,'' said Mark Mooradian, a senior analyst with
Jupiter Communications. ``The day when you hear five major labels
are encoding their catalogs in Windows Media and nothing else is
the day Microsoft has sewn up the market.''

GORE AND BRADLEY IN CAMPAIGN ROLE REVERSAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GORE-CAMPAIGN, GORE-AFL-CIO)  
(mk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ In an unlikely role reversal, the
front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, Al Gore,
is behaving less like a front-runner, or a vice president, and more
like a brawling insurgent. And Bill Bradley, who is the true
insurgent, is behaving more like the man to beat.
</P>
<P>
   The contrary approaches, which were on display _ in stark relief
_ on Saturday night here before 3,000 Democrats at the
Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner, reflected the extraordinary turn in
the Democratic contest. With Bradley creeping up on him, or even
outpacing him, in important states like New Hampshire and New York,
Gore is determined to do whatever he can to upend the dynamic.
Bradley, happy with his surging campaign, does not dare make any
move that could tamper with a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   So at the dinner, Gore repeatedly taunted Bradley, imploring him
to debate, while Bradley refused to engage, portraying himself as a
graybeard of Democratic politics who would travel only the high
road.
</P>
<P>
   While the strategies seem sensible, they also carry potential
perils.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to engage, Bradley opens himself up to being
portrayed as a risk-averse, aloof politician who does not have the
mettle _ or the hunger _ to fight emphatically for the nomination.
And if he succeeds in persuading voters that he is the strongest
candidate, Bradley will have to contend with a pressure most
challengers never worry about: heightened expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in discarding his front-runner's reserve, risks appearing
desperate _ and could even be accused of besmirching the dignity of
the White House. When President Bush, alarmed by Bill Clinton's
climb in the polls in 1992, reacted by deriding Clinton's running
mate, Al Gore, as ``Ozone Man,'' many Republicans said he only hurt
his cause.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by his performance on Saturday, Gore apparently had few
qualms _ or perhaps few alternatives _ about trying a new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president descended from his perch of incumbency,
stepped out from behind the lectern and looked down at his
competitor in the audience and tried a new stunt. He issued a
challenge for weekly debates. ``How about it, Bill?'' Gore needled
his rival. ``If the answer is yes, stand up and wave your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, needless to say, did not stand _ or even wave.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, as part of his new offensive, unleashed a
call to arms: ``Stay and fight!'' he cried repeatedly as hundreds
of blue and white signs bearing those words bobbed up and down at
the Polk County Convention Complex.
</P>
<P>
   The slogan, which seemed to win over this audience, pulled
together, in a simple expression, the threads that Gore has been
struggling to meld into an overarching theme: It suggested a
passion that his critics say he has lacked. It enlivened the
audience. It suggested focus and purpose _ a rationale to his
candidacy that he has not so far expressed.
</P>
<P>
   The slogan also helps Gore deal with a troubling subject: his
loyalty to President Clinton. He has tried in other unsubtle ways
to distance himself from the president's scandals, only to find
that he draws more attention to his own inconsistencies than to
Clinton's behavior. But the slogan was intended to underscore his
loyalty _ and answer critics who said he should have cut and run
during impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Gore had tried blander themes that seemed
suited for a cautious incumbent. First he trotted out, then
discarded, an abstract slogan of ``Practical Idealism.'' He then
tried ``New Horizons.'' More recently, he has been trying to utter
the mouthful that his staff stitched together after talks with
focus groups: ``Change that works for working families.''
</P>
<P>
   In another attempt to slow Bradley's surge, Gore on Saturday
portrayed him as a disloyal Democrat. He said Bradley failed the
party in its two most defining moments of the last 20 years:
Bradley voted for the 1981 Reagan budget cuts and, in 1995, he
announced he was quitting the Senate and would ``not rule out'' an
independent candidacy for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1981, when the Reagan budget cuts in education, housing and
health care threatened decency and social justice, even some
Democrats said we have to support them to survive politically,''
Gore told the crowd in an unstated but unmistakable reference to
Bradley. ``But I didn't walk away. I decided to stay and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Newt Gingrich took over Congress and tried to reinforce
Reaganomics to try to force deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, I
didn't walk away,'' Gore said. ``I decided to stay and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the words, Gore has tried to shed the White House
trappings. He has dumped the vice presidential seal that usually
hangs on the lectern; in fact, he has abandoned the lectern
altogether, edging close to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke before Gore, Bradley stayed safely behind the
lectern _and delivered the sort of safe speech preferred by
front-runners. He refused to respond to Gore's attacks. He has
resisted Gore's request for several debates. And he did not say one
negative word about the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bradley spoke loftily of his ``big ideas,'' asserting,
for instance, that ``the moral imperative for health care shouldn't
scare us.'' And he extolled the virtues of a positive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't American politics be like McGuire and Sosa?''
Bradley asked, referring to the friendly competition for baseball's
home run championship between Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa. ``Why
can't it be Vice President Al Gore pushing Bill Bradley and Bill
Bradley pushing Al Gore to be the best we can be so that the
national interest will benefit?'' He added, ``It takes discipline
to be positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when pressed, Bradley refused to be drawn into responding
directly to Gore, though he defended his loyalty to the Democratic
Party. ``I've always been a Democrat since I cast my first vote in
1964,'' he said. ``I am simply not going to deal with the darts
that are being thrown.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's barbs seemed to make the Bradley camp a bit more
defensive. When Anita Dunn, Bradley's communications director, was
asked whether he had considered running for president as an
independent, she repeatedly sidestepped the question. The closest
she came to a reply was: ``It was not a serious consideration.''
And rather than take up Gore's request for repeated debates,
something most challengers would relish, Ms. Dunn offered a
non-answer: ``There are going to be plenty of debates.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore's advisers, after weeks of discouraging
publicity, sounded excited about the new rollout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something just clicked,'' Michael Whouley, Gore's top
strategist in Iowa and New Hampshire, said of his candidate's
performance. ``This is the `Al Gore on Fire Tour.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that was wishful thinking or not, the question now is
whether either Bradley or Gore can sustain the images they are
trying to project to voters. It will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his insurgent message, Gore has tried to distance
himself from the world of politics. His retooled campaign speeches
have included passages about his being disillusioned with politics.
After Vietnam and Watergate, he has said, the last thing in the
world he wanted to do was become a politician.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore also seeks to claim the birthright of a natural-born
Democrat, delivering passionate appeals to labor, minorities,
homosexuals and other party constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   But once Gore picks up the prized endorsement of the AFL-CIO
this week, as is now expected, it might be harder for him to paint
himself as an anti-establishment outsider _ and easier for Bradley
to paint him as an entrenched insider.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, if Gore's new style appears to be catching on,
Bradley may no longer have the luxury of trying to be above
politics _ and repeated debates.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Hinton, a librarian from Fort Dodge who attended the dinner
Saturday night, said she was taken aback by Gore's debate
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was rather strange, actually,'' said Ms. Hinton,
51, who is torn between the candidates. ``That's not the way a
front-runner usually conducts himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Salvatore, a postal worker from Fort Dodge who backs
Bradley, said the vice president was in rare form. ``I was
impressed with Al Gore's speech,'' he said, ``because it was so
unlike him. He's usually so stiff.''

MILT JACKSON, 76, JAZZ VIBRAPHONIST, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., N.Y., Mich., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By   BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Milt Jackson, the jazz vibraphonist who was a member of the
Modern Jazz Quartet for 40 years and was one of the premier
improvisers in jazz with a special brilliance at playing blues,
died on Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He
was 76 and lived in Teaneck, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, said his daughter, Chyrise Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   All the best jazz musicians know how to take their time, and
Jackson was no different. Originally a singer in a Detroit gospel
quartet, he created a new sound in the 1940s by slowing down the
motor on his Deagan Vibraharp's oscillator to a third of the speed
of Lionel Hampton's; a result, when he chose to let a sustained
note ring, was a rich, warm, smoky sound, with a vibrato that
approximated his own singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came closer than anyone else on the instrument to making it
sound like the human voice,'' the young vibraphonist Stefon Harris
said Sunday. ``It's a collection of metal and iron, and we don't
have the ability to bend notes and make vocal inflections like a
saxophone. But Milt played the instrument in the most organic way
possible _ with a warm, rich sound. He set a precedent that this
instrument can speak beautiful things, and that it's not just
percussive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who was born in Detroit, had become an impressively
broad musician by the middle of his teen-age years. He had perfect
pitch, and he began teaching himself guitar at the age of 7,
started piano lessons at 11 and in high school played five
instruments: drums, tympani, violin, guitar and xylophone; he also
sang in the choir. By the age of 16, he had picked up the
vibraphone as well, encouraged by a music teacher, and sang tenor
in a popular gospel quartet called the Evangelist Singers as well
as beginning his jazz career, playing vibraphone with Clarence
Ringo and the George E. Lee band.
</P>
<P>
   Out of high school, he almost joined Earl Hines' big band, but
his draft notice intervened. In 1944, back in Detroit after two
years of overseas military service, he set up a jazz quartet called
the Four Sharps. (He admitted that he got his nickname, Bags, from
the temporary furrows under his eyes incurred by a drinking binge
after his release from the Army.) Dizzy Gillespie saw the quartet
at a Detroit bar on a swing through the Midwest, and called upon
Jackson in 1945 to join his band in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's style, then and later, came from Charlie Parker,
rather than Hampton, his most prominent precursor on the
instrument; he not only tried to achieve a hornlike legato with his
mallets, but he adopted many of Parker's rhythmic traits as well.
He was the first bona fide bebop musician on the vibraphone, and
became one of the prides of Gillespie's own band. Gillespie also
brought him to Los Angeles to fill out his sextet at Billy Berg's
club, hedging against the probability that Parker, who was in the
band and at the low point of his heroin addiction, would fail to
show up.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York in 1946, Jackson recorded some of bebop's
classics with Gillespie's orchestra _ ``A Night in Tunisia,''
``Anthropology'' and ``Two Bass Hit.'' Jackson, the pianist John
Lewis, the bassist Ray Brown and the drummer Kenny Clarke were the
rhythm section of Gillespie's band. ``Dizzy had a lot of high parts
for the brass in that group,'' remembered Brown. ``So he said, `I
have to give these guys' lips a little rest during concerts, and
while they're resting, you should play something.' '' The
development of this rhythm section's relationship led to some
recordings for Gillespie's own label, Dee Gee, by a new band known
as the Milt Jackson Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson left Gillespie and came back to him again for a period
in the early 1950s. And in 1951, with Thelonious Monk, he made
recordings that would further the idiom again, weaving his linear
improvisations around Monk's abrupt, jagged gestures on pieces
including ``Criss Cross'' and ``Straight, No Chaser.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the pianist, began to have ideas about forming a new
group, one that would go beyond the notion of soloists with a
rhythm section. He had an extensive knowledge of classical music,
had been involved in the sessions with Miles Davis and Gerry
Mulligan that would become known as ``Birth of the Cool,'' and he
envisioned a more deliberately formal feeling for a small band. In
1952, the Modern Jazz Quartet began, with Clarke as drummer and
Percy Heath as bassist. Connie Kay replaced Clarke in 1955. After a
while, Lewis became the group's musical director.
</P>
<P>
   The group wore tailored suits and practiced every aspect of
their public presentation, from walking on stage to making
introductions to the powerfully subdued arrangements in their
playing. They wanted to bring back to jazz the sense of high
bearing it had been losing as the popularity of the big bands was
slipping and jazz became more of a music predicated on the casual
jam session.
</P>
<P>
   Through two decades of immaculately conceived and recorded
albums on Atlantic Records, beginning in 1956, their vision was
borne out. Initially, they found that audiences were somewhat
startled by the authority of their quietness; eventually the group
would be one of the few jazz bands embraced by an audience much
wider than jazz fans.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lewis economized, playing small chords and creating a light but
sturdy framework for the music, and Jackson was the expansive foil,
letting his tempos crest and fall, luxuriating in the passing tones
and quick, curled runs of bebop. It was often supposed that he grew
frustrated with his role in the band; in a recent interview Jackson
said he felt that Lewis suppressed the group's sense of swing. In
1974 he left, dissolving the band until it reunited for the first
of several tours in the 1980s. Kay died in 1994, and the Modern
Jazz Quartet, with Mickey Roker sitting in for him, gave its last
performance the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being widely acknowledged as one of the music's greatest
improvisers, Jackson wrote a lot of music _ most famously the blues
pieces ``Bags' Groove,'' ``Bluesology'' and ``The Cylinder.'' He
recorded widely. He made small-group and orchestral records in the
early 1960s, collaboration albums with John Coltrane and Ray
Charles, and a large number of records on the Pablo label during
the 1970s and 1980s with Brown on bass, as well as Gillespie, Count
Basie, Oscar Peterson and others. In 1992 he began a series of
albums produced by Quincy Jones for the Qwest label; the most
recent, from this year, was ``Explosive!,'' recorded with the
Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra. The last collaboration with Brown
and Peterson, ``The Very Tall Band,'' was issued this year by
Telarc.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, of Fort Lee, N.J., he is survived
by his wife, Sandra, of Teaneck, and three brothers: Alvin, of
Queens, and Wilbur and James, both of Detroit.

<P>
   Larry Wynn, a lyricist who wrote the words for the 1941 novelty
hit ``Five Guys Named Moe,'' died on Sept. 28 at Englewood Hospital
in New Jersey. He was 89 and lived in Cliffside Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn's lyrics for ``Five Guys'' were combined with music by
Jerry Bresler, and the song was recorded for Decca by Louis Jordan
and his Tympany Five.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn, a performer and songwriter who later became a salesman in
radio and television, once said that six decades ago he had
listened to a group of musicians whose names he could not recall,
so he referred to them as ``five guys named Moe.'' In a 1992
interview with The Record of Hackensack, N.J., he recalled that he
thought at the time: ``Man! That's a title begging for a song.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote the song's words quickly. They include these lines:
``There's a brand new band sensation/That is sweeping all the
nation/Every hepcat knows them by their name.'' The lyrics also
identify the five Moes as Big Moe, Little Moe, Four-Eyed Moe, No
Mo' and Eat Mo'. The song's title later became the name for a
Broadway revue based on Jordan's song hits.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn, originally named Lester Litwin, was reared in Queens and
graduated from Washington and Lee University.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Evelyn, died in 1990.

<P>
   Dr. Sydney E. Salmon, a cancer researcher and founder of the
Arizona Cancer Center in Tucson, died on Wednesday at his home in
Tucson. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Laurie Young, a
spokeswoman for the center.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Salmon and Dr. Anne Hamburger, of the University
of Maryland, developed the first test for cloning human tumors. The
results of such tests make it possible to treat a cancer patient
with a specific anti-cancer drug instead of using a battery of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon's specialty was treating cancer of the bone marrow, also
called multiple myeloma.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the University of Arizona College of Medicine in 1972
as chief of hematology and oncology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, he established the Arizona Cancer Center at the
college. It is one of 30 comprehensive cancer centers nationwide.
He was its director until August, about 18 months after his cancer
was diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Elias Salmon was born on May 8, 1936, on Staten Island.
He moved to Tucson in 1948 and earned a bachelor's degree from the
University of Arizona in 1958. He earned his medical degree from
Washington University in St. Louis in 1962. He was an intern and
resident at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He was recruited to the University of Arizona from the
University of California at San Francisco. Earlier, he was a cancer
researcher with the U.S. Public Health Service in Boston and a
special fellow in hematology and immunology at the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon was president of the American Society of Clinical
Oncology in 1984 and 1985, and of the Association of American
Cancer Institutes in 1988 and 1989. In 1991, he was named to the
National Cancer Advisory Board.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Joan; three sons, Howard, Stewart
and Russell, all of Tucson; two daughters, Dr. Julia Salmon of
Boston and Laura Levine of Atlanta; a brother, Norman of Tucson,
and three grandchildren.

<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived for my regular hair appointment at the Joseph
Martin salon on Madison and 63rd Street recently, I was informed
there was a leak and no water. That meant the colorist couldn't
start work, but then finally word came that the water was back on
and he went ahead and applied the color.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 minutes, the timer went off, but once again the water
had stopped. With the color still on my hair and no time to spare,
the salon arranged for me and the man who was to shampoo me to go
to another salon two blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   We went off, me with my ill-fitting brown gown, a blue towel
covering my hair, sunglasses and a look of a creature from
somewhere else. I walked with my head down, hoping no one would
recognize me.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived at our destination, my hair was washed and we began
walking back to my original salon. We passed a man in a wheelchair
whose habit for years has been to sit in front of a coffee shop. My
friends and I have always tried to help him out. Despite my
disguise, he spotted me. ``Hi, sweetheart,'' he said, ``How are you
doing today?''
</P>
<P>
   There was not another soul who even glanced my way. Apparently
no one even thought I looked unusual. That made me wonder about
being a New Yorker and a woman over 50. Are we so invisible?

   I am a frequent shopper on the Lower East Side and have a
special appreciation of good pickles.
</P>
<P>
   As my order was being packed on a recent expedition, I noticed a
woman with a very confused look perusing the assorted barrels. When
her turn came, she asked the pickle man, in a very British accent,
what was the difference among the pickles? He, in fast New Yorkese,
replied ``Quarter sour, half sour, three-quarter sour and full
sour.'' Looking even more perplexed, the woman asked, ``What would
you recommend for beginners?''
</P>
<P>
   He told her she could buy three for $1 and suggested she try
three different ones. Sounding very relieved, she happily went off
with her assortment. Now I wonder if after tasting them, she will
be able to tell which is which and if she'll return as an
intermediate pickle purchaser?

looking over her license and passport. When she returned to her
hostess's apartment, she studied the contents of the packet she had
been given and discovered that the car had been leased to ``Mrs.

married and he's in trouble? If so, what did he do? Are they just
friends and he can't make the big commitment? If so, why go to the
expense of hiring skywriters? Did he pound at her door and she
didn't let him in? What if she never looked up?

MCCAIN (Phoenix) _ Sen. John McCain's wife, Cindy, bared her soul
on national television Sunday, telling how she was addicted to
painkillers and stole pills from the relief agency she founded. It
was not a new admission for Mrs. McCain. Though she admits she took
the drugs from the relief organization, Cindy McCain emphasised
that no needy person failed to receive medicine because of her
addiction. By BILL MULLER. Story will move in the ``A'' category.

   GORE (Phoenix) _ The last time Vice President Al Gore campaigned
in Arizona, he was jubilant because he and his boss, President
Clinton, were sweeping to an easy re-election that included a
historic victory in Arizona. Today, Gore will return as a
presidential candidate in his own right, making a brief swing
through Phoenix to scoop up campaign cash for his unexpectedly
tight Democratic primary battle against former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley. Gore, scheduled to arrive in Phoenix in the morning, will
tour a local school to highlight school overcrowding, then attend a
$250-a-person fund-raiser. Story by KRIS MAYES. Story will move in

<P>
   BIOSPHERE (Tucson, Ariz.) _ It's been a long, strange trip _
from desert ``eco-cult'' to reputable research center. But in eight
years, the massive glass-and-steel pyramid and eggshell-like
buildings of Biosphere 2 have emerged as a genuine educational and
scientific proving ground. ``I'm a very reputable scientist, and I
endorse 100 percent what's going on out there,'' said Wally
Broecker, a geochemist at Columbia University in New York. By KERRY
FEHR-SNYDER. Story will move in the ``A'' category.

<P>
   WATERPACT (Phoenix) _ If water is power _ and in the arid West,
water is everything _ the balance of power in Arizona is about to
shift. State and federal negotiators are working on an agreement
that could leave 10 Indian tribes in control of nearly half the
Colorado River water that flows through the Central Arizona Project
Canal. It's enough water to serve an urban population of more than
3 million, and someday it just might. The Clinton administration is
determined to see that the tribes get water. Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt has made it clear that he will use his authority to
take the water from the state if talks fail. Arizona officials
believe some sort of agreement is in everyone's best interest. The
tribes, which want the water to settle decades-old claims against
the federal government, likely would lease some of their bounty
back to farmers,who stand to lose the most in the deal, or to
cities thirsty to accommodate new growth. BY SHAUN MCKINNON. Story

MOVE ALONG, A VIP NEEDS YOUR SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the mayor and the police are determined to
continue Operation Move Along, the campaign against double-parking,
they might at least give it an honest name. This should be known as
Operation Get Out of My Space. It's like Captain Kidd leading a
campaign against piracy.
</P>
<P>
   While the officers of the 24th Precinct were blitzing the Upper
West Side with double-parking tickets last week, their personal
cars were double- and triple-parked outside the station house on
100th Street. Meanwhile, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and City Council
members were parking for free in their own reserved spots and in
the many curbside zones set aside for various kinds of permit
holders.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders have broad permits good in all the zones,
because in an emergency it is absolutely vital for them to reach
the scene while television cameras are still rolling. The zones are
also reserved for the personal cars of other essential public
servants, like gym teachers who would have to risk commuting by
mass transit if there weren't curbside spaces outside schools.
</P>
<P>
   The city gives out permits to teachers, police officers,
firefighters, municipal bureaucrats, journalists (not me, alas) and
assorted others _ 140,000 in all, which helps explain why the rest
of us end up double-parked. Through those VIP zones and other
giveaways, New York's officials have made a congested mess of the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we waste our public space is inexcusable,'' said John
Kaehny, the executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a
group that promotes alternatives to automobiles. ``Whether you're
an environmentalist like me who wants to reduce the number of cars
here, or whether you think the car is the ideal form of urban
transportation, you have to be appalled at our irrational policies
on parking.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, New York officials have simultaneously discouraged
the construction of parking garages and frittered away the spots on
the street. Besides giving away spots to municipal workers, the
city has marked off loading zones where commercial vehicles can
park for free.
</P>
<P>
   The zones can be legally used only for a brief time while
freight is being unloaded, but they've become private parking lots
for commuting merchants. A study by the Department of
Transportation found a quarter of the commercial spaces occupied by
vehicles used by merchants for commuting. With those vans hogging
the curb all day, working trucks are forced to double-park and clog
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   We need to find a more logical way to allocate the finite space
on the street,'' said Elliot G. Sander, director of the Center for
Transportation Policy and Management at New York University. Four
years ago, when he was the city's transportation commissioner, he
and business leaders developed a solution: a plan for charging
commercial vehicles in midtown for the time they spend at the curb.
But the city has yet to implement it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of rationally pricing scarce space, the city is
basically subjecting drivers to a negative lottery,'' said Charles
Komanoff, a trustee of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a
consortium of planning groups. ``A few are haphazardly given
tickets for double-parking even though they have no alternative,
just as a few get ticketed for getting stuck in clogged
intersections. Drivers are being randomly punished just for showing
up.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Kaehny would like to see drivers pay market prices for
the real estate they occupy, which would lead to higher rates at
parking meters and an end to free parking on many residential
streets. The curbside spaces might be allocated by auctioning
permits. There could also be bidding by nondrivers, like a street
vendor who wanted to rent a curbside spot, or a neighborhood group
wishing to restore a block to its preautomobile elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1950, it was illegal to park overnight in Manhattan, which
is why the old cityscapes show gracefully uncluttered streets. Many
of the sidewalks were much wider than today's and adorned with
greenery.
</P>
<P>
   The city's pedestrian majority, as Police Commissioner Arthur
Wallander approvingly observed in 1947, was firmly opposed to ``the
public streets being used as garages.'' But the city's politicians
had their own cars to park and favors to hand out. So some of the
world's most expensive real estate has ended up being used to store
hulks of metal, at unbeatable prices.

EDITORIAL: A BETTER WAY TO TREAT THE OLD
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 11:
</P>
<P>
   At a Roman Catholic nursing home in Albany, N.Y. a year ago, the
order of Carmelite nuns that runs it broke from tradition by asking
the aged applicants who were about to become residents: ``What time
do you like to get up in the morning? When do you like to have
breakfast? What do you like to eat?'' The Teresian Home had decided
to end the tyranny of structure and schedule that herds old people
through the day in nursing homes across the country: up at 6:30
a.m., dressed for breakfast at 7:30 to 9, lunch at noon in a dining
room with scores of others, showers at a certain time, naps at a
certain time, dinner at 5 to 5:30 p.m. and back in bed by 8, two to
a room, on long hallways.
</P>
<P>
   In Fairport, N.Y., on the Erie Canal, the Fairport Baptist Home
decided about four years ago to break that same rigid pattern. At
meals where 42 Alzheimer's patients were fed all at once, in chaos
and din, the staff was tying some down to keep them at the table,
giving appetite stimulants to others who did not want to eat and
sedatives to the agitated. The impulse to try something different
came from nurses on the staff, but the administrator, the Rev.
Garth Brokaw, found what he wanted to copy at a United Methodist
home in Oshkosh, Wis., the Evergreen Retirement Community, and at
the Roman Catholic Mount Saint Vincent's in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Jewish Home in Rochester, N.Y., has begun making
changes, too. The point is to try to shape daily life around the
needs and preferences of the residents, rather than the
institution's. In an industry where 1.6 million old people,
two-thirds of them impoverished and 70 percent suffering from
dementia, live mostly in hospital-style buildings, it is a
revolutionary idea. It is also not surprising, in an industry
increasingly dominated by corporate chain ownership, that the
changes are occurring in nonprofit, church-sponsored homes.
</P>
<P>
   After $23 million was spent on the gradual reconstruction of its
buildings, the Fairport Baptist Home had a grand opening in August
of its new architecture, in which 9, 10 or 12 residents live in
single rooms clustered around big open kitchens, living rooms and
dining areas, with the Alzheimer's patients mixed in. The residents
are allowed to eat and sleep and dress according to their habits,
and each cluster of rooms has a staff to nurse, feed, launder and
care for those in need. Dogs and children are brought to visit.
Plants grow everywhere. The noise level, the drug level, the
wandering and the number of patients in restraints are all down.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on operating costs has yet to be seen. For such
humane changes to be copied by for-profit homes, the finances would
have to work. But the chains are showing interest, sending
representatives to visit church homes and attend conferences.
Rightly or wrongly, nursing homes have come to have a terrible
reputation among the old. No one wants to end up there. The homes
with the worst financial troubles at the moment _ and the most
consistent patterns of resident abuse _ are the for-profit homes.
Some real, caring changes could do them a world of good.

EDITORIAL: CRACKDOWN IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 11:
</P>
<P>
   The student protests that convulsed Iran in July were the
largest public outpouring of emotion there since the 1979
revolution. The demonstrations _ for cultural freedoms and greater
democracy _ were peaceful until paramilitary groups and security
forces attacked the students. Now, in a terrifying illustration of
the kind of strictures the protesters challenged, four people have
been sentenced to death on charges of organizing the
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The sentences, a clear attempt to discourage further protests,
are a sign of the panic that Iran's restlessness is causing among
the mullahs. Since Mohammad Khatami was elected president on a
reform platform two years ago, he has been battling the
conservative Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's spiritual and
political leader. and his fundamentalist followers. President
Khatami's election encouraged writers, journalists, students and
politicians to emerge from silence and fight for more liberties.
But his popularity has not been able to keep the fundamentalists
from cracking down on these newly visible targets.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the four sentenced to death is still not known,
and their trial was held in complete secrecy. The chief judge of
Tehran's Revolutionary Court said the Supreme Court had already
approved two of the sentences and two were being reviewed. He
hinted that others could get a death sentence as well. Hundreds of
students are believed to be in detention.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a dangerous year for reformers. In January, a
death squad inside the intelligence service was found responsible
for the murders of several prominent reformist writers and
political activists. Repression of the pro-Khatami press has also
increased. Four proreform dailies have been closed this year, and
one publisher recently received a 30-month suspended sentence. Iran
is also preparing to try 13 Iranian Jews on dubious charges of
spying for Israel. Clerics have called for their hanging even
though no evidence has yet been made public. The most recent
obsession of the fundamentalists is a play that makes fun of one of
Islam's most holy events. It was published in a student newsletter
(circulation 150) at one of Tehran's scientific universities. Some
have demanded that the authors be hanged.
</P>
<P>
   There are some new signs, however, that the fundamentalists are
wary of losing support. On Oct. 1, Khamenei gave a speech _ at the
shrine of the revolution's Ayatollah Khomeini no less _ admonishing
the radicalism of some of his supporters. Khamenei also praised the
president as a pious man working for the rebirth of Islam. The
astonishing speech offers some hope that recent extremist decisions
could be softened or reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Although Khamenei's speech included his usual criticisms of the
reformist media, his apparent desire for conciliation charts a
wiser course. But the speech must now be followed by the release of
those jailed and an end to punishment for those who believe, as the
president does, in a more accountable, democratic and freer Iran. &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE SENATE CONFRONTS SOFT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 11:
</P>
<P>
   When campaign finance reform comes before the Senate this week,
Trent Lott and other enemies of cleaning up the system will make
the usual predictions that reform cannot win. In fact, the
Republican leadership's barricade against change is crumbling.
Under pressure from a growing number of business leaders, and
rising outrage over a projected $3 billion to be spent in the
current campaign, some important Republicans are thinking about
supporting the McCain-Feingold ``soft money'' ban. Sen. Chuck Hagel
of Nebraska is planning to offer amendments, a welcome sign that he
and others might be showing up to help pass the bill, not block it.
</P>
<P>
   A solid bipartisan majority passed campaign reform in the House
last month. In the Senate it is backed by a majority consisting of
all 45 Democrats and seven Republicans. But eight more Republicans
are needed to break the filibuster to be engineered by Lott and
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, an energetic fund-raiser and ardent proponent of the
present system, is telling colleagues that changing the campaign
laws is a liberal plot to destroy the Republican Party. In fact,
Democratic Party professionals also fear that banning soft money _
the unlimited money that corporations, unions and rich individuals
give to the parties _ would cripple the Democrats. What the bill
will really do is curb each party's ability to haul in vast
corrupting sums from special interests looking for favors.
</P>
<P>
   The core bill to be introduced by Sens. John McCain of Arizona
and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin is a simple ban on soft money,
without an earlier provision regulating contributions to
independent groups for their campaign ads. Their aim in pushing
this stripped-down version was to lure Republicans genuinely
worried about regulating the rights of such groups. We support the
restrictions on these groups' fund-raising but also accept the
tactic of dropping that part of the bill. Democrats pushing to
re-attach the regulation of independent groups should realize that
they are probably reducing the chances of winning enough votes to
get the entire bill passed in the Senate. One alternative might be
to widen disclosure requirements for money donated to independent
groups that run campaign ads before an election.
</P>
<P>
   Amendments to be offered by Hagel or other Republicans should be
aimed at attracting more supporters without opening loopholes to
corrupt money. The Senate can consider raising ceilings on
donations to candidates, but only if the soft-money ban for the
parties remains intact. Among the senators whose constituents
should press them to join this process are Spencer Abraham of
Michigan and William Roth of Delaware. Both are in tough
re-election fights in states where voters care about campaign
reform. They must know that they would receive tremendous credit at
home for standing up for principle, not campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   This is a signal moment for McCain, whose poll numbers in New
Hampshire are starting to move upward in his drive for the
Republican presidential nomination. But other Republicans, notably
Susan Collins of Maine, have been working hard to corral support
within their party. McConnell's bullying tactics have not worked.
After his threatening letter to the Committee for Economic
Development, telling it to stop recruiting among businesses for
support for the soft-money ban, the committee doubled its
membership to more than 200 leaders.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell likes to define campaign donations as free speech. But
everyone knows that money does more than talk in Washington. It
buys influence. The only way to stop that practice is to limit the
money that sloshes through the system. Most Americans, most House
members and most senators agree. The only question now is whether
the majority or cash will rule. &QL;

O'DONOVAN PLANS BIG CHANGE FOR REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution should benefit from having
been eliminated from playoff contention in the last game of the MLS
season in Washington. This was an unsuccessful season, only
slightly masked by the team's 1-1 regulation-time tie against D.C.
United Saturday night, and had New England inched into the playoffs
it would have been a deceptive measure of success.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's 2-0 victory over Colorado allowed the Fusion to finish
with 29 points, three ahead of New England in the race for the
final playoff berth. But the Revolution, propped up only by the
failures of Miami and the even more disastrous New York-New Jersey
MetroStars, were less than a playoff team for much of the season
</P>
<P>
   This was the worst regular-season record in the Revolution's
four years of existence. The atmosphere surrounding the team
improved slightly over the 1998 season, but the record did not. The
Revolution continue to be pursued by demons of the past, weighed
down by losing and pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Zenga's ultra-pragmatic approach might have been a
lifeline for the Revolution, who really never have had a
discernible identity in their playing style. Zenga reasoned that
the Revolution needed only to band together and stay in contention
in every game, and they could finish in the top four in the Eastern
Conference. But even this simple philosophy could not be carried
out, only partially because of Zenga's shortcomings as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Too many Revolution players are accustomed to losing _ the team
has 36 regulation-time wins in four years _ and they are carrying
the weight of failure. At least Zenga brought a winning attitude _
the Revolution have only 19 regulation-time victories without Zenga
in goal _ and he made it obvious he could not accept losing.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the fans likely to continue to accept losing, at least
not in the same numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it to the fans to look at this project and correct,
once and for all, what we are doing wrong,'' general manager Brian
O'Donovan said. ``Because whatever we have been doing has not been
working. We are talking about significant change, but whatever that
is has not been decided yet. We have created something really
special here _ a franchise with awareness, passion, interest in
what the club is all about, a fan base. We've probably sold more
tickets for soccer than any other city in the country this year,
and we've sold more sponsorships than probably any other MLS team.
But on the field we are doing something fundamentally wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donovan has made bold moves at the start of each season,
hiring former English League star Frank Stapleton as coach in 1996,
signing MLS coach of the year Thomas Rongen from Tampa Bay in 1997,
following Rongen's extensive makeover plans last year, then
bringing in Zenga as player-coach, followed by Steve Nicol this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a whole change in the organizational
structure,'' O'Donovan said. ``It's safe to say we need somebody in
here who thinks, eats, and breathes soccer, and who also knows
international soccer, a sort of director of winning. He could be
the director of soccer operations, or he could be the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicol is a candidate for the job, but O'Donovan would not reveal
other names. The Revolution likely are considering collegiate
coaches, but they also would consider someone such as Steve
Heighway, a former Liverpool star who played in the North American
Soccer League, holds a US coaching license, and is now director of
Liverpool's player development program.
