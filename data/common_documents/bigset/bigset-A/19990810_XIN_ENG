<HEADLINE> French Defense Minister to Visit Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard will visit Kosovo on Tuesday, following three days of
clashes between French troops and Kosovo Albanians in the northern
city of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
One French soldier was injured Monday morning by stone thrown
by rioting Albanians during a confrontation between the French
troops of the U.N. Kosovo Peacekeeping Force (KFOR) and the
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The French Defense Ministry did not give any detailed
information on the visit of Richard.
</P>
<P>
But a KFOR spokesman said that he will go to Pristina first and
then go to Kosovska Mitrovica, where the headquarters of the
French troops in Kosovo are based.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Liberation Army has denounced French troops in
Kosovska Mitrovica for ``arrogance'', but denied any involvement
in the riots since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Albanians were trying to force their way through a bridge
in the city dividing the Albanian and Serb communities, saying
that they wanted to take back their houses seized by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
French troops have been blocking the Albanians at the entrance
of the bridge.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Senate to Approve Nuclear Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton urged
the Senate Monday to approve a nuclear test ban treaty which was
signed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony at Fort Myer in Arlington, Virginia,
Clinton said the approval of the treaty would "strengthen national
security, not only of the United States, but of people around the
world."
</P>
<P>
"It is in America's interest. Why? Because we have already
stopped testing," Clinton told the event which is celebrating the
50th anniversary of the creation of the office of chairman of
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee still stalled the treaty
while the panel's chairman, Jesse Helms, refused to take action on
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton noted that four former Joint Chiefs chairmen, Colin
Powell, David Jones, William Crowe and John Shalikashvili,
publicly supported the treaty.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Clinton praised those who have held the post,
saying the position is "indispensable" to the president of the
United States.

<P>
CAIRO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Monday expressed pleasure
that the Namibian government has succeeded in restoring security
and stability in its northern area.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official said Egypt sides with the Namibian
government and people in safeguarding territorial integrity and
national stability.
</P>

Egypt supports Namibia's effort to promote economic development
and realize the welfare of the friendly Namibian people, the
official said on customary condition of anonymity.

<P>
He added that his country followed with concern the recent
insurgency in Namibia's Caprivi area against the legitimate

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leonean Hostages Likely to Be Freed, U.N. Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean
Government has been negotiating with the rebels who have been
holding a number of U.N. military observers, West African
peacekeepers and local journalists, and the hostages may be freed
by this evening, a U.N. spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference here
that a number of hostages had been released over the weekend, with
some 20 remaining.
</P>
<P>
"The arrangements that they tell us they have made are for
those people all to be returned this evening," he said.
</P>
<P>
An intermediary who secured earlier releases in the hostage
standoff returned to the bush to try to persuade rebels to free
their remaining captives as the crisis entered its sixth day on
Monday, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a U.N. official in the capital Freetown said that
the negotiators were awaiting fresh words from the captors.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the U.N. and other sources in Freetown on Sunday
suggested that about half of an estimated 34 hostages, including
military observers from the United Nations Observer Mission in
Sierra Leone (UNMSIL), the Nigerian-led West African peacekeepers,
known as ECOMOG, and local journalists had been set free.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began on Wednesday when an unarmed U.N.-led team
went to a rebel-held area in Ocra Hills, some 65 kilometers east
of Freetown, to collect about 100 children, who were abducted
during the civil war in the West African country. The U.N. team
was escorted by a team of ECOMOG soldiers.
</P>
<P>
However, the rebels, instead of keeping their words by freeing
the children, detained the U.N. group as well as the ECOMOG
soldiers and local journalists.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the outbreak of the crisis, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed for the immediate release of
the detainees without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special representative for Sierra Leone, Francis
Okelo, had been rushing back to Freetown to deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Okelo had just concluded three days of meetings at the U.N.
headquarters in New York with an ECOMOG delegation. The
discussions focused on future arrangements and the division of
labor in Sierra Leone between the West African peacekeepers and
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, because of the lack of security, the U.N. World Food
Program (WFP) has suspended its scheduled distribution of food to
some 9,000 people in the area where the hostages were seized.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Sudan Coordinate Stances on Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Sudan has expressed appreciation
on Egyptian government for its banning of activities of a outlawed
and unauthorized Sudanese human rights organization in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Mustafa Othman Ismail welcomed the Egyptian
government's move to summon leader of the human rights group
Hamuda Fatah Arrahman and told him Cairo will not allow any
anti-Sudanese government activities in Egypt, the Sudanese News
Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
But he denied receiving a message from his Egyptian counterpart
Amr Moussa on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The agency had said Desouki Fayez, the Egyptian Charge
D'affaires in Khartoum conveyed a message from Moussa Monday
afternoon to Ismail, which said the organization was collaborating
with Baroness Cox and the Christian Solidarity Organization (CSO)
with anti-Arab and anti-Muslim intentions.
</P>
<P>
The message also said the organization has promoted a movie
produced by the CSO to deceive the world public opinion by
claiming slavery was practizing in the Sudan, which is
categorically untrue.
</P>
<P>
Observers in Sudan saw the Egyptian move to ban the organization
as the first coordination between Cairo and Khartoum following
strained relations since the failed assassination attempt against
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had traded charges of housing the opposition
elements of each other.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mission in Kosovo Begins Paying Local Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has begun making ad hoc
payments to local civil servants in the Yugoslav province, a U.N.
spokesman said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is just the beginning of what will eventually have to be
-- with the financial support of the international community if we
get it -- payments to up to 50,000 civil servants," Fred Eckhard,
the U.N. spokesman, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"But we're starting slow," he said. Thirty-nine judges,
prosecutors and customs officials would be getting ad hoc
payments, which are a kind of stipend pending the establishment of
a salary scale.
</P>
<P>
The figure of 50,000 was an approximation that the U.N. mission
had come up with a few weeks ago. "This is the stipend pending the
definition of a salary scale for these 50,000 people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The next payments, which should be made in about a week's time,
would go to health workers, firefighters and teachers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five post offices have opened up in Pristina,
capital of the Serbian province, maily to facilitate the payment
by Belgrade of pensions to the 25,000 pensioners in the greater
Pristina area who had not been paid since around March, he said.
</P>
<P>
Those payments were normally made through the post office, and
now that the post offices are open, Belgrade has the facility it
said it needed to resume the payment, he said. "So we hope that
will happen normally."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission had appealed to the international community
to contribute money for the payment of Kosovo's civil servants.
Eventually, when the province would be able to collect customs
and duties, the civil service would be paid from those revenues.
</P>
<P>
"The intention is not to ask the international community to
indefinitely pay the Kosovo civil service, but for an initial
period, they are being asked to pay," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Fine Weather Forecast for Eclipse Day in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Eclipse watchers got something
to cheer themselves up with on Monday when local meteorologists
forecast possible fine weather for the coming Wednesday -- the
total solar eclipse day.
</P>
<P>
Meteorogolists reversed earlier forecast for cloudy weather
conditions for the day, the last in this millenium with a total
solar eclipse in this part of the world.
</P>
<P>
Monday's forecast predicted a buildup of high pressure in
southern Belgium that will help keep the sky dry over the region
where the totality of the solar eclipse will be visible.
</P>
<P>
Last week, however, the meteorologists of the Royal Institute
of Meteorology of Belgium predicted cloudy weather for the next
five days right to the eclipse day.
</P>
<P>
As weather conditions predicted as fine, local transport
authorities have to prepare themselves to cope with the coming
traffic congestion on local road systems prior to and on the day
of the eclipse, a rare phenomenon occurring at an interval of 370
years on average.
</P>
<P>
Right roads are proposed to eclipse watchers to get to the
vantage points while other road users are given advice on how to
avoid the traffic slow-down on the roads around southern Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The southern tip of the country was announced the best viewing
point of the solar eclipse in this country.
</P>
<P>
A solar eclipse happens when the moon comes right in between
the sun and the earth, blocking the view of the sun from the
earth.
</P>
<P>
The August 11 solar eclipse is estimated to be visible in whole
or in part to around 2 billion residents of this planet.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Issues Guidelines on Relations with Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
drawn-up its new media policy which balances "the need to be open
and the need to respect confidentiality U.N. sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard confirmed this and said it took
four years for the document to be drafted. The guidelines will
come out as a U.N. document before the completion of legal
experts' language polishing.
</P>
<P>
An inter-office memorandum circulated since April 28 shows that
the guidelines was last revised by the discussion of the senior
U.N. management group on March 31.
</P>
<P>
The policy provides that the U.N. Secretary-general is "the
principal voice of the organization", while his spokesman and his
staff are entitled to speak daily to journalists on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
Every member of the U.N. secretariat may speak within the
limits of their areas of competence and responsibility, providing
facts instead of opinions or comment and leaving "sensitive
issues" to officials who are specifically authorized to speak.
</P>
<P>
The number of officials speaking on sensitive issues is
"necessarily limited" to the spokesman on the basis of guidance,
designated members of the Secretary-General's staff and heads of
department within their areas of competence and some others.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the new U.N. press policy may be more helpful to
reporters with more questions expected to be answered except for
those "hypothetical" ones Judged by U.N. officials.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Calls on Congolese Rebels to Sign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven
Mahachi Monday called on the two divided rebel factions in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to put their differences
aside and sign the ceasefire agreement to end hostilities in their
country.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Mahachi welcomed the decision last week
by Jean- Pierre Bemba, leader of the Congo Liberation Movement, to
sign the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The rebel movement led by Bemba controls large pieces of
territory in the Equatoria region in the northern Congo.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said he was still hopeful that the peace agreement
signed last month by six countries involved in the conflict would
bring peace to the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
"The leadership of the rival parties should now rise to the
occasion and put personal, other divisive and selfish interests
above everything else and forget their differences," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
"They should now demonstrate to the international community and
the Congolese people, in particular, concrete political will and
prove their good faith by signing the ceasefire agreement," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese Rally for Democracy (CRD) led by Enerst Wamba dia
Wamba and Ernest Ilunga's other faction, have been refusing to
sign the ceasefire agreement due to personality clashes.
</P>
<P>
"The restoration of peace and stability to the war torn
country should benefit not only that country but also the region
as a whole," Mahachi noted.
</P>
<P>
"The Congolese people are tired of this war. We need to give
peace a chance in that country in order for the Congolese people
to occupy their rightful place in the region's quest for
unfettered development," he said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Optimistic Over Sierra Leone Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua)-- The British Government said on
Monday it was optimistic that the remaining hostages being held by
rebels in Sierra Leone would be released "sooner rather than
later".
</P>
<P>
Foreign Office minister Peter Hain told the BBC he could not be
certain when the releases would take place but that he hoped it
would happen "within the next day or two".
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after some 19 hostages, including two
British soldiers, were released on Sunday. Other 19 Nigerian
peacekeeping soldiers and three other British military officers
are still being held in a jungle camp near Freetown, the capital
of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an official British spokesman said he expected the
remaining prisoners to be released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The hostages, part of a United Nations-led negotiating team,
were seized on Wednesday. They had gone to the Okra Hills, about
60 kilometres from Freetown, to try to persuade the rebels to
release about 100 children abducted earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers, who said they were members of Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council, former members of the government army who
rebelled and took control of the country in a military coup in
1997, demanded a stake in the peace settlement and to be
readmitted to the Sierra Leonean army.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- All member states of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) may ratify the trade protocol
by August 27 so that the tariff reduction phase for the region
could begin, a senior Zambian government official said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Deputy Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry, Norman
Chibamba, told reporters Monday that Zambia will only ratify the
SADC trade protocol when certain agreements in the tariff
reduction schedule have been reached.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Zambia may ratify the SADC trade protocol,
which seeks to create a free trade zone in the region over a
period of eight years, ahead of the SADC summit scheduled for
Maputo, Mozambique on August 17.
</P>
<P>
So far only five countries namely Botswana, Tanzania, Namibia,
Mauritius and Zimbabwe have ratified the trade protocol. Chibamba
said Malawi and South Africa had indicated that they would ratify
it ahead of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Chibamba could not, however, explain why it had taken Zambia so
long to ratify the protocol.
</P>
<P>
Some business organizations have painted a gloomy picture of
tariff reduction schedule for SADC for two thirds of the member
states have not ratified the trade protocol so far.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ready to Work with Russia's New Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration said
on Monday that it is ready to work with new Russian Premier
Vladimir Putin, who is to replace Sergei Stepashin, if approved by
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
David Leavy, a spokesman for Presidential National Security
Council, reacted cautiously to the new shake-up of the government
announced earlier Monday by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Leavy said that Putin was a known quantity and U.S. officials
had worked with him recently in resolving Russia's role in the
NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.S. administration had a good
relationship with Stepashin, who just paid a three-day working
visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration is expecting to have a similarly good
relationship with Putin when the appointment was approved by
Russia's Duma, Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
"We work with the Russian government based on policies, not
personalities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said it is "prerogative" of Yeltsin to choose the
premier.
</P>
<P>
"President Yeltsin's actions are consistent with the
constitution. It's now up to the Russian Parliament to consider
the candidacy of President Yeltsin's nominee. We understand that
this candidacy will be debated next week," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin reiterated the policy which was upheld when Yeltsin
conducted the shakeup before. "We have focused our policy on the
policies of Russian reform and the policies of the Russian
government, not the personalities."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also indicated that the shakeup in Moscow will
not affect the U.S.-Russian relationship.
</P>
<P>
"Our two governments and two presidents have laid out a clear
agenda for our bilateral relations to focus on arms control,
economic reform in Russia and nonproliferation, and it will be
important for us to follow up on these in the coming weeks," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Financial Sector Benefits from Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's financial sector has
become healthier following the closure of several big commercial
banks due to their insolvency.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Gerald Ssendaula made the remarks at a
workshop of the country's association of journalists here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The core of the sector is still financially sound after the
bank closures because of mismanagement and large and continued
losses, he told the reporters at the function.
</P>
<P>
Citing the closure of the Cooperation Bank, the minister said
the 35- year-old bank began to make losses from 1995 and the total
loss of the bank was over four billion shillings (three million
U.S. dollars) at the time of its closure.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy would benefit from the bank closures
because the financial sector would be stronger and could stand up
to bigger challenges.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Uganda, the country's central bank, announced the
closure of Greenland Bank and Cooperative Bank in April and May
respectively. Each of the two closed banks have more than 100,000
depositors.
</P>
<P>
The bank closures sparked wide public criticism over the
financial sector and triggered a desperate rush for withdrawal of
money from sound banks. The general public still believe that the
banking sector is running badly in spite of numerous efforts by
the central bank to soothe this fear.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Takes EU to Court of Justice on Food Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Belgium announced on Monday that
it was taking the European Union to the European Court of Justice
on the case of dioxin-related food exports.
</P>
<P>
This EU member country made the move after the 15-nation bloc
banned exports of its foodstuff containing more than 2 percent of
animal fat with the exception of dairy products.
</P>
<P>
The ban was issued shortly before Belgium, where the
cancer-causing dioxin was raking havoc with the food industry,
said that it believed that only food with more than 20 percent of
animal fat would have to be tested.
</P>
<P>
Belgium asked the EU and other member states to accept the
20-percent limit whereas the European Commission, the executive
body of the European Union, insisted that Belgium accept the
2-percent limit instead.
</P>
<P>
When the European Commission issued last Friday a directive on
the control of animal fat-containing foodstuffs of Belgium, the
Belgians felt that it was a virtual ban on its exports of such
food as chocolate, biscuit and waffle.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Health Minister Magda Aelvoet has pledged to reverse
the EU directive which was said to be designed to combat the
dioxin crisis.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that a new law would limit tests on food with
more than 20 percent of animal fat except for fats derived from
milk. But the new law needs the backing from the entire
government that came in after the previous government collapsed in
the election due to the dioxin crisis.
</P>
<P>
Belgium already faces legal action from the EU for failing to
inform EU member states in the early stage of the outbreak of the
dioxin crisis. The country could run into a similar trouble if it
overrules the EU directive.
</P>
<P>
In May, the previous Belgian government admitted that meat
produced in Belgium contained high levels of dioxin and the
admission triggered worldwide bans on Belgian meat, eggs and dairy
products.
</P>
<P>
Dioxin was first found in eggs and poultry meat while pork meat
was added to the problem list, with fat as the most likely to
contain the cancer-causing chemical.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Backs Eliminating Mass Destruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Monday
renewed its support to efforts in eliminating weapons of mass
destruction, especially in the Middle East region, the Kuwait
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh is "looking forward to seeing the Middle East region
free of all kinds of mass destruction weapons," said Saudi Crown
Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz during a
weekly cabinet session he chaired in the country's western city of
Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
He voiced concern at the possession by many countries of
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, urging all nations to
join the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and open their nuclear
facilities to international inspection.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's remarks came after Saudi Second Prime Minister and
Defense and Aviation Minister Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz denied any
Saudi attempts to acquire nuclear weapons from Pakistan or any
other country.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question over his visit to a uranium
enrichment plant and a missile factory in Pakistan, Sultan said it
did not "exceed the entrances of the sites and did not include
secret facilities as reported."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that British officials were worried that
Riyadh might have sought to buy nuclear weapons from Pakistan.

These refrigerators are free of chloroflourocarbons harmful to
the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
The program will seek to increase the supply of these
energy-efficient units and raise understanding of their benefit.
</P>
<P>
Refrigerator manufactures will get training and an incentive
award scheme will be created to encourage participation.

<HEADLINE> German Businessman to Be Retried Behind Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Helmut Hofer, the German
businessman accused of having illicit sexual relationship with a
Muslim woman, will be retried on August 11 behind closed doors, a
Tehran Justice Department official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Saeed Nobari, head of the department's public relations
office, said no media representatives will be allowed to attend
the court hearing.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was arrested in September 1997 and was sentenced to
death in January 1998, because Iranian laws banned relations
between a non-Muslim man and a Muslim woman.
</P>
<P>
However, Hofer argued that he has converted to Islam before
having an affair with the Iranian woman. The death sentence was
then rejected by Iran's Supreme Court, which ordered a retrial.
</P>
<P>
He was released from jail on bail in April but was again put
behind bars in August. The reason for his re-arrest, according to
judicial officials, was his "links with certain foreign elements
and the possibility of his fleeing from the country."
</P>
<P>
Nobari was quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency
as saying "Hofer's charges are of the kind that, according to the
law, must be held behind closed doors."
</P>
<P>
Malek Houshang Qahhari, a defense lawyer of Hofer, explained
that, according to law, any case concerning unethical issues is
held behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hofer's moral and psychological conditions had
improved after he was released from jail on bail, and he has not
visited Hofer since his re-arrest earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
He said he is not aware of any possible fresh charges against
his client.

<HEADLINE> Georgian President Angered by Alleged Bombing of Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze on Monday expressed indignation over the alleged
bombing of the Georgian village of Verkhneye Omalo located near
the Dagestani border by Russian aircraft, Georgian State Minister
Vazha Lordkipanidze said.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that three local residents were
killed in that bomb attack, the Interfax news agency reported in a
dispatch from Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze urged Russian President Boris Yeltsin to make an
urgent public assessment of this outrageous fact, Lordkipanidze
said.
</P>
<P>
On instruction from Shevardnadze, Lordkipanidze talked with
Russian acting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin who expressed his
deep condolences over the incident and promised to take
appropriate measures, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the General Staff of the Russian Air Force early on
Monday denied that one of its warplanes violated the air space of
Georgia and bombed its territory.
</P>
<P>
The plane was said to have invaded Georgia's airspace near the
village of Bochormi in Akhmetsky district that borders the Russian
republics of Chechnya and Daghestan.
</P>
<P>
But a Russian General Staff spokesman said "air force planes
are not fulfilling tasks in the airspace of Daghestan, and it
cannot violate the air border of states bordering Russia," the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Georgian Ambassador to Russia Malkhaz Kababadze has handed a
note of protest to the Russian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Lordkipanidze said the leaders of Georgian law-enforcement
agencies have been given corresponding instructions to take
"adequate measures" if the incident is repeated, Interfax
reported.

CAIRO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- An Arab economic conference due to
be held here in September is expected to discuss Arab economic
development and the general situation of the world economy,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shafik Gabr, chairman of Egypt's Economic Forum, told the news

cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The conference is to discuss the global economic development
and the impact on Arab economies.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Norway's Move to Resume Full </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday welcomed Norwegian
government's move to resume full diplomatic relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid-Reza Asefi said that
Iran-Norway relations have experienced a four-year break since
1995, and that Norway's decision to send its ambassador to Tehran
would serve to develop bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries lowered their diplomatic relations in 1995
after recalling their ambassadors, mainly because of Oslo's
support to the British author Salman Rushdie and Tehran's refusal
to stop executing the death sentence on Rushdie ordered by its
late spiritual leader Ayatollah Khomeni.
</P>
<P>
Rushdie was condemned to death in 1989 by Komeni for his
novel, the Satanic Verses, which was regarded blasphemous and
insulting to Islam.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said Norway is willing to increase trade and economic
cooperation with Iran and Iran, for its part, would lift trade
barriers with Norway. Norway, which sees Iran as a big market for
its oil and gas technology, decided in June to normalize trade
relations with it.
</P>
<P>
The Scandinavian country has sent Svein Aass, its deputy
representative at the United Nations, as its ambassador to
Tehran. Iran said it would introduce ambassador to Oslo soon.

ANKARA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is very satisfied with
Iran's release of the two Turkish soldiers, who had been detained
on July 22 inside the Iranian border, the Foreign Ministry said
in a statement on Monday.

The two Turkish soldiers were handed over to Turkish officials
Monday afternoon at the Kapikoy Border Gate in Saray town of
Turkey's eastern province of Van following the talks between the
Turkish and Iranian officials.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Reintroduces Corporate Foreign Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Finance Ministry
Monday reintroduced corporate Foreign Currency Accounts (FCA)
allowing all direct exporters to retain 100 percent of their
export proceeds.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said in a statement that as a
result of the recently concluded stand-by agreement with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) the country's balance of
payments position had slightly improved.
</P>
<P>
"With immediate effect, therefore, all direct exporters of
goods and services may retain 100 percent of their export proceeds
in corporate FCAs, maintained with their authorized dealers," said
the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"This move represents an immediate shift to 100 percent
retention instead of the two-staged process outlined in the
government's letter of intent to the IMF," it said.
</P>
<P>
The authorized dealers would be required to maintain statutory
reserves in foreign currency at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
equivalent to 30 percent of their currency deposits which is in
line with current statutory reserve ratio for all commercial and
merchant banks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the new initiative was intended to
enhance market confidence and promote export growth by cushioning
exporters against exchange risk.
</P>
<P>
Exporters would also benefit where they rely on imported raw
materials or other inputs while companies would be able to easily
access foreign exchange.

LUANDA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian petroleum company
"Petrobras" will endeavour to reinforce its participation in the
Angolan market, the out-going Brazilian ambassador in Angola
Alexandre Addor Neto said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos,
Neto said that Petrobras, ranking in the list of the world's 20
biggest petroleum companies, has more advanced technology in deep
water operations.
</P>
<P>
Neto, who will leave Angola for Brazil on August 29 after a
four-year term, announced that Brazilian Minister of Mines and
Energy Rodolf Turim will start his visit to Angola on August 23,
during which he will discuss with Angolan officials on the
bilateral cooperation in developing petroleum.
</P>
<P>
Petrobras, a leading company in Brazil's oil industry, began
its participation in the exploration and development of crude oil
in Angola from 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Brazil, which lacks petroleum resources and imports
60 percent of its petroleum products, has kept increasing its
investment in the Angolan oil developing market.
</P>
<P>
Angola, the second largest oil-producing country in Sub-Sahara
Africa after Nigeria, enjoys a 750 thousand-barrel-per-day
production, with the off-shore oil fields in northwest Cabinda and
Zaire provinces as its main oil-producing areas.

<HEADLINE> French Daily to Distribute Free Sunglasses for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The French daily newspaper ``Le
Parisien'' and its national edition ``Aujourd'hui'' will
distribute free on Tuesday the special sunglasses for protecting
sky-gazers' eyes on the eclipse day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper is expected to distribute 630,000 sunglasses with
each sunglasses for one copy of newspaper.
</P>
<P>
``The quality of the glasses has been checked by two experts of
the General Direction of Consumption, Competition and Suppression
of Fakes,'' said Le Parisien.
</P>
<P>
The French daily Le Monde published on Monday a special edition
on eclipse in both French and English, entitled ``The Night of
Mid-day.''
</P>
<P>
The newspaper warned eclipse watchers that if they don't wear
the special sunglasses when watching eclipse, they risk losing
their eyesight.
</P>
<P>
``Usually, the dazzling glare of the Sun discourages us from
staring at our star directly. But the same does not necessarily
apply in the event of an eclipse, a phenomenon everyone wants to
see,'' said Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
``Without proper precautions, the star to which we owe our life
can also rob us of our eyesight,'' it warned.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper described human eyes gazing at the eclipsed sun
without special sunglasses as a piece of paper under a magnifying
glass which concentrates the Sun's beams onto a small spot.
</P>
<P>
``It should be stressed that even if more than 99 percent of
our star is covered, as will be the case in Paris, the few
remaining rays will be enough to cause serious injury to the
unprotected eye,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
It warned eclipse watchers against using any other screening
devices like photographic film, X-ray photograph, smoked glass,
compact disc, or ordinary sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
The French state railway company SNCF will distribute special
sunglasses at railway stations with trains going to the zone in
northern France, where a complete eclipse will occur in the
mid-day Wednesday for two minutes.
</P>
<P>
Sunglasses for watching eclipse are reportedly running out in
some French cities within the zone of total eclipse, such as Reims
in northeast France.
</P>
<P>
The producers of the sunglasses, who will organize a rock
concert at the square of the Great Catheral of Reims on the
eclipse day, will distribute on the site sunglasses at five francs
(0.8 U.S. dollars) a piece.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Liberal Democrats Elect New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Liberal Democrats on
Monday elected Charles Kennedy as their new leader to replace
Paddy Ashdown, who stepped down after 11 years as chief of the
country's third political party.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, 39, the party's rural affairs spokesman, beat four
rivals for the leadership in a ballot of 90,000 members.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge now is to carry on with Paddy's work: building
the party," Kennedy said in his acceptance speech to party
supporters.
</P>
<P>
Liberal Democrats have 46 of the 659 seats in the House of
Commons while Prime Minister Tony Blair's ruling Labour Party has
419.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said Liberal Democrats under his leadership would be a
pro-European party fighting for social justice.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Blair said earlier that the prime minister was
ready to continue close ties with whoever succeeded Ashdown.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister felt and continues to believe that
cooperation between the cabinet and the Liberal Democrats has
worked to the benefit of both parties," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, born on November 25,1959, was Britain's youngest
politician, the "Baby of the House", when he entered the
parliament at the age of 23.
</P>
<P>
He was elected party president of the Liberal Democrats from
1990 to 1994.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Facilities Bombed by U.S.-British </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S.-British warplanes continued
on Monday their regular attacks on civilian facilities in
northern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:05 (0605 GMT), 10 formations of
enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace violated northern
Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Neineva and Erbil provinces and
attacked some civilian installations in the region.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention whether civilian casualties were caused in
these attacks.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired
missiles at the enemy planes and repulsed them to their base in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes coming from the Saudi and Kuwaiti
bases also violated southern Iraqi airspace twice in the day over
Basra, Thi-Qar, Muthana and Misan provinces, said the spokesman,
adding that Iraqi anti-aircraft units repulsed the enemy planes.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have made 11,166 sorties over the two no-fly
zones in Iraq, and have been regularly attacking Iraqi civilian
facilities and military sites.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed by the U.S.-led western allies
following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of protecting
the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
attacks by Iraqi government troops.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Reports Food Shortages in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Close to 10 million people
in sub-Saharan Africa need emergency food aid, the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Somalia alone, one million people are facing serious food
shortages with over 400,000 at risk of starvation, said the report
issued through the U.N. headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
In Ethiopia, the report estimates that more than 5 million
people need emergency food aid, including 385,000 people displaced
by the on-going war with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Africa, the report said, a prolonged drought has
affected crops production and livestock in west Uganda where large
numbers of farmers are to be in need of urgent assistance.
</P>
<P>
FAO termed the food outlook for Angola "very bleak", as a
result of escalating civil war which has produced one million new
internally displaced people.
</P>
<P>
In other parts of southern Africa, the report said, a
tightening of the food supply situation is anticipated in
countries where a reduced 1999 cereal crop was harvested.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, estimated cereal output is even below last
year's below-average crop. In Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and
Zimbabwe, cereal output is below average for the second
consecutive year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Reaffirms Support for a Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Raouf Rawabdeh reiterated Monday his country fully supported the
right of the Palestinians to establish an independent state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his first major press conference since he assumed
office some six months ago, Rawabdeh stressed the Palestinian
issue was the key element in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of an independent Palestinian state would
guarantee peace, stability, economic development and prosperity in
 the region, and Jordan stood by the Palestinians in their
struggle for an independent state, Rawabdeh said.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan, which is providing shelter to some 1.32 million
Palestinian refugees, also supported the right of Palestinian
refugees in the region to return to their own homeland.
</P>
<P>
Jordan would stand by the Palestinians, Syria, Lebanon and in
the peace process between Israel and Arab countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he brushed aside a Palestinian proposal to set up a
confederation between Jordan and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hoped to build up stable and permanent ties with the
Palestinians, but the top priority for the moment was to set up an
independent Palestinian state, instead of a political entity like
a confederation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also at the press conference, Rawabdeh said Jordan`s ties with
other Arab countries were at their best stage and had been
restored to levels prior to the 1990 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was isolated by Arab countries during the crisis for
which it was found to be sympathetic with Iraq after President
Saddam Hussein`s troops stormed into Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Jordan and Kuwait restored their ties
severed during the Gulf crisis.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Teenagers Finish 1-2 in 5,000m Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, Croatia, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese women teenagers
snatched a one-two finish in the 5,000 meters competition at the
Military World Games in Lake Jarun here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Liang, 15, pocketed China's first gold at these games by
clocking one hour three minutes and seven seconds while 16-year-
old Zhang Dan carried home the silver at 1:03:30.
</P>
<P>
The results were remarkable considering the duo had never
competed in natural waters before and had to overcome jet leg
after arriving in Zagreb Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
"I expected to win this gold medal after we arrived here
yesterday," said Zhang Liang, who started swimming training since
five.
</P>
<P>
"I was 80 percent sure that this medal is mine before the race.
I noticed that the past results of the other competitors are
inferior to mine," she added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Liang's coach Chen Guoqiang said he did not expect China'
s winning two medals in this event.
</P>
<P>
"When I waved our national flag during competition, I could see
that encouraged them to gain glory for the homeland and the army,"
the colonel said.
</P>
<P>
Croatia's Petra Banovic grabbed the bronze in 1:04.09.
</P>
<P>
In men's competition, Eugeniy Bezruchenko of Russia took the
gold in 57 minutes 2.32 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Russians could have achieved a similar one-two finish if
Alexei Akatiev were not edged to third place by Luca Baldini of
Italy with a margin of less than 0.1 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Baldini was timed 57:05.44 while Akatiev 57:05.50.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Welcomes Portuguese PM's Intention to Visit Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will in
principle welcome Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres's
willingness to visit Indonesia after the August 30 UN-administered
autonomy ballot in East Timor, a foreign ministry spokesman said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I think, we will in principle welcome his visit if it is
purely aimed at increasing relations with Indonesia," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local magazine, Portuguese Prime
Minister Guterres said recently that he planned a trip to India,
Cambodia and Indonesia after the popular consultation in East
Timor has been completed.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a former colony of Portugal for more than 400
years. It was integrated into Indonesia in 1975 but the move has
never been recognized by the United Nations and Portugal cut its
diplomatic relations with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the Indonesian government offered East
Timor a wide-ranging autonomy within Indonesia through a ballot to
be held in August 30. If the majority of the East Timorese people
reject the offer, Indonesia will consider East Timor's separation
from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Reports said many Portuguese politicians in Lisbon had aired
the need to normalize diplomatic ties with Jakarta after the
holding of the UN-supervised ballot on autonomy which will pave
the way for the people of East Timor to determine their own
future.
</P>
<P>
More than 400,000 East Timorese have registered to cast their
votes in the autonomy ballot inside and outside the former
Portuguese colony.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Continue to Denounce Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- More and more Falun Gong
practitioners have come to realize the true nature of Falun Gong,
and they say that they will arm themselves with Marxist
materialism, abide by the laws of the state and protect social
stability.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xianglan, former head of the Falun Gong general training
center in Wuhan City, and Wang Xiaoming, former deputy head of the
center, said that they have realized that Li Hongzhi, the founder
of Falun Gong, is a liar who has sinister purposes.
</P>
<P>
They refuted Li's claim that Falun Gong has no organization and
is not involved in politics, with the facts that they had received
many orders from Li Hongzhi and then passed such orders on to
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
They said that if the organization is allowed to expand freely,
there will occur inconceivable consequences, and therefore, they
are determined to break with the illegal organization.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Guichen, former deputy head of the Falun Gong training
base in Henan Province's Anyang City, recalled that Li Hongzhi
came to Anyang on September 10, 1997, and said that he once lived
in Anyang in the Song Dynasty (960 - 1279 ).
</P>
<P>
In Anyang, Li even wrote two doggerel verses in which he
boasted that he is the reincarnation of Yue Fei, the Song Dynasty
national hero, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
Li also claimed that he is the reincarnation of Li Shimin, a
leading Tang Dynasty (618 - 907) emperor, Bian Que and Li Shizhen,
both prestigious ancient Chinese doctors.
</P>
<P>
Li even bragged that he is also the reincarnation of the
president of a foreign country, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
Wang De'an, former head of the Falun Gong training base in
Henan Province's Kaifeng City, said that Falun Gong had
established a network controlled by Li Hongzhi from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
He said that Li controlled and fooled Falun Gong practitioners
with superstition, and instigated them to hold gatherings in front
of government institutions in order to realize his own malicious
political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Shao Hanmin, head of the Philosophy Institute under the Jilin
Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, said that Li Hongzhi's
fallacies run counter to science and blaspheme human civilization.
</P>
<P>
He said that Li's real motive is to conduct illegal activities
and pursue his vicious political goals by fooling people with
superstition.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Yeltsin Reshuffles Cabinet for Upper Hand in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- By naming Vladimir Putin as Russia
's new prime minister and anointing him as his preferred successor
in the Kremlin, President Boris Yeltsin is striving to ensure the
outcome of the year 2000 presidential race in his favor.
</P>
<P>
Putin is the fourth man to be named Prime Minister by Yeltsin
in 18 months, since Sergei Kiriyenko was dumped in August, 1998,
following the country's worst financial crisis which was marked by
an effective ruble devaluation and default on foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
No specific reasons were given for Sergei Stepashin's downfall
by Yeltsin in his televised address to the nation, but Putin said
it "is related not with a negative assessment of acts of the
premier and the government, but to the wish of the president to
change the interior political configuration in the country on the
eve of the State Duma and presidential elections."
</P>
<P>
Local observers believe the departure Stepashin may be prompted
by his failure to effectively stop, or at least control, the
alliance formed last week between Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov's "
Fatherland" party and the "All Russia" movement of influential
local governors.
</P>
<P>
Such a bloc will put the Kremlin in a major disadvantage in the
upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections. Yeltsin has
signed a document Monday setting the election date for the State
Duma, or the lower house of parliament, on December 19 this year.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the situation, Russian media speculate, Yeltsin
chose to pick up Putin, someone the opposition-dominated State
Duma is not likely to approve.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, Yeltsin may dissolve the Duma
if it rejects his prime ministerial nominee three times.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has already sent a letter to Duma speaker Gennady
Seleznyov reporting the dismissal of Stepashin and requesting the
Duma's approval of Putin as the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov called an emergency meeting of parliamentary faction
leaders on Monday evening. He said the date for an extraordinary
Duma session for discussions of the nomination would be set at
that meeting. The Duma is currently in recess.
</P>
<P>
By law, the Duma should start the confirmation process within a
week.
</P>
<P>
If the State Duma rejects Putin, the theory goes, it would play
into the hands of Yeltsin, who would dismiss the lower house of
parliament and immediately steps down as president, the Moscow
News weekly newspaper speculated.
</P>
<P>
Putin would then become the acting president automatically, a
position that would surely strengthen his chances of winning the
presidential race three months after assuming the acting
presidency.
</P>
<P>
If the State Duma gives up and lets Yeltsin have his way by
confirming Putin, observers say, Yeltsin could still use the
resignation card. He could step down for other reasons such as
poor health.
</P>
<P>
Of course, under the best scenarios, Yeltsin will be able to
serve out his term until next summer and turn over the helm to
Putin.
</P>
<P>
During the Monday television address, Yeltsin piled praises on
the 46-year-old Putin, who served as head of the Federal Security
Service, the main successor to the Soviet KGB, and the Security
Council, a top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
Putin will be "able to consolidate society" and "ensure the
continuation of reforms in Russia," Yeltsin said. "He will be able
to rally behind him those who are to renew great Russia in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Putin's quick ascent from a career intelligence officer to a
Kremlin darling was attributed to his ability to make tough
decisions, his authority with the power structures, and his
loyalty to the Kremlin establishment, observes say.
</P>
<P>
Putin graduated from the law department of the Leningrad State
University in 1975 and began his career with the Foreign
Intelligence Service of the Soviet State Security Committee, or
KGB.
</P>
<P>
After a long assignment in Germany, Putin became deputy head
for International Affairs of the Leningrad State University.
</P>
<P>
Putin served as deputy head of the Kremlin Property Department
in 1996-1997 and head of Kremlin's Chief Control Department in
1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed head of the Federal Security Service, the main
successor to the KGB, in July 1998 and secretary of the Security
Council in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said Putin in recent years had "acted confidently and
firmly, and achieved good results."
</P>
<P>
"Vladimir Putin has much experience in state work. Running the
government is a heavy burden and a serious test," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
"He will succeed -- I am sure of that -- and the Russians will
give him support," the president said.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Book Offers New Way to Measure Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A new book released in New
York last week by the Office of Development Studies of the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) proposes the creation of a
quality adjusted rate of unemployment (QARU) as a new and more
effective policy tool for measuring unemployment, a UNDP news
release said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The book, entitled "Perspectives on Globalization and
Employment," says that the QARU measurement would go beyond
official statistics and take into account quality of employment in
terms of revenues and sustainability of jobs.
</P>
<P>
The authors note, for instance, that although unemployment
rates may be low in the U.S., 14 percent of the workforce are in
fact "looking for more and better jobs," the news release said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the employed are in temporary jobs or are on call as
"independent contractors" who often have very few clients.
Contributors to the book are eminent economists, development
experts and employment specialists, the news release added.

UNITED NATIONS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A new program backed by
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) will help Viet Nam
to improve the administration of customs in the country, a UNDP

<P>
The one-year program of 500,000 U.S. dollars will assist the
Vietnamese Government in making customs procedures more efficient
and transparent, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
The effort will put Viet Nam's customs administration in line
with international norms and practices, and facilitate the
country's integration into global and regional economic
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Customs staff will receive training and tariff classification
systems that are in line with international standards will be
adopted. "These efforts will assist Viet Nam in its move towards
membership in the World Trade Organization," the news release
said.
</P>
<P>
"The project will help the government build the capacity to
deal with the challenges of international integration," said
UNDP's acting Resident Representative in Hanoi, Nicholas
Rosellini, "We expect that its result will provide opportunities
for other donors to join faces and help Viet Nam improve its
customs services, and by extension, facilitate its international
integration in a coordinated manner," the news release added.

The general economic environment, coupled with relatively weak
demand in the premium passenger market and industry-wide price
discounting, produced an operating profit of 94 million pounds.

The company's Business Efficiency Program (BEP) continues to
deliver strong results, with savings reaching 750 million pounds
last year and 1 billion pounds by 2000/2001.

pounds to improve significantly every single product.
</P>
<P>
In line with British Airways' strategy to restrain mainline
scheduled capacity growth, the company will grow capacity by less
than 0.6 percent in the current year and reduce capacity by up to
12 percent over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Bob Ayling, British Airways Chief Executive, said: "We are
ahead of the competition in a number of areas... Our strategy of
reducing capacity is ahead of target and through our fleet and
network changes."
</P>
<P>
"British Airways will emerge from current market conditions
with lower costs and a young aircraft fleet focused on the most
profitable sections of the market," he added.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Co-operate With New Russian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Monday that it
would continue to work closely with new Russian government to
promote progress in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to work closely with (Russian)
President(Boris) Yeltsin and the new Russian government for peace,
stability and economic progress both inside Russia and
externally," Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made after President Yeltsin sacked his
government on Monday morning, replaced Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin with intelligence chief Vladimir Putin and named him as
his chosen successor for president.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin was the fourth prime minister sacked by president
Yeltsin in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Putin, 46, the head of the Federal Security Service, the main
successor to the KGB, has been named acting prime minister.
Yeltsin said he wanted Putin to succeed him as president in next
year's elections.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's move was branded "100% lunacy" by the Russian
Communists who control the largest number of seats in the Duma,
the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin's sacking triggers another political crisis as Russia
prepares for the parliamentary elections in December.

<HEADLINE> Countries Involved in Congo Crisis to Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of South Africa,
Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda have agreed that the verification
process which was agreed upon on July 10 by leaders of six
countries involved in the year- long Congolese crisis should be
carried out as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached Sunday at the end of a sub-regional
summit on the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
 which was held in Pretoria, capital of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that the verification will lead to the signing of
the peace agreement of the legal representative of RCD (the
Congolese Rally for Democracy), but after that there should be an
attempt to reconcile the rebels," Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu told Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the weekend clashes between the RCD troops and
Ugandan forces, Bizimungu said the fighting happened when Ugandan
forces tried to show the envoy of the facilitator, President
Frederick Chiluba said that ousted RCD leader Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba had a big constituency and many followers.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the Ugandan troops put road-blocks on all
the streets of Kisangani, the third largest city in the Congo
which were controlled by the rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
"The Ugandan forces took that initiative without consultation
or informing the RCD forces," Bizimungu charged, saying that the
situation is reportedly calm on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan president expressed the hope that the verification
mission which is due to establish legal representation will be
carried out smoothly, and that Ugandan forces will no longer
attempt to disrupt it by provoking the rebels.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Uganda President Yoweri Museveni who attended
the meeting put the blame on the rebels who wanted to disrupt the
meeting which was being organized for Wamba.
</P>
<P>
Rebel sources in Kisangani said that the clashes which broke
out early Saturday left seven Ugandan soldiers and three rebels
dead. Well- informed sources in Pretoria told the Rwanda News
Agency that both Uganda and Tanzania have thrown all the weight
behind Wamba and were strongly opposed to verification mission in
a bid to curtail all efforts to find the truth about the real
legal representation of the RCD.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime Bizimungu has blasted reports by Zimbabwe media
that Rwandan troops are massing troops and weapons to restart war
in the Congo, and that they are training some Congolese youths to
carry out genocide.
</P>
<P>
He said that this was a futile attempt by Zimbabwe to whitewash
itself of the training of Interahamwe militia, which was continued
even after the signing of the Lusaka peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Calls for Fairness in Trade Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 NAIROBI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Ghana underscored Monday the
need for fairness, equity and justice in international trade
relations to justify the reforms taking place in its economy.
</P>
<P>
 The west African country also kicked against established
institutions, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and major
trade partners, for creating tariff and non-tariff barriers that
not only stifle emerging economies but end up crippling them
completely, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
 These were some of the sentiments expressed by Ghanaian
participants at a round-table discussion between members of the
United Kingdom branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association (CPA) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry and its
umbrella bodies.
</P>
<P>
 Briefing the British delegation on the current trends in the
trade and industrial sectors of Ghana's economy, Dan Abodakpi,
Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry, noted that Britain is
Ghana's largest and strongest trading partner as well as the
single largest investor in the Ghanaian economy.
</P>
<P>
 This makes it imperative to develop ideas that would lead to
the expansion of available markets open to them.
</P>
<P>
 Abodakpi said Ghana has over the years undergone some painful
and drastic reforms "under which we are still struggling and hope
that through this partnership we can share ideas on how to
progress."
</P>
<P>
 Recent developments on the international market have proved
worrying, he said, adding the continued decline in cocoa and gold
prices, Ghana's major exports, "have proved to be more hurting
than our efforts can sustain. "
</P>
<P>
 Abodakpi told the delegation that reforms in the sector over
the last three years, which are aimed at propelling Ghana into a
middle income country by 2020, are underway.
</P>
<P>
 He cited the gateway and free zone projects, port reforms,
divestiture and the overall liberalization of the economy as means
to make the nation's dream to become a reality.
</P>
<P>
Abodakpi said the liberalization of the international market
is putting Ghana at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
 He said Ghana is interested in the Lome IV Convention, but
stressed that agreements signed should not be discarded by the
big, rich countries to the detriment of the smaller ones within
the African, Caribbean and Pacific community.
</P>
<P>
 "Like the WTO, the whole thing is now becoming like a club of
rich nations, where the practice is 'you say what is on your
mind, but we will do what we want'", he said.
</P>
<P>
 The British delegation led by Diane Abbott, Labor member of
parliament in the British parliament, expressed its preparedness
to help in the development of Ghana's economy and democracy to
facilitate increased trade.

<HEADLINE> Albright Postpones Mideast Trip at Barak's Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has decided to postpone her Middle East trip,
possibly until the beginning of September, the State Department
said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
She delayed the trip at the request of Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, who wanted more time to iron out his problems with
the Palestinians over the timing for carrying out the Wye
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Albright had planned to visit the region starting next
weekend -- for the first time since Barak took office.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said Albright
consulted Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouq al-Shara on Sunday before deciding the
postponement. Both expressed understanding.
</P>
<P>
"What the trip will be designed to do will be to take stock
of where all the parties are, what their positions are, and then
be in a position to see whether down the road there are
openings that one can try to advance," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The trip will start at about the time when the timetable
resumes on September 1 for carrying out the rest of the Wye
agreement, which was suspended under former Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that the Israelis and the Palestinians have
made progress on various aspects of implementation ... the
secretary will be able to focus on issues beyond implementation
of Wye," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
These include the possibility of resuming talks with Syria
and the start of talks with the Palestinians on "permanent
status" issues such as Jerusalem and borders, he added.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Israel and the Palestinian-controlled territories,
Albright will also visit Syria for the first time in almost two
years.
</P>
<P>
"It will be an opportunity to have an extensive discussion
with the leaders in Syria about their views on the Syria track
-- the first time such a discussion will have been held in a
very, very long time, at the end of which one will have a better
sense of what is possible and not possible," Rubin said.

<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- All major European bourses closed
higher Monday despite jitters over the U.S. interest rate outlook
and the dismissal of Russia's fourth prime minister in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
London's benchmark FTSE 100 trimmed early gains to finish the
session 0.09 percent higher at 6,126.4, a gain of just 5.4 points.
</P>
<P>
Telecoms stocks pulled the index higher in early trade, making
recoveries after last week's heavy falls. BT was up 12p to 951p
and Vodafone AirTouch rose 16p to 1176p.
</P>
<P>
But when Wall Street opened, U.S. interest rate fears were
still in evidence and the Dow Jones immediately fell leaving the
FTSE 100 up a mere 5.4 points at the close.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's electronic Xetra Dax closed up 1.53 percent, or
76.83 points, at 5,078,30, driven by gains in telecoms.
</P>
<P>
But the mood was wary as investors remained vigilant over the
next direction in U.S. interest rates, which will be signaled when
the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets on August 24.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the blue chip CAC 40 snapped a five session losing
streak to close up 1.64 percent, or 69.26 points, at 4,292.90 on
market volume of 1.96 billion euros.

The request would help harmonize the technical arrangements
with the OAU framework agreement and its implementation
modalities, Meles said, noting that Ethiopia had always been
committed to implementing the OAU framework agreement and its
modalities.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia would make known its position after it receives a
response from the OAU, an official from the Foreign Ministry said.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of Ghana's Parliament
Francis Annan has criticised programs which are designed to
address debt and poverty, for not aiming at a true and lasting
response to poverty.
</P>
<P>
 He called on the international community Sunday to respond
positively to the changing trends and ensure that Africa does not
finish at the losing end, even though it is made to think that the
changes are intended for its benefit, the Ghana News Agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
 Annan was speaking at a dinner given to visiting British
parliamentarians, and delegates of the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association (CPA), Africa region who are in Accra, the capital, to
attend a meeting starting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
 The British parliamentarians and their Ghanaian counterparts
discussed the sustenance of the democratization process,
socio-economic development, development assistance and good
governance.
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent reference to the fall in gold and cocoa
prices, Annan said: "We must once again draw your attention to the
real concerns that we in the gold producing countries,
particularly Ghana and South Africa, have registered about selling
gold to finance debt reduction."
</P>
<P>
 He described the consequence of widespread poverty as
"debilitating and even dehumanizing," saying this might erode
confidence in the democratic process being established.
</P>
<P>
Annan thanked Britain for its assistance to Ghana's young
parliament since the re-birth of parliamentary democracy six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Diane Abbot, Britain's Labour MP and leader of the
seven-member delegation, described the visit as a magnificent one
that gave them "a life- time treat".
</P>
<P>
 She said they met the majority and minority MPs and had
practical and useful discussions, including sentiments in the gold
industry in Ghana and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
 "We will take back the sentiments discussed and will let you
have the feedback," she said, adding Britain and Africa are
linked in several ways out of which has grown a very genuine
mutual respect and love that must be nurtured to meet the
aspirations of the peoples of both countries.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Day of World's Indigenous People Marked at U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Day of
the World's Indigenous people, which falls on Monday, is
celebrated at the United Nations headquarters in New York with two
days of workshops and events.
</P>
<P>
These events include a cultural event paying tribute to
indigenous human rights defender, a Sacred Pipe Ceremony and the
official opening of an exhibit of Australian Aboriginal art.
</P>
<P>
Topics for the workshops include the relationship of indigenous
peoples to land and how indigenous peoples can lobby governments.
</P>
<P>
Indigenous peoples from around the world will gather for the
events, which are open to the public here.
</P>
<P>
The International Day of the World's Indigenous People is an
opportunity for indigenous peoples and groups, working together
with other interested parties, to organize activities which raise
awareness about indigenous peoples, their history, their cultures,
their aspirations and their contemporary concerns, U.N. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
In his statement on the occasion of the International Day in
1999, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that as the world
celebrates this day for the last time in the 20th century, "we
remember the many centuries of adversity which indigenous peoples
have suffered around the world and pledge that the next century
will be different." "We recognize the resilience and richness of
our world's indigenous heritage, and we recommit ourselves to
ensuring that these ancient traditions enter a new age -- an era
not only of survival, but of revival," he said.
</P>
<P>
The International Day was first proclaimed by the United
Nations General Assembly in 1994 to be observed each year during
the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People
(1995-2004).
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are at least 5,000 indigenous groups
composed of 300 million people living in more than 70 countries on
the five continents. Their way of life, livelihood, religion and
culture are inextricably interwined with and dependent on the
traditional environment in which they live, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In many parts of the world, the cultures of indigenous peoples
are precariously balanced on the edge of extinction, the officials
added.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Network, System Management Market Expands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide network and
system management (NSM) market is on pace to reach 10.8 billion
U.S. dollars in 1999, according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
In 2002, the market is expected to surpass 18 billion dollars
U.S. research firm Dataquest said. On the other hand, the middle
prise segment is projected to account for 24 percent of the total
NSM market with revenue of 2.6 billion dollars this year and will
nearly double by 2002 with revenue reaching 5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest defines the middle market for NSM as prisemarket --
companies with the number of employees ranging between 500 to
4,500 and revenue between 50 million dollars and 1 billion
dollars.The research firm estimates there are currently between
75,000 to 100,000 U.S.-based companies that fall into this
category. Because the NSM middleprise market has been relatively
untapped, Dataquest believes that there are great opportunities
for vendors to thrive in this marketplace.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest expects middleprise organizations to grow revenue and
employee count quickly, and these organizations believe their
technology infrastructure will give them a competitive advantage.
With this belief accelerating purchasing decisions, there are
plenty of selling opportunities for vendors selling to the NSM
middleprisesegment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Launches Stamp Available Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Postal Service Monday
launched PC Postage, a stamp which users can buy over the Internet
and print it through personal computers.
</P>
<P>
The system eventually could change the way many people put
postage on their envelopes, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Consumers would go online to one of the companies offering PC
Postage. With an ordinary laser or inkjet printer, a barcode would
be printed on each envelope to indicate mail processing
information and postage payment. For packages, consumers would
enter the weight, buy the appropriate amount of postage and print
it on labels to be put on the packages.
</P>
<P>
"With PC Postage you can purchase and print postage 24 hours a
day, seven days a week from the convenience of your home or
office," said Pam Gibert, Postal Service vice president of retail.
</P>
<P>
Stamps.com and E-Stamp Corp., both of whom are based in
California, began offering the computerized postage Monday. Two
other companies -- Neopost Inc. of Hayward, California, and Pitney
Bowes of Stamford, Connecticut -- are to begin offering the
products in coming months.
</P>
<P>
Consumers can use those companies' Web sites to purchase and
print postage for domestic first-class, priority and express mail
and for parcel post envelopes and packages.
</P>
<P>
With each company, the consumer goes to the company's Web site
to register and download any required software. Some companies
offer the software free while others require a fee.
</P>
<P>
Consumers also will pay handling fees to the companies -- they
will range from 1.99 to 19.99 U.S. dollars a month depending on usage
rates, according to companies' plans -- along with payment for the
postage. Purchases can be made either by debit or credit card.
</P>
<P>
During the three years of working on PC Postage, each company
has had to meet requirements to ensure the security of the system,
Gibert said.
</P>
<P>
Even with high-tech stamps, the traditional stamp isn't headed
for extinction, Gibert said.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Says His Job in Brussels Definitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Marking his 60th birthday in Italy's
central town of Felina Monday, European Commission (EU)
president-designate Romano Prodi said his job in Brussels was
"definitive".
</P>
<P>
"There is not even any discussion of whether my commitment in
the EU is temporary or definitive, my job in Brussels is
definitive," he told a group of sympathizers, friends and the odd
reporter in this hamlet in the Apennine mountains.
</P>
<P>
"I will devote the next five years totally in that direction,"
said Prodi of his coming 5-year term as commission president, if
his appointment is confirmed by the European parliament.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he expects to be on a part-time basis between
Brussels and Italy, he was equally firm: "No, it's five years at
the EU because when you start a mission of this kind, you don't
share it with something else."
</P>
<P>
According to Prodi's spokesman, Franco Riccardo Levi, the
Italian former premier, whose Democrat party proved a major force
on the center-left in June's European elections, was ruling out
any idea that he might consider running in the Italian elections
to be held no later than the Spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Prodi was also clearly bursting with enthusiasm at the
challenges he expects to be facing at the helm of the EU's
executive and cited what he expects to be the main priorities:
employment, a common European foreign policy, and the EU's
expansion, first of all into central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that Europe will make its mark on the next
millennium as well as on all future economic relationships," he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- All major European bourses closed
higher Monday despite jitters over the U.S. interest rate outlook
and the dismissal of Russia's fourth prime minister in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
London's benchmark FTSE 100 trimmed early gains to finish the
session 0.09 percent higher at 6,126.4, a gain of just 5.4 points.
</P>
<P>
Telecoms stocks pulled the index higher in early trade, making
recoveries after last week's heavy falls. BT was up 12p to 951p
and Vodafone AirTouch rose 16p to 1176p.
</P>
<P>
But when Wall Street opened, U.S. interest rate fears were
still in evidence and the Dow Jones immediately fell leaving the
FTSE 100 up a mere 5.4 points at the close.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's electronic Xetra Dax closed up 1.53 percent, or
76.83 points, at 5,078,30, driven by gains in telecoms.
</P>
<P>
But the mood was wary as investors remained vigilant over the
next direction in U.S. interest rates, which will be signaled when
the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets on August 24.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the blue chip CAC 40 snapped a five session losing
streak to close up 1.64 percent, or 69.26 points, at 4,292.90 on
market volume of 1.96 billion euros.

<HEADLINE> Newborn Babies at Risk if Released from Hospital Early, Research Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Medical Association
Journal said Tuesday that babies are at a high risk of getting
sick if released from hospital too soon after birth.
</P>
<P>
Newborns released from the hospital within two days of being
born are twice as likely to suffer from jaundice, dehydration or
respiratory infections in their first month, compared with those
discharged from hospital after four to six days, the journal said.
</P>
<P>
Based on a study of health records of 7,009 babies born at a
Toronto-area hospital, the journal warned of a trend showing that
the length of a hospital stay following childbirth had gone from
six days to two days or less.
</P>
<P>
More and more women and newborns are released earlier from
hospital due partly to cost considerations, the journal said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Non-performing Loans Still High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The level of non-performing
loans (NPLs) in the Thai banking system is still high at 47.7
percent of total credits, said a Government House press release
issued after the cabinet meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NPLs of financial institutions totaled 2.73 trillion baht
(73.8 billion U.S. dollars), or 47.7 percent of total credits at
the end of May, the release said.
</P>
<P>
In May only, NPLs increased 27 billion baht (729.7 million
dollars), mostly from public commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
In private commercial banks, NPLs totaled 1.3 trillion baht
(35.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The increased NPLs in the private banks are mostly from real
estate business, industry and wholesale and retail business, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, foreign commercial banks have remaining NPLs
totaling 86 billion baht (2.3 billion dollars), or 11.7 percent of
total credits, while finance companies have 2.6 billion baht (70.3
million dollars) of NPLs mostly in the personal consumption
sector.
</P>
<P>
High proportion of NPLs in the local banking system has led to
weak bank lending, which greatly hampered the process of the
country's economic recovery.

<HEADLINE> Denunciation of Falun Gong Continues Across Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Officials and the general public
across China continue to lash out at Li Hongzhi and his Falun Gong
organization, with an increasing number of people coming to
realize the true nature of the cult.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong has fooled and instigated practitioners to besiege
and disturb government departments and the media in the past few
years. In particular, the April 25 gathering at the Zhongnanhai
compound severely disordered the routine work of the Party and
government institutions, and jeopardized Beijing's stability, in
violation of the Constitution and other regulations, said Tian
Shuyu, a judge at the people's higher court of north China's Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Falun Dafa Research Society was illegal because it was not
registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs, said Chai Zhenguo,
a law professor with the Hebei University of Economics and Trade.
Just as illegal were the activities organized by the organization
that disturbed social order.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shasha, one of the former heads of Falun Gong's general
training center in Shenyang, the capital of northeast China's
Liaoning Province, participated in the December 31 gathering
around the provincial government building, and the April 25
gathering at the Zhongnanhai compound.
</P>
<P>
But now she has broken with the cult. The 48-year-old Party
member said that Li Hongzhi often agitated practitioners to put
pressure upon governments, and that he adopted many illegal means
to materialize his ulterior political motives.
</P>
<P>
Experts from legal circles in Jilin Province and other
localities have suggested strengthening legal education for the
public, in a bid to raise legal awareness among the general public.

<HEADLINE> People's Movement for Peace to Be Launched in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A strong people's movement will
be launched in Sri Lanka to push for a political solution to the
ongoing ethnic civil war, the official radio reported Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
The organization named "Our Voice" will be launched in Colombo
Thursday, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted the acting secretary of the organization,
Jayantha Perera, as saying that a memorandum will be handed over
to President Chandrika Kumaratunga and the leader of the main
opposition United National Party.
</P>
<P>
Perera said the ongoing war is causing untold misery and
suffering to the people of Sri Lanka without a foreseeable end.
</P>
<P>
He said Sri Lankans have demolished all opportunities for the
solution to the ethnic problem due to their narrow political
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
The organization plans to mediate strongly to end the war in
Sri Lanka's north and east, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old civil war between
the government and Tamil rebels who demand a separate homeland for
minority Tamils in the north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The government has proposed a devolution package to resolve the
ethnic conflict but the package has been on the shelf as it lacks
a two-thirds majority in Parliament to come into law without the
opposition's approval.

<HEADLINE> British Trio Pull out of Zurich Athletic Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- British athletes Colin Jackson,
Steve Backley and Kelly Holmes have decided to quit the IAAF
Golden League meeting in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss venue has traditionally attracted Britain's best but,
with the World Championships in Seville looming large, Holmes has
completed a trio of withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, gunning for a second world title over the 110 meters
hurdles in Seville, has a stomach upset and javelin ace Backley
has a slight injury problem with his left knee.
</P>
<P>
Holmes, after two disappointing 1,500m performances recently,
has opted to put things right on the training track.
</P>
<P>
The new crop of British sprint stars - Dwain Chambers, Jason
Gardener and Darren Campbell - have also turned down the
opportunity of one final 100m head-to-head with world record
holder and Seville gold medal favourite Maurice Greene of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
That leaves Commonwealth champion Julian Golding as the
brightest British hope when the action begins in the Letzigrund
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The Blackheath Harrier has looked very sharp recently, running
20.20 seconds to win the recent AAA title and clocking 20.23
seconds when winning Saturday's British Grand Prix at Crystal
Palace.
</P>
<P>
Golding is up against world outdoor and indoor champions Ato
Boldon of Trinidad and Namibia's Frankie Fredericks, and the
Londoner could be inspired to improve on his personal best 20.18
seconds.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Business People Slam Lee Teng-hui's Splittist Remarks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xu Junda, chairman of the Taiwan Compatriots' Investment
Association, said that trade cooperation across the straits has
proceeded well over the past decade, with more than 40,000 Taiwan
enterprises established on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Such good relations have been damaged by Lee Teng-hui's "two
states" remark, and the stock index has plunged again and again on
Taiwan's bourse, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that people of integrity, no matter whether they live
on the mainland or in Taiwan, all wish that China can become
stronger, and most Taiwanese do not want to be isolated from the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue should be resolved peacefully by the
authorities on both sides of the straits, and with wisdom. No
businessmen from Taiwan want a deterioration of normal relations,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Business People Slam Lee Teng-hui's Splittist Remarks (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huang Yijian, general manager of another Taiwan-funded company,
said that great changes have taken place in Fuzhou over the past
few years, with the investment environment getting much better.
All this can be attributed to the reform and opening-up drive and
the more relaxed atmosphere across the straits.
</P>
<P>
Xi Jinping, acting governor of Fujian Province, said that the
atmosphere has become better on the whole since the opening-up,
and economic and trade cooperation between Fujian and Taiwan has
speeded up.
</P>
<P>
The cross-straits relations must turn for the better, which is
in the interests of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
The reunification process is irreversible, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Now, Hong Kong has returned to the motherland, and Macao will
return late this year. The Taiwan issue faces us and cannot drag
on for ever," he said.
</P>
<P>
The policy of "one country, two systems" has been proved
feasible, and even Western countries regarded it as a first-rate
idea, but Lee has attempted to redefine it as "state-to-state"
relations at this crucial time. Lee was not taking Taiwan people's
interests seriously, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fujian, as a front-line province opposite Taiwan, will try to
make its due contributions to the reunification of the motherland,
Xi concluded.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Insists no Wrongdoing over "Cash Gift" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson said on Tuesday that he did nothing wrong in handling the
cash gift from Russian soccer agent Grigory Yessaoulenko.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson revealed in his new book Managing My Life that the
agent had handed him a 40,000 pounds (64,500) "gift" after his
client Andrei Kanchelskis signed a new deal at United in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson made the club's officials aware of the payment but the
cash was kept at Old Trafford for a year before being repaid to
Yessaoulenko.
</P>
<P>
The revelation has prompted the English F.A. to seek
discussions with the United manager before handing a report to
FIFA.
</P>
<P>
The F.A. has already stressed, however, that Ferguson is not
being investigated for any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson will tell the F.A. he feels no guilt for the way he
handled the situation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely happy with the way I conducted myself during,"
Ferguson said at the book's launch.
</P>
<P>
He also backed the club's decision to hold on to the money
rather than informing the footballing authorities.
</P>
<P>
"I think the feeling was that he (Yessaoulenko) was always
about the place because he was always on Andrei's shoulder but
then he never appeared for a while and when he came back it was
given to him right away.
</P>
<P>
"I think that was the right thing. I don't think the club has
done anything wrong."
</P>
<P>
Ferguson also questioned the assertion that the payment had
been an attempted "bung."
</P>
<P>
He said: "There are a lot of ways at looking at what the word
bung really means.
</P>
<P>
"What is a bung? I think (it's) if someone gives you money to
affect something and make something happen but this is three
months after Andrei signed a contract. He had been with the club
three years at the time."
</P>
<P>
Kanchelskis eventually moved to Everton in a five million
pounds deal (8 million pounds).

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Launch CyberIncubator Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is expected to set
up its first CyberIncubator in Mid-September in order to help high
technology start-ups in the region.
</P>
<P>
The CyberIncubator, known as SHKP Tech Center, will be jointly
sponsored by the Hong Kong Industrial Technology Center
Corporation (Tech Center) and the Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (
SHKP).
</P>
<P>
The CyberIncubator, capable of accommodating over 10 technology
start-ups, comes with a business center, broadband Internet
connection and structured cabling. It is well designed for
software companies.
</P>
<P>
SHKP provides ready-to-use office premises free of charge and
the Tech Center helps run the premises with a full service
business center, according to the agreement announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Tech Center also provides credit allowance valued at 240,
000 HK dollars (about 30,700 U.S. dollars) to each technology
start-up and incubates it with the "We Make Succeed" Program for
three years.
</P>
<P>
In return for services and office space received, the
technology start-up will contribute a certain percentage of equity
to the Tech Center and SHKP.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the launch ceremony, James Liu, CEO of the Tech
Center, said the CyberIncubator is a tripartite program between
the property developers, technology start-ups and the Tech Center.
</P>
<P>
"The Tech Center and property developers are showing their
support to high-tech companies by investing resources that are
geared toward their long-term success. When a technology start-up
becomes successful, all parties benefit.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the CyberIncubator also helps boost the property
market, create more jobs and drive economic growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the relevant regulation, a technology company
eligible to apply for the CyberIncubator should be commercially
viable, has the potential for future growth and is led by a
balanced management team.
</P>
<P>
The company should be small and young limited company with a
minimum paid-up capital of 400,000 HK dollars (about 51,000 U.S.
dollars). It must be registered in Hong Kong with at least two
full-time employees, one of whom is a shareholder.

<HEADLINE> Macao People to Celebrate China's National Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- People of various social quarters
here will form a preparatory committee on August 23 to take
charge of extensive celebration activities for the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>

great changes of the country and felt the support of the
motherland since the founding of New China," Ma said. "The fate of
Macao is closely related to that of the motherland, and only a
stronger motherland can give Macao a brighter future."
</P>

Following Hong Kong's return to the motherland, Macao's return
will be the second step to the realization of the peaceful

<HEADLINE> Greece Takes Measures to Deal With Heatwave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece has taken measures to help
people tackle the heatwave, which is now hitting the country with
high temperatures soaring to more than 42 degrees Celsius on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second heatwave in Greece this year, the first one
took place in July with high temperatures rising to 40 degrees
Celsius in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Average temperatures in Greece for August usually hover around
35 degrees Celsius. In 1987, more than 1,000 people died in a
heatwave when temperatures jumped above 42 degrees Celsius for
more than a week.
</P>
<P>
Greece has since Monday began an emergency plan to deal with
the heatwave, which will last until Thursday. As part of the plan,
hospitals and emergency services have been placed on full alert to
deal with possible heat-related ailments.
</P>
<P>
The fire service has been also placed on alert to deal with
possible brush or forest fires sparked by the heat.
</P>
<P>
Pathologists and cardiologists are manning a special telephone
line for the capital city of Athens while residents in the port
city of Piraeus can access a similar service. Information is also
provided via the express ambulance service (EKAV) 166 hotline.
</P>
<P>
Many of Athens' nearly 5 million people have left the capital
for their annual summer vacation, but the Greek Health Ministry
also issued a warning for vulnerable groups such as the elderly,
children and chronic disease patients to avoid unnecessary outdoor
activities, exposure to the sun and the consumption of alcohol,
recommending regular showers, light clothing and meals as well as
increased liquid intake, particularly water.
</P>
<P>
In Athens and other urban centers, large air-conditioned
auditoriums and public buildings are open for people suffering
from the heat. Public beaches run by municipalities or the
Hellenic Tourism Organization (EOT) stay open to the public as
late as 11 P.M. (local time), with no entrance fee charged.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Labor Center has issued a release requesting reduced
working hours while the union of professional footballers has also
sent a letter to the Greek Soccer Federation seeking a
postponement of all cup games during the heatwave which began to
hit Greece on Monday.

ISLAMABAD, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Tuesday called on the
international community to pay attention to the "unprovoked act of
Indian military aggression" in shooting down an unarmed Pakistan
navy aircraft.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the Foreign Office said that Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz has sent letters to the President of the U.N.
Security Council and the U.N. Secretary General as well as the
Organization of Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in his letter that the Indian aggression has resulted
in the loss of 16 naval personnel including five officers who were

<P>
"This cold blooded murder deserves strong condemnation by the
international community and the Organization of the Islamic
Conference," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility of this wanton and cowardly act rests
squarely with India. Pakistan reserves the right to make an
appropriate response in self-defense," Aziz added.

<HEADLINE> Calgary Fire Out with Probe On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A probe is going on in abreast
with cleaning work after the extinction of the worst fire in
Canada's southwest industrial city Calgary.
</P>
<P>
At the wreckage site of the Hub Oil, the oil recycling refinery
situated at the southeast outskirt of the city, investigators are
busy looking for remains of the two missing workers who were
believed at the site when the explosion induced fire erupted at
noon Monday.
</P>
<P>
The probe is also directed at any evidence for cause of the
fire, which lasted more than 10 hours before finally put out in a
75-minute, all-out assault by a crew of 25, five pumper trucks, a
foam truck and a large aerial truck.
</P>
<P>
Cleaning personnel moved in for restoration work, but the latest
live reports from the city said that nearly everything had been
tainted including water.
</P>
<P>
Specialists however dismiss the suspicion that the fire has
caused a serious pollution problem, describing the blaze as "a
very clean burn".
</P>
<P>
Live reports also indicated that it might be impossible for
families to rebuild their houses around the wreckage site in case
of any possible hazardous aftermath.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people were evacuated from the neighbourhood of
the refinery, where more than a dozen oil tanks exploded one after
another in "a historic and tragic" huge fire, which was fuelled by
oil, jet fuel and propane with thousands of litres of foam and
water late Monday.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Shanties Demolished in Bangladeshi Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000 shanties in the
Bangladeshi capital Dhaka were demolished by police Tuesday as
part of the Home Ministry's slum eviction drive in the city.
</P>
<P>
All the squatters in shanties on both sides of the Janapath
from Khilgaon railway crossing to Malibagh railway crossing,
possibly the longest slum in the capital, were evicted
"peacefully," a senior police officer said.
</P>
<P>
The slum was a den of criminal, the police said.
</P>
<P>
It is said there were around 2 million slum dwellers in Dhaka,
which is expanding rapidly housing about 9 million people.
</P>
<P>
A section of the slum dwellers under the patronage of some
godfathers were involved in drug and arms trafficking, and the
drive, aimed at cutting crime and criminal activities, would
continue till the removal of the last slum from the capital,
according to the police.
</P>
<P>
The government took the decision to clear all unauthorized
occupants from slums and level up illegal structures following the
killing of a police constable in the city last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police demolished more than 2,000 shanties Monday and removed
over 40,000 slum dwellers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The government has constituted a 13-member committee to
rehabilitate the slum dwellers evicted from the illegal shanties
in a planned manner, the BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to evict the slum dwellers to curb
slum-based crimes and anti-social activities, and to take
possession of government land from illegal occupants for
implementation of development projects, the BSS added.

<HEADLINE> Premier Stresses Importance of Soil Erosion Control (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has
called for unremitting efforts to control soil erosion on the
upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River to bring benefits to
future generations.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour of northwest China's Shaanxi
Province on August 5-8, Zhu urged local governments to take
concrete measures, including the return of farmland and the
cordoning off of hills for afforestation and grass planting, to
improve the local ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
"Controlling soil erosion and improving ecological environment
is vital to the nation's existence and development in the long run.
Therefore, it must be dealt with from the strategic perspective of
sustainable development," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Great achievements have been scored in environmental
improvement since the reform and opening up policies were
introduced, but many problems still exist, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu criticized some localities for slackening their efforts in
this respect, saying that the felling of trees has not totally
stopped, the acreage of vegetation is on the decline, and soil
erosion is getting worse.
</P>
<P>
"If this trend is not fundamentally reversed, it will
definitely endanger the nation's existence and development, and
bring untold troubles for our offspring," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Zhu stressed that soil erosion control on the Loess Plateau is
the key to harnessing the Yellow River, the second longest in
China and the source of frequent flooding over the past 2,500
years.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China in 1949, a series of flood
control facilities have been built up along the river, but the
danger of flooding still remains acute, he said.

Efforts should be stepped up to breed quality grass seeds and
expand the coverage of grass and trees on the Loess Plateau, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the central government would invest more in
soil erosion control projects on the upper and middle reaches of
the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, the longest in China.
</P>
<P>
He urged the provinces and autonomous regions concerned to
adjust their agricultural structure by reducing farmland on hills
and expand green vegetation areas.
</P>
<P>
"The state will take effective measures to solve the food
problem for the farmers who stop cultivating hilly land," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
After hearing reports of flood control work along the Yellow
River, Zhu asked the localities concerned to be vigilant and fully
prepared for possible floods.
</P>
<P>
On economic work, Zhu said that a good environment for economic
development has been created, due to the central government's
active fiscal policy, its increased spending and its crackdown on
smuggling since last year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, beginning this year, new progress has been made in
the reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), with more SOEs
making profits, he said.

He asked all localities to deepen the reform of enterprises and
improve the quality of products, to ensure good economic returns.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Promises Retaliation Against Japanese Provocation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) told Japan on Tuesday that it will meet
force with force, while calling on Tokyo to pay war compensation
and halt its policy of "stifling" the country.
</P>
<P>
"If Japan dare turn to a showdown of strength in a bid to find
a pretext to realize the wild ambition for re-invasion, we will
have no option but to take a corresponding countermeasure," the
DPRK government said in a statement, released two days after the
54th anniversary Sunday of DPRK's liberation from Japanese
colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
The statement, carried by DPRK's Korean Central News Agency,
accused the former Imperial Japanese Army of killing more than one
million Korean people and using nearly 200,000 Korean women as sex
slaves.
</P>
<P>
"Japan can never flee from its legal and moral obligation to
make a thoroughgoing apology and compensation," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
While DPRK welcomes any moves by Japan to come to terms with
its past, the country will initiate "merciless retaliation" toward
any Japanese "reckless provocation," it said.

at the ongoing National Anti-drug Conference, which opened
yesterday in this industrial city in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Jia Chunwang, director of the National
Narcotics Control Commission and minister of Public Security,
called on all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities to
set up their own anti-drug education centers within the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
He also urged that more anti-narcotics activities be carried
out in universities, and primary and secondary schools, and
encouraged the publication of more anti-narcotics literary and
artistic works.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the departments concerned should work
harder to conduct all-round, multi-level and multi-formed
educational activities against narcotics, so as to create a better
social environment for the nationwide anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that the departments concerned "should pay particular

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Pakistani Plane Shot Down by India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz confirmed Tuesday afternoon that a Pakistani navy
plane was shot down by Indian troops Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told a press conference here that the unarmed plane was
shot down at around 11:30 a.m. local time (0630 GMT) by air-to-air
missiles launched from two Indian air force aircraft.
</P>
<P>
All the 16 people on board the plane, including five navy
officers, were killed.
</P>
<P>
The plane was shot over Badin district in southern Sindh
province near the border between Sindh and India's western state
of Gujarat, other Pakistani sources said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said a navy plane was missing and its wreckage
was finally found at a site in Badin after several hours' search
by helicopters.
</P>
<P>
A press party was soon taken to the site to witness the plane
wreckage which Pakistan claimed to be two miles from the
international border.
</P>
<P>
The plane, Atlantic of French origin, took off in the morning
from the Karachi naval base and was on routine patrolling duty,
said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The "unprovoked" attack, which came as the plane was well in
Pakistani air space and without any warning, violated the related
agreement the two countries signed in 1991, Pakistani Information
Minister Mushahid Hussain Sayed told a BBC program.
</P>
<P>
Mushahid said the latest accident might be a revenge action
taken by India against the downing of two Indian jets during the
Kashmir conflict.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan reserves the right to respond, he said.
</P>
<P>
India claimed that the plane shot down was a maritime
reconnaissance and anti-submarine aircraft and that it intruded
four kilometers into the Indian air space.
</P>
<P>
India said the plane wreckage was found on the Indian side of
the international border.

ISLAMABAD, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
Tuesday lodged a strong protest with India over the downing of a
Pakistani naval plane by Indian troops.
</P>
<P>
The Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad was summoned to the
Foreign Office Tuesday afternoon and a strong protest was lodged
with him over the "unprovoked" shooting down of the unarmed
aircraft on a routine training flight, according to an official
press release.
</P>
<P>
"This blatant and unprovoked act of military aggression against
an unarmed aircraft is a flagrant violation of international norms
relating to inviolability of international frontiers as well as
the bilateral Pakistan-India agreement on the Prevention of
Airspace Violation of 1991," said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani plane was shot down at around 11:30 a.m. local
time (0630 GMT) by air-to-air missiles launched from two Indian
air force aircraft and all the 16 people on board were killed.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan said the plane was well inside its territory and its
wreckage fell at a site in coastal area of southern Sindh
province, two miles from the international border, but India
claimed that the plane wrecked in the Indian territory.
</P>
<P>
The responsibility for this wanton and cowardly act as well as
its consequences rests squarely with India, said the press
release, adding that Pakistan reserves the right to make an
appropriate response in self-defense.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Introduce Central Depository System Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
soon introduce central depository system (CDS) to make the capital
market transparent and regain confidence of the potential
investors, the national news agency BSS reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister A.M.S. Kabria disclosed this while speaking at
a round-table discussion on capital market organized by the Dhaka
Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
The CDS, which will hold securities of investors in the
electronic form and provide services related to transaction in
securities, should be out of the control of the stock exchange and
dealers association, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will extend support to the potential businessmen
for developing the CDS, Kabria stated.
</P>
<P>
He explained the reasons behind the stock market crash in 1996,
saying that people did not invest money in the capital market for
long term gains and they basically traded shares for immediate
profit despite repeated government warnings against whimsical
investment.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the non-payment of dividend after announcement, he
called upon the industrialists to give dividend to the
share-holders in due time to regain confidence of the investors to
boost capital market. "We should promote investing attitude of the
investors by paying due time dividend," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
More new banks will push down the interest rate in a
competitive environment, he predicted, responding to the queries
of industrialists on reducing interest rate of banks. "Market
forces will determine the rate of interest and the government has
nothing to do with it," the minister added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The China State Power
Corporation (CSPC) expects to realize profits totaling 8.6 billion
yuan this year, much more than the 1998 figure, said a senior
power official here today.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, China has given priority to
speeding up restructuring of the power industry and developing the
Three Gorges Power Grid, as well as the country's major provincial
power grids, said Jiang Shaojun, director in charge of the
corporation's strategic studies and planning.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country has made great efforts to perfect the
newly established State Power Corporation, and has made remarkable
progress in transforming it into a giant corporation with more
modern operating methods and a shareholding system.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the country generated 1.16 trillion
kwh of electricity last year, up six percent from a year earlier,
and absorbed contracted overseas investment of 1.79 billion U.S.
dollars, up 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
China will see an overall growth in the power sector this year,
said the official, adding that the country has made headway in
building and renovating 87 urban power grid projects and 1,590
rural ones.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China has effectively restructured its power industry
by closing a large number of small thermal power plants with high
coal consumption, heavy pollution, and poor economic efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Is Well Organized: Insiders (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Some key members of the outlawed
Falun Gong sect have said that it had well-organized networks and
ulterior political motives.
</P>
<P>
Yu Ruichen, head of the Falun Gong general training center in
Zhengzhou, capital of central China's Henan Province, said that Li
Hongzhi, the Falun Gong founder and leader, was lying when he said
that the sect had no organizations.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, it had a strict organizational system,
with the Beijing-based Falun Dafa Research Society as its top
governing body. It set up general training centers, sub-stations
and exercise spots in provinces and municipalities, Yu said,
adding that in Zhengzhou City there were a general training center,
five sub-stations and many exercise spots.
</P>
<P>
Li's orders were passed down from the Beijing-based society to
every practitioner through telephones, fax and the Internet, Yu
said.
</P>
<P>
Feng Runti, the former head of the Falun Gong sub-station in
Xihua County, said that his sub-station often received Li Hongzhi'
s "teachings" and instructions from higher-level organizations,
and had to report its operations to the immediately higher-level
station.
</P>
<P>
Li tightened his control over practitioners ideologically. "We
were told that what he said was law, and whoever opposed his
statements would be committing a felony," Feng said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Lianying, the former deputy head of the Zhengzhou general
training center, turned in 257 Falun Gong-related books and audio-
visual materials worth several thousand yuan. She admitted that
she herself had bought the materials, some of which she was going
to sell to new recruits to the cult.

worth nearly 600 yuan in three months," said Zhang Guangxue and
She Guizhi, an elderly couple of Falun Gong practitioners in
Puyang City.
</P>
<P>
The sect was an anti-science and anti-government organization,
said Xu Zhuangchao, the former head of the western suburbs
training center in Nanning City, the capital of south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Xu, who served as vice-chairman of a local
pharmaceutical group's trade union, said that the heads of the
training centers in the city convened regularly every month to
read Falun Gong-related documents and report what was going on at
each center.
</P>
<P>
Cao Xuwu, the former head of the general training center in
Changsha, the capital of central China's Hunan Province, said that
he felt guilty about what he had done to help spread the sect's
fallacies.
</P>

Some practitioners began to have doubts about Li Hongzhi's
promise not to interfere in politics after the April 25 illegal
gathering around the Zhongnanhai compound, the site of the Chinese

<HEADLINE> Thailand Launches New Economic Stimulus Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday gave
its nod to a new stimulus package, which aims to further spur the
economic recovery by reducing import duties and mobilizing funds.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet outlined four key aspects of the package, namely,
tax and tariff measures, equity investment measures, measures to
promote the recovery of the real estate sector, and measures to
improve financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
</P>
<P>
The cabinet approved to cut the import duties, mainly on raw
materials, intermediate goods and products that are not being
produced domestically, to help reduce the production cost of Thai
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government is also to set up three new funds, namely,
the Equity Fund, the Thailand Recovery Fund and the Fund for
Venture Capital Investment in SMEs, to encourage the
debt-restructuring of corporate sector and boost the investment of
the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Equity Fund will be established to seek investment in
large-scale enterprises in Thailand which are competitive but so
far have been denied liquidity from the banking system.
</P>
<P>
The Thailand Recovery Fund, in which the Asian Development Bank
will become a key partner, will serve medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund has also expressed
strong interest in jointly investing in the fund, which will have
an initial start up capital of 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
To support small scale enterprises, the state-controlled Small
Industry Finance Corporation will be providing soft-loan funding
to the sector.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has allocated one billion baht (27 million
dollars) of funds drawn from structural adjustment loans.
</P>
<P>
The government will also mobilize another 67 billion baht (1.8
billion dollars) to create the liquidity and improve the consumer
demand in the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
To reach the goal, the Government Housing Bank will issue a
housing bond worth 46 billion baht (1.24 billion dollars) with
three to five-year maturity, while the state-run Secondary
Mortgage Corporation will raise another four billion baht (459.5
million dollars) in National Housing Authority as part of the
state agency's reserve to purchase and develop the incompleted
housing project for sale to the small income people.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the government will cut the fee for the
transfer of land titles to help boost the transaction in property
market as well.
</P>
<P>
The new stimulus package is the third part of a three-pronged
strategy of the government to reform the economy, following
measures on August 14, 1998 to reform the financial and banking
sector and those on March 30 to boost government fiscal spending
and consumer demand.

<HEADLINE> No Need to Fear Peso Depreciation: Philippine Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government assured
the public Tuesday that there is no need to worry about the slight
depreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar, which it said
was due to external influences.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Edgardo Espiritu of the Department of Finance said
the Philippine Central Bank has large foreign reserves to cushion
the impact of the peso's weakening.
</P>
<P>
"Fundamentally, we are still doing well. Let's not worry. This
is a moderate adjustment since interest rates have been going down
for five months," Espiritu said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange reserves have reached a record
high of 14 billion U.S. dollars and are expected to remain strong
with the steady flow of remittances from overseas Filipino workers
and the entry of foreign investments and dollar loans.
</P>
<P>
Some sectors have aired concern over the peso's strength after
its foreign exchange rate dipped to 39.28 pesos against the
dollar, a six-month low in Monday's trading.
</P>
<P>
But Espiritu pointed out that currencies in neighboring
countries such as Thailand and Indonesia, have also experienced
mild dips.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said the slight drop in the value of Asian currencies,
including the Philippine peso, was due to doubts about the
performance of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is no need for the central bank to
intervene because there have been no sharp fluctuations in the
peso-dollar exchange rate. He said that the local currency's value
against the greenback dropped by at least one peso over a span of

Bosnich is having treatment on a groin strain he suffered in

"Mark's got a groin strain and we'll have to wait to see how he

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona have ruled out any
chance of selling Brazilian ace Rivaldo to European champions
Manchester United, saying the midfielder is "untouchable".
</P>
<P>
"He's untouchable. We're not even considering listening to any
offers," club chairman Josep Lluis Nunez told the Barcelona sports
daily, El Mundo Deportivo.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Tuesday, Nunez was reacting to
press speculation that United were drawing up a multi-million
pound deal to lure the gifted playmaker.
</P>
<P>
Sir Alex Ferguson has refused to say whether he is interested
in the Brazilian, but has admitted he thinks Rivaldo, who scored
twice when Barcelona played United in the Champions League last
November, is the best player in the world.
</P>
<P>
British press reports said United, the richest club in the
world, were planning to offer Rivaldo nearly 800 million pesetas (
3.18 million pounds), double his yearly salary at Barcelona, as
part of a five billion pesetas (20 million pounds) offer to the
champions of Spain.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona bought Rivaldo from Deportivo de La Coruna two
seasons ago for four billion pesetas (16.25 million pounds) with a
contract waiver clause of 15 billion pesetas (60 million pounds).

<HEADLINE> Putin Vows Harsh Crackdown on Gunmen in Daghestan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia's troops on Tuesday
continued offensive on Islamic militants occupying several
villages in Daghestan, a republic near the breakaway province of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Acting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, on his first working day
after President Boris Yeltsin fired Sergei Stepashin Monday, said
the situation remains tense but will normalize in about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters following a meeting with Yeltsin in the
Kremlin that "a complex of measures have been prepared for
bringing order and discipline to Daghestan."
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Putin chaired a meeting of officials from the
country's Anti-Terrorist Committee, the Defense Ministry, the
Federal Security Service, the Interior Ministry and other power-
wielding agencies.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot see such a state of affairs in the territory of
Russia as tolerable," Putin said, urging various agencies to
improve their interaction and strengthen discipline.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the so-called Islamic Shura of Dagestan adopted a
declaration early Tuesday announcing the establishment of an
Islamic State of Dagestan in the republic's Botlikh region where a
number of villages are controlled by Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
"We, the Muslims of Dagestan, are officially declaring the
restoration of an independent Islamic state of Dagestan. In hope
of the assistance and mercy of Allah, we are declaring that jihad
is the duty of every Muslim in Dagestan who must rise to the
defense of the Islamic state and fight until all the infidels are
ousted from the Muslim territory," the Interfax news agency quoted
a declaration of the Shura as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, prosecutors of the Daghestan republic said the
statement of the Shura, an organization that no one knows in the
republic, is punishable under a series of articles in the Russian
Criminal Code.
</P>
<P>
"The full force of law will be applied to the people who openly
call for the toppling of the constitutional system in the republic,
" the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic militants, who overran a number of villages in west
Dagestan Saturday, have left Echeda, a hamlet in the Tsumadin area,
and re-positioned themselves in the neighboring Botlikh area to re-
group, Interfax reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Federal forces now fully control the Tsumadin area, Interfax
said, quoting the Daghestani Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Amid rising tension in the Caucasus region, authorities in
Moscow have also beefed up security at most important facilities
in the capital to guard against possible terrorist attacks, Tass
reported, quoting the press service of the Russian Interior
Ministry.

PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- About 150 children in the French
city of Thionville will perform a story from the comic-strip
series "Tintin" on Wednesday, the day of the eclipse. The story
was written by Belgian writer Herge.
</P>
<P>
Thionville is located within the belt of the total eclipse in
northern France.
</P>
<P>
The children will perform the story of "Tintin Saved by the

Tintin, his dog "Milou," and his friends -- a ship's captain and
an astrologist -- captured in a city of sun-worshipping Inca
Indians in South America.
</P>
<P>
When the Indians were about to execute Tintin and his friends,
an eclipse occurred, which had been predicted by his astrologist
friend, and since the prediction came true, they were spared from
the axes of the Indians, according to the story.
</P>
<P>
A decorative set resembling an Incan Indian temple will be
constructed in the center of Thionville and the children will wear
Indian costumes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the mayor of the city has asked parents to keep
their children of less than six years of age at home during the
eclipse, in order to prevent accidents.

BAOTOU, August 10 (Xinhua)-- China plans to set up more drug-
free communities nationwide, according to sources at the ongoing
National Anti-Narcotics Conference, which opened Monday in this
industrial city in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Jia Chunwang, director of the National Narcotics Control
Commission, said that the campaign to build "drug-free communities
" is a bold and creative experiment in the quest to find a Chinese
solution to the drug problem.
</P>
<P>
The campaign for "drug-free communities", initiated by Baotou,
aims at making the smallest social units drug-free first. The
combination of an increasing number of drug-free communities is
expected to finally lead to the complete elimination of narcotics
across the country.
</P>
<P>
"As a socialist country, China has its institutional and
political advantages," said Minister of Public Security Jia
Chunwang, who is attending the conference, adding that the fight
against narcotics can not be successful without the support of the
overwhelming masses of the people.
</P>

The campaign for "drug-free communities" aims to involve every
member of a particular community in the fight against narcotics.

Malouh also pointed out a statement released by the Popular

a basic step forward, Voice of Palestine reported.
</P>
<P>
In another development, nine Palestinian groups which are based
in Damascus on Monday "rejected" any dialogue with the Palestinian
National Authority.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a spokesman of the Popular Front has
emphasized the existence of differences between the Popular Front

</P>
<P>
The Popular Front had underlined that dialogue with Arafat
would help maintain the PLO role, whereas, HAMAS reiterated that
dialogue would produce no results.
</P>
<P>
The Fatah movement held dialogues in Cairo on August 1 with the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine as a preliminary
step toward the unification of Palestinian national forces while

MANILA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Bountiful grain harvests and
economic improvements have helped keep prices of prime commodities
stable in the Philippines despite the recent rash of calamities
and disasters, a private price-monitoring group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Consumer and Oil Price Watch, a private sector group that
monitors prices, said a survey conducted last week in the
country's 34 markets showed that prices of 17 prime commodities
remained stable despite the monsoon-induced rains that pounded
Metro Manila and nearby provinces.
</P>
<P>
The prices of rice, milk and meat in Metro Manila, for
instance, did not increase during the week ending August 7,
indicating that the market has adequate supply of these items, the
group said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Goods with stable prices also include ordinary rice, evaporated
milk, powdered milk, coffee, pork and dressed chicken. Prices of
cooking oil and detergent bars actually decreased during the week,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Disaster Coordination Council, last
week's heavy rains damaged nearly 700 million pesos (17.5 million
U.S. dollars) worth of crops and infrastructure projects and
killed at least 156 persons in the northern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
As a result of bountiful harvest of grains during the first
three months of 1999, the country's inflation fell in July to a
23-month low of 5.7 percent which helped keep the prices low in
early August despite the calamities, according to the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government expects to keep inflation rate at a
single digit level, or at around 9.5 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Urged to Tackle Tea Industry Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A major Sri Lankan tea planters'
union Tuesday urged the government to take urgent measures to
avert a full blown crisis in the tea industry.
</P>
<P>
The tea sector had lost more than 4,400 million rupees (61.6
million U.S. dollars) in export revenue in the first five months
of this year despite a production increase of nearly 12 percent,
the Planters' Association of Ceylon said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Average sale prices between January and July 1999 have fallen
by about 34 rupees per kilogram over prices in the corresponding
period last year, and producers, including small holders, are now
facing difficulties in meeting operation costs," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The planters wanted the government to exempt them from a sales
tax and said their employees' wages should be linked to
productivity to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate comment from the government, but it
recently set up a task force to examine the tea industry's
problems.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is the world's biggest exporter of tea.

<HEADLINE> Businessmen Protest Insecurity in Somali Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of angry businessmen
and women Tuesday took to the streets protesting insecurity in the
business centers of Afgoie, a town only 30 kilometers south of
capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Ali Hashi Barreh, one of the demonstrating businessmen told
Xinhua on the telephone that they pay faction leader Hussein Aidid
exorbitant taxes, but no security is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
All markets except the animal market in Afgoie have been closed
until Tuesday noon for the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
However, the security personnel in the town promised the
demonstrators that the security in and around the town will be
improved later.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, growing uncertainty in Puntland in northeastern
Somalia was reported after Abdullahi Yussuf Ahmed, leader of the
regional administration of Puntland, issued a decree sacking 18
officials in the air and sea ports in the towns of Garoweh,
Galkaio and Bossaso.
</P>
<P>
The officials have allegedly caused the loss of some 1.8
million U.S. dollars through mismanaging the funds in the ports.
</P>
<P>
The economy and mismanagement problems have been persisting
reportedly in the northeast during the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Many of the regional administration offices in these towns
remained closed after the administration could not pay the
employees their basic salaries.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the newly-imported Somali bank notes there are also
causing economic hazards by bringing the value of the Somali
shilling down to its lowest in the region ever. The exchange rate
Monday dropped to over 11,800 shillings against one U.S. dollar
from 9,200 shillings against one dollar a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen in northeastern Somalia have expressed concern
over the deteriorating currency.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Stimulus Package Aims to Boost Private Investment: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government's new
stimulus package aims to boost private investment in industrial
sector, Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said at a press conference after the cabinet approved
the package that import tariff cuts and reductions on raw
industrial materials will lower production costs of local
industries and most of the industrial enterprises will benefit
from the cuts.
</P>
<P>
An equity fund worth about 500 million U.S. dollars will be set
up to invest in big businesses or restructure firms which are
highly competitive in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
To boost the property sector, the government will extend loans
to buyers in middle and low income brackets, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The package, jointly proposed by the Finance Ministry and
Industry Ministry, also included loans for small and medium-sized
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It is the third big economic program the Thai government has
launched in one year. Last August the government kicked off a
package to help banks recapitalize and on March 30 this year a
plan was launched to expand fiscal spending.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Reiterates Acceptance of OAU Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile
Weldensea Tuesday reiterated his government's formal acceptance of
a detailed peace plan proposed by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) for the Ethio- Eritrean border dispute.
</P>
<P>
In a statement available here, the minister said that his
government last Saturday officially accepted the OAU proposal on
Technical Arrangements for the implementation of the OAU Framework
Agreement and its modalities.
</P>
<P>
Haile said that the Eritrean government is committed to
cooperating fully with the current OAU Chairman and President of
Algeria Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the OAU, the United Nations and
other partners in implementing the three documents as the sole
bases for resolving the border dispute between Eritrea and
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that it is crystal clear that the present
Technical Arrangements are purely an elaboration of the letter
and spirit of the principles contained in the OAU Framework
Agreement and the Modalities, the two documents endorsed at the
35th OAU summit in Algiers on July 14.
</P>
<P>
Haile told diplomats in Asmara that the Technical Arrangements
are based on the principles of respecting colonial boundaries,
resolving disputes through peaceful and legal means, non-use of
force to settle disputes and non acquisition of land by force.
</P>
<P>
In wake of the Technical Agreements for the implementation of
the Framework Agreement and its modalities, the details of
envisaged next steps would be a formal signing of all three OAU
documents by Eritrean and Ethiopian leaders, a cessation of
hostilities, the redeployment of forces and the installment of
civil administration and delineation/demarcation of the border.
</P>
<P>
The minister also appealed to the international community to
urge Ethiopia to accept the Technical Agreements and move quickly
to implement the OAU peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Ethiopia, which have been at war over their common
border since early last May, received the latest OAU proposal last
week. The conflict between the two sides has claimed tens of
thousands of lives and displaced hundreds of thousands of
civilians.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- One man was shot to death by
police near Jerusalem on Tuesday when he steered his car twice to
the sidewalk at a bus stop in an attempt to run down people.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said that at least nine people were wounded
in the incident and all of them were soldiers and police.
</P>
<P>
Paramedics said that one soldiers was injured seriously and
the others were hurt lightly.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened when the man drove his Fiat Uno car
into a group of people, who were waiting buses at a junction
near the Jerusalem suburb of Beit Shemesh.
</P>
<P>
After the car hit several people, the man sped away and
made a sharp U-turn to plough into the people a second time.
</P>
<P>
Witness told Israel Radio that the man was killed by police
after his car got stuck on the underside of a truck.
</P>
<P>
Shimon Sharvit, the deputy police commander of the central
district, said that the incident was apparently a suicide
terror attack.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Internal Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said that
the driver was a resident of the West Bank city of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said that he hoped the violence would not affect
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. He also called on the
Palestinian National Authority to restrain militants.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Spend $4.4 Million on Prisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.5 billion RF (about
4.435 million U.S. dollars) will be spent in feeding Rwanda's
overcrowded prisons this year, official sources from the Ministry
of Justice said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the new figure is a bit lower
than RF two billion used last year.
</P>
<P>
"Even the two billion spent in the financial year 1998 in
buying foods wasn't enough and this had to be supplemented by the
International Committee for Red Cross," Rwandan Minister of
Justice Jean de Dieu Mucyo told Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"This year we plan to spend RF 1.5 billion which is higher than
the Ministry's budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the Ministry of Finance and
Economic planning realize the burden on prisons' authorities to
feed prisoners, but it could not be revised.
</P>
<P>
The decision stems from the fact that, in the 1999 financial
year, the respective Ministries' budgets were reduced and the
government is under pressure from the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank to cut down on the government spending.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan overcrowded prisons accommodate more than 130,000
prisoners, mostly genocide suspects.
</P>
<P>
"Due to financial constraints and increasing number of genocide
suspects in jails, the Rwandan government has opted for the
traditional courts, locally known as Gacaca, " Mucyo said.

LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>

each be paid 10,000 pounds compensation, even if the terrorists
were planting bombs when they died, a Dublin commission has
proposed.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Boris Yeltsin stunned his compatriots Monday by
sacking his prime minister and naming Vladimir Putin, the little-
known head of the internal security services and former Soviet spy,
as premier and his preferred successor as president.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>

<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>

to prove his credentials as a tough Liberal Democrat leader by

Leone released the three remaining British army offices Monday

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli government is expected to approve the outline
for the 2000 budget Tuesday, at the first of three scheduled
sessions dealing with the budget this month. The first session
will focus on the basic parameters that Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Finance Minister Avraham Shochat have delineated, while the
next two sessions will deal with specific cuts in various
departments.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's security services have recommended sealing a
gateway opened by the Waqf, or the Islamic Trust, Monday in the
southern wall of the Temple Mount enclosure - a move which they
admitted could spark riots by Palestinians. The final decision
will be made by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who is apparently
leaning toward permitting the police to act.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The left-wing Meretz is trying to compel Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to implement change in the order of priorities as the

said it is impossible to go to referendum in peace with a quarter
of a million unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli cabinet ministers attacked the outline of the 2000
budget, saying it "contains no good news for economy." Minister

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's "Two-States" Remark Refuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Today's "People's Daily," China'
s leading newspaper, carries a front-page signed article refuting
Lee Teng-hui's "two-states" statement.
</P>
<P>
The long article says Lee tried to propagate "special state-to-
state relations" in a bid to continue deceiving the Chinese people
including those in Taiwan and the international community.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that the "two-states" statement exposed
the splittist nature of Lee Teng-hui and his followers, who aim to
damage the basis for cross-straits dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The article, signed by Guanchajia (Observer), says that Lee
Teng-hui's "two states" remark has neither historical support nor
a legal basis, and it will surely bring calamities to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the "two states" remark attempts deceive the
Taiwan people by saying "the sovereignty of Taiwan belongs to the
Taiwan people." In this way, it fools the Taiwan people into
thinking that Lee wants them to become their own masters.
</P>
<P>
The article also refutes the so-called "effective rule" theory,
stressing that though China has not achieved reunification, the
fact that sovereignty over Taiwan belongs to China has never
changed.
</P>
<P>
It says the Taiwan people's will to become their own masters
and their desire for reunification of the motherland have never
contradicted each other.
</P>
<P>
The article predicts that Lee's splittist remarks will not
bring security to Taiwan, but will damage the island province's
economy and trade, and eventually bring calamities to the people
of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Unification has always been a mainstay in China's history,
and unification of the nation guarantees the progress of China,"
the article stresses.
</P>
<P>
The article also predicts that Lee Teng-hui and his followers
will not be able to escape the punishment of history if they
continue along this path.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Bans Sudanese Human Rights Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has banned activities in the
country by the Sudanese Organization for Human Rights, the
national Al-Ahram daily reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian Foreign Ministry official said Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa briefed his Sudanese counterpart Mustafa Osman Ismail on
the step in a message conveyed to Ismail on Monday by Egyptian
Charge d'Affaires in Khartoum Desouki Fayed.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told Ismail that Egypt's move was prompted by the
failure of the Sudanese organization to get permission to carry
out activities in Egypt, the pro-government newspaper quoted the
the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
He did not say when Egypt issued the ban on the Sudanese
organization, which publicized recently a film claiming that
slavery exists in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese foreign minister expressed appreciation for the
Egyptian move as it made it clear that Egypt refuses all attempts
aimed at defaming Sudan, the Egyptian official said on customary
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The move showed a further effort to improve Egypt's relations
with its southern neighbor, which soured after Cairo accused
Khartoum of masterminding the 1995 assassination attempt on
President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Sudan has denied
the charge.
</P>
<P>
A thaw appears to have set in after the two Arab neighbors
repeated readiness to improve the ties and took steps in this
respect in the past two years.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Is Asian Recovery on Shaky Ground? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- While Asian economies are showing
signs of a strong recovery, problems such as heavier corporate
debts, rising bad loans and larger government deficits have
aroused fears for a new round of financial crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
This contradictory phenomenon started recently in the course of
the regional economic turnaround.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, Asian economies had been
recovering very fast. After registering a 4.6-percent growth in
the gross national product (GDP) in the first quarter from a
negative 5.8 percent last year, South Korea's economy was expected
to rise by 9 percent in the second quarter, the country's central
bank predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, which suffered a recession in the fourth quarter
of 1998, GDP also grew 6.7 percent in the second quarter, from 1.2
percent in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, problems like private debts have caused
alarm in the region. For example, financial woes of Daewoo in
South Korea aroused fears that the group's debt could spark
another economic crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Noting such a contradictory phenomenon, some economists wonder
if the Asian economic recovery is on shaky ground and could last
long.
</P>
<P>
The Daewoo case has made economists more suspicious about a
real recovery in the region. Daewoo, South Korea's second largest
conglomerate, has the country's largest private sector debt
overhang. The company owes 60 trillion won (about 50 billion U.S.
dollars), or around 13 percent of South Korea's gross national
product (GDP), while its exports account for 13 percent of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
Because of the important role Daewoo plays, the government
admitted that the group's financial woes will be likely to have
some negative impact on the country's overall economy.
</P>
<P>
"We should not under-estimated the importance of Daewoo," said
Eugene Yun, managing director of a Seoul-based investment
consulting firm Blue Nile Partners. But he added:" It is unlikely
to trigger a second crisis (in South Korea)."
</P>
<P>
The debt problem is also confronting other Asian economies. A
debt mountain of some 180 billion dollars owed by private
companies and the government is threatening to disrupt Thailand's
recovery from recession, economists warned.
</P>
<P>
If the debt is not managed properly, analysts said, it could
delay the country's revival after a two-year slump.
</P>
<P>
Another serious problem hindering Asia's full economic recovery
is non-performing loans, which have already amounted to over 1
trillion dollars in the region.
</P>
<P>
In the five crisis-hit countries -- Thailand, Malaysia,
Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea, non-performing loans
have risen to 15 percent to 60 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
While banks, in fear of increasing bad loans, are reluctant to
extend new loans to companies, companies are becoming more
difficult in expanding business, and as a result, they could
hardly repay their loans. That has made the situation from bad to
worse.
</P>
<P>
At the end of May, non-performing loans of Thailand's financial
sector were around 2.73 trillion baht (73.39 billion dollars), or
47.72 percent of the total lending.
</P>
<P>
The huge bad loans are preventing banks to lend normally to
fuel the economic recovery in the region, and governments will
have to spend more to bail out the financial sector, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
The third problem which may affect a lasting recovery is the
larger government deficits. In the early 1990s, the five
crisis-hit nations ran balanced or surplus budgets. But their
average budget deficits will increase to 5-6 percent of GDP in
2000, due to heavier government deficit spending to stimulate
growth.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 80 percent of Asia's growth this year and
the lion's share of its stock rebound come from government
stimulus.
</P>
<P>
But Asian governments cannot continue for too long to increase
deficit spending to promote recovery.
</P>
<P>
"Thais don't feel the pinch now because the government is using
an expansionary fiscal policy to cushion the impact of the crisis.
But it will eventually have to tighten it ... most likely from
2001," said Supavud Saicheua, head of economics and strategy at
Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
"By then, the government might have to earmark up to 10 percent
of the budget to service debt, and will have very little money
left for investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, all these problems are unlikely to stop the recovery
process in Asia, where the financial market has already stabilized
and the general growth trend seems irreversible. Many economists
do not agree that the Asian recovery is on shaky ground
</P>
<P>
So long as Asian governments find effective remedies, they
still could achieve a lasting recovery despite these problems,
analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots to Visit Monastery in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 700 Greek Cypriots will
visit the Apostolos Andreas Monastery in northern Cyprus next
Sunday, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, more than 800 Turkish Cypriots were allowed to
visit Kokkina enclave in southern Cyprus through Greek
Cypriots-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony commemorating those Turkish Cypriots who died in the
Kokkina enclave during bitter intercommunal fighting in August
1964 was held. Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash joined the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The visits take place as part of an understanding reached two
years ago between the two sides that allows the Turkish Cypriots
to cross through the Greek Cypriots-controlled areas to visit
Kokkina enclave and to travel to the Tekke shrine in southern
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Greek Cypriots are allowed to travel to the Apostolos Andreas
Monastery on special feast days.

<HEADLINE> Increased Tax Rebates Spur Exports in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China's increased tax rebate
rate which went into effect on July 1 has stimulated foreign trade
growth in Shanghai by 20 percent for the first seven months this
year.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign trade volume for the period amounted to 39.5
billion U.S. dollars, with imports up 23 percent to reach 16.714
billion U.S. dollars, and exports up 18 percent at 22.792 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The impetus for the exports recovery has been attributed to the
2.95-percent rise in the average tax rebate rate for export-
oriented products by the Ministry of Finance and the State
Administration of Taxation.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's machinery exports, especially electronic products,
recorded the largest increased margin, 50 percent, and that for
clothing also achieved a double-digit growth rate.
</P>
<P>
With the economic recovery in southeast and east Asian
countries, Shanghai's exports to the region have also gained some
strength, with exports to the Republic of Korea, Thailand, and the
Philippines increased by 80 percent, 50 percent and 40 percent,
respectively.

BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet is expected to

The cabinet is also expected to approve the cuts in import
duties, mainly on raw materials and intermediate goods, to help
reduce the production costs of Thai manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Thailand to Implement Scholarship Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Thailand have
agreed to set up a joint management committee to implement a
scholarship scheme to enable Thai students to study in Malaysian
universities and vice versa, Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid
Albar said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was one of the measures agreed upon at the just-concluded
Malaysia-Thailand Joint Commission Meeting (JCM) in Bangkok, he
told reporters after a function in Bangi near here.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of our efforts to increase human resource
training linkages between the two countries, " he was quoted by
Bernama news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said students and areas of study would be identified
with an emphasis on science and technology.
</P>
<P>
He said that the money for the scheme was already there and
Petronas (Malaysia's oil giant company) had identified about 60
students for the program.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said the two neighboring countries also agreed to
step up cooperation to check trans-border crimes such as the
trafficking of drugs and women and children.
</P>
<P>
He said both sides had agreed on most points on border
demarcation, except for the area near Jeli in Kelantan where more
consultations were needed to finalize the matter.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid hoped that the JCM would be conducted regularly on
an annual basis, saying that Malaysia had offered to host it next
year.
</P>

BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will send specialists
to Cambodia to help train Cambodian ex-soldiers into skilled
civilians, a senior official of Thailand's Labor and Social
Welfare Ministry said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian government had asked the Thai government to help
train its ex-soldiers so that they could earn a living as
civilians when their terms of military services expire, Chaturont
Atthavibhakpaisarn, director-general of the Department of Skill
Development was quoted by Thailand News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The department would send a group of specialists to train some
2,000 soldiers, who would end their military services this year,
into technicians, electricians and workers in the textile and
garment industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
The training would be carried out at the Thai-Cambodian
Vocational Training Center, about 10 kilometers south of Phnom
Penn.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government had given financial support for the
construction of the center under the Thai-Cambodian Assistance
Project, and the Thai Foreign Ministry's Department of Technical
and Economic Cooperation, which supervises the project, will
render further support of about 20 million baht (540,000 U.S.
dollars) to install equipment and machines for the center.

<P>
CANBERRA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Australian government
ministers cracked whips in the air as they joined lamb farmers
protesting outside the U.S. Embassy Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Trade Minister Mark Vaile and Agriculture Minister Warren Truss
showed their prowess with a whip provided by former Deputy Prime
Minister Tim Fischer at the protest against U.S. import
restrictions on Australian lamb.
</P>
<P>
"All we are asking for is a fair crack of the whip," Truss said
outside the embassy gates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson told reporters
the demonstration sought to remind Americans of the appalling
decision, which did not help either country's industry or
consumers.
</P>
<P>
"We will keep the pressure up, we will do everything we can to
help the industry grow, not only in the U.S. but other markets as
well," Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government has taken the issue to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) and is developing an assistance package
for the industry.
</P>
<P>
The great danger was the decision sent the wrong signal for
upcoming WTO negotiations on trade in Seattle, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
"They have said 'do as we say, not do as we do'," Anderson
said.
</P>
<P>
"Now that has to be turned around," he added.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urges Merger of Small Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
encouraging small banks, particularly the thrift and rural banks,
to work out plans for possible mergers in order to compete in a
globalized environment by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Cardenas, a senior manager at the Thrift Banks Department
of the Philippine Central Bank, said Tuesday that the government
is now calling on the said banks to prepare because they will have
no choice when the time comes for them to merge and consolidate
their resources.
</P>
<P>
He believes that by doing so they will be able to conduct
effective banking business without the hassles of running out of
cash to serve the needs of their clients.
</P>
<P>
This call was a reiteration of a circular of the central bank
which mandates all banks in the country, particularly those whose
performance is below par, to merge in anticipation for
globalization, Cardenas said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the right move that these banks should do amid the
environment of liberalization where big foreign banks are allowed
to come in and establish their branches here," he said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has scheduled to raise the thrift banks'
capitalization from 250 million pesos (6.25 million U.S. dollars)
to 400 million pesos (10 million dollars) for those within Metro
Manila by the year 2000.

The requirements of those outside Metro Manila will be
increased from 52 million pesos (1.3 million dollars) to 64
million pesos (1.6 million dollars) by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Cardenas said that with these requirements there is a strong
indication that the thrift banks, and even rural banks, will be
pressured to comply. "Otherwise, those who cannot will just bid
good-bye to the industry," he added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Democrats Propose Compromise Referendum Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Democrats
Tuesday further complicated the dispute over what question should
to be put at the November republic referendum by proposing their
own compromise question.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard Monday agreed to a new
question which asks voters to alter the constitution to establish
a republic, with the queen and governor-general being replaced by
a president appointed by a two-thirds majority of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats, who hold the balance of power in the Senate, put
up an alternative question which proposes "A Bill for an Act to
alter the constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia
as a republic."
</P>
<P>
Democrats republic spokeswoman Natasha Stott Despoja said the
new proposal would be moved in the Senate later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She said the Democrats' question is more simple and accurate
and aimed at breaking the stalemate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The parliament must agree on the referendum question this week
or the November 6 poll will be postponed.
</P>
<P>
Despoja said the Democrats believe Howard's question is "not
entirely accurate."
</P>
<P>
"It is not correct to talk about appointment in relation to the
parliament," she said.
</P>
<P>
Democrats leader Meg Lees has been in negotiation with Howard
on the republic question and he proposed a new preamble to the
constitution.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Seal Opening in Wall of Holy Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- In a move to signal the
position of Israel's new government on Jerusalem issue, Israeli
police Tuesday sealed an opening in the outer wall of the Al Aqsa
Mosque compound, Islam's third holiest site.
</P>
<P>
The action was approved by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in
coordination with the public security ministry, a statement from
Barak's office said.
</P>
<P>
The statement quoted Barak as saying that "this is the
sort of suitable response we will take wherever people will
violate the law and try to establish facts on the ground. ''
</P>
<P>
After sealing the opening, Israeli police brought
reinforcements near the compound, which is also known to Jews
as the Temple Mount, or the site of the Jewish Temple
destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D..
</P>
<P>
In response, Muslim leaders warned that police action would
bring about violent Muslim protests.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that the wall opening is part of renovations
carried out by the Islamic Trust and that Israel has no right to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
During the recent renovations, a window on the compound's
outer wall, which is not far from the Western Wall, Judaism's
most sacred site, was enlarged into a door-sized opening.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Internal Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said that
the enlargement of the window was a violation of the unwritten
agreement between the Israeli authority and the Islamic Trust that
 neither side introduce changes at the holy site.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which captured the compound in eastern Jerusalem in
the 1967 Mideast war, has insisted that all of Jerusalem is its
``eternal and invisible capital.'' But the Palestinians want to
establish a future independent state with Jerusalem as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
The sovereignty over Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive
issues in the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis were
killed in the violent clashes between Israeli troops and the
Palestinians after former Likud government ordered the opening of
a new entrance to a tourist tunnel near the compound.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Ready for Meaningful Talks: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban have said
that they are ready for a meaningful dialogue aimed at resolving
the Afghan conflict and ending the fighting in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed Mutawakkil told the media Tuesday
in Kabul that the Taliban have always supported negotiations for
resolving of the Afghan issue, the Associated Press of Pakistan
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban have attended a number of peace talks and have
never expressed opposition to negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban official said that their opponents regrettably
benefit from the process of talks. They always want to seek time
so that they could make war preparation, he said.
</P>
<P>
To a question, Mutawakkil said that this is a fact that
fighting and negotiations have been continuing side by side since
the out- break of the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to hold talks with the mediator on some facts and
realities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mutawakkil noted that the anti-Taliban opposition offered peace
talks but at the meantime continued its military operations as
well.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebels Free 5 More Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Five more hostages were freed
Monday night by Sierra Leonean rebels and the release of the rest
is expected soon as former junta leader Johny Koroma went to the
hostage-takers' camp Monday to dissolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The hostages released Monday includes four U.N. military
observers who are from Britain, and a Sierra Leonean journalist,
according to information reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office confirmed Monday that the last three
British soldiers held were freed Monday night and had reached the
Sierra Leonean capital, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The remaining hostages include 10 soldiers from the west
African intervention force known as ECOMOG and two members of the
Sierra Leonean army. They will be released soon, said a rebel
official on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The rebels loyal to Koroma released Sunday 19 people out of a
jungle hideaway where one freed hostage said as many as 2,000
disenchanted members of the former junta are based.
</P>
<P>
"They treated us fine," said Chernor Bangura, a journalist for
Sierra Leonean state television, in a telephone interview. "We
were given one meal a day and tea in the morning," he added.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapping took place last Wednesday during what was to
have been a handover of some civilians seized by the gunmen during
the civil war. The kidnappers freed last Thursday the first
batch of their captives and let them carry the messages demanding
food and medical supplies and the release of Koroma, who they
claimed had been detained by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
rebels.
</P>
<P>
But later Koroma denied he was a prisoner and promised to
personally intervene to dissolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the RUF and the former junta soldiers has
been strained, though they theoretically are allies. Many former
junta fighters might feel excluded when the RUF signed the July 7
Lome peace accord on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
Koroma, a former military officer, launched a coup and fought
the head of state in 1997. He allied himself with the RUF rebels,
which has been fighting successive government since 1991.
</P>
<P>
But ten months later he was flushed out by the Nigeria-led west
African peacekeeping force and the unseated President Tejan Kabbah
was reinstated.

PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President sacked Serguey Stepashin from his prime
minister's post and nominated Vladimir Putin as his successor. The
abrupt dismissal was clearly linked to the legislative elections
in December and the presidential election in 2000. The Kremlin is
in a difficult situation in preparing for the elections when faced
with its adversaries, notably the mayor of Moscow Yuri Lujkov.
</P>
<P>
-- The Afghan Mujahidins led by Commander Ahmed Shah Massoud
have taken back their territory captured by the Talibans last
weekend and are now over-looking the capital Kabul from a hill.
The latest fightings between the forces of Massoud and Talibans
had resulted in the fleeing of 100,000 civilians from their homes
in the area between Kabul and the Panshir Valley, the stronghold
of Massoud.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French Defense Minister Alain Richard will fly to Kosovo on
Tuesday after three days of clashes between French peacekeeping
troops and Kosovo Albanians in the northern city of Kosovska
Mitrovica. Five French soldiers have been injured by stones thrown
by young Albanians, who were orchestrated by the Kosovo Liberation
Army, according to foreign witnesses.
</P>
<P>
-- From the Terre Neuve in Canada to the Gulf of Bangladesh,
more than 350 million inhabitants of the Earth will look toward
the sky on Wednesday. The shadow of the Moon will slide across the
surface of the planet in a fantastic total eclipse.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Blasts Armed Attacks on Spanish Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister of
Natural Resources and Tourism Zakia Meghji has strongly condemned
last week's attack on Spanish tourists by armed bandits in a
northern village.
</P>
<P>
"Last week's attack on tourists was total madness and shameful
act by the bandits," the Daily News Tuesday quoted Meghji as
saying.
</P>
<P>
She told the paper Monday that the attack has raised grave
concern and security forces are hunting for the bandits.
</P>
<P>
Three bandits, believed to be Somalis, ambushed 17 Spanish
tourists who were travelling in a truck eight days ago at the
Roroki Kimoi Village in northern Tanzania's Arusha region.
</P>
<P>
The tourists were forced to surrender their cash, passports,
video cameras, wrist watches and other valuables after the
bandits wielded sub- machine guns and stopped them in a deep
forest close to the village, but no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
Somali bandits are notorious for their acts in Arusha. Last
year, they shot dead a district police commander in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish tourists were travelling in a truck belonging to a
Kenyan safari company. It is suspected that the gangsters
tracked the tourists from Kenya and laid a trap in the village.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the police were also investigating how the
Kenyan registered overland truck carrying the tourists sneaked
into Tanzania.

SINGAPORE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed sharply

<HEADLINE> U.S Urged to Take Lead in Pollution Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States currently accounts for half of all carbon
dioxide (CO2 emissions by western industrialized nations,
according to a WWF press release here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, WWF said, the U.S government has favored using the
potential loopholes in the 1997 Kyoto climate treaty, rather than
reducing emissions domestically.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the conservation organization accused other
industrialized nations of having been "scaling back efforts to cut
CO2 emissions, waiting for a leadership signal from the U.S.".
</P>
<P>
In a comprehensive new study released on the same day, WWF and
the Tellus Institute found that a mix of financial incentives,
regulatory changes and market measures to promote efficient and
non-polluting technologies could save the U.S. as much as 43
billion dollars per year on energy costs, and create more than 870,
000 new jobs by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The report, "America's Global Warming Solutions" said that
applying these policies would also ensure that the U.S. could
reduce its emissions by 14 percent below 1990 levels, twice the
amount specified in the Kyoto treaty, and could result in
substantial reductions in other air pollutants harmful to human
health.
</P>
<P>
"By acting on these findings and cutting domestic carbon
dioxide pollution, the U.S government would be providing a major
impulse internationally to efforts which protect the climate,"
said Jennifer Morgan, climate change policy expert at WWF. "In
addition, tackling the cause of global warming at home is not a U.
S. favor to the rest of the world, it is a matter of economic self
interest."

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Natural Resources Should Be Conserved: Workshop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A national workshop Tuesday
underscored the need for increased determination and commitment to
addressing the challenges of ensuring sustainable use and
conservation of the natural resources including bio-diversity in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The workshop on "Coastal and Wetland Bio-diversity Management
Project (CWBMP)" was jointly organized by the Department of
Environment, the Association of Development Agencies in Bangladesh
and the Coalition of Environmental Non-Government Organizations.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the workshop stressed the need for the
establishment of an innovative system for management of the
biologically critical areas in the country, which will have a
significant and positive impact on the long-term viability of the
country's important bio-diversity resources.
</P>
<P>
They maintained that the fate of Bangladesh -- its people and
its prospects for sustainable development -- is determined by its
relationship with water and wetlands as the country's 128 million
people are critically dependent on wetland system as vital natural
resources to sustain them primarily through agriculture and
fishing.
</P>
<P>
With a total area of 148,393 square kilometers, Bangladesh's
range of wetlands includes over 700 rivers and streams, thousands
of shallow freshwater lakes and marshes.
</P>
<P>
The main feature of the CWBMP is to involve the local
stock-holders to implement the project with their active
cooperation and participation, Forest and Environment Minister
Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury said in her speech at the workshop.
</P>
<P>
Earlier workshops were held at various levels to arrive at some
recommendations, she stated, hoping that this workshop would
further enrich those recommendations which would be helpful for
the government to evolve necessary laws, regulations, action plans
and strategies on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The government is determined to preserve and protect natural
resources including its bio-diversity, the minister stated.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Concerned About Tanzania's Bid to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar has raised
concern about the union government of Tanzania to pull out of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), saying the
move will hamper regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's Finance Minister Amina Salum Ali said the pullout
from the 21-member organization is an indication that Tanzania is
still pursuing protectionism policies.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's withdrawal from COMESA is not fair and the country
should reconsider its decision for long-term economic development
strategies, Ali told an international business forum in Zanzibar
Monday.
</P>
<P>
She cautioned that regional cooperation is an international
trend and Tanzania should not remain as "an island" in the
globalization process, the Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On July 21, Tanzanian Minister of Industries and Commerce Iddi
Simba suddenly announced at a National Assembly session that
Tanzania plans to quit COMESA. His announcement surprised the
organization a lot as Tanzania has always been an active partner.
</P>
<P>
A COMESA delegation visited Tanzania early this month trying to
persuade the country not to quit the economic bloc, but Simba
insisted that Tanzania would stick to its position.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is better for Tanzania to adhere to smaller
blocs such as the 14-member Southern African Development
Community (SADC), and East African Co-operation that comprises
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian manufacturers have expressed concern that zero
tariffs would damage its local industries with the flooding of
imported goods from other COMESA members.
</P>
<P>
COMESA was set up in 1994 with a vision to reach a zero
taxation rate for intra-region imports next year.
</P>
<P>
The member countries are Angola, Burundi, Comoros, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi,
</P>
<P>
Mauritius, Namibia, Rwanda, Seychelles, Sudan, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
With an annual import bill of around 32 billion U.S. dollars,
COMESA forms a major market place for both internal and external
trading.
</P>
<P>
Juma Bakari Mwapachu, chairman of the Confederation of Tanzania
 Industries, said that there is a need of coordination between the
Tanzanian mainland and Zanzibar on pulling out of COMESA.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, which comprises Unguja and Pemba and a number of
smaller islands, joined Tanganyika in 1964 to form the United
Republic of Tanzania.

<P>
KIEV, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Sergei Bubka, the only athlete to
win six straight world titles, will miss the 1999 World Athletics
Championships late this month due to injury.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Ukrainian pole vaulter, who set the world
record of 6.14 meters at Sestriere, Italy, in 1994, is still
recovering from last year's surgery on his Achilles tendon, said
the Ukrainian athletics team coach Valeriy Aleksandrov.
</P>
<P>
"He will miss the championships because doctors in Finland,
where he was operated on, recommended that he not participate,"
Aleksandrov said.
</P>
<P>
Bubka, who has set the world record 35 times, had poor
performances last year and has been slow in recovering from his
injury.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Seeks Interpol Help in Tracing Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is seeking the
assistance of the International Police (Interpol) in tracking down
two businessmen, Soh Chee Wen and Patrick Lim, both being sought
in relation to several cases of alleged fraud.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Securities Commission (SC) has already issued arrest
warrants for both of the businessmen who are believed to be hiding
abroad, SC Chairman Ali Abdul Kadir told newsmen here at a
Malaysia Capital Market seminar.
</P>
<P>
Every effort is being taken to locate Soh and Lim, he said,
adding, "Where international help is needed, this is being sought.
As far as I know, Interpol is assisting in the matter."
</P>
<P>
He said that the SC believed it knew where the two businessmen
were hiding, but could not act, "until the fish is in the net."
</P>
<P>
Ali said the SC's recent active enforcement of action against
offenders would continue.
</P>
<P>
On July 24, Ishak Ismail, executive deputy chairman of KFC
Holdings Bhd and Wan Muhammed Hasni Wan Sulaiman, executive
chairman of Abrar Corporation Bhd, were charged in court for
allegedly contravening the Securities Industry Act.
</P>
<P>
On August 4, the SC charged TA Securities Bhd Executive
Chairman Tony Thiah and his sister-in-law Kimmy Khoo for allegedly
contravening the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange rules for trading by
stockbroking companies. They were charged for allegedly abetting
fugitive businessman Soh Chee Wen in fraud activity involving the
now defunct Omega Security Sdn Bhd.
</P>
<P>
Ali did not rule out the possibility of more people being
prosecuted for offense under the Securities Commission Act and
Securities Industry Act.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the claims that the recent crackdown was targeted
on people close to former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim who
is now in jail. Ali also refuted the claims that the enforcement
was undertaken for political reasons.

<HEADLINE> Angola Denounces Savimbi as Mafia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister Joao
Bernardo de Miranda denounced here Tuesday Jonas Savimbi, head of
the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), as member of an influential "mafia net", local television
reported.
</P>
<P>
Joao Miranda, who was attending the program "Opinion", said
that the mafia net, with some branches in Africa and Europe, is
engaged in the transactions of arms and narcotics.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "the mafia group has channels leading to South
Africa, through which they connect with Europe and other places
around the world."
</P>
<P>
The South African government acknowledged that some South
Africans are engaged in helping UNITA in arms transportation,
saying that the government opposes and condemns their illegal acts
and will take measures to crackdown on the criminals.
</P>
<P>
Angolan government considers that through the channels to the
outside world, Savimbi's UNITA movement survived the crackdown by
the government.
</P>
<P>
Miranda also said the sanctions imposed by the Security Council
of the United Nations against Savimbi and his group have taken
effect, for Savimbi can not travel abroad freely.
</P>
<P>
"Although having many friends, today's Savimbi is not received
here and there," said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Ethnic Conflict Blamed as Plot Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has said that certain elements opposed to the civilian
dispensation and seeking to subvert it have instigated the recent
ethnic fighting in Sagamu and Kano.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Tuesday quoted the president as saying
that such persons would be punished when apprehended, with the
government already at work to track them down .
</P>
<P>
The president, on a visit to Sagamu in western Ogun State where
ethnic rage which flared lately left scores of persons dead,
described the clashes as "highly instigated".
</P>
<P>
Not identifying the suspected masterminds of the phenomenon,
Obasanjo said: "It is the work of evil-minded people... Those who
think they could unleash mayhem on this country will not go
unpunished. We are already searching for the perpetrators, and the
law of the land will catch up with them."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, in what marked his first official visit to Ogun, his
home state since he assumed office on May 29 this year, visited
Sagamu to commiserate with the entire community and particularly
the families of victims of the recent clash.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo who said he would have loved to visit Ogun in a
happier mood called for a minute's silence for the repose of the
souls of those who lost their lives in the mayhem.
</P>
<P>
According to him, his government would provide comfort and
convenience for children who lost their parents, those who
suffered disability and those who were injured during the fracas.
</P>
<P>
One of the lessons the government learnt from the fracas, he
disclosed, was that the police need to be properly equipped to be
able to contain future occurrence of such mayhem.

<HEADLINE> Steadfastly Maintain "One China" Principle, Article (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua, China's official news
agency, today released a signed article calling for the steadfast
maintenance of the "One China" principle.
</P>
<P>
Since Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui made public his special "two states
" remark, he has met condemnation from Chinese at home and abroad,
and criticism from the international community, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The essence of Lee's remarks is to completely negate the "One
China" principle and eventually separate Taiwan Island from the
motherland, it says.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, Lee has been premeditating the negation of
this principle. When he first took office, Lee promised on many
occasions that there is only "one China" and that "one China" is
the supreme policy.
</P>
<P>
With the passage of time, Lee could no longer restrain himself
from exposing his true nature of trying to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Last month, he proclaimed that the Taiwan authorities have
defined the ties between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits as "
state-to-state, at least special state-to-state" relations. "This
has thoroughly taken off all his cover-ups and pretensions," the
article says.
</P>
<P>
"The 'one China' principle constitutes the very basis and
precondition of the country's peaceful unification," the article
notes.
</P>
<P>
For the past four decades, though they had many differences,
the Nationalist Party and the Communist Party of China have shared
major common ground.

<HEADLINE> Steadfastly Maintain "One China" Principle, Article (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both sides have recognized that there is only one China, and
that Taiwan is part of China; both oppose "Two Chinas," "one China,
one Taiwan," and "Taiwan independence," according to the article.
</P>
<P>
The "one China" principle also represents the basis and major
guarantee for the sound development of cross-Straits relations,
dialogues, and consultations.
</P>
<P>
"For the development of cross-Straits relations, the 'one China
' principle is a must. This principle must be abided by if
relations are to be maintained and expanded," it says.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever negates the 'one China' principle will become the
chief criminal undermining relations across the Straits," the
article says.
</P>
<P>
At present, cross-Straits relations have come to another major
juncture. Lee's remarks have completely destroyed the principle of
"one China" and the basis for the growth of cross-Straits
relations and talks, and posed a large threat to the motherland's
peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no future for the 'special state-to-state'
remarks," the article warns, adding that Lee, who has acted
against the historical tide and become an enemy of the entire
Chinese nation, will be doomed to failure.

NEW DELHI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- India and Japan Tuesday began
a dialogue here to discuss some unresolved issues hampering
investments between the two countries, including import tariffs.
</P>
<P>
This is the first ever dialogue between the two countries to

<P>
Indian Minister of State for Industry Sukhbir Singh Badal in
his opening speech said he hoped the dialogue process would help
in achieving a target of 500 million U.S. dollars of Japanese
investments in India for the year 2000. Japanese investments in
India were only 200 million dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hisamitse Arai, vice minister of international trade and
industry of Japan, said that India topped the chart of Japan's
investment destinations in the new millennium and Japan is keen to
resolve the bilateral investment issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The issues to be resolved include India's insistence on export
obligations for auto companies, foreign exchange controls and high

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Today in Shenyang, capital of
Liaoning Province, China opened its archives on the Japanese
aggression against northeast China.
</P>
<P>
A total of 233 archive documents and 138 historic photographs
are on exhibit at the Liaoning Archives, offering strong evidence
of Japanese aggression against the region, and their crimes
committed over a period of nearly 100 years.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, titled "Archives on Japanese Aggression Against
Northeast China," consists of three parts beginning with the Sino-
Japanese War launched by Japanese imperialism in 1894-1895 and
ending with Japan's unconditional surrender in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of the Liaoning Archives, Zhao Yunpeng, told
Xinhua that the exhibition is aimed at promoting patriotism among
all the Chinese people, especially the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
It is also intended to have young people remember the history
and treasure their happy lives today, he said.
</P>
<P>
Three Japanese professors also attended the opening ceremony.
They said they will tell their students the truth about Japanese
aggression against China, and have them treasure the friendship
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Liaoning Archives contains a huge amount of documents on
Japanese aggression against China, and in 1994 and 1995 it opened
archives on the Nanjing Massacre and Japan's germ warfare
experiments during its invasion of China, causing strong reactions
in China and worldwide.

<P>
BEIRUT, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani Tuesday called for a just and comprehensive peace
in the Middle East through peace talks between Arabs and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The ruler of the Gulf emirate made the call in his speech to
the full session of the Lebanese Parliament during his ongoing
two-day state visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no way out of conflicts, no peace in the region
unless through a full, just and lasting settlement based on
international laws and the United Nations resolutions," said the
Qatari ruler.
</P>
<P>
He said the land-for-peace formula and U.N. resolutions 242,
338 and 425 are among the basic principles dedicated to solving
the Arab-Israeli conflicts.
</P>
<P>
These resolutions urge Israel to withdraw from the lands it
captured from Syria, Palestine and Lebanon over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Lebanon's guerrillas for their resistance to
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli occupation forces out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is the second stop of the Qatari emir's Mideast tour
which has taken him to the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
He arrived here on Sunday evening and will leave on Tuesday
afternoon for Algeria and Morocco.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China's power industry is
currently undertaking large-scale technological renovations
designed to control pollution, increase financial returns, and
guarantee safe operations, said a senior power official here today.
</P>
<P>
The sector is now in the process of renovating generating units
that have been in operation for at least 25 years, according to
Jiang Shaojun, director in charge of strategic studies and
planning.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to improve the capacity of the units to meet peak
power demand periods, improve security, reduce energy consumption,
and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country's power plants will reduce the amount
of coal required to produce one kilowatt hour of electricity by an
average 34 grams over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the voltage level in more than 95 percent of major
Chinese cities will meet national standards, and the reliability
rate for power supply will reach 99.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official said that power grids will coordinate power
supplies in order to ensure that the country's five major regional
and 15 provincial power companies reach international standards in

BEIDAIHE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen said here today that it is China's fixed policy to pursue
its good-neighborly relations with Nepal.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Murari Raj Sharma, secretary of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nepal, Qian expressed his hope that
China and Nepal will join hands to maintain the bilateral good-
neighborly partnership for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
Referring to regional and international situations, Qian said
that China hopes that south Asia will maintain peace and stability,
and that all countries in the region should treat each other on an
equal footing while solving their differences by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the principles of mutual respect of
sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as mutual non-
interference in each other's internal affairs are "indisputable
standards" in handling relations between countries.
</P>
<P>
"It would be very dangerous for these principles to be
abandoned," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sharma expressed his agreement with Qian's assessment of Sino-
Nepali ties. He said that Nepal will always stick to the One China
policy when handling issues concerning Taiwan and Tibet, and
firmly opposes all views and activities aimed at splitting China.

peace and stability in the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) on Tuesday refused to accept a timetable that permits Israel
to complete its withdrawal from the West Bank by February 15 next
year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement broadcast Tuesday by the Voice of Palestine
radio, Saeb Erekat, chief negotiator of the PNA, also said the PNA
had earlier denied such a proposal.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Minister in Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon
announced on Monday that Israel proposed to complete its military
withdrawal from the West Bank by the coming February 15 at the
most.
</P>
<P>
It was aimed at prolonging by seven months the third phase of
Israeli withdrawal under the Wye river accord signed between
Israel and the Palestinians last October, said Erekat.
</P>
<P>
He added that under the Wye accord, Israel should finish
pulling out its troops from the West Bank last February, not the
coming February.
</P>
<P>
Israel intends to incorporate the third-phase withdrawal into a
final settlement by delaying full implementation of the Wye
land-for-peace accord, Erekat added.

<HEADLINE> One Shot Dead in Apparent Terror Attack in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- One man was shot to death by
Israeli police near Jerusalem on Tuesday when he steered his car
twice to a sidewalk at a bus stop in an attempt to run down people.
</P>
<P>
The police said that at least nine people were wounded in
the incident and all of them were soldiers and policemen.
</P>
<P>
Paramedics said that one soldier was injured seriously and the
others were hurt slightly.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened when the man drove his Fiat Uno car into
a group of people, who were waiting for buses at a junction near
the Jerusalem suburb of Beit Shemesh.
</P>
<P>
After the car hit several people, the man sped away and made a
sharp U-turn to plough into the people for a second time.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told Israel Radio that the man was killed by police
after his car got stuck on the underside of a truck.
</P>
<P>
Shimon Sharvit, deputy police commander of the central
district, said that the incident was apparently a suicide terror
attack.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Internal Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said that
the driver was a resident of the West Bank city of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed hope that the violence would not affect
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. He also called on the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to restrain militants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ehud Barak told a cabinet meeting
that he viewed the attack "with extreme seriousness."
</P>
<P>
Barak noted that there will be a full review concerning the
free transit of Palestinian cars.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's attack came at a time when Israel and the PNA
disputed on the implementation of the Wye agreement. Barak proposed
to delay part of Israeli troops' withdrawal from the West Bank,
while the PNA insisted that Israel should fulfill the accord
immediately.

<HEADLINE> China to Host International Franchise Exhibition, Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The '99 International Franchise
Exhibition &AMP; Conference, hosted by the China Chainstore &AMP;
Franchise Association (CC&AMP;FA), will be held at the International
Convention Center here November 1-3.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from domestic and overseas franchised
enterprises will gather here to exchange views and experiences on
the development of the franchise business in China and its
prospects.
</P>
<P>
Guo Geping, chairwoman of the CC&AMP;FA, said at a news conference
today that franchising, with lower cost, less risk and higher
profit than traditional marketing patterns, will be favored by
more Chinese commercial enterprises in the future.
</P>
<P>
Running franchises can not only resolve the financing problems
facing most small and medium-sized companies, and enhance their
competitiveness, but also create more jobs for the unemployed and
stimulate domestic consumption in the long run, she added.
</P>
<P>
Guo said that franchising was born out of the chain store
business, and emerged in China several years ago. It has shown
conspicuous growth in this country, she said.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the total sales of the chain store sector
exceeded 100 billion yuan last year, with franchise business sales
hitting nearly 30 billion yuan. In the first half of this year,
the chain store sector registered a growth rate of 31.7 percent
compared with the same period of last year, she added.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she said, the sales of franchise businesses in
China only account for some one percent of the country's total
retail sales, indicating a huge market potential.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that in some ten years' time the sales of
franchise businesses will account for more than 10 percent of the
total retail sales in China.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Entrepreneurs Slam Legislators' Allowance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian entrepreneurs told
members of the National Assembly (parliament) Monday to dump the
pursuit of "jumbo furniture" allowances in favor of more pressing
national issues, the Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While appreciating the need for the legislators to be
comfortably accommodated to carry out their various assignments,
the entrepreneurs described as strange the law makers' clamor to
carry out the furnishing of their official quarters by themselves
given the fact that their tenancy is within a tenure.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the entrepreneurs expressed dismay at the sidelining
of critical national issues in pursuit of furniture allowances.
</P>
<P>
According to the entrepreneurs, the legislatures should pay
more attention to issues like rising crime rate, Niger Delta
crisis, high unemployment, revision of the 1999 budget, rural
economic development, sliding value of the local currency naira,
revival of the nation's agricultural and manufacturing sectors and
other pressing issues.
</P>
<P>
Criticism of the legislators by the business managers is coming
ahead of a planned rally by Nigeria Labor Congress in capital
Abuja Tuesday to protest the law makers' demands for furniture
allowances, which it described as "excessive, selfish and
unrealistic."
</P>
<P>
The country's top legislators insist that the government pay
each senator 3.5 million (about 37,000 U.S. dollars) and each
house representative 2.5 million naira (about 26,000 U.S. dollars)
in cash, although President Olusegun Obasanjo suggested that the
government pay for the refurnishing of their official quarters.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah Tuesday held talks with visiting Namibian President Sam
Nujoma on promoting bilateral ties in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the latest developments in the
international arena, said Minister for Royal Palace Affairs Nasser
Mohammad Al-Sabah after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma, who arrived here on Monday for a three-day official
visit, had earlier met several members of Kuwait's Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, apparently in a bid to woo more Kuwaiti
investments in Namibia's development projects.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian president is on his second visit to the oil-rich
Gulf emirate since November 1995, when he called on Kuwaiti
businessmen to increase investment in his country.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma, on several occasions, also sided with Kuwait in urging
Iraq to implement United Nations resolutions regarding the issue
of the Kuwaiti prisoners of war (POWs), the Kuwait News Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait claims more than 600 Kuwaiti and third country nationals
are still detained in Iraqi jails since the 1991 Gulf war ignited
by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. But Baghdad denied
the claim.

<HEADLINE> 1,243 HIV Cases Registered in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines registered 1,243
HIV or human-immunodeficiency virus infection cases from January
1984 to June 1999, an official of the Department of Health (DOH)
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Consorcia Quizon, resident adviser of the DOH's National
HIV Sentinel Surveillance System, said that of the total HIV
positives, 399 people had Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS) which caused 197 deaths by June 1999.
</P>
<P>
Quizon noted that for the month of June this year alone, 12 new
HIV-positive persons were reported. Of the new HIV positives, six
were male and six were female. The men's age ranges from 29 to 43
years old, and that of the women from 20 to 44.
</P>
<P>
According to Quizon, the predominant mode of transmission
remains to be sexual contact and this has been the case for the
reported mode of transmission for both men and women.
</P>
<P>
With regard to AIDS, four new cases were reported in June --
two males and two females. Again, the reported mode of
transmission was all sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
The DOH maintained a HIV/AIDS Registry which, to this day,
issues official statistics on HIV infection in the Philippines to
the global health community from 1987.
</P>
<P>
In consonance with the country's AIDS law, all these reports
respected the anonymity of the persons involved.

Mutangelwa took refuge in the South African High Commission

<HEADLINE> Last British Hostages Freed in S.Leone </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Tuesday the last
three British soldiers held by a rebel faction in Sierra Leone had
been freed.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted at this news. The release is obviously very
welcome," Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain said in a statement
after the three had arrived safely in Freetown, the Sierra Leone
capital.
</P>
<P>
Hain urged the rebels to free all remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
The three British soldiers were in a group of four hostages
freed late on Monday. Two other British soldiers were released on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The hostages, part of a United Nations-led negotiating team,
were seized on Wednesday. They had gone to the Okra Hills, about
60 kilometers from Freetown, to try to persuade the rebels to
release about 100 children abducted earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers, who said they were members of the Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council, former members of the government army who
rebelled and took control of the country in a military coup in
1997, demanded a stake in the peace settlement and to be re-
admitted to the Sierra Leone Army.

<HEADLINE> 16 Killed in Fresh Clashes in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- At least 16 people were killed,
120 others injured and 20 houses were burned as fresh communal
clashes flared up in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku, on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Most of those who died sustained gunshot wounds, head of the Al
Fatah Hospital Paing Suryaman was quoted by the Antara News Agency
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of victims may rise as injured people
continue to be brought to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
According to chief of the provincial police Bugis Saman, the
security officers were compelled to shoot at the mobs who were
threatening lives with their brutal activities.
</P>
<P>
"Officers tried using a persuasive approach but without gaining
any (positive) response from the mobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The clashes in Ambon first broke out in January, in which more
than 100 people were killed and tens of thousands of people were
forced to flee their villages.
</P>
<P>
Local religious figures, along with the military, have tried to
reconcile the warring camps but clashes broke out again in
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 82 people died, 141 were injured and 4
went missing from July 15 to August 5.
</P>
<P>
Saman said that security officers alone could not stop the
clashes.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how many security officers are deployed to the city,
if the people do not intend to stop the clashes, then it would be
impossible to halt these fights," he added.
</P>
<P>
In Ambon, about 60 percent of the population is Christian. Most
of the rest are Muslims, many of them immigrants from other
islands.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong's Pseudo-science Face Exposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The essence of Falun Gong
concocted by Li Hongzhi is its reaction to science, and efforts
must be made to expose thoroughly its pseudo-science face, Chinese
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of Li's fallacies are based on his reaction to
modern science and his negation of scientific knowledge, they
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Li proclaimed that modern science can't be called science and
that his followers should never accept modern science since it is
a great mistake.
</P>
<P>
The scientists refuted his fallacies with indisputable facts.
It's science that lets us know the universe and ourselves; and it
is science that has unveiled the laws of the material world. "
Without science, human beings would not be as they are today,"
they said.
</P>
<P>
Changing the contents of scientific notions and then using them
to trick those with little knowledge is a major feature of Li's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
The scientists cited many examples of Li's ignorance. Li has
always called iron "iron molecules," which are actually "atoms";
and Li said that only by lining up two million atoms can a
molecule be formed, yet the truth is that even a single atom can
form a molecule.
</P>
<P>
Li also claimed that he is a supreme life-form from the
uppermost layer, and that the universal wall is where Elysium lies.
This is simply crazy talk from a madman, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
The fight against Falun Gong and its founder Li Hongzhi is a
battle for the masses and also a good opportunity to educate them
with scientific world views, they said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists should take on the responsibility of promoting
science and technology, and become a major force in opposing
superstition and eradicating ignorance and pseudo-science, they
noted.

<HEADLINE> Magistrates Suspended for Taking Bribes in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Five Kenyan magistrates have
been suspended for taking bribes or illegally selling government
lands in a recently launched crackdown on corruption in the

<P>
SHANGHAI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai today began a
comprehensive survey of the quality of its river water in
preparation for pollution treatment.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest river quality survey ever undertaken in the
city, China's largest metropolis, and it will continue through the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the municipal water conservation department said
there are 5,000 monitoring stations along the city's rivers. They
will collect samples for intensified quality analysis by
departments of water conservation, environmental protection, and
institutes of higher learning, which will work together to compile
the final results.
</P>
<P>
Eleven percent of this bustling commercial center is covered by
water, and rapid industrialization and urbanization development
has brought with it serious water contamination problems.
</P>
<P>
The survey is expected to provide important data for pollution
treatment of surface and underground water, which will be taken
into consideration for comprehensive urban planning.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Continue Cooperation with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua)-- Chief Executive Director
Catherine Bertini of the World Food Program (WFP) said here today
that the WFP will continue to cooperate and collaborate with the
government of China to fight against hunger and poverty in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Bertini has just returned from a week-long visit to the DPRK,
which was preceded by a nine-day visit of China, including an
inspection tour of the WFP project sites in Qinghai and Liaoning
provinces.
</P>
<P>
During her China trip, Bertini met with President Jiang Zemin
and discussed China's challenges for the future including
population, urbanization, food adequacy, and poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
At today's news briefing, Bertini said her visit marks the 20th
anniversary of the WFP's cooperation with China, which has
produced fruitful results.
</P>
<P>
According to her, the WFP has unconditionally assisted China
with more than 60 projects since 1979, with a total investment of
nearly one billion US dollars, benefiting some 30 million people.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, during last year's unprecedented flooding in China,
the WFP assisted with emergency aid valued at around 90 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
While traveling, Bertini said she saw first-hand that a small
investment in development in China can result in tenfold dividends
including agricultural productivity, higher literacy rates for
women, and other socially desirable goals.
</P>
<P>
However, she pointed out, many Chinese rural areas still embody
the classic characteristics of a developing country: low household
income, food insecurity, and regional disparities where millions
remain in conditions of absolute poverty.
</P>
<P>
The WFP will support the efforts of Chinese government to seek
solutions in the coming years to address these very human and very
real needs, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Bertini also discussed the WFP's food assistance operations in
the DPRK.

BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- In a week, the main avenues of
Paris, including the Champs-Elysees, will be festooned with
colorful banners reading "China Culture Week" in both Chinese and
French.
</P>
<P>
China Culture Week, scheduled for September 1-12 in Paris,
will be the largest cultural event ever held by the Chinese
government abroad.
</P>
<P>
With the theme of China marching into the 21st century, China
Culture Week is designed to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, and to
inform Europeans about China's long cultural history and its
contemporary development.
</P>
<P>
"Understanding a nation is much more complicated and difficult
than just making friends, as people usually do," Zhao Qizheng said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"Nations can make friends only after they learn about each
other's culture," said Zhao, who is director of the Information
Office of the State Council,
</P>
<P>
China Culture Week will be jointly sponsored by the
Information Office of the State Council of China, and the United
Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
, which takes cultural exchanges as one of its main
responsibilities, and which will provide the event with exhibition
halls, multi-media technology, and simultaneous translation
equipment free of charge.

President Jacques Chirac wrote in a letter of congratulations that
the French people can particularly understand that China cherishes
its long history and traditions, while seeking to construct a
brighter future. The president expressed his confidence that the
French people will admire and be attracted by China Culture Week.
</P>
<P>
The 12-day cultural gala will offer exhibitions, performances,
and forums and lectures, and a set of 2,400-year-old chimes, a
musical instrument popular in ancient China, will be exhibited for
the first time in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Exhibitions and performances also include chinaware, Peking
Opera costumes, dancing with chime bell music, and the singing and
dancing of China's ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Li Rongrong, vice minister of the State Development Planning
Commission, will give an introduction of China's economic and
social development to French industrial and commercial magnates.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Qizheng will describe the 20th century as the most
extraordinary century in China's 5,000-year history, a century
during which the Chinese people have experienced tremendous
changes.
</P>
<P>
Three scholars and artists, Ma Chengyuan, Wu Liangyong and Wang
Yuzhen, will lecture respectively on ancient bronze ware, ancient
architecture, and China's Peking Opera.
</P>
<P>
"This cultural activity will not only enable China and France
to shake hands with each other, but enable Asia and Europe to do
so as well," Zhao said, adding that he hopes China Culture Week
will offer a true image of China to the French and other European
people in order to enhance mutual understanding.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Formulate New Food Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
formulate a new national food policy in a bid to find ways and
means for ensuring sustainable food self-sufficiency in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary Erastus Mwongera of the Water Resources
Ministry made the remarks Monday at the opening of a two-day
National Food Policy Review Workshop at the Embu Agricultural
Staff Training College in Eastern Province.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times, the state-run newspaper, Tuesday quoted
Mwongera as saying the new policy will review the policies of
1981 and 1994, which are no longer applicable under the current
economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary noted the agricultural sector continues
to play a significant role in national economy, saying that the
sector generates 65 percent of Kenya's foreign exchange and 70
percent of the agro based raw materials.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry had a crucial role to play in ensuring the
marginal areas were supplied with sufficient water for irrigation
and domestic use.
</P>
<P>
Director Wilfred Mwangi of Agriculture and Livestock
Production said under the new national food policy, all
stakeholders would be involved in the formulation and
implementation of agricultural development program.
</P>
<P>
The strategy and vision of the government was to involve all
stakeholders through the agricultural sector investment program,
he said, adding that under investment program, agro-extension
services will be planned by extension officers in conjunction
with farmers at the village levels.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is facing a shortage of maize supply due to poor harvest
caused by scarce rains in its major maize-growing areas during the
main rains season between March and June this year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of July, the Kenyan government announced to cut its
tariff on maize imports to 25 percent from 32.5 percent in a bid
to increase the supply.
</P>
<P>
The country needs to import at least two million 90-kg bags of

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
approved the proposal of the National Constructors Association of
the Philippines (NACAP) to rehabilitate the damaged infrastructure
projects in Central Luzon and other parts of the country.
</P>

Willy Castor, president of the 8,000-member NACAP said Tuesday
that he was instructed by President Joseph Estrada to discuss the
details of the proposed rehabilitation efforts with the officials
of the Department of Public Works and Highways.

proposal was based on his letter to President Estrada, formalizing
the NACAP's offer to undertake the repair works of the
infrastructure projects in the country destroyed by floods.
</P>

Castor told the president that "our members, who will undertake
the repair works, are willing to donate their profits to the
government in order to help the government alleviate the
socio-economic life of the calamity victims."
</P>

The NACAP is the country's biggest group of small and
medium-scale constructors. Castor said that once the proposal
becomes a reality, thousands of NACAP members throughout the
country will be involved in the rehabilitation efforts.

According to the National Disaster Coordination Council (NDCC),

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is formulating a
capital market masterplan for the long term growth of the capital
market to enable the country to face the challenges associated
with the competition ahead.
</P>
<P>
The capital market masterplan, being formulated by the
Securities Commission, is consistent with the consolidation
exercise in the banking, finance and insurance sectors, Malaysian
Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The masterplan, expected to be ready by the end of the year,

He said the capital market masterplan also involves the
consolidation of the country's 64 stockbroking firms.

store for stockbroking companies, the guidelines as well as the
future development of the private debt securities market.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Commercial Banks Hike Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Five of Zimbabwe's eight
commercial banks have hiked their minimum lending rates by four to
five percent as a result of monetary policy changes introduced by
the central bank last month, the daily Herald reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
First Banking Corporation, Barclays Bank of Zimbabwe, the
Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe and Stanbic Monday increased their
rates to 51 percent, 48. 5 percent, 49.5 percent and 48.5 percent
a year respectively.
</P>
<P>
This follows a similar move by Standard Chartered Bank, which
hiked its minimum lending rate to 49.5 percent per annum last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The latest interest rate increases will exert more pressure on
the productive sector as companies, which are already struggling
under prevailing tight economic conditions, will find it hard to
borrow money for expansion and employment creation, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe last moth introduced measures to
curb high inflationary pressures and discourage the government and
other institutions from borrowing.
</P>
<P>
The measures involved the hiking of the reserve bank's rate by
2.5 percentage points and the widening of the margin between the
repo rate and the Treasury bill rate.
</P>
<P>
The bank rate, at which commercial banks borrow from the
reserve bank, would now be maintained at five percentage points
above the effective Treasury bill rate.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also increased statutory reserves for
commercial and merchant banks from five percentage points to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce, which has condemned
the reserve bank for tightening monetary policy, said the hiking
of interest rates was not achieving the intended objective of
price stability.

<HEADLINE> SADC, COMESA Urged to Be Merged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian official has called for
the unification of Southern African Development Community (SADC)
and the Common Market for the Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
as they are duplicating each other's work.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Association of Zambia (EAZ) chief executive, Muna
Nakalonga said his association has been calling for a merger of
the two organizations since 1994 to create a bigger bloc.
</P>
<P>
Nakalonga said the behind-the-scene fights going on between the
two organizations were not healthy at all as they tend to retard
the organizations from focusing on the main issue of creating
wealth in the region.
</P>
<P>
The stand of the EAZ is that the two should unify as they are
doing the same thing although they were originally created for
different purposes, Nakalonga was quoted by Tuesday's Zambian
newspaper, Financial Mail, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nakalonga said although originally SADC was created as a
political organization to lessen the dependence on apartheid South
Africa and COMESA was for economic purposes, the two are now doing
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
He further said it was unfortunate that Tanzania has decided to
pull out of the COMESA when it has come a long way since inception
of the economic grouping.
</P>
<P>
He added that with the near conclusion of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo peace talks over, Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba can now tackle the merging of the two
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Former Falun Gong Station Heads Exposing Li Hongzhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Additional former heads of Falun
Gong stations have broken away from the cult, saying they had been
fooled by its founder, Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xianglan, head of the Falun Gong general station in Wuhan in
central China's Hubei Province, said that her station was in
charge of promoting Falun Gong in south and east China's six
provinces including Hubei, Fujian, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and
Hainan.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Falun Gong is a tight organization armed with
modern communications. The Wuhan station has three branches, each
branch with practice sites. Xu also disclosed that the Falun Gong
station in Wuhan is a national distribution center for Falun Gong
books and propaganda materials.
</P>
<P>
Many more people like Xu across China have repented since the
government banned the cult last month.
</P>
<P>
Some former key members of Falun Gong in the city of Nanchang
in east China's Jiangxi Province have repented of following Li
Hongzhi, and vowed they will have nothing to do with the cult.
</P>
<P>
Jin Ming, former head of the Falun Gong station in Jinzhou
District of Dalian City in northeast China's Liaoning Province
said that Li Hongzhi defrauded many people through a variety of
nefarious schemes.
</P>
<P>
These former key members of Falun Gong have called on fellow
practitioners to see through the political nature of the cult and
the grave harm it caused the country, and wake up from blind faith.

<HEADLINE> North China Port City Improves Entry-Exit Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin Administration for
Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine was established today in a
bid to bring the north China port city's relevant services up to
international standards.
</P>
<P>
The new administration is a merger of three former bureaus: the
Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau, the Tianjin Animals and
Plants Quarantine Bureau, and the Tianjin Health Inspection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at simplifying inspections at ports of entry
and exit, raising efficiency, and doing away with procedural
redundancies.
</P>
<P>
As a major coastal port, Tianjin handles a huge amount of
traffic and shoulders a heavy inspection burden.
</P>
<P>
The new organization will also reform its inspection procedures,
supervisory system, license registration system, and import-export
functions.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Develop Own Rubber Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambia needs to develop its own
rubber industry because it is losing at least 10 million U.S.
dollars annually through the importation of rubber products, an
industrial rubber consultant said.
</P>
<P>
Mathew Devert, chairman of A.P Agro Consultancy Firm, said in
an interview Monday that the government should seriously consider
a comprehensive rubber report handed to it by the Zambia rubber
research group four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Tuesday quoted Devert as saying
failure to tap the country's rubber potential especially in
Luapula Province, would continue to drain the economy in costs of
importing rubber.
</P>
<P>
"If Zambia could develop its own rubber project it could save
about 10 million U.S. dollars in import substitution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Devert said prices of imported rubber products including motor
vehicle tyre would continue to rise as long as Zambia did not
develop its own resource base.
</P>
<P>
He said with the continued depreciation of the Kwacha against
other convertible currencies, the Zambian transport sector for
instance, should continue to suffer because of high importation
and landing costs of the finished products such as tyre.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Cabinet Okays New Draft Law for Children, Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi cabinet has
approved a new draft law providing for capital punishment at the
maximum for child and woman repression in a bid to rein in its
perpetrators, according to an official handout available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new draft law, the Woman and Child Repression Control Act
1999, "has been formulated to effectively prevent repression on
children and women with stern punitive measures," and it will
replace "The Woman and Child Repression (Special Provision) Act
1995," the handout said.
</P>
<P>
The new draft law will be placed as a bill before the
parliament in its session set to begin on August 29.
</P>
<P>
It proposes maximum punishment of death sentence along with
pecuniary penalty for acid throwing, rapes and kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
Those who will supply acid will also be deemed as committing
equal offense of inflicting acid burns and be awarded similar
punishment.
</P>
<P>
The offender will have to take the responsibilities of the
child to be born following a rape, the draft law says.
</P>
<P>
It also proposes recording the statement of a victim in camera,
and even reaches the custodian if a woman becomes victim of rape
or repression while under custody of anyone of authority, and the
guilty custodian will be subject to punishment of 5-10 years'
rigorous imprisonment in such cases.
</P>
<P>
Execution of the law will restrict publishing pictures of
victims and no newspaper can print the picture of the repressed
woman or child if the court doesn't permit it, the handout added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Implement First Money Laundering Control Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's first money
laundering control act will come into effect on August 20, which
will help the country fight drug trafficking and other illicit
transactions, according to an official press release received
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Predicate offenses under the act are narcotics offenses,
trafficking in children and women, cheating and fraud to the
public, misappropriation or cheating and fraud by commercial banks
or financial institutions, malfeasance in office or judicial
office, extortion or blackmail by criminal organizations and
customs evasion.
</P>
<P>
The act requires financial institutions, land registration
offices and some other professions to report all transactions that
are unusual, suspicious or in excess of a given amount to the
Office of the Money laundering Control.
</P>
<P>
The act would also help Thailand to gain membership of the
United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, which it failed because of
absence of such kind of act.
</P>
<P>
Joining the convention will open the way for Thailand to
cooperate with member countries to effectively suppress drug
trafficking and destroy sources which receive money from drug
trade and control equipment and chemical substances used in the
production of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances, said the
press release.
</P>
<P>
It will also help Thailand to cooperate with member countries
in confiscating assets at the order of a foreign court, in
addition to confiscation of assets at the order of a Thai court.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the act will also help improve Thailand's
international image, the press release said.

<P>
HARARE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's bakers Monday
increased the price of bread by 10 percent, citing increased
production and input costs, the daily Herald reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Master Bakers' Association Eddie Cross Monday
said some bakers had or were going to hike the price of bread by
between 9 and 11 percent, adding that the percentage increases
effected would vary from one baker to another.
</P>
<P>
He said the price increase was a result of increases in the
cost of sugar and flour, which had gone up by 20 percent and 11
percent respectively, yeast, whose price had risen by 34 percent
and fuel and power whose tariffs had gone up by 36 percent and 20
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The price of bread has now gone up by more than 100 percent
since last year and many families can no longer afford, The Herald

</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry and Commerce Nathan Shamuyarira resisted a
hike in the price of bread, saying it was not a luxury, but a
basic food.
</P>
<P>
The government said it has to protect its citizens from higher
prices while the bakers argued that most of them would be out of
business if the price of bread was not raised.

<P>
KATHMANDU, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Foreign Minister Ram
Sharan Mahat told the House of Representatives Monday that Nepal
will not deviate from its non-aligned foreign policy, The Rising
Nepal reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Non-alignment is the time-tested foreign policy of Nepal and
there is not even a slight deviation from that stand," the paper
quoted Mahat as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said the government is very positive about the spirit of
non-alignment, adding that Nepal had adopted it as it serves the
interests of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Mahat also said that Nepal has balanced, equal and cordial
relations with both of its closest neighbors, China and India.
</P>
<P>
"We are effortful to further consolidate these ties," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai's earlier remarks
which some say hint at closer and special ties with India, the
foreign minister said that Bhattarai was talking only in the
cultural terms and it had no bearing on the country's foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said Nepal's stand on the 1950 Treaty with India has not
changed. Nepal has been pressing India to revise the treaty.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese Cities Enjoy Cool Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Residents of eastern China
cities including Shanghai and Nanjing have enjoyed a cool summer
this year, as Beijing to the north experienced its hottest summer
in 100 years.
</P>
<P>
The highest temperature in Shanghai was only 34.1 degrees
centigrade this summer, a record rarely seen over the past 100
years.
</P>
<P>
Local meteorological data records such cool summer weather only
in the years 1877 and 1882.
</P>
<P>
In Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province, one of China's
traditionally dubbed "furnaces" because of its usually scorching
summer, the thermometer has not risen to 35 degrees centigrade all
summer, and the average temperature from July 10-20 was only 24.3
degrees centigrade, the lowest reading in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
While people were enjoying a pleasurable season, many
businesses, such as refrigerator, air conditioner, and ice-cream
vendors, have been suffering losses. Air-conditioner sales in
Nanjing this summer were less than one-fourth that for the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists attribute the climate change mainly to the
extended rainy season that lasted about 45 days at the middle and
lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the country's longest river.
</P>
<P>
They also point to the cool air from the southeast as another
reason.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Develop Secondary Bond Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia wants to develop
an active secondary bond market in government securities to enable
it to play a role in pricing credit risks, Second Finance Minister
Mustapa Mohamed said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government is also looking at ways to further develop the
domestic capacity of the fund management industry to allow for the
more efficient management of funds and risks, he said when opening
a Securities Commission's seminar on Malaysian capital market.
</P>
<P>
These are among measures to further ensure the development of
the private debt securities market in efforts to ensure a more
balanced funding of economic activities, Mustapa said.
</P>
<P>
The recent crisis has highlighted that the economy was
overdependent on the banking sector for financing, exposing it to
a higher degree of liquidity and systemic risks and this made it
more vulnerable to internal and external shocks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the relatively underdeveloped bond market, economic
activities were mostly funded through bank credit, he said, adding
this was unlike the situation in many developed countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that to ensure a well-balanced funding, the government
had also to look seriously at the need to ensure financial
integrity of the capital market to limit any potential contagion
effect and reduce systemic risks.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa said that the crisis had been in some ways a blessing
because it brought to the fore issues relating to the need to
strengthen the regulatory framework and enhance corporate
governance.
</P>
<P>
These are cornerstones for enhancing investor confidence and
sustaining long-term growth of the capital market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Securities Commission Chairman Ali Abdul Kadir said
on the occasion that the time has come for the bond market to take
off.
</P>
<P>
A deeper bond market and an active secondary bond market would
benefit investors, especially institutions as they would enable
them to invest in a diversified portfolio with different rates,
risks and return profiles, Ali said.

<HEADLINE> 5 Pro-Israeli Militiamen Sent to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Five former members of the
pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) have been sentenced to jail
or fined after they were found guilty of collaborating with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Military Tribunal sentenced Monday four former
militiamen to imprisonment terms between three years to one year
and imposed on another one a fine of 1 million Lebanese pounds
(about 666 U.S. dollars), the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The court heard the cases last Wednesday along with 14 others
for which verdicts and sentences will be issued at a later date.
</P>
<P>
The defendants were among 220 SLA members who surrendered to
the authorities after their militia pulled out of Jezzine in
June.
</P>
<P>
Jezzine, just north of the Israeli occupied border zone in
south Lebanon, has been policed by the militia since Israel
established the buffer zone in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Increasing casualties inflicted by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, led to the SLA withdrawal from the
predominantly Christian town.
</P>
<P>
The defected SLA members claimed that they were forced into
the SLA, either coerced by the militia or unable to find other
employment. But they denied supplying Israel with intelligence
information.
</P>
<P>
The court, which will meet every Wednesday to hear the cases
of SLA defectors, has ruled on 25 cases so far.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Says It Builds Democracy Different From West's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is determined to build a
democratic system which is different from that desired by the West
although the government is in the form of a military one, Myanmar
leader Lt.Gen. Khin Nyunt said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing trainees of Myanmar's first course in diplomacy
conducted by the Foreign Ministry in 52 years since independence,
Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council, said the democratic system to be built is in
accord with Myanmar's culture, traditions and historical
background.
</P>
<P>
"It may not be exactly the form of democracy desired by the
West, but it will surely be the one that is most appropriate for
our country and its people," he said.
</P>
<P>
He rapped some Western countries for attacking Myanmar by using
the pretext of democracy and human rights and by putting
political, economic, social and all sorts of pressure on it.
</P>
<P>
He also accused these Western countries of trying to mold the
country according to their values and patterns.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the actions of the West are a result of lack
of comprehension of the actual situation in Myanmar and the
challenges it faces.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Myanmar is systematically taking steps for
the emergence of democracy in the nation.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar military government took over the power of state in
September 1988.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Transport Strike in Bangladesh Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The countrywide indefinite
transport strike in Bangladesh scheduled to start on Tuesday has
been called off following an agreement between the government and
the Bangladesh Road Transport Workers Federation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came on Monday at the end of a two-day discussion
between representatives of the government and the federation,
press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement envisaged steps to meet the 11-point demand of
the federation in phases. Under the accord, the government would
amend the ordinance relating to road transport industry, stop
highway robbery and toll collection, not to blame drivers
unilaterally for accidents, stop harassment in the name of traffic
laws, create welfare fund for transport workers, declare wage
scale for transport workers and amend labor laws.
</P>
<P>
The federation, after several rounds of talks with the
government failed, had earlier threatened to go on an indefinite
strike across the country from Tuesday to press home their
11-point demand, including amendment of the Industrial Relations
Ordinance 1969, cancellations of fake registration of transport
workers' union and owners' association, effective steps to stop
illegal toll collection and highway robbery.
</P>
<P>
Led by its Waziuddin Khan and Shahjahan Khan, two members of
parliament from the ruling Awami League, the federation enforced
similar strikes in 1997 and 1998 to realize its demands.
</P>
<P>
The federation signed agreements with the government thrice in
the past but those were not implemented, M.H. Rahman, office
secretary of the federation, was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Almost All S'pore Economic Sectors Post Positive Growth in 2Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- All economic sectors except
construction posted positive growth in Singapore in the second
quarter of 1999, making the country's GDP bounce back sharply by
6.7 percent from the revised 0.6 percent growth in the preceding
quarter, an official survey showed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
And the performance has led to the upward adjustment of the
1999 GDP growth forecast from between 0-2 percent to between 4-5
percent.
</P>
<P>
An economic survey released at a press conference Tuesday by
the Ministry of Trade and Industry says the growth momentum on a
seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter basis shows a strong
increase of 22 percent with a 41.7 percent strong hike in the
financial sector and over 20 percent growth in the manufacturing
and commerce sectors.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the same period of 1998, the manufacturing sector
grew by 14 percent in the second quarter of 1999, up from the 6.5
percent in the first quarter, the commerce sector grew by 5.5
percent, up from the minus 2.1 percent in the preceding quarter,
the transport and communications sector picked up by 6.6 percent,
an improvement from the 5.8 percent in the first quarter, the
financial and business services sector turned to grow by 7.6
percent, from the contraction of 2.3 percent in the earlier
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Total demand grew for the first time in four quarters, rising
6.6 percent in the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Total employment rose by an estimated 15,400 in the second
quarter compared with a decline of 9,600 in the preceding quarter
and the unemployment rate eased to 3.3 percent in June 1999 from
3.9 percent in March 1999. This is the first quarterly increase
after four consecutive quarters of decline.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing investments commitments totaled 2.1 billion
Singapore dollars (1.25 billion U.S. dollars), compared with the
1.7 billion Singapore dollars (one billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the construction sector remained in the doldrums,
shrinking by 15 percent in the second quarter, a further
deterioration from the minus 9.8 percent in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the nearly all-round hike to continued
strong growth in the manufacturing sector and robust performance
in the financial services and commerce sectors, which benefited
from the stabilization of the global economy in recent months and
regional economies' gradual recuperation from the severe
contraction last year as well as growing global demand in the
electronic industry.
</P>
<P>
The survey says that the general outlook has become brighter as
a significant number of major downside risks which were
threatening to derail the regional recovery process a few months
ago -- including the worsening of stability in Indonesia and a
U.S. stock market crash -- have become less probable.
</P>
<P>
Noting that these risks have not disappeared completely and
fresh stress points have recently surfaced, the survey says
recovery remains focused on the more internationally-oriented
sectors riding on the external upturn and there are still existing
uncertainties that characterize a still fragile external
environment.

<P>
WELLINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Pilots of the Ansett New
Zealand, an airline owned by Australians but operating in New
Zealand, Tuesday began a 24-hour strike again in protest at the
airline's proposal to cut pilot numbers and change their contract.
</P>
<P>
The striking pilots have another 24-hour strike planned for
next Tuesday. They walked off the job Friday for a 24-hour strike.
</P>
<P>
The pilots are striking over what they say are Ansett plans to
save five million NZ dollars (2.7 million U.S. dollars) a year by
cutting pilot numbers by at least 30.
</P>
<P>
Adam Nicholson, negotiator of the New Zealand Airline Pilots
Association, to which the striking pilots belong, said the union
is available to negotiate at any time, but only on the terms of
the pilots' present contract, not the new one the company is
promoting.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Doddrell, chief executive of the Ansett NZ, condemned the
pilots' union for continuing with the strike, saying it is
hardening the company's determination to secure employment
contract changes.
</P>
<P>
He urges the pilots to call off strike action and join the
company in mediation.

Arch-rival Air New Zealand has decided to put on one extra

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National Archives
announced Monday that the copies of former President Richard Nixon
's secret White House audio tapes on Watergate will be for sale to
the public in January.
</P>
<P>
"In the past there has been a lot of interest in using the
tapes on the air," said Susan Cooper, a spokeswoman for the
National Archives.
</P>
<P>
"Researchers have been interested in having their own copies
and professors have wanted them for their classes. We are just
responding to a demand," she said.
</P>
<P>
Cooper said the archives would not profit from the sale of
Nixon tapes as prices for the cassettes will be set to cover the
cost of copying and packaging them.
</P>
<P>
The archives have a total of 3,700 hours of Nixon tapes, but
the public can only buy copies of 264 hours of so-called "abuse of
government power" tapes.
</P>
<P>
The tapes for sale will contain conversations about the break-
in and bugging of the Democratic National Committee headquarters
in the Watergate in 1972, the subsequent cover-up and wrongdoing
by Nixon or his staff, the scandal that led to Nixon's resignation
25 years ago.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Survey to Study Use of Putonghua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China started a massive survey
yesterday on the utilization of the Chinese language and
characters across the country as a measure to promote the use of
standard Chinese or Putonghua, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the survey, given approval by the State
Council, is the first on the use of a language since the People's
Republic of China was founded in 1949. It is launched by the
Ministry of Education and the State Working Committee on Language
and Characters (SWCLC).
</P>
<P>
It will cover 600,000 people aged 15 to 69 in all provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions, said SWCLC Vice-Director
Zhu Xinjun.
</P>
<P>
The survey will be targeted mainly at civil servants, teachers,
students and those working in the commercial, medical and mass
media sectors, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on the spread of putonghua, as well as tracking
the use of nearly 100 dialects and over 60 ethnic languages across
the country.
</P>
<P>
The survey will start in Shanghai Municipality, the provinces
of Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Gansu and Yunnan, and Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region. These areas have relatively more dialects and
ethnic minority languages, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The central government instituted the simplification of Chinese
characters and the popularization of Putonghua in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The survey, due to be completed in 2001, is expected to help
provide a basis for future study schemes in Putonghua, dialects
and the languages of the 55 ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
It will help enhance people's awareness of upgrading language
skills.
</P>
<P>
The SWCLC has set up a special task force to implement the
survey. It will give four-day training courses to officials from
across the country responsible for the use of language and
characters, says the paper.

<HEADLINE> Germany Hails PKK's Intention to Abandon Armed Struggle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The German government on Monday
welcomed Turkey's rebel Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)'s intention
to abandon armed struggle and hoped that the Turkish government
would seize the opportunity for a peaceful solution to the Kurdish
issue.
</P>
<P>
The PKK statement on renouncing armed struggle is "an
interesting political development," said Charima Reinhardt,
spokesperson for the German government, at a press conference here,
adding that the PKK should pursue further for the intended goal.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued earlier on Monday by the Cologne-based
Kurdish news agency, the PKK said it would hold an extraordinary
party congress and a new platform would be adopted, indicating
that it would replace armed struggle with political struggle.
</P>
<P>
"Although armed struggle is sometimes necessary, it has lost
its prominent significance over the past 100 years," the PKK
statement said.
</P>
<P>
But the statement did not give a date for the planned party
conference.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Kurdistan People's Liberation Army (ARGK), the
PKK's armed wing, announced that it would stop fighting and begin
withdrawing its forces from Turkey on September 1, as called upon
by PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, sentenced to death by a Turkish court on June 29,
earlier last week called on the PKK forces to end their armed
struggle and withdraw from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting against Turkish government troops
since August 1984 for a separate Kurdish state, leaving more than
31,000 persons killed in the conflict.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Pilots Stage 24-Hour Strike Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Pilots of the Ansett New
Zealand, an airline owned by Australians but operating in New
Zealand, Tuesday began a 24-hour strike again in protest at the
airline's proposal to cut pilot numbers and change their contract.
</P>
<P>
The striking pilots have another 24-hour strike planned for
next Tuesday. They walked off the job Friday for a 24-hour strike.
</P>
<P>
The pilots are striking over what they say are Ansett plans to
save five million NZ dollars (2.7 million U.S. dollars) a year by
cutting pilot numbers by at least 30.
</P>
<P>
Adam Nicholson, negotiator of the New Zealand Airline Pilots
Association, to which the striking pilots belong, said the union
is available to negotiate at any time, but only on the terms of
the pilots' present contract, not the new one the company is
promoting.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Doddrell, chief executive of the Ansett NZ, condemned the
pilots' union for continuing with the strike, saying it is
hardening the company's determination to secure employment
contract changes.
</P>
<P>
He urges the pilots to call off strike action and join the
company in mediation.
</P>
<P>
Arch-rival Air New Zealand has decided to put on one extra
flight Tuesday between Christchurch and Queenstown on New
Zealand's South Island.

<P>
CHANGSHA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province
will use 279 million US dollars-worth of overseas loans to improve
its flood-control works on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund of Japan will offer Hunan's 21 flood-prone cities 24 billion
Japanese yen (about 209 million US dollars) in loans for
constructing and improving water-control facilities. The loans
have a term of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to be finished in 2003, and by then the
flood-combat capacities of these cities, which were seriously
damaged by the worst flooding on the Yangtze in 1998, will be
greatly enhanced, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province will also utilize 70 million US
dollars-worth of loans from the World Bank (WB) to reinforce the
124-km embankment built along the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Protected by the embankment are Yueyang City and 11 counties,
where 1.6 million people live, as well as the Beijing-Guangzhou
trunk railway line and National Highway 107.
</P>
<P>
The WB-financed project is expected to be finished in four
years, and the reinforcement will greatly reduce risks to
secondary dikes, said a local water-control official.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Basically Agrees to U.N. E.Timor Personnel Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
basically agreed to a proposed increase in the number of U.N.
Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) personnel, provided the matter is
first discussed with Indonesia, Antara news agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Ministry Director General for Political Affairs
Nugroho Wisnumurti Monday said that Jakarta will host a tripartite
meeting between Indonesia, Portugal and the U.N. on August 12.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, usually held at the U.N. headquarters in New York,
will be attended by the Portuguese ambassador to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will discuss matters relating to East Timor
following the U.N.-sponsored direct ballot, he was quoted by
Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Australian government has proposed to
increase the number of UNAMET officials following the campaign
period prior to the direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has deployed some 241 international staffers, 420
volunteers and 280 civilian police officers, and recruited 4,000
local staffers to implement the direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
The campaign period is scheduled to start on August 14 and ends
on August 27.
</P>
<P>
The August 30 ballot will allow the territory's people to
choose whether their homeland should become an autonomous region
within Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N., which

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Accept E.Timor Ballot Outcome: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian official said the
government will accept the final outcome of the autonomy ballot in
East Timor -- whatever it may be -- so long as the ballot is
conducted fairly, transparently and democratically.
</P>
<P>
"But if the ballot process does not run fairly, and if
Indonesian observers see fraud, we will probably reject the result
of the ballot," Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Sulaiman
Abdulmanan was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Tuesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Foreign Affairs Ministry's subdirectorate for
decolonization, politics and law Hari Purwanto said he was
optimistic that the majority of East Timorese will vote for
autonomy within Indonesia in the August 30 U.N.-led ballot.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairwoman of the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P) Megawati Soekarnoputri Monday invited the people
to take part in the coming autonomy ballot "with honesty and a
sense of responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Megawati arrived in Dili, capital of East Timor, for a two-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
She explicitly expressed her expectation of East Timor to
remain with the Republic of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Don't hesitate to decide on the future of this region (in
integration with Indonesia)," she was quoted by Antara News Agency
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that PDI-P and other 14 political parties have
declared in Dili on Monday that they are forming an alliance which
supports autonomy for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"The integration (of East Timor with Indonesia) should be
maintained and preserved," the alliance's chairman Armindo Soares
Mariano said.
</P>
<P>
The August 30 ballot will allow East Timorese to choose whether
their homeland should become an autonomous region within Indonesia
or totally independent. As of August 8, the final day of
registration, 446,256 East Timorese have registered in and outside
East Timor for the ballot.
</P>
<P>
If the majority of the people reject the offer, the People's
Consultative Assembly, Indonesia's highest decision-making body,
will consider East Timor's separation from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N., which
still considers Portugal as the administering power of the
territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The German government on Monday
said that it was deeply concerned over the current situation in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, and urged the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA) to lay down arms as promised earlier.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, government spokesperson Charima
Reinhardt appealed to the KLA to disarm as stipulated in an
agreement it reached earlier with NATO.
</P>
<P>
She warned that the international community will not allow the
KLA, the armed force of Kosovo ethnic Albanians, to fill the power
vacuum after the withdrawal of the Yugoslav forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The warning came as an increasing number of clashes between the
NATO peacekeeping forces in Kosovo and the KLA were reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, the peacekeeping forces closed a KLA base in
eastern Kosovo and detained 59 armed Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Many German politicians have urged the presence of an
international civilian police force in Kosovo to help the peace-
keepers prevent ethnic Albanians from making reprisals against
Serbs remaining in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Some 100,000 Serbs have fled Kosovo for fear of revenge from
Albanians since the NATO peace-keepers entered the province.

<P>
BELGRADE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic met with Bosnian Serb President Nikola Poplasen here
Monday. The two leaders stressed the need to fully implement the
1995 Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that all outstanding issues in the Bosnian Serb
republic and Yugoslavia's Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina must be
resolved in line with the Dayton peace agreement, the official
Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
They said that only by steadfastly sticking to the agreement
can the remaining issues get smoothly resolved.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic and Poplasen also exchanged views on expanding
cooperation between Yugoslavia and the Bosnian Serb republic, and
showed interests in promoting cooperation in economy, culture,
education and other areas, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1995 Dayton peace agreement, Bosnia was divided in
two -- the Bosnia Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat Federation,
each having its own president and government. Poplasen was elected
president of the Bosnian Serb republic in 1998.

MEXICO CITY, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Mexico City is considering
imposing prison terms and heavy fines on drivers and garage owners
for breaching local regulations on vehicle exhaust emission
control, municipal authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We shall not tolerate corruption or distortion of the Integral
Program for Reducing Exhaust Emissions (IPREE)," the city's

</P>
<P>
The Federal District's legislative Assembly is debating on
imposing sentences up to five years and considerable fines on
offenders of the IPREE, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, drivers who break the IPREE will only be fined or
have their vehicles retained.
</P>
<P>
In a campaign to fight car pollution, 11 garages failing to
meet the environment standard have been closed.
</P>
<P>
In Mexico City, vehicles are required to undergo an exhaust
emission test every six months at authorized repair shops.
</P>

PANAMA CITY, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Panama receives international

an official from the Ministry of Economy and Finances said Monday.

Alredo Broce, director of the ministry's technical cooperation,

<HEADLINE> China in Bid to End Illegal Fining of Rural Firms: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Agriculture has
called for the lifting of illegal fines and arbitrary quotas which
are hampering the sustained growth of China's township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Township industry, a major contributor to the country's
economic growth, has endured unfair fines as well as a sluggish
market and difficulties in obtaining bank loans, the ministry was
quoted by Tuesday's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Illegal fines, arbitrary quotas and other unreasonable
measures imposed on township and village enterprises have been on
the rise this year," said Jiang Yongtao, director of the Township
Enterprises Bureau of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the nationwide campaigns to ease the financial
burdens on farmers, many local governments have shifted the
unjustifiable charges borne by farmers to township firms instead,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many small and medium-sized township enterprises are
plagued by acute fund shortages, as banks are reluctant to lend
them money and funding from government sources is dwindling, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Developing township enterprises has been slated as a key
strategy and a long-term, fundamental policy by the government.
Officials believe they will contribute to the flourishing rural
economy and to boosting overall economic growth, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Township and village businesses grew 17.3 percent last year,
contributing about three percentage points to the country's 7.8
percent gross domestic product growth.

BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- ITT Fluid Technology, one of the
world's biggest pump manufacturers, is interested in finding a
Chinese partner to jointly manufacture giant flood-control pumps,
according to Richard Labrecque, president and CEO of ITT.
</P>
<P>
The pump, capable of drawing 35 tons of water per second, is
much needed in China for anti-flood use, the Ministry of Water
Resources was quoted by today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Subject to monsoon climates, China has to fight floods every
year. Last year, the country was hit by the most severe flooding
since 1954.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese market is an important one for ITT, although it
accounts for only one percent of the company's total sales at
present and its business in China is slowing down, Labrecque said.
</P>
<P>
However, the slow-down will be temporary, as China is adjusting
its economic structure and reducing its industrial projects, he
added.

SANTIAGO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The only solution to the case of
Chile's Senator for Life Augusto Pinochet is his return to the
South American country, Foreign Minister Juan Gabirel Valdes said
in Washington on Monday at the beginning of his three-day United
States visit.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chilean government will stick to its position that
wherever Pinochet is, in London or in Madrid, Spanish judge
Baltasar Garzon has no jurisdiction over him.
</P>
<P>
The former ruler of Chile has been held in London since October
16, 1998, and faces the possibility of being extradited to Spain.
Spanish judge Garzon has accused Pinochet of violating human
rights during his military regime in Chile.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government has maintained a firm stance against
Pinochet's detention and extradition, considering the action
violates the diplomatic immunity and judicial sovereignty of Chile.

QUITO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador affirmed on Monday that it
would not participate in any form of military intervention in
neighboring Colombia, where the government is struggling hard on
the road to peace with armed rebels.
</P>
<P>
"A political and strategic objective of our country is not to

Conflicts between the government forces and the rebels have so

Colombian magazine "Cambio 16" said in its latest edition that
the United States is likely to lead a multinational force against
the biggest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC), whose activities are concentrated near the border
with Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz said Ecuador's allowing U.S. planes to use its Manta
airport for anti-drug fight in no way implies any military action
against Colombia's guerrillas.

In a communique issued Sunday, leftist guerrillas of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) claimed that the
plane had been hijacked by Venezuelan dissidents and that FARC
came across the aircraft after hijackers had abandoned it on a
clandestine landing strip in the jungle.
</P>
<P>
A Colombian police chief accused the 15,000-member FARC of
masterminding and carrying out the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Interior Minister Ignacio Arcaya flew to Guasdualito
on Monday to help arrange the hostages' release and government
troops in the zone were put on alert.
</P>
<P>
The Avior Airlines plane disappeared during a 25-minute
domestic flight from the southwestern Venezuelan city of Barinas
to Guasdualito. It was originally believed to have 16 Venezuelan
passengers on board, but it was later confirmed to have eight
passengers, five hijackers and two pilots.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers had fled the scene in Arauca, and the FARC held
the passengers for investigation, according to a statement a woman
read to Colombia's Radionet radio.

<P>
XI'AN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Government departments in China's
Shaanxi Province plan to build a Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368)
architecture museum in the city of Hancheng, 240 kilometers
northeast of the provincial capital, Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
The city has 24 sites with buildings that date back to the Yuan,
a sixth of China's Yuan Dynasty architectural examples. But, they
are scattered about the city, making relics protection and tourism
difficult. So the provincial and city government recently decided
to house the relics near Puzhao Temple, an important tourist
attraction, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
The museum is expected to draw more than 100,000 visitors and
earn some 10 million yuan every year.

Zhang Liang grabbed China's first gold at these games by
clocking one hour, three minutes and seven seconds while Zhang Dan
carried home the silver at 1:03:30.
</P>
<P>
The results were remarkable considering the duo had never
competed in natural waters before and had to overcome jet leg
after arriving in Zagreb Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
"I expected to win this gold medal after we arrived here
yesterday," said Zhang, who started swimming training since five.
</P>
<P>
"I was 80 percent sure that this medal is mine before the race.
I noticed that the past results of the other competitors are
inferior to mine," she added.
</P>
<P>
The other Chinese gold medal came from the women's under-78kg
judo competition, where Yu Lina triumphed over Russia's Victoria
Kazounina in the final.
</P>
<P>
Compatriot Yuan Hua snatched the bronze in the women's over-
78kg, which was won by Bulgarian Tzetana Bojilova.
</P>
<P>
In shooting, Russia edged China by one point to win the women's
50 meters sports rifle prone team title.
</P>
<P>
China took the silver in 1,750 points while Ukraine was third.
</P>
<P>
The oriental sports powerhouse China also grabbed one silver
and one bronze in fencing, where Xiao Aihua carried home the
bronze in women's foil while the country won the team silver
behind gold medalist Italy.
</P>
<P>
But the day's biggest winner was Germany, which grabbed five
golds in canoeing and kayaking alone.
</P>
<P>
They could have monopolized the paddling sports had host
Croatia not gone away with the 1,000 meters two-men canoeing gold.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has
decided to postpone her Middle East trip, possibly until the
beginning of September, the State Department said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
She delayed the trip at the request of Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, who wanted more time to iron out his problems with the
Palestinians over the timing for carrying out the Wye agreement.
Albright had planned to visit the region starting next weekend --
for the first time since Barak took office. (US-Mideast-Albright-

<HEADLINE> Chinese Surgeons Replant Severed Thumb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Surgeons in this capital of
northeast China's Liaoning Province have successfully replanted a
severed thumb by connecting a vein in the thumb with the artery in
the injured hand.
</P>
<P>
The surgery was performed on a 37-year-old man recently in the
Central Hospital affiliated to the Shenyang Medical College.
</P>
<P>
Replanting a thumb by connecting artery with vein is a very
rare medical procedure, according to Tian Lijie, the surgeon who
performed the operation.
</P>
<P>
Instead of adopting the normal medical practice of connecting
artery with artery, and vein with vein, Tian and his team adopted
a vein-to-artery method, connecting the vein vessels of the thumb
with the artery vessels of the injured hand.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the hospital called the operation a complete success,
and said swelling caused by the procedure is shrinking gradually
and the mended joint now has a smooth flow of blood.

<HEADLINE> Continued World Low Sugar Prices Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 9 (Xinhua) -- World sugar prices that have been
running at 14-year lows are likely to continue, the American Sugar
Alliance (ASA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Department of Agriculture expert John Love told the
International Sweetener Symposium, an ongoing annual event sponsored
by ASA and held in Napa Valley, California, that historically three to
five years are necessary for the sugar market to turn from bearish to
bullish.
</P>
<P>
"World sugar production is expected to exceed consumption in
1999/2000," Love was quoted as saying. "Surplus will add to stocks for
the third consecutive year."
</P>
<P>
According to the sugar expert, as long as world prices remain low,
efforts of governments to block import competition will remain high.
Already, he said, governments regulate sugar markets to support
domestic industries by subsidizing exports and alternative uses such
as sugarcane for fuel, condoning state trading enterprises and
imposing import tariffs and other protective levies. Producers in
India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia are pressing for new
import tariffs to respond to the low world prices.
</P>
<P>
The United States is a huge sugar market as well as a leading
producer. U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that in 1993 about
145 pounds of sugar and sweenteners per capita were delivered into the
food supply. Meanwhile, the American sweetener industry creates some
420,000 direct and indirect jobs in 42 states, and contributes 26.2
billion U.S. dollars to positive economic activity each year.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at enhancing the position of American sugar producers, ASA
urges a U.S. sugar policy to prevent "subsidized world dump market
sugar."

<HEADLINE> Most U.S. Companies Communicate with Employees Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 9 (Xinhua) -- More than three-quarters of
companies in the United States currently communicate with
employees online, according to a new survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Personalized materials and online communication are
increasingly popular tools for providing more and better
information to employees about their compensation and benefits,
said consulting firm Aon which conducted the survey of Fortune
1000 companies and other national and regional organizations.
</P>
<P>
Virtually all companies surveyed say that personalized
communication detailing an employee's compensation and benefits is
an important part of their employee communication strategy. More
than 73 percent personalize their communications in the form of
total compensation statements and 87 percent use personalized
enrollment materials.
</P>
<P>
"The survey found that employers want their employees to
understand the cost of the benefits they receive and to appreciate
the concept of total compensation," the consulting firm said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that corporate intranets or the Internet
are becoming the employee communication vehicles of choice.
Seventy-seven of companies responding to the survey communicate
with employees online. Of the remainder, nearly half say they plan
to implement online communications within the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most employers who utilize online communications
continue to use print material in addition to online resources,
according to the survey.

<HEADLINE> Provincial Premiers of Canada Meet on Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Provincial premiers of Canada are
making their way to Quebec City Monday to discuss tax system.
</P>
<P>
While most of the 10 provincial premiers are expected to
continue support for the current tax policy, Mike Harris of
Ontario, Ralph Klein of Alberta and Gary Filmon of Manitoba tend
to withdraw from the shared federal-provincial tax scheme, the
local media said.
</P>
<P>
Quebec is the only province that sets its own rate, but even
its premier Lucien Bouchard may join the call for tax cuts, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
One of the strong arguments by premiers for the cuts is that
Canada is heavily burdened by a tax level of 36.8 percent in its
GDP, compared with a level of only 28.5 percent in the United
States, as registered in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Manitoba Premier Filmon indicated a brain drain coming from the
competitiveness of tax policies.
</P>
<P>
He proposed to encourage Canadian talents to stay with a policy
of lower taxes, saying the country has spent much money on
education of those talents, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The western premiers used their annual conference earlier this
year to call for money from Ottawa for education, while the
Atlantic premiers have set a pre-conference meeting to work on a
common front for their social programs.
</P>
<P>
Local reports quoted insiders as expecting this premiers
meeting eventually to revert to previous patterns with a final
communique reflecting a divergence of priorities.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled to open on Monday night and will end
on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Starr to End Investigation of Clintons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr said Monday he would wrap up his investigation of
the Clintons before the 2000 New York Senate election to be
contended by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
While attending the American Bar Association's annual meeting
in Atlanta, Starr said he would deliver his final report "at the
earliest practicable moment."
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to move forward very, very rapidly... and we are
doing so," he said, but he declined to say whether President
Clinton or first lady were out of legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
Even if he brings no further charges, Starr has gathered
evidence for a final report that political opponents could use to
question Hillary Clinton's credibility during any campaign,
political observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Starr's promise Monday comes after incessant attacks on the
length of his investigation which lasts five years and costs 40
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry began with the Whitewater allegations about the
Clintons' business deal in Arkansas but was expanded by federal
court to include a controversy about files of the Federal
Investigation Bureau, possible lies by presidential aides in the
White House travel office firings and the Lewinsky case.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Hits 22-month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices hit 22-month
highs on Monday after a blast at a U.S. refinery gave fresh
impetus to a market already strong on the back of tight producer
compliance with output curbs.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark Brent crude for September delivery last traded at
20.51 U.S. dollars per barrel, up 45 cents and the highest level
seen since October 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
News of the explosion at Citgo Petroleum Corp's U.S. Corpus
Christi in Texas was enough to send prices soaring once more.
However, refinery officials said production had not been affected
at the 165,000 barrels per day plant, according to a Reuters
report.
</P>
<P>
The North Sea grade breached the psychological 20 U.S. dollars
mark on Friday on fresh evidence of OPEC output restraint and a
recovery in refinery profit margins that should shore up crude
demand.
</P>
<P>
The rise above 20 U.S. dollars was also driven by Russian
product export curbs, a rally in U.S. gasoline markets and reports
of a fall in U.S. oil inventories.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government's Energy Information Administration (EIA)
said on Friday OPEC compliance would be relatively strong
throughout the Summer before declining much more gradually than it
had expected.
</P>
<P>
The price has now doubled from historic less than 10 U.S.
dollars touched at the turn of the year, rising to the top of
between 18 and 20 U.S. dollars range that OPEC sees as the
informal target of its price rescue pact.
</P>
<P>
For the moment, there is no sign as yet of a slackening in
OPEC's adherence and some analysts say the cuts look likely to
wipe out surplus global oil inventories by the end of the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
World oil prices would average about 18.39 U.S. dollars per
barrel in the third quarter of 1999, rising to 18.67 U.S. dollars
in the final period of the year, the EIA said. That compared to
previous forecasts of 15.60 and 15.75 U.S. dollars per barrel,
respectively.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Report of Move against bin Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
denied a report by a Qatari satellite television station that
two U.S. military planes had landed at airports in Pakistan with
commandos in apparent preparation for a strike against guerrilla
leader Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
"This is an inaccurate report and should not be taken
seriously," National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said
at a White House briefing.
</P>
<P>
Al-jazeerah television said the two planes landed at the same
time -- one at Islamabad airport and the other at a nearby
airport. It said dozens of U.S. commandos emerged, taking up
combat positions near the planes and barring anyone from
approaching the area.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon declined immediate comment but Leavy quickly
denied the report.
</P>
<P>
Al-Jazeerah reported that the operation was in apparent
preparation for a military strike against bin Laden, alleged to
have masterminded two bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania last August.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said on the even of the anniversary
of the bombings on Friday that the United States would not rest
until justice was done.

<HEADLINE> 6th Plenary of 4-Party Talks on Korean Peninsula Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The sixth plenary session of the
four-party talks to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula and to
establish a peace regime there ended here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The four parties, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, and the
United States of America, had "useful and productive discussions
which were conducted in a business-like and cordial manner,"
according to the joint press statement issued at the end of the
five-day meeting chaired by China.
</P>
<P>
On August 6-7, the two sub-committees, one on the building of
tension reduction measures on the peninsula and the other on the
establishment of a peace regime there, had further discussions
about substantive issues and proposals for agenda items.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of tension reduction, the parties raised some new
proposals or reiterated previous ones.
</P>
<P>
"Each party recognized from the current situation on the Korean
Peninsula the importance and urgency of tension reduction there,"
said the statement. They also expressed the hope to expedite the
process of talks.
</P>
<P>
On the establishment of the peace regime, the statement noted
the parties tabled their "respective ideas" and "such an
exploration helped deepen the mutual understanding of each other's
positions on the establishment of a peace regime."
</P>
<P>
Sharing the value of regular four-party meetings which began in
December 1997, the parties agreed that the date for the seventh
plenary will be set later at a meeting of the four-party working
group.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with established procedure, the next round of
talks will be chaired by the ROK.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Administration Rejects Oil Dumping Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton Administration on
Monday rejected an unprecedented oil dumping case that accused
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Mexico and Iraq of selling crude oil at
unfair prices in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was a defeat for a group of independent oil
producers known as Save Domestic Oil, who filed the case earlier
this Summer saying that low prices had driven many independent
firms out of business.
</P>
<P>
"Without adequate industry support, Commerce is prohibited by
law from initiating investigations. Consequently, Commerce
dismissed the petitions," the Commerce Department said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Save Domestic Oil accused the four countries of selling
government-subsidized oil at unfairly low prices in the U.S.
market last year and into early 1999.
</P>
<P>
All four nations, who provide more than half of U.S. oil
imports, denied the dumping charges, arguing that oil prices are
freely set on the open market. Many big U.S. oil companies that
import oil also urged the government to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
"Now that Commerce has decided not to initiate investigations,
these cases are closed and no further action will be taken," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The dumping case was the first involving a widely-traded
commodity like oil. The case was a politically sensitive one for
the Clinton Administration, involving a crucial Middle East ally,
and two other important trading partners.

NEW YORK, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
Monday for the second straight day as investors remained in
fears of higher interest rates.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 6.33 at

the pace of labor cost and price increases will be picking up
the Federal Reserve will have to act "promptly and forcefully"
to preempt inflation from the U.S. economy.

Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP;
