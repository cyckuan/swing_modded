WILL DODGERS TRADE AWAY CENTER FIELDER?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Devon White's rocky relationship with the Dodgers
might be near an end.
</P>
<P>
   White, hobbled by an ailing left quadriceps, has another year
and a guaranteed $5.9 million left on his contract, but the Dodgers
hope to trade him this offseason. The veteran outfielder said it
isn't time to say whether he wants to remain in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be somewhere that I'm going to play,'' said
White, who was limited to 47 games this season because of injuries.
``They have to address a lot of situations. We'll see what happens.
I'm not ready to answer that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   White has felt slighted during his two years with the Dodgers,
particularly this season.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at spring training to learn he would have to compete
for the starting center field spot with Todd Hollandsworth. White
won it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Dodgers quietly questioned the work White was putting
in during his rehab from a partially torn rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the trade for Tom Goodwin, which rankled White to
the point his agent asked the Dodgers to trade him, team sources
said. Goodwin is expected to be the Dodgers' starting center
fielder next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always want to point the finger, and if they want to
put it on me, so be it,'' White said. ``When I did sign (after the
1998 season), I did come over as a fourth, fifth or sixth hitter,
however they want to use me. And this year they used me in the
(leadoff) role. I guess people are saying it's the leadoff guys'
fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since spring training, it's been, `I have to win a job.'
Why do I have to prove a thing? The two years I've been here,
things sometimes are not done professionally. A guy with my record,
and I'm coming into a season and they say the center field job is
open? Then when I talked to them, they said they never said that.
Somebody's lying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, if a player doesn't trust someone, it's going to
be hard to play for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: X-rays to the right wrist of Dodgers rookie
pitcher Eric Gagne were negative. Still, manager Davey Johnson said
he'll change his starting rotation to rest Gagne. Darren Dreifort
will pitch Tuesday, followed by rookie right-hander Luke Prokopec
on Wednesday. Kevin Brown will pitch Thursday's home finale against
San Francisco. Gagne was hit with a batted ball that knocked him
out of his Friday start. ... Left fielder Gary Sheffield is
expected take some swings in the batting cage today and could
return to the lineup Tuesday. ... Ismael Valdes will undergo more
tests on his right hand. He had numbness in his right pinkie, which
forced him to miss a start earlier this month in Arizona,
effectively ending his season. But a club official said the tests
are being done at the request of Valdes and his agent, Jim Bronner,
to show teams Valdes is healthy entering the winter. Valdes is a
free agent, and he's not expected to re-sign with the Dodgers.

SAN JOSE LET HUGE VICTORY GET AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dave Baldwin might have saved his job. However, no
one associated with San Jose State was happy after Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans coach, rumored to be fighting for his job, had
ninth-ranked USC on the ropes until the Trojans avoided catastrophe
by rallying with two late scores for a 34-24 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our opportunities and we didn't do it in the fourth
quarter when we needed to,'' said Baldwin, the former Cal State
Northridge coach. ``That's a tremendous football team. They've got
great skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Rashied Davis, the former Kennedy High star, caught six passes
for 121 yards on a big stage. He had catches of 38 and 42 yards,
both of which contributed to scoring drives and a 12-point San Jose
State lead heading into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he couldn't have been more disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should've won this game,'' he said. ``We got complacent in
the second half. We didn't play hard enough. We gave it to them.
But they played hard in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was consoled by family and friends in the end zone
following the game.
</P>
<P>
   The best anyone could come up with was, ``Ya'll had them
scared.'' However, Davis wasn't looking to scare anyone or even
earn respect for the low-profile San Jose program; he wanted to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get no respect from anyone,'' Davis said. ``We beat
the socks off Stanford and we still don't get no respect. This may
get us a little respect. But all I care about is winning.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cares about Baldwin, who he wants to stay next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully (his job) ain't in jeopardy,'' Davis said. ``I want
him to be here. I don't know anything about that. But I hope he
stays.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin built a winner at Northridge, where he turned a 2-8 team
in 1995 into a 7-4 team the following year. He then left for San
Jose, where he's 13-24 in the fourth and final season of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Davis certainly did his part to help Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   He got behind cornerback Chris Cashand and caught a 42-yard pass
to the USC 2 on third-and-9. Two plays later, Deonce Whitaker
scored from 1 yard out to give the Spartans a 17-12 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also had a key reception on San Jose State's ensuing
possession, which also resulted in a Whitaker touchdown. Davis had
a 38-yard reception down the right sideline, this time with solid
coverage by defensive back Kris Richard.
</P>
<P>
   Davis caught a 10-yard pass to the 14 on the next play and
Whitaker ran it in from 14 yards out to put San Jose State up 24-12
with less than a minute left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans finished with 366 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense is so potent,'' Davis said. ``Nebraska couldn't
stop our offense. I feel we have the best receivers in the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   It just didn't add up to what would've been the biggest victory
in Baldwin's career.

DUCKS DRAG DOWN BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ ``OV-ER-RAT-ED. OV-ER-RAT-ED.''
</P>
<P>
   The chant that chased Alabama and Michigan off the Rose Bowl
field this month followed UCLA out of a raucous, sold-out Autzen
Stadium on Saturday. Along with the chant and a 29-10 loss to
Oregon in the Pacific-10 Conference opener came a message as crisp
and clear as this early Autumn afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to win on the road to be a champ,'' Bruins
cornerback Jason Bell said. ``Somehow, some way, you've got to find
a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If all the work done in the Bruins' upsets of then-No.
3-Michigan and then-No. 3 Alabama - the rise from unranked to No. 6
in the nation - wasn't undone, it let them know there's a
difference between hunter and hunted, home and away, and most of
all between them and the nation's elite.
</P>
<P>
   Just as unranked Oregon (3-1, 1-0) was enjoying its 17th
consecutive win at home, UCLA (3-1, 0-1) was suffering its seventh
consecutive loss on the road.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins challenged for the national title two years ago,
they found ways to win at places like Oregon State and Arizona. On
Saturday, just as Michigan had the week before, the Bruins found
ways to lose - many of them.
</P>
<P>
   They forced fumbles at the goal line, like Robert Thomas did,
but couldn't recover it. They had disastrous turnovers, like Drew
Bennett's errant option pitch. They struggled to pass (Ryan McCann
was 13 for 33) and catch (Jon Dubravac dropped a touchdown pass,
one of four Bruin drops). They couldn't overcome poor calls by the
officials (Freddie Mitchell's apparent touchdown). They lost the
turnover battle, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't keep their poise (the offensive line was whistled
for five false starts including on three successive plays). They
were penalized for having two special teams players - Asi Faoa and
Mike Vanis - on the field with the same number.
</P>
<P>
   They even had the wrong shoes - changing at halftime after
several players slipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were horrible,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   But most horrible of all, the Bruins, who have yet to play a
complete game, seemed to let this one get away.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, just as they had in their first three games, fell
behind. They trailed 10-0 at halftime, the same deficit as last
week against Michigan. They were fortunate it wasn't more, thanks
to two missed field goals by Josh Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA had just 102 yards on offense and turned the ball over
twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told our players at halftime that as bad as we are playing,
the score is close and we've got a chance,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo
said. ``We've got to go out in the second half and we've got to
execute.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mitchell was ruled out of the end zone (incorrectly,
according to TV replays) on a 30-yard pass from McCann, UCLA
settled for Chris Griffith's 46-yard field goal to bring the Bruins
within 10-3 with 10:12 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' defense got the ball back and on third and 2 from
the UCLA 46, receiver Drew Bennett - the erstwhile quarterback -
entered the game, presumably to run an option play as he did in the
first half. But Bennett, after faking a handoff, pulled back and
threw to Mitchell, who was well behind cornerback Brian Johnson.
Before Mitchell even reached the end zone the 45,470 fans turned
stone silent as the score was tied with 6:44 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put 10 points up quickly and I thought we were rolling,''
defensive end Rusty Williams said. ``It seemed exactly like (the
Michigan game).''
</P>
<P>
   Nate Fikse's ensuing kickoff went out of the end zone, but the
Bruins were penalized five yards and had to re-kick because Faoa
and Vanis were both on the field wearing No. 35. Fikse's next kick
was returned to the UCLA 37. Then, with Oregon facing fourth and 10
at the Bruins 34, Joey Harrington completed a 17-yard pass to tight
end LaCorey Collins, although the Ducks had to settle for Frankel's
24-yard field goal and a 13-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA went three and out and sophomore Keenan Howry returned a
punt 27 yards, but it might have been a touchdown if he hadn't
tripped over teammate Keith Lewis. Nevertheless, it led to
Frankel's 28-yard field goal and a 16-10 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Another three-and-out possession for the Bruins gave Oregon the
ball at its own 47. Oregon tailback Maurice Morris, who riddled the
Bruins for 139 yards on 37 carries, got the ball on the play that
stymied the Bruins all afternoon - an option pitch from Harrington
- and raced 17 yards on third-and-1 from the Bruins 44.
</P>
<P>
   It set up a 1-yard run by Morris pushing Oregon ahead 22-10 with
6:45 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, after a 35-yard pass from McCann to Mitchell,
fizzled and punted, and that was that. So, too, may be the Bruins
shot at a national championship and even the Rose Bowl.

TROJANS AVOID EMBARRASSMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC wide receiver Kareem Kelly stood on the field
moments after the Trojans' 34-24 victory over San Jose State on
Saturday and pondered how easily a 10-point victory could have been
a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a big embarrassment,'' Kelly said. ``We
were on the verge of losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory aside, the Trojans should still have been embarrassed,
with a sloppy display that hardly merited their No. 9 national
ranking, or reason for optimism heading into Pacific-10 Conference
play.
</P>
<P>
   USC (3-0) escaped with some fourth-quarter heroics, just like it
did two weeks ago against Colorado. But there were too many
mistakes to let a mere victory over the mighty Spartans gloss over
glaring examples of inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Coliseum crowd of 56,545 had barely sat down, the
Trojans fumbled the opening kickoff and had a punt blocked for a
touchdown. By the end of the first half, the Trojans lost two more
fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Trojans scored touchdowns in the first half, they
missed both extra points, as a snap was bobbled and a kick hit the
upright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team at halftime that we were embarrassing on
special teams, on defense and on offense,'' USC coach Paul Hackett
said. ``We were embarrassing as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   And what was the No. 1 embarrassment?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the No. 1 crisis we have is having punts blocked,''
Hackett said. ``The punter takes too long. The snap takes too long.
The blocking is poor. That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   More on that later.
</P>
<P>
   With all that going against them, the Trojans once again needed
some fourth-quarter magic from quarterback Carson Palmer, who in
the first half was looking more like his struggling self from the
season-opener against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer hadn't even hit his groove by the third quarter and San
Jose State (1-3) had a 24-12 lead and plenty of momentum.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmer seemed to change in the fourth quarter, becoming
nearly perfect, much like he was two weeks ago against Colorado.
Palmer completed 8 of 9 passes on USC's first drive in the fourth
quarter, and the Trojans scored when he hit tight end Antoine
Harris on an 8-yard pass that cut San Jose State's lead to 24-19.
</P>
<P>
   USC held San Jose State on downs, but lost its momentum when
tailback Sultan McCullough had the Trojans' fourth fumble at the
Spartans' 25 with 5:33 left in the contest.
</P>
<P>
   After the USC defense again held San Jose State, Palmer quickly
drove the Trojans 67 yards by completing a 28-yard pass to Steve
Stevenson and a 29-yard pass to Keary Colbert. Petros Papadakis
scored on a 5-yard run to make it 25-24, and Palmer escaped a
tackler and hit Matt Nickels on a two-point conversion to give the
Trojans a three-point lead, 27-24.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling on our sideline was that we were not going to lose
this game,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they hadn't watched the special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our special teams weren't very special,'' kicker David Newbury
said.
</P>
<P>
   Especially the punt team. Whether or not it was a factor, USC
had freshman Norm Katnik snapping on punts for the first time this
season, in an attempt to give starting linebacker Zeke Moreno a
break from that role.
</P>
<P>
   But it was obvious that every punt was an adventure, as punter
Mike MacGillivray nearly had three other attempts blocked in
addition to the first-quarter miscue that led to a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, one explanation offered was that opponents rarely
punted in San Jose game tapes, which made scouting the Spartans'
punt-blocking scheme difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't seen a lot of film on them, and didn't know what
alignment it was that they were in,'' MacGillivray said. ``We were
just trying to get it up real quick. It was a guessing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``About three of them and I had to move or it would have been
blocked.''
</P>
<P>
   The fumbles were just as crucial, with the most serious being
wide receiver Marcell Allmond's first-half bobble in the end zone
on what otherwise might have been a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a devastating display that hardly established the
Trojans as a front-runner in the Pac-10, despite their record and
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't beat a Pac-10 team if we play like that,'' defensive
tackle Ennis Davis said. ``A lot of people had a lack of
concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also caught a major break when the Spartans were
forced to play the second half without their top weapon, tailback
Deonce Whitaker, who suffered a neck stinger. Whitaker, averaging
182 yards per game, was held out by coach Dave Baldwin as a
precautionary measure. He finished with 51 yards in 13 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there. I thought we had them,'' San Jose State
defensive tackle John Hammer said. ``We should have won. I still
can't believe we lost. I don't know what happened.''

THIS TIME, BROWN COMPLETES JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There was no way Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson was going to yank Kevin Brown. It didn't matter that the
tying run was on second base with one out in the ninth inning.
Brown was in to stay, especially with the way he's pitched this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Having suffered through seven no-decisions in which he's allowed
one run, this time Brown was allowed to finish the job. He did so
by throwing a complete-game two-hitter to lead the Dodgers past San
Diego 2-1 Saturday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Brown established a regular-season career-high with 13
strikeouts, including getting Desi Relaford and Ryan Klesko on
strikes to end it with the tying run on third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you start to get drained because it's been a long
battle, a lot of tight games,'' said Brown, who allowed a single to
Klesko in the fourth and a double to Damian Jackson in the ninth.
``It's not the number of pitches. There's been a lot of tight games
where the game was riding on one pitch. The mental aspect is
difficult sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   While Brown is used to pitching well and being involved in close
games, he wasn't dealt his typical fate. Despite a 2.56 ERA, which
is the second lowest in the National League, Brown is just 13-6.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Brown been victimized by a lack of run support in
getting 13 no-decisions this season, the Dodgers have managed to
score just 10 runs in his six losses. And if not for a throwing
error by Ruben Rivera in the sixth inning, the Dodgers might not
have scored. Rivera's errant throw allowed Tom Goodwin to score,
and it led to Shawn Green's RBI single as the Dodgers went ahead
2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I did hook (Brown), we'd have gone in holding hands,''
Johnson said. ``I'd made sure he waited on me because somebody
would have taken a shot at me. He's been outstanding. He's had some
injuries, but this year has been a better year than last year.''

CUBA PUTS U.S., LASORDA IN PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Sydneysiders were bending over like champion
gymnasts on the balance beam to advance the Olympic ideals of
friendly competition. With one week gone, it was clear ``The Big
Smile'' was putting on far too genial a Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   The cold war tensions that gave the 1956 Summer Games in
Melbourne a palpable edge were as much in evidence here as rain,
rudeness or riotous fans. A warm front had seized the city and
we're not simply talking about the glorious weather.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you turned, there were good-humored officials. Venues
were filled with fans so gracious they drew athletes of all
countries to their collective bosom.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was so serene, Inger Miller was moved to wish her
rival Marion Jones well in the 100 meters and swimmer Gary Hall Jr.
refused to pileon his vanquished Australian foes.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, soccer friendlies aren't this friendly.
</P>
<P>
   If these Games weren't careful, their smile was going to become
one giant cavity.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Saturday Cuba and the United States took the field in
baseball to play a preliminary-round game. With spikes flying and
tempers flaring, they helped the Olympics get their enmity back.
</P>
<P>
   The game featured everything but lively U.S. bats:
</P>
<P>
   There was Cuba's starting pitcher Jose Ibar throwing a no-hitter
for 4 innings and throwing at Ernie Young in the top of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Ibar's errant pitch - the only one that got away from him in
seven innings of work, if he was to be believed - hit Young, who
just happens to be the U.S.'s best hitter, in the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   When Young nudged Cuba's catcher Ariel Pestano on his way to
first, both benches cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy had pinpoint control and I get to be the beneficiary
of a 94 mile-per-hour fastball on my shoulder blade,'' Young said
afterward. ``I'm upset because I know he hit me on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department need not have fretted when the benches
emptied; the U.S. players delivered weaker hits with their hands
than they did with their bats.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach Wilson High graduate Sean Burroughs ended Ibar's
no-hit bid in the fifth with a one-out single, the first of seven
hits the U.S. would scatter in a 6-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   After Burroughs nicked him, Ibar retired eight of the next 11
batters he faced - striking out three of them - before giving way
to Pedro Luis Lazo in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the eighth, pinch runner Yobal Duenas flew home
from third on a single and slid into U.S. catcher Pat Borders with
his spikes up like the flaps on an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Borders had the ball in his mitt in plenty of time but it
squirted out in the collision. Borders rolled his left ankle and
was none too pleased. He angrily ripped off his catcher's mask and
kicked it, drawing boos from the crowd. He also had some choice
words for Duenas that we're pretty sure required no translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get hit like that, your ankle gets rolled, you get mad,''
Borders said, doing his best to be, uh, diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot remember what happened,'' he added when pressed, a
smile affixed to his face.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's players naturally couldn't understand what all the fuss
was about. Must have been the language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things happen between good teams that both want to win
badly,'' said designated hitter Antonio Pacheco, who had one RBI.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before, U.S. manager Tommy Lasorda had exhorted his
players to win this game for all the Cuban exiles in Miami. But
Saturday night, he professed not to understand why anybody would
read anything political into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never thought about politics,'' Lasorda said. ``I thought
about winning the game for all the people who had to leave their
country. What does that have to do with politics?''
</P>
<P>
   We wish Lasorda could have posed that question to the Cuban
flag- waving fan who was baiting American journalists in the mixed
zone after the game. He almost certainly would have told Lasorda
the game was a victory for Cuba and, in absentia, the country's
First Fan Fidel Castro.

SWIMMING'S WEEK-LONG GOLDEN AGE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The men's 400-meter freestyle relay
established the plot and the men's 400-meter medley relay provided
the exclamation point. In between, the swims at these 27th Summer
Olympics wrote a story for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Klim's world-record-setting first leg for the Australian
sprint freestyle relay that shattered the world record epitomized a
competition that saw 14 world records fall - four more than in the
Barcelona and Atlanta Games combined - and a 15th one tied.
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies' victory in a relay the American sprinters had never
lost in an Olympic competition put the U.S. swimmers on tactical
alert: If they didn't go into battle completely focused, these
Games were going to be forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team was able to clear the bar the Aussies had raised,
accounting for four of the world records and bettering 15 American
records.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday Chris Thompson felled the domestic mark in the 1500
meters before it had had much time to take root, trimming over two
seconds off USC sophomore Erik Vendt's time of 14 minutes, 59.11
seconds from last month's U.S. Olympic Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a senior at Michigan, clocked a 14:56.81 to win the
bronze medal behind Aussies Grant Hackett (14:48.33) and Kieren
Perkins (14:53.59) in the most-inspirational U.S. swim this side of
Misty Hyman's 200 butterfly and Tom Dolan's 200 and 400 individual
medleys.
</P>
<P>
   Vendt, who took the race out much faster than he did at the
Trials in an effort to stay close to the Aussies' dynamic duo,
faded to sixth in 15:08.61.
</P>
<P>
   On the final, fabulous day of competition, Inge de Bruijn of the
Netherlands collected her third gold medal of these Games, in the
50 freestyle. And backstroker Lenny Krayzelburg joined Aussie
teenager Ian Thorpe as the only triple gold medalists on the men's
side when he led off the U.S.' world-record setting 400 medley
relay.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg just missed his 100 backstroke world record of
53.60, but gave the Americans a clear advantage with a split of
53.87. Ed Moses, swimming next, turned in the fastest 100
breaststroke split in history - a 59.84 - to hand Ian Crocker and
Gary Hall Jr. a virtually insurmountablelead.
</P>
<P>
   With the relay win, the U.S. padded its advantage in the medals
race (or medals war, as an Australian volunteer at the swimming
venue referred to it). The Americans finished with 33 medals (14 of
them gold) for their most-bountiful haul in a non-boycotted Games
since 1976, when the U.S. men went 1-2 in nine events - and 1-2-3
in three - in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Australia wound up with 18 medals, five of them gold, which is
fair dinkum for a country of 19 million.
</P>
<P>
   USA? So far at these Games it has stood for United Swimmers of
America, those 33 medals accounting for 65 percent of the country's
total tally through Day 8.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three individual world records were broken at the
glorious Games of 1976, with American men or East German women
accounting for all but one of the marks. These Games were much more
democratic, with 18 countries collecting medals and eight countries
dividing the golds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll look back on this period as a golden age of
swimming,'' said U.S. sprinter Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get no argument from the 140,000 fans who took in the
eight days of competition here.

PALMER NEEDS ONLY A CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Carson Palmer, USC's marquee player, a sure-fire
pro prospect, is a young man in a hurry. Once he gets moving, that
is.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's his fault. Or maybe it's the way the coaches call the
plays. Whatever it is, this makes two consecutive games in which
Trojans fans had to wait until the anxious final minutes before the
quarterback was able to show his stuff.
</P>
<P>
   In the come-from-behind victory over Colorado, the Trojans
waited until the climactic drive of the night to put the ball in
Palmer's hands, whereupon he completed six consecutive passes for
67 yards to set up the game-winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   And in the come-from-behind, 34-24 win over San Jose State at
the Coliseum on Saturday, they again waited until the fourth
quarter to let their star be a star. And he came through with eight
completions in nine throws for 91 yards and the 8-yard Antoine
Harris touchdown that turned the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The drives looked identical. And they probably felt that way to
Palmer, who calmly translated a well-deserved sense of urgency into
vital points and became the first USC quarterback in 13 years to
lead the team to back-to-back fourth-quarter comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same kind of position we were in against Colorado.
Coming into the fourth quarter, we knew we had to make some big
plays,'' Palmer said as he made one last escape after the game,
weaving through a crowd of well-wishers on his way to the locker
room. ``I think that really got a little fire going, and guys who
needed to make plays made plays. Me, too, but a lot of guys came
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into the huddle and said, `Can we get two touchdowns?'
Everybody said, `Yes!' We felt the emotion change.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans had a chance to win because, after a sloppy first
half, they cut down on their mistakes and shut down a San Jose
State offense that had lost its prolific tailback to injury. And
that's all Palmer seems to need - a chance.
</P>
<P>
   So on the pivotal possession of the game, starting 80 yards from
the goal line with 13:26 on the clock and the Trojans trailing
24-12, they put it all on Palmer and his receivers. Before it was
too late.
</P>
<P>
   He competed a pass to Marcell Allmond for 23 yards on first down
and USC was on its way. He connected to Harris (13 yards), Allmond
(21) and Keary Colbert (11) for first downs. And after missing high
to Sultan McCullough over the middle on second and goal from the
San Jose State 8, he found Harris in the end zone for the game's
most important score.
</P>
<P>
   Within range of victory the next time the Trojans got the ball,
Palmer hit Keary for 29 yards to the San Jose State 5 to set up
Petros Papadakis' go-ahead touchdown run with 2:34 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer became the first quarterback to lead USC to consecutive
fourth-quarter victories since Rodney Peete (against Arizona and
UCLA) in 1987. The ninth-ranked Trojans have never looked better
this season than when they've put their sophomore quarterback in
position to win a game, and then put the offense in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's heroics, in a game that shouldn't have been this
tense, kept USC undefeated at 3-0 and prevented a widening of the
Los Angeles transit strike. After UCLA lost at Oregon on Saturday,
it appeared both of our college football bandwagons were hitting
the brakes at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say it's play calling, but it's Carson doing what
he does best,'' said a relieved Hue Jackson, USC's offensive
coordinator and quarterbacks coach. ``He has an uncanny ability to
stay cool and find a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I try to do is get him in a groove, get him in rhythm,
because if he's in rhythm, our offense is in rhythm. We'd like to
not be in that position every game. But it's fun to know that when
we are in that position, we have a guy who likes to rise to the
occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Just one question: If Palmer responds this well when the coaches
ask him to win the game with his right arm, why don't they go to
that same short- to mid-range passing game and get him in rhythm
!ital!before!off! crunch time? Say, in the second quarter?
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, might spoil the drama, and nobody would want
that.

KINGS TO OPEN YEAR SANS FISET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. _ Stephane Fiset, the Los Angeles Kings'
projected opening-night goaltender, will miss at least the first
week of the regular season after suffering a sprained left knee
during the first period of Friday's one-point loss to the Anaheim
Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset underwent an MRI on Saturday morning that revealed no
structural damage but found a sprained medial collateral ligament.
He is listed as week to week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is good news, believe me,'' coach Andy Murray said
Saturday night before the Kings' 4-1 exhibition victory over San
Jose. ``When it happened it appeared to be really serious. We could
have been looking at not having Steph for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who is hoping to pare his training-camp roster from 39
to 29 after this weekend, will go with Jamie Storr in goal for the
Oct. 6 season opener at Washington. Storr started against the
Sharks and gave up one goal in two periods.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset was injured with nine minutes left in the first period on
a collision with former teammate Dan Bylsma in front of the Kings
goal. Before he left, Fiset allowed a goal to the Mighty Ducks'
Teemu Selanne, the first he has given up in 79 exhibition minutes
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sent packing: The Kings trimmed seven off the roster before
Friday's game, sending right winger Scott Thomas to Manitoba of the
IHL and six players to Lowell, Mass., of the AHL. Players sent to
Lowell: defensemen Joe Corvo and Michael Pudlick; right-wingers
Kevin Baker, Nate Miller and Jason Podollan and left winter Dave
Hymovitz.

DUCKS DEFEND ALIOTTI, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ This wasn't about revenge, insisted Nick Aliotti.
It was about redemption.
</P>
<P>
   He buried the hatchet with UCLA head coach Bob Toledo on Friday
- accepting Toledo's handshake - and then watched with satisfaction
on Saturday as his Oregon defense stifled the Bruins, holding them
to 197 yards and one trick-play touchdown in a 29-10 victory over
the sixth-ranked team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never doubted myself,'' the Oregon defensive coordinator
said. ``I always thought I was a good football coach.''
</P>
<P>
   This would come as news to UCLA fans who remember Aliotti as the
man behind the Bruins laissez-faire defense in 1998, the one that
ultimately crashed and burned against Miami and Wisconsin, costing
them a shot at the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   What was so unusual, though, was Toledo's public criticism of
Aliotti, who in his first year on the job didn't follow Toledo's
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   So Aliotti, who fled to Oregon after 1998, wasn't about to lie
when he was asked whether this one was particularly special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it does,'' said Aliotti. ``What a great win. I'm not
going to sit here and B.S. you guys. These kids play for the
University of Oregon and the fans, but it was a very gratifying win
for myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty selfish, but it does feel good. My players - our
players - played their (behinds) off and I'm very thankful for them
doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Ducks talked afterward of how badly they wanted to
not only win for Aliotti, but play well for him. The Ducks went 9-3
last year, but one of their losses was at UCLA, 34-29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him a hug and he gave me a little kiss on the head
after the game,'' said Ducks defensive tackle Jason Nikolao. ``It's
very emotional right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him before the game, we're going to win this one for
you. I know about the bad blood and the rumors about him and Bob
Toledo. He's my coach and I love him. We had to do it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliotti inspired the same faith from his players at UCLA. He
greeted about 30 of them Friday when the Bruins came to Autzen
Stadium for a walk-through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Freddie Mitchell we were going to clamp him up, just
like I used to do at practice,'' Aliotti said. ``I grabbed his
wrist like I had handcuffs. The next thing I knew Bob was right
there. It threw me off. He offered his hand and said, `How you
doing coach?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Aliotti insisted afterward that bygones are bygones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demons were put to rest today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not until the Bruins had hell to pay.

USC'S ARBET IS HELD OUT OF STARTING LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF 
and JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC cornerback Kevin Arbet was held out of the
starting lineup for Saturday's game against San Jose State because
of a team rules violation.
</P>
<P>
   Arbet, who played and deflected two passes while also fumbling
the opening kickoff, declined to say why he was held out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some stuff happened,'' Arbet said. ``I can't comment on it.
It's a little bit disappointing. But whatever my role was, I
contributed, and that's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbet was scheduled to start in place of Kris Richard, who had a
sprained knee. But USC started Chris Cash in Richard's spot, and
then started Richard at nickel back.
</P>
<P>
   Cash had a mixed performance, with nine tackles and an
interception, while allowing several pass completions.
</P>
<P>
   Not a fumbler: USC tailback Sultan McCullough said he isn't
concerned that he could develop a reputation for fumbling, based on
histwo fumbles in the first three games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   His fumble against San Jose State could have been devastating,
after helost the ball on the Spartans' 25-yard line with 5:33 left
in the game and USC trailing 24-19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens,'' McCullough said. ``My coach told me that Marcus
Allen once fumbled four times in a game and did he have a
reputation for fumbling? I felt sick this week and didn't practice
a lot. I wish it didn't happen but it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker out: San Jose State tailback Deonce Whitaker sat out
most of the second half with a neck stinger, playing only in the
game's final series. The nation's No. 3 rusher finished with just
51 yards in 13 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker wanted to return earlier, but San Jose State coach Dave
Baldwin refused, perhaps mindful that Whitaker underwent neck
surgery in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Jamar Julien was running the ball well and we've got
eight games left. I want to keep him healthy,'' Baldwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Bouncing back: Tight end Antoine Harris was a potential goat
against Colorado, dropping a wide-open pass on fourth down. But he
had two big catches against the Spartans, including an 8-yard
touchdown pass in the fourth quarter that cut San Jose State's lead
to 24-19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much redemption, but it builds my confidence up
and shows the guys that I'm there when I need to be,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Recruit watch: Among the high players in the locker room after
the game was tailback Darryl Poston of Edison High in Huntington
Beach and All-American wide receiver William Buchanon of Oceanside.
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: USC reported only one injury, a mild ankle sprain
to defensive tackle Bernard Riley.

   OLY-SOC-WOMEN (Melbourne, Australia) _ In the 60th minute, Mia
Hamm was chopped down from behind by Brazil's Formiga. The referee
drew a yellow card and awarded the Americans a free kick from 45
yards. Brandi Chastain lofted the ball toward Lorrie Fair in the
penalty area. The resulting chaos left Brazil's goalkeeper on the
ground and the ball at Hamm's feet on a severe angle to the left of
an empty net. Pushed and kicked and jostled all evening, Hamm was

   &UR;  &LR; OLY-GYM-WOMEN (Sydney, Australia) _ The dramatic pause before the
final score was posted lasted long enough for Svetlana Khorkina to
launch into a plea bargaining session with her demons. She clamped
her eyes shut, clenched her fists as tight as paper wads and
whispered under her breath: Please, no more heartbreak. An instant

Coimbra, his left hand holding a duffel bag on his shoulder, laughs

Charles Barkley,'' the 32-year-old forward of the Angolan national
team said. ``I just knew.'' Coimbra is playing in his third
straight Olympics, eight years after Barkley maliciously elbowed
him in the chest at the Barcelona Games in 1992. If the cheap shot
brought him international sympathy and portrayed Barkley as the
ugliest of Americans _ a quick Polaroid of the world's richest
nation beating up on an impoverished, war-torn African country _ it
also gave Coimbra a name. Noticing the temperament of the 2000 U.S.
team, Coimbra said he does not believe sportsmanship is improving

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; OLY-BOX (Sydney, Australia) _ There was a soundtrack to U.S.
flyweight Jose Navarro's second-round victory Sunday in the Olympic
boxing tournament. It was loud, passionate and mostly in Spanish,
and it came from Navarro's older brother, Carlos, who stood
ringside yelling instructions and encouragement that filled the
small converted hall that serves as Sydney's boxing venue. There
may be only one gold medal awarded in Jose's flyweight division
this week, but there are two Navarros chasing it. And if Jose wins
it, Carlos gets to keep it. It was supposed to be the other way

HAMM POWERS U.S. PAST BRAZIL AND INTO GOLD MEDAL GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia _ In a game that became as raw as the
weather, Brazil's defenders kept sliding into Mia Hamm, knocking
her feet out from under her but never unmooring her composure or
resolve.
</P>
<P>
   She fell hard on her shoulder, her back, her knees. Three times,
the tackles were so rough that Brazil was issued yellow warning
cards. Hamm kept getting up, saying nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In the 60th minute, she was chopped down again, this time from
behind by Brazil's Formiga. The referee drew a yellow card and
awarded the Americans a free kick from 45 yards. Brandi Chastain
lofted the ball toward Lorrie Fair in the penalty area with a pass
that looked like a drive from a golf tee. The resulting chaos left
Brazil's goalkeeper on the ground and the ball at Hamm's feet on a
severe angle to the left of an empty net.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly finding herself free, Hamm tucked the ball into the
back right corner for a disputed 1-0 U.S. victory before 11,200 at
Bruce Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it was the most important goal of Hamm's
spectacular career.
</P>
<P>
   First, it advanced the United States to the gold medal game on
Thursday in a rematch against Norway, whom the Americans dominated
2-0 in the first match of this tournament. Norway defeated Germany
1-0 on an own goal in Sunday night's other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Hamm is a great player, but also a conflicted one. She
acknowledges that her confidence sags as her scoring ebbs. Since
last year's Women's World Cup, she has faced increased scrutiny
about whether her game is in decline. It has been her tendency to
score early during important tournaments, then to grow quiet as
defenses tighten and the pressure of expectation squeezes like a
vise.
</P>
<P>
   Only once previously had Hamm delivered a goal after the second
game of the Olympics or the World Cup. Sunday night, she awakened
from that curious dormancy to keep her team alive, and the elation
was visible on her face and in the way she raised her arm in
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Whether she is scoring or not, she works ceaselessly on defense
and passing and running. Sunday night her acute sense of
anticipation left her in the perfect spot to poach a goal. She did
what a great player does. In one instant she rescued a tense, ugly
game during which Brazil often had the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team believes in Mia Hamm, Mia Hamm believes in Mia Hamm
and the coaching staff believes in Mia Hamm,'' said coach April
Heinrichs, who has grown weary and protective as questions of Hamm
have grown more adversarial. She added, ``It goes way beyond
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's latest goal, her second of these Games, was the 127th of
her career, a record for international play for men and women.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was as contentious as it was decisive. As Fair headed
Chastain's free kick, Brazil's goalkeeper Andreia rushed forward,
stuck out her right arm, missed the ball, collided with Tiffeny
Milbrett and fell to the ground. Circling in front of the scrum,
Hamm reached the loose ball and punched it into the net with her
left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Duarte, the Brazilian coach, said that a foul should have
been called on Milbrett, who did not disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``She definitely could have called a foul either way,'' Milbrett
said of the Swiss referee, Nicole Petignat, who also gave the
Americans a favorable call on Briana Scurry's goalkeeping during
the penalty-kick shootout against China in the 1999 World Cup
final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to wreak havoc,'' Milbrett said. ``I
obstructed her and Mia slotted it in from a tough angle.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of 51 fouls were called in this vinegary match, and
eight yellow cards were issued. The Americans, having traveled
ambitiously this year, seemed slow and perhaps tired. They
struggled to string passes together and possessed none of Brazil's
speed or flair. Yet, Brazil still has defeated the United States
only once in 17 meetings and has failed to score a goal in eight of
the last nine matches.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. back line of Brandi Chastain, Joy Fawcett, Kate Sobrero
and Christie Pearce superbly cleaned up mistakes Sunday night, and
goalkeeper Siri Mullinix made a lunging save of a Roseli blast in
the 70th minute. Still, it was left to Hamm to find a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   China seemed to distract her with hard fouls earlier in these
Olympics. Emotion, she has said repeatedly, is the best and worst
aspect of her talent. Instead of growing unnerved Sunday night, she
remained collected as Brazil declined brutishly to give her any
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it as a sign of respect,'' Hamm said of the hard fouls.
``If I didn't, I'd probably go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria tried the same tactic in last summer's World Cup,
felling Hamm three times in the early minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coming after you,'' she told one of the Nigerian defenders
and scored a goal to start a 7-1 rout. Sunday night, she said
nothing, speaking instead with her feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get angry, and a light comes on and you want to go
harder,'' Milbrett said of Hamm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Afterward, her eyes bloodshot with effort, Hamm faced the
toughest moment of her evening, a question about whether her talent
had begun to erode. Her answer was as direct as her play had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I have to say is that every single day I wake up I commit
myself to being better,'' Hamm said. ``Some days it happens and
some days it doesn't. I'm still committed to that. There are going
to be games I'm going to dominate and games I'm going to struggle.
It doesn't mean I give up.'' &QL;

KHORKINA FINDS REDEMPTION WITH GOLD MEDAL IN UNEVEN BARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The dramatic pause before the final score
was posted lasted long enough for Svetlana Khorkina to launch into
a plea-bargaining session with her demons.
</P>
<P>
   She clamped her eyes shut, clenched her fists as tight as paper
wads and whispered under her breath: Please, no more heartbreak. An
instant later, as the impressive Ling Jie's score of 9.837 glowed
on the overhead screen, Khorkina's naturally sullen exterior melted
away.
</P>
<P>
   Joy moved in. With tiny puddles in her eyes, the willowy Russian
floated over to the uneven bars and kissed them like an old friend.
By the smallest of margins, by the miniscule hop on Ling's
dismount, Khorkina's 9.862 in her signature event was enough to
give her a gold medal in Sunday's Olympic apparatus finals at the
Super Dome. It also provided her with an ounce of redemption after
an error by the technical staff ruined her chance at the
prestigious all-around title on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That night, after springing into her vault, and abruptly
crashing like a bird flying into a window pane, the diva of
gymnastics was too emotionally distraught to hit her next routine,
the uneven bars. One event later, she was told the vault block had
been mistakenly set two inches below standard height. In an array
of reactions, Khorkina cried, screamed and eventually exited the
arena in a huff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't get over the disappointment, I wouldn't be
Khorkina,'' she said through an interpreter Sunday. ``I wouldn't be
standing here with the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hurts a lot. It was cruel to all the participants, to
vault on a nonstandard height. It's quite possible to get killed.
The five centimeters could decide the future of a sports person.
But I was fortunate to have many people to help me get through
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Khorkina found comfort from the dozens of flower arrangements
sent to the Olympic Village by fans, was delighted by a visit with
her little sister just before Sunday's competition and enjoyed a
mind-cleansing afternoon in the city on Friday. Surrounded by
friends, she visited the Sydney Aquarium, went to a salon for a
manicure and had her cropped blonde hair sheered away.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, in her innocent pageboy haircut, with the long-awaited
smile that appeared Sunday, the hard edge to the Khorkina persona
softened. Fitting the spirit of her makeover, Khorkina was giving
to the Russian teammates who often appear to be her wait staff.
Sunday, she handed over a chance to grab a gold medal to Elena
Zamolodtchikova.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier last week, long before the debacle Thursday, Khorkina
qualified to compete in the vault apparatus final. But an hour
before Sunday's competition, Khorkina, haunted by her last
experience and feeling soreness in her knee, decided to bow out of
the vault final. She handed over her spot to the Russian next in
line, Zamolodtchikova.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she could win the gold,'' Khorkina said. ``I'm glad
I could give her that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Zamolodtchikova embraced the moment. On little notice, she
gathered her focus and came through with a 9.731 to grab the gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So happy,'' she said. ``Just so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a satisfying day for the Russians, who finished with
consolation medals in the team finals. Beyond the success of
Khorkina and Zamolodtchikova, Alexie Nemov picked up a sliver in
the floor exercise and a bronze on the pommel horse, adding to the
all-around gold medal he won on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Nemov on the medal stands, Igors Vihrovs, of Latvia, won
the gold in the floor exercise and Romania's Marius Urzica took the
gold on the pommel horse. Flaunting his strength on the still
rings, Hungary's Szilveszter Csollany leaped in delight after a
9.850 gave him the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still cannot comprehend how beautiful this day is,''
Csollany said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians were the captivating figures. Even as a
runner-up, the personable Nemov played to the crowd, throwing his
medal-ceremony bouquet into the seats. A half hour later, Khorkina
followed his lead, tossing her flowers with even more vigor. As she
exited the arena, she winked at the fans, blew them kisses and left
a different impression of herself. Beneath her famed petulance,
Khorkina knew how to express her lighter side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow, I will dance for Russia,'' said Khorkina, referring
to the women's floor exercise, which is scheduled for part two of
the apparatus finals on Sunday. ``I will leave what happened on the
vault far behind me, like the North Pole.''  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: SPORTING DEITIES MINGLE IN SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sports of the Times) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ These guys are gods.
</P>
<P>
   That was my basic reaction when I saw the crews scrambling out
of their shells at rowing the other day. They were tall and
handsome and in great shape, and they simply glowed with
confidence, and not only the medal winners, not just taciturn
Steven Redgrave with his five gold medals, but all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Watching these guys, I had a rather simple epiphany. The Summer
Games are on. These guys are Olympians, and so are the people at
the table tennis, and the diving, and the sailing.
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like one of these blatantly obvious ``Duhhhh!''
statements, but when the medal-bearers arrive in a procession, it
is quite clear that this is not some regional sports festival. For
all its flaws, for all the bribes and the drugs and the fatuousness
of the leaders, this is, in fact, the Olympics, the best of the
best.
</P>
<P>
   It is happening all around us. I feel sorry for the people back
in the States who have to take what the network gives them, more
than half a day later, all glossy and packaged and cute. There are
television directors screaming in the ear of commentators: ``Tell
them about the brother who collects bottle caps! Tell them about
the mom who works two jobs!''
</P>
<P>
   It's better right here, what's available to the naked eye.
Pardon if this sounds like blasphemy, but these guys are gods, and
the women are goddesses, of assorted body types.
</P>
<P>
   You can't miss. Right smack in the middle of the Games, now that
everybody has mastered the great Olympic crawl through the train
lines and the electronic security lines, there are Olympic events
all over the huge campus known as Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   To catch the essence of the Olympics, you walk in any direction.
I cheated Sunday. I went to the first thing I could find with a
Brazilian team in it. The Brazilian fans are the best in the world,
good-spirited, well-traveled. They don't just turn on the juice for
the soccer team, which is how Brazilians are generally noticed.
</P>
<P>
   I went looking for goddesses to go with the gods I had seen out
at the rowing. There they were, tall and tan, young and lovely,
both the Americans and the Brazilians, playing volleyball, the
indoor variety. Both teams were undefeated, the Americans being a
bit of a surprise. The Americans ranged from 5 foot 9 to 6 foot 2,
while the Brazilians ranged from 5 foot 8 to 6 foot 4.
</P>
<P>
   The roster listed not only the height and weight and birth dates
of these players, but also their ``highest reach'' for both spikes
and blocks. Janina, for example, with her green-and-yellow braids
flopping behind her, reached 312 centimeters, which is 10 feet 2
inches, while Leila had a block of 9 foot 6. For the Americans,
Danielle Scott had a spike at 10 feet 8, while Mickisha Hurley had
a block of 10 foot 7.
</P>
<P>
   These altitudes only served to confirm my thesis that there are
gods and goddesses in all these arenas and stadiums and pavilions.
</P>
<P>
   You could hear the shrieks from the players. Every point is a
celebration. You could hear the friction as players dove to the
wooden floor. I remembered the late Flo Hyman, the charismatic
captain of the 1984 U.S. team, talking ruefully about her
``love-hate relationship with the floor.'' Her coach expected even
the spikers to dive, inducing floor burns and bruises and the odd
fracture, but good for the soul.
</P>
<P>
   Volleyball goes on without Hyman. The Brazilian women use only
one name, just like the male athletes from their country. There was
Fofao and Virna and Janina, while the Americans use their last
names: Sykora and Ah Mow and Cross-Battle. The Brazilians' shorts
were cut high to the hip; the Americans' were somewhat more modest.
</P>
<P>
   The front-line players jumped high above the net. The shorter
players braced two arms to control a ferocious serve. The ball went
``splat'' as it landed out of bounds. The Brazilians shrieked. They
won in four sets, and the mystical globes on the Brazilian flag
shimmered, and parents passed their children to Brazilian players
for a photograph, and Japanese fans with the Brazilian flag painted
on their cheeks begged for autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazilian fans are great,'' said Stacy Sykora, the U.S.
stalwart from that well known volleyball factory of Texas A&AMP;M.
``They support their team, but they are friendly to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Sykora said at times this could be any major volleyball
tournament, with the same teams, the same long arms poking at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fans, the spirit, the supporting cast, the hoopla, is
all different here,'' she said. ``Here there are all kinds of
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   She was right about that. I left the goddesses in shorts and
repaired to an internal television set, with access to every event
taking place at the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Click. A burly and dignified discus thrower from Qatar. Click.
Hurdlers. Click. South Africa making a neat 6-4-3 double play
against South Korea. Click. Tommy Haas of Germany playing Alex
Corretja of Spain in tennis. Click. Men's beach volleyball. Click.
Windsurfers skittering back into port, their race postponed because
of stiff winds. Click. A Cuban discus thrower. Click. A long jump
throwing sprays of sand in the pit.
</P>
<P>
   These are the Summer Games of a dozen shapes and sizes. Chunky
soccer players with low centers of gravity. Lanky basketball
players. Outsized weight lifters. Wiry little artistes of table
tennis and badminton. They take different forms, but for these 16
days this is the center of the universe to sporting gods and
goddesses, every way you look.

NAVARRO BOXING FOR HIS BROTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ A soundtrack came with the American
flyweight Jose Navarro's second-round victory Sunday in the Olympic
boxing tournament. It was loud, passionate and mostly in Spanish,
and it came from Navarro's older brother, Carlos, who stood
ringside yelling instructions and encouragement that filled the
small converted hall that serves as Sydney's boxing venue.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro was losing a tight fight with Hicham Mesbahi of Morocco
and needed a final-round rally. Carlos was doing everything in his
power to make sure his brother pulled through.
</P>
<P>
   There may be only one gold medal awarded in Jose's flyweight
division this week, but there are two Navarros chasing it. And if
Jose wins it, Carlos gets to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hear him,'' Jose said with a laugh after the fight,
which he won on points, 12-9. ``Everybody in the place could hear
him. He knows we're in this together.''
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be the other way around, Jose in the
grandstand, cheering for Carlos at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the two-bedroom, South Central Los Angeles house Jose shared
with his parents and 11 brothers and sisters, Carlos, five years
Jose's senior, was always going to be the family's Olympian. Or at
least the first one.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos was the top-rated U.S. amateur featherweight for most of
the early 1990s and a seasoned fighter with international
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ranked No. 1 for three straight years heading into the
1996 Olympic Trials,'' Carlos said last week. ``Everybody knew I
was going to the Atlanta Olympics. I guess I got big-headed,
because I lost in the Trials to Floyd Mayweather, who ended up
winning a bronze medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose was 15 years old at the time and remembers sitting with
Carlos in the locker room after his Olympic Trials defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just staring down at the floor,'' Jose said. ``What was
there to say? So I told him I still had a chance at the Olympics.
If I could win a gold medal, it would be for him and me. He was
always there from the beginning helping me in boxing. I told him,
why should all our hard work go to waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos sat next to his brother as Jose told this story last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fighting for both of us,'' Carlos added as Jose nodded
his head in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if he wins a gold medal, he's going to give it to me,
right Jose?'' Carlos asked.
</P>
<P>
   Jose smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' he said. ``I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos, his eldest sister Esperanza, and their father Carlos
Sr., are in Sydney with help from the former Olympic champion Oscar
De La Hoya. The family raised money for years _ ``Tons of aluminum
cans recycled,'' Carlos said _ but was still short when it came to
the airfare needed to get to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The Navarro home isn't too far from De La Hoya's old
neighborhood and Carlos and Jose, who began competitive boxing when
he was 5 years old, had occasionally trained in the same gym as De
La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, he said he wanted to help me out,'' Jose said of De
La Hoya. ``He's helped a lot of people like me in our community. I
wanted my family to be able to come to Sydney, so I said OK. It's a
nice gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   As the son of Mexican immigrants living in Los Angeles, and with
boyish good looks, Navarro, who graduated from high school with a
3.8 grade average, has already been compared to De La Hoya and been
called the next Golden Boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way too early for that,'' said Navarro, who advanced
Sunday to the flyweight quarterfinals. ``I'm just getting
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos has begun a professional career _ his record is 22-1 _
and Jose concedes he will likely turn pro, too. He dreams of
earning enough money to build his parents a new home outside Los
Angeles, though he's not sure he could move.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I like it there with all the noise _ the helicopters
overhead, the police sirens, the gunshots,'' Jose said. ``I know
that might sound funny but I'm so used to it. But I'd like to do
something for my family, they did so much for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose's father bought and sold used cars, funneling extra income
into vitamins for his boxing sons and boxing equipment for the back
yard behind the family home. His wife sewed the robes they wore in
the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The income wasn't always constant,'' Jose said. ``But for the
number of children we had in that little house, they did great. And
that back yard got a lot of use. We had a punching bag out there, a
speed bag. It was like a little gym.''

 &HT;    DESPITE LAW, REFORMS LANGUISHED FOR YEARS
 &HT;    With NURSING-HOMES.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The road to nursing home improvement has been a
tortuous one of missed deadlines and unfinished agendas even as the
pace of new proposals accelerates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enforcement of the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987, set to
begin in 1990, was delayed until 1995 because the Health and Human
Services Department (HHS) was late in completing the necessary
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   _ By 1998, congressional investigators at the U.S. General
Accounting Office were probing California's nursing homes and
finding that 30 percent had health violations that caused injury or
death to residents, or had falsified records to hide deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week before the scheduled release of the report,
President Clinton announced a crackdown on the worst nursing homes,
including surprise weekend inspections and immediate fines for
violating standards.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1999, federal investigators continued to find major health
and safety violations. The HHS inspector general reported that
``some nursing homes are chronically substandard'' and that
complaints were on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Congress passed a law forbidding nursing homes from
evicting Medicaid recipients after some facilities began trying to
replace the residents with higher-paying clients.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 2000, Democratic congressional investigators began checking
conditions in a sampling of congressional districts and finding
serious health and safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ This summer, eight years late, HHS delivered a ground-breaking
report on the ill effects of understaffing in more than half of
America's nursing homes. The study had been ordered by Congress for
completion in 1992, but it was all but forgotten by lawmakers and
HHS until Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate
Aging Committee, brought it to the attention of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In response, President Clinton on Sept. 16 proposed $1 billion
in grants over the next five years to boost staffing in some
nursing homes. He also announced he was ordering the Health Care
Financing Administration to establish mandatory minimum standards
for staffing levels at nursing homes, but not for at least two more
years.

 &HT;    13 YEARS AFTER REFORM LAW, NEGLECT STILL HAUNTS NURSING HOMES
 &HT;    Eds: Inserts 2 grafs after graf 9 with details.
 &HT;    With NURSING-CHRONO.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than a decade of federal attempts, including a
sweeping federal law in 1987 and an enforcement crackdown by
President Clinton two years ago, have yet to deliver promised
quality care for nursing home residents.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by a national Institute of Medicine report that
described ``shockingly'' poor conditions in many facilities in the
1980s, Congress enacted the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987, which
was supposed to open a new era for long-term care. The law entitled
residents to individual care plans, sufficient services, and safe
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 years since then have brought a chain of reports
concluding that federal enforcement of the law has been lax, and
many nursing homes grossly deficient.
</P>
<P>
   In one positive sign, health care experts say that the
facilities now use fewer unnecessary restraints to keep patients in
beds or chairs, and that they have reduced the practice of drugging
residents into a stupor to control behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sizable number of nursing homes, government inspectors
and researchers continue to find residents who are malnourished,
left soaking in their own urine and feces, and physically abused by
underpaid, poorly trained staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, nursing homes have not increased their staffing levels
as the number of residents has grown to 1.6 million. And the
facilities are serving sicker patients who are transferred sooner
from hospitals amid cost-cutting in the medical system.
</P>
<P>
   The state of nursing home standards is up for review Thursday at
a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, just as the
industry is receiving new critical reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Health and Human Services Department (HHS) recently
concluded that 54 percent of the nation's 17,000 long-term care
facilities are so understaffed that they harm their patients.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Clinton to ask Congress this month to approve $1
billion in grants to boost chronic understaffing in nursing
facilities. Residents ``shouldn't go another day without the care
that they deserve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks were broadcast from the Washington Home, which he
praised for giving ``top-quality'' care for more than 100 years.
However, federal records posted on the Internet show the facility
has been cited for six ``deficiencies,'' one more than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   Among the inspectors' findings were a failure to develop a
complete care plan for some of its residents and a failure to
``store, cook, and give out food in a safe and clean way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide inspection results just compiled by the Health Care
Financing Administration (HCFA), which oversees most nursing homes,
offers widespread evidence of negligence and shoddy care.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings from the first three months of this year:
</P>
<P>
   _ One out of every five facilities surveyed was cited for abuse
of residents, compared with one in 10 during the first quarter of
last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Just over 17 percent were cited for failure to properly treat
or prevent bedsores, a condition that is frequently a sign of
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only about 15 percent of the facilities were found to be in
compliance with all health standards.
</P>
<P>
   When Democratic congressional investigators checked conditions
in a sampling of congressional districts this year, they also found
serious health and safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   The worst examples were in the San Francisco area, where worm
larvae were found crawling in one resident's bedsore. In another
home, ants were found crawling on the face of an 83-year-old woman.
In a third, the air conditioner had not worked for six months, and
residents' room temperatures ranged up to 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suffering of nursing home residents is intolerable,'' said
Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, who as chairman of the Senate
committee receives quarterly updates from HCFA on nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bedsores and malnutrition turn the stomach and hurt the
conscience,'' Grassley said recently. ``They beg for a solution,
the sooner, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Why have the reforms mandated in 1987 failed to come about?
There are a number of viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   The American Health Care Association, which represents about
11,000 for-profit nursing homes, blames the government for using
too much stick and not enough carrot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is painfully obvious,'' said Michael Hogan, chief
lobbyist for the trade group. ``You can't punish your way to
quality improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Brushing aside federal studies indicating that penalties have
been mild, Hogan complained that the government has spent years
building an ``enforcement machine'' for nursing home standards and
has not spent enough to improve care.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for nursing home reforms, on the other hand, say the
government has used too much carrot and not enough stick.
</P>
<P>
   Toby Edelman, an attorney with the private Center for Medicare
Advocacy, points to total public funding for nursing homes, which
more than doubled from $25 billion in 1990 to an estimated $58
billion this year from the Medicaid and Medicare programs.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman cites numerous appeals and delays available to nursing
homes to avoid penalties and fines. She concluded that
``enforcement was pretty ineffectual, and any improvement was
really voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other nursing home critics, Edelman charged that nursing
home operators, who are big political campaign contributors, are
able to use their clout to fend off tough enforcement.

ANGOLAN BASKETBALL PLAYER STILL ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT BARKLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The sinewy man in the navy sweat suit
trudged slowly into the interview area beneath the stands, his legs
still sore after a close loss. But Fernandes Herlander Coimbra, his
left hand holding a duffel bag on his shoulder, laughed when that
name was brought up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you were going to ask me about Charles Barkley,'' the
32-year-old forward of the Angolan national team said. ``I just
knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Coimbra is playing in his third straight Olympics, eight years
after Barkley maliciously elbowed him in the chest at the 1992
Barcelona Games. If the cheap shot brought him international
sympathy and portrayed Barkley as the ugliest of Americans _ a
quick Polaroid of the world's richest nation beating up on an
impoverished, war-torn African country _ it also gave Coimbra a
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he made me famous in some places,'' Coimbra said. ``In
1996 when I come to Atlanta, many members of the press are waiting
for me at the airport to talk about this. And they ask me, `If he
do it again, what do you do?'
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction was, `I don't have the muscles to fight with
him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Noticing the temperament of the 2000 U.S. team, Coimbra said he
does not believe sportsmanship is improving in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch Alonzo Mourning, and he poses over the player from
China, like he wants to fight,'' Coimbra said of a scene from last
week's preliminary round. ``The first Dream Team and the second
Dream Team, I think, the players were more wholesome and more
personality. The new players are young players, and I think they
come from _ what can I say? _ not arrogance, but they want to put
you in your place in international basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Coimbra and the Angolans will not qualify for the medal round.
They play their final preliminary game Monday against Russia and
will most likely fall to 0-5. They won two games in Barcelona, one
in Atlanta. In life and basketball, not much has changed in Angola
since 1992. Not much has changed in 25 years, when the fighting
began.
</P>
<P>
   A civil war still depressingly hangs over the African nation.
The capital of Luanda is relatively unscathed by the conflict,
though every Angolan is affected in some way.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Palma, the coach of the Angolan team, described how
difficult it is to put together an Olympic squad. Only two of their
12 players come from the southern part of the country, where the
conflict is most intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know the conditions we have over there,'' Palma said of
the southern region, ``you cannot believe we make the Olympic
Games.''
</P>
<P>
   After the conflict began, Palma explained, many of the best
teachers _ including the ones who taught physical education _ moved
to safer areas of the country or to other towns on the African
coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't teach physical education anymore at schools,'' said
Arlindo Macedo de Oliveira, a journalist from Angola covering the
Olympics. ``Now we have a problem: Some teen-agers are good
athletes, but sometimes they don't know how to run, how to jump,
because they have no physical education.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war began, he said, many of the country's gymnasiums
were converted into ammunition depots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of street basketball,'' Palma said. ``And some
of the so-called gyms are really outside, with a roof hanging over.
No air conditioning. You play outside in 95 degrees. And the
surface is not like wood surface. It is made up of other fibers.
Some players cannot stop on the floor when they go fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Luanda has one large, well-lit gymnasium and three smaller gyms.
``Only six teams play, so it's very difficult to get good players
and the tallest players,'' Coimbra said. ``Many of the players here
just started playing two years ago. It is very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the conditions, Angola still has the best basketball
team in Africa. The squad is not very tall, with the 6-foot-7
Coimbra one of the exceptions. To compensate for their lack of
height, the Angolans play like the ultimate church-league team,
constantly lofting 3-pointers and running the break.
</P>
<P>
   To make up the national team, seven players were taken from one
of three professional club teams in Angola and five more were taken
from the remaining two teams. A professional player in Angola
receives between $100 and $200 U.S. dollars per month. ``They give
you pocket money when you first start, and if you are good, you can
win a car or maybe get an apartment,'' de Oliveira said.
``Sometimes they will give a player a home or a motorcycle or a
well-heeled relative of the team will support the player.''
</P>
<P>
   Coimbra, who will be 36 in 2004, is unsure if he will compete at
his fourth Olympics in Athens. He is a gentle, soft-spoken man,
privileged to have had an opportunity to represent his country
three times in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is someday we can have many players that are more
than 2 meters tall, like other countries,'' he said, referring to
6-foot 7-inch players. ``Also, to play close games against the good
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not play extensive minutes anymore. Often, Coimbra said,
he answers more questions about Barkley than his playing ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when I'm at home, and I watch the NBA, I remember
that,'' he said. ``I just start laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in retirement, he added, Barkley remains one of his
favorite players. ``I love the way he fights on the court. He has a
soul.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's not my favorite anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   No?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Coimbra said. ``Scottie Pippen. He is now my favorite.''

AMERICAN DIVER UPSETS CHINESE TO WIN GOLD IN 10-METER PLATFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Six months ago, the platform diver Laura Wilkinson
broke three toes on her right foot while training. With Olympic
trials looming, she figured her dreams of Sydney fractured as well
that day.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday Wilkinson roared from fifth place to capture the
women's 10-meter platform gold, the first American to win the event
since 1964. She faced down her own fears _ an inward 2{ somersault
that has spooked her _ and a formidable pair of Chinese divers who
were expected to top the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson, a 22-year-old Texan, finished 1.74 points ahead of
the favorite, Li Na, who ended up with silver. Anne Montminy, a
Canadian, won the bronze medal, edging out Li's diving partner,
Sang Xue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of trials and tribulations to get here,'' said
Wilkinson, recounting the painful weeks of rehabilitation that
followed her injury. ``The day I broke my foot, I thought my dreams
were over. But God works in mysterious ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by her coach, Ken Armstrong, Wilkinson embarked on a
brutal training regime that included standing in a cast for six
hours a day on top of the platform to practice her push-offs. As
soon as the cast was removed, Wilkinson began practicing dives
underwater, to avoid putting pressure on her foot.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Armstrong said Wilkinson demonstrated a stoicism
and determination that confounded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is so mellow and so in control of her feelings,''
Armstrong said. ``I have never seen her rattled.''
</P>
<P>
   Those traits were on display Sunday, as Wilkinson battled back
from a 60-point deficit after the semifinals. The turning point
came in the third dive of the final round, a reverse 2{ somersault,
which Wilkinson performed perfectly, entering the water
knife-straight with barely a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old Li, by contrast, struggled on her third dive,
after having given a diving clinic for most of the competition.
Sang fell apart completely on an inward 3{ somersault, dropping out
of medal contention. Also hurt in that round were Montminy, who had
briefly challenged Li for the top spot, and her Canadian teammate,
Emilie Heymans.
</P>
<P>
   But while Wilkinson's third dive was one of her strongest, the
fourth dive had plagued her in previous rounds. It puts pressure on
the bones in her foot that were broken. And she had not been able
to banish fears of hitting her head on the concrete tower on this
particular dive; in earlier rounds, Wilkinson had twice bungled it.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wilkinson walked to the ladder, Armstrong took her aside
and urged her to dive for her friend and teammate Hilary Grivich,
who was killed in a car accident in 1998. He had never invoked
Grivich's name before.
</P>
<P>
   ``She needed a boost,'' Armstrong said. ``That's a tough dive.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson said she was caught totally off guard. But she said
the comment cleared her head and inspired her to nail the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson's improbable victory was a devastating defeat for the
Chinese, which have built a dynasty in women's diving in the last
decade. Li made few excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I feel very regretful that I didn't win the gold
medal,'' she said. ``I didn't dive well. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both Li and Sang, 15, dove impeccably until halfway
through the final round. The judges scored their dives consistently
above 8.5 during the preliminary round and the semifinal. Even Li's
last effort, a forward 3{ somersault, showed her trademark style,
barely rippling the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, Wilkinson also nailed her final dive, a back 2{
somersault with a half twist, making it impossible for Li to catch
her.
</P>
<P>
   Li's defeat may raise questions about the Chinese team's
decision to shift its champion diver, Fu Mingxia, who won a gold
medal in the 10-meter competition in 1992, from the platform to the
springboard.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her regret, Li said she was looking ahead to the women's
synchronized diving competition, in which she will compete with
Sang. Based on their performance Sunday, the two must be considered
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson faces a trip home to The Woodlands, Texas, and the
prospect of having the bones in her foot rebroken to set them
properly. For all that, Armstrong said, she had never complained
about her injury.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said the seeds of Wilkinson's heroics may have been
planted by the injury. After she won a gold medal in the 1998
Goodwill Games in New York, Armstrong said her intensity ebbed
somewhat. But after the injury, Wilkinson found new reserves of
grit that Armstrong had not seen before.
</P>
<P>
   The coach did his part. He recalled waking her up at 6 a.m. the
morning after her injury to tell her that she was not going to
quit, that she would make the Olympic team. After rubbing her eyes,
Wilkinson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, our goal was not just to make the Olympic team, but
to win a medal, and not just a medal, but a gold one,'' she said
serenely.

VAGENAS KICKS U.S. INTO SPOT IN SEMIFINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Peter Vagenas volunteers for penalty kicks.
Not everybody does. Some of the most productive scorers in soccer
history would just as soon inspect the light stanchions or the
clumps of grass when the call goes out for volunteers. But Vagenas
wants the ball.
</P>
<P>
   His eagerness to knock home a potential freebie has helped bring
the United States to Sydney, to say nothing of the semifinals of
the Summer Games. The men's soccer team has become one of the
biggest surprises of the huge U.S. enterprise here, and will play
Spain on Tuesday night at Sydney Football Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Vagenas had a lot to do with it, although he plays down his
impact. He scored a penalty kick at 90 minutes to tie the score
with Japan, 2-2, on Saturday night in Adelaide. Then, after 30
minutes of overtime, Vagenas asked for the first penalty kick and
converted it, and the Americans went on for a 5-4 victory in
penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing is to draw the penalty kick, not to make
it,'' said Vagenas, who is 22 years old and plays for the Los
Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   He gave praise to Josh Wolff for forcing a Japanese defender to
knock him down. The penalty kick does not automatically go to the
fallen player but to either the coach's choice or the first
volunteer on the field. That was Vagenas, who was captain for UCLA
in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the penalty kick I like but the intensity,'' he said
Sunday night as the team headed for Sydney. ``It's what it's all
about. One on one. Mano a mano. Pressure is something athletes
like.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not precisely true, but Vagenas showed he liked pressure
against Cameroon by scoring the penalty kick. He volunteered
Saturday night to face the Japanese goalkeeper, Seigo Narazaki, who
had just sustained a bloody nose in a collision with his own
defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter told me that he wanted to go first,'' said Clive
Charles, the coach. ``I gave him the privilege of going first and
then moved everybody down one. I originally had him down to take
the last one. So Peter decided who went first and then I made a
decision on the other four.''
</P>
<P>
   The only miss in the first 10 players, amazingly enough, was
Hidetoshi Nakata, the Japanese star, who plays for Roma in Italy's
top league, Serie A. Nakata hit the left post on the fourth
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's arguably one of the best players in the world, but great
players are human, too,'' Vagenas said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the United States has ever advanced even
to the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're riding the wave right now,'' Vagenas said. ``We've got
two days to prepare, but we could play right now if we had to.''

COSTAS NOT BECOMING A REDHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   SYDNEY, Australia _ Bob Costas,
NBC's prime-time host, has sandy brown hair, so why was it looking
red, with lovely auburn highlights? He hasn't been dipping into the
henna _ or so he says _ but he heard the murmurs. Even Hannah
Storm, the daytime host, asked why Costas was becoming a redhead.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Within NBC's compound here, no one saw Costas' hair reddening.
But technicians examined how Costas looked to viewers in his
hometown of St. Louis and in New York, and concluded that it was a
combination of lighting on his set and color enhancements used to
transmit the prime-time telecast.  &QL;

ANGOLAN BASKETBALL PLAYER STILL ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT BARKLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Repeating to correct slug; no other changes) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The sinewy man in the navy sweat suit
trudged slowly into the interview area beneath the stands, his legs
still sore after a close loss. But Fernandes Herlander Coimbra, his
left hand holding a duffel bag on his shoulder, laughed when that
name was brought up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you were going to ask me about Charles Barkley,'' the
32-year-old forward of the Angolan national team said. ``I just
knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Coimbra is playing in his third straight Olympics, eight years
after Barkley maliciously elbowed him in the chest at the 1992
Barcelona Games. If the cheap shot brought him international
sympathy and portrayed Barkley as the ugliest of Americans _ a
quick Polaroid of the world's richest nation beating up on an
impoverished, war-torn African country _ it also gave Coimbra a
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he made me famous in some places,'' Coimbra said. ``In
1996 when I come to Atlanta, many members of the press are waiting
for me at the airport to talk about this. And they ask me, `If he
do it again, what do you do?'
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction was, `I don't have the muscles to fight with
him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Noticing the temperament of the 2000 U.S. team, Coimbra said he
does not believe sportsmanship is improving in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch Alonzo Mourning, and he poses over the player from
China, like he wants to fight,'' Coimbra said of a scene from last
week's preliminary round. ``The first Dream Team and the second
Dream Team, I think, the players were more wholesome and more
personality. The new players are young players, and I think they
come from _ what can I say? _ not arrogance, but they want to put
you in your place in international basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Coimbra and the Angolans will not qualify for the medal round.
They play their final preliminary game Monday against Russia and
will most likely fall to 0-5. They won two games in Barcelona, one
in Atlanta. In life and basketball, not much has changed in Angola
since 1992. Not much has changed in 25 years, when the fighting
began.
</P>
<P>
   A civil war still depressingly hangs over the African nation.
The capital of Luanda is relatively unscathed by the conflict,
though every Angolan is affected in some way.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Palma, the coach of the Angolan team, described how
difficult it is to put together an Olympic squad. Only two of their
12 players come from the southern part of the country, where the
conflict is most intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know the conditions we have over there,'' Palma said of
the southern region, ``you cannot believe we make the Olympic
Games.''
</P>
<P>
   After the conflict began, Palma explained, many of the best
teachers _ including the ones who taught physical education _ moved
to safer areas of the country or to other towns on the African
coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't teach physical education anymore at schools,'' said
Arlindo Macedo de Oliveira, a journalist from Angola covering the
Olympics. ``Now we have a problem: Some teen-agers are good
athletes, but sometimes they don't know how to run, how to jump,
because they have no physical education.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war began, he said, many of the country's gymnasiums
were converted into ammunition depots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of street basketball,'' Palma said. ``And some
of the so-called gyms are really outside, with a roof hanging over.
No air conditioning. You play outside in 95 degrees. And the
surface is not like wood surface. It is made up of other fibers.
Some players cannot stop on the floor when they go fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Luanda has one large, well-lit gymnasium and three smaller gyms.
``Only six teams play, so it's very difficult to get good players
and the tallest players,'' Coimbra said. ``Many of the players here
just started playing two years ago. It is very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the conditions, Angola still has the best basketball
team in Africa. The squad is not very tall, with the 6-foot-7
Coimbra one of the exceptions. To compensate for their lack of
height, the Angolans play like the ultimate church-league team,
constantly lofting 3-pointers and running the break.
</P>
<P>
   To make up the national team, seven players were taken from one
of three professional club teams in Angola and five more were taken
from the remaining two teams. A professional player in Angola
receives between $100 and $200 U.S. dollars per month. ``They give
you pocket money when you first start, and if you are good, you can
win a car or maybe get an apartment,'' de Oliveira said.
``Sometimes they will give a player a home or a motorcycle or a
well-heeled relative of the team will support the player.''
</P>
<P>
   Coimbra, who will be 36 in 2004, is unsure if he will compete at
his fourth Olympics in Athens. He is a gentle, soft-spoken man,
privileged to have had an opportunity to represent his country
three times in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is someday we can have many players that are more
than 2 meters tall, like other countries,'' he said, referring to
6-foot 7-inch players. ``Also, to play close games against the good
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not play extensive minutes anymore. Often, Coimbra said,
he answers more questions about Barkley than his playing ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when I'm at home, and I watch the NBA, I remember
that,'' he said. ``I just start laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in retirement, he added, Barkley remains one of his
favorite players. ``I love the way he fights on the court. He has a
soul.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's not my favorite anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   No?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Coimbra said. ``Scottie Pippen. He is now my favorite.''

AMERICAN DIVER UPSETS CHINESE TO WIN GOLD IN 10-METER PLATFORM

<P>
   SYDNEY _ Six months ago, the platform diver Laura Wilkinson
broke three toes on her right foot while training. With Olympic
trials looming, she figured her dreams of Sydney fractured as well
that day.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday Wilkinson roared from fifth place to capture the
women's 10-meter platform gold, the first American to win the event
since 1964. She faced down her own fears _ an inward 2{ somersault
that has spooked her _ and a formidable pair of Chinese divers who
were expected to top the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson, a 22-year-old Texan, finished 1.74 points ahead of
the favorite, Li Na, who ended up with silver. Anne Montminy, a
Canadian, won the bronze medal, edging out Li's diving partner,
Sang Xue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of trials and tribulations to get here,'' said
Wilkinson, recounting the painful weeks of rehabilitation that
followed her injury. ``The day I broke my foot, I thought my dreams
were over. But God works in mysterious ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by her coach, Ken Armstrong, Wilkinson embarked on a
brutal training regime that included standing in a cast for six
hours a day on top of the platform to practice her push-offs. As
soon as the cast was removed, Wilkinson began practicing dives
underwater, to avoid putting pressure on her foot.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Armstrong said Wilkinson demonstrated a stoicism
and determination that confounded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is so mellow and so in control of her feelings,''
Armstrong said. ``I have never seen her rattled.''
</P>
<P>
   Those traits were on display Sunday, as Wilkinson battled back
from a 60-point deficit after the semifinals. The turning point
came in the third dive of the final round, a reverse 2{ somersault,
which Wilkinson performed perfectly, entering the water
knife-straight with barely a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old Li, by contrast, struggled on her third dive,
after having given a diving clinic for most of the competition.
Sang fell apart completely on an inward 3{ somersault, dropping out
of medal contention. Also hurt in that round were Montminy, who had
briefly challenged Li for the top spot, and her Canadian teammate,
Emilie Heymans.
</P>
<P>
   But while Wilkinson's third dive was one of her strongest, the
fourth dive had plagued her in previous rounds. It puts pressure on
the bones in her foot that were broken. And she had not been able
to banish fears of hitting her head on the concrete tower on this
particular dive; in earlier rounds, Wilkinson had twice bungled it.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wilkinson walked to the ladder, Armstrong took her aside
and urged her to dive for her friend and teammate Hilary Grivich,
who was killed in a car accident in 1998. He had never invoked
Grivich's name before.
</P>
<P>
   ``She needed a boost,'' Armstrong said. ``That's a tough dive.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson said she was caught totally off guard. But she said
the comment cleared her head and inspired her to nail the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson's improbable victory was a devastating defeat for the
Chinese, which have built a dynasty in women's diving in the last
decade. Li made few excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I feel very regretful that I didn't win the gold
medal,'' she said. ``I didn't dive well. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both Li and Sang, 15, dove impeccably until halfway
through the final round. The judges scored their dives consistently
above 8.5 during the preliminary round and the semifinal. Even Li's
last effort, a forward 3{ somersault, showed her trademark style,
barely rippling the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, Wilkinson also nailed her final dive, a back 2{
somersault with a half twist, making it impossible for Li to catch
her.
</P>
<P>
   Li's defeat may raise questions about the Chinese team's
decision to shift its champion diver, Fu Mingxia, who won a gold
medal in the 10-meter competition in 1992, from the platform to the
springboard.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her regret, Li said she was looking ahead to the women's
synchronized diving competition, in which she will compete with
Sang. Based on their performance Sunday, the two must be considered
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson faces a trip home to The Woodlands, Texas, and the
prospect of having the bones in her foot rebroken to set them
properly. For all that, Armstrong said, she had never complained
about her injury.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said the seeds of Wilkinson's heroics may have been
planted by the injury. After she won a gold medal in the 1998
Goodwill Games in New York, Armstrong said her intensity ebbed
somewhat. But after the injury, Wilkinson found new reserves of
grit that Armstrong had not seen before.
</P>
<P>
   The coach did his part. He recalled waking her up at 6 a.m. the
morning after her injury to tell her that she was not going to
quit, that she would make the Olympic team. After rubbing her eyes,
Wilkinson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, our goal was not just to make the Olympic team, but
to win a medal, and not just a medal, but a gold one,'' she said
serenely.

</P>
<P>
   ``She needed a boost,'' Armstrong said. ``That's a tough dive.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson said she was caught totally off guard. But she said
the comment cleared her head and inspired her to nail the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson's improbable victory was a devastating defeat for the
Chinese, which have built a dynasty in women's diving in the last
decade. Li made few excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I feel very regretful that I didn't win the gold
medal,'' she said. ``I didn't dive well. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both Li and Sang, 15, dove impeccably until halfway
through the final round. The judges scored their dives consistently
above 8.5 during the preliminary round and the semifinal. Even Li's
last effort, a forward 3{ somersault, showed her trademark style,
barely rippling the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, Wilkinson also nailed her final dive, a back 2{
somersault with a half twist, making it impossible for Li to catch
her.
</P>
<P>
   Li's defeat may raise questions about the Chinese team's
decision to shift its champion diver, Fu Mingxia, who won a gold
medal in the 10-meter competition in 1992, from the platform to the
springboard.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her regret, Li said she was looking ahead to the women's
synchronized diving competition, in which she will compete with
Sang. Based on their performance Sunday, the two must be considered
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson faces a trip home to The Woodlands, Texas, and the
prospect of having the bones in her foot rebroken to set them
properly. For all that, Armstrong said, she had never complained
about her injury.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said the seeds of Wilkinson's heroics may have been
planted by the injury. After she won a gold medal in the 1998
Goodwill Games in New York, Armstrong said her intensity ebbed
somewhat. But after the injury, Wilkinson found new reserves of
grit that Armstrong had not seen before.
</P>
<P>
   The coach did his part. He recalled waking her up at 6 a.m. the
morning after her injury to tell her that she was not going to
quit, that she would make the Olympic team. After rubbing her eyes,
Wilkinson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, our goal was not just to make the Olympic team, but
to win a medal, and not just a medal, but a gold one,'' she said
serenely.

KHORKINA FINDS REDEMPTION WITH GOLD MEDAL IN UNEVEN BARS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The dramatic pause before the final score
was posted lasted long enough for Svetlana Khorkina to launch into
a plea-bargaining session with her demons.
</P>
<P>
   She clamped her eyes shut, clenched her fists as tight as paper
wads and whispered under her breath: Please, no more heartbreak. An
instant later, as the impressive Ling Jie's score of 9.837 glowed
on the overhead screen, Khorkina's naturally sullen exterior melted
away.
</P>
<P>
   Joy moved in. With tiny puddles in her eyes, the willowy Russian
floated over to the uneven bars and kissed them like an old friend.
By the smallest of margins, by the miniscule hop on Ling's
dismount, Khorkina's 9.862 in her signature event was enough to
give her a gold medal in Sunday's Olympic apparatus finals at the
Super Dome. It also provided her with an ounce of redemption after
an error by the technical staff ruined her chance at the
prestigious all-around title on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That night, after springing into her vault, and abruptly
crashing like a bird flying into a window pane, the diva of
gymnastics was too emotionally distraught to hit her next routine,
the uneven bars. One event later, she was told the vault block had
been mistakenly set two inches below standard height. In an array
of reactions, Khorkina cried, screamed and eventually exited the
arena in a huff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't get over the disappointment, I wouldn't be
Khorkina,'' she said through an interpreter Sunday. ``I wouldn't be
standing here with the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hurts a lot. It was cruel to all the participants, to
vault on a nonstandard height. It's quite possible to get killed.
The five centimeters could decide the future of a sports person.
But I was fortunate to have many people to help me get through
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Khorkina found comfort from the dozens of flower arrangements
sent to the Olympic Village by fans, was delighted by a visit with
her little sister just before Sunday's competition and enjoyed a
mind-cleansing afternoon in the city on Friday. Surrounded by
friends, she visited the Sydney Aquarium, went to a salon for a
manicure and had her cropped blonde hair sheered away.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, in her innocent pageboy haircut, with the long-awaited
smile that appeared Sunday, the hard edge to the Khorkina persona
softened. Fitting the spirit of her makeover, Khorkina was giving
to the Russian teammates who often appear to be her wait staff.
Sunday, she handed over a chance to grab a gold medal to Elena
Zamolodtchikova.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier last week, long before the debacle Thursday, Khorkina
qualified to compete in the vault apparatus final. But an hour
before Sunday's competition, Khorkina, haunted by her last
experience and feeling soreness in her knee, decided to bow out of
the vault final. She handed over her spot to the Russian next in
line, Zamolodtchikova.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she could win the gold,'' Khorkina said. ``I'm glad
I could give her that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Zamolodtchikova embraced the moment. On little notice, she
gathered her focus and came through with a 9.731 to grab the gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So happy,'' she said. ``Just so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a satisfying day for the Russians, who finished with
consolation medals in the team finals. Beyond the success of
Khorkina and Zamolodtchikova, Alexie Nemov picked up a sliver in
the floor exercise and a bronze on the pommel horse, adding to the
all-around gold medal he won on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Nemov on the medal stands, Igors Vihrovs, of Latvia, won
the gold in the floor exercise and Romania's Marius Urzica took the
gold on the pommel horse. Flaunting his strength on the still
rings, Hungary's Szilveszter Csollany leaped in delight after a
9.850 gave him the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still cannot comprehend how beautiful this day is,''
Csollany said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians were the captivating figures. Even as a
runner-up, the personable Nemov played to the crowd, throwing his
medal-ceremony bouquet into the seats. A half hour later, Khorkina
followed his lead, tossing her flowers with even more vigor. As she
exited the arena, she winked at the fans, blew them kisses and left
a different impression of herself. Beneath her famed petulance,
Khorkina knew how to express her lighter side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow, I will dance for Russia,'' said Khorkina, referring
to the women's floor exercise, which is scheduled for part two of
the apparatus finals on Sunday. ``I will leave what happened on the
vault far behind me, like the North Pole.''  &QL;

Service for AMs of Monday, Sept. 25:
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   (Coded i)
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-BOMB-ARRESTS (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ The Indonesian
police said Sunday that they have arrested 25 people in connection
with a recent series of bombings in Jakarta, including one that
killed 15 people at the stock exchange. The police said that the
suspects have admitted to the bombings and indicated that their
next target was the American Embassy. By Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   ZAMBIA-POLITICS (Luanshya, Zambia) _ This struggling town in the
country's Copperbelt has suffered more than most at the hands of
copper's cascading fortunes and government's lamentable efforts to
manage the nation's most precious natural resource. So it is hardly
happenstance that the politicking that will likely frame the
campaign for presidential elections next year is centering on this
eroded expanse of industrial promise. By Henri E. Cauvin.
</P>
<P>
   IMF-MEETING (Prague, Czech Republic) _ Developments of the day
at the prelude to the IMF and World Bank meetings. By Joseph Kahn
and Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-ELECTION (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ The presidential election
in Yugoslavia. By Steven Erlanger.

the U.S. ambassador to Israel, which has sent a chill over a lot of
diplomats. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   PERU-SPYCHIEF (Lima, Peru) _ The disgraced spy chief who touched
off Peru's political crisis has fled the country in a private jet.
By Larry Rohter.
</P>

the presidential term in France from seven years to five. By
Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   SWISS-REFERENDUM (Geneva) _ Switzerland vote on whether to limit
immigration, a proposal embarrassing to the government in a country
that has seen itself as open but has become less welcoming to
foreigners. By Elizabeth Olson.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   (Coded a)
</P>
<P>
   OIL-RESERVES (Undated) _ Gauging people's reaction to the
Clinton/Gore fuel solution.
</P>
<P>
   ARK-WHITEWATER (Little Rock, Ark.) _ Now that Whitewater has
been put to rest by the independent counsel, what are folks in
Little Rock saying about the damage the investigation did to their
town and how do they see Bill Clinton in his last months as
president. By Rick Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   DECATUR-FIRESTONE (Decatur, Ill.) _ For residents here, no news
would definitely be good news. Six years ago, they had their first
encounter with the national news media when workers at the city's
three biggest employers went on strike. A year later, the Archer
Daniels Midland Co. got caught up in a global price-fixing scandal.
Now the national spotlight has turned to the city's
Bridgestone/Firestone plant, which produced the bulk of the faulty
tires blamed for more than 100 deaths and about 400 injuries.
People here call their city of 89,000 residents the Pride of the
Prairie. Still, all the bad news can be a bit demoralizing. By
David Barboza.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   (Coded w)
</P>
<P>
   SWAMPFOX-PROFILE (Washington) _ W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, who
stands to inherit control of the influential Commerce Committee if
Republicans retain control of the House, negotiates the murky
waters where Washington meets corporate America with a shrewdness
that has earned him the nickname ``Swamp Fox.'' The lawmaker, who
recently seized the national spotlight by holding hearings into
Firestone tires, admits he is ``a mix'' of contradictions. By
Christopher Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   (Coded p)
</P>
<P>
   WIS-SWING-VOTERS (Green Bay, Wis.) _ After almost 14 years in
office, Tommy Thompson bestrides Wisconsin politics like a
colossus. But he has never managed to carry his state for his
party's presidential nominee. But this time, the governor recently
proclaimed, ``I'm not worried.'' If not, he's the only politician
in Wisconsin who isn't. The race between Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas and Vice President Al Gore is breathlessly close here, in the
estimation of political pros in both parties. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>

   CLINTON-FUNDS (Dateline TK) _ President Clinton is going about
raising hundreds of thousands of dollars very quietly, in intimate
dinners and other private gatherings. By Marc Lacey.

   (Coded e)
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-SHOCKERS (London) _ It is far from proven that
newspapers sell art, but art certainly seems to sell newspapers in
Britain these days. At least that must be one explanation for the
enormous space given to London's contemporary art scene by the
British press. Newspapers no longer cover major art shows as
cultural events, but as news stories, while the media's devotion to
the celebrity cult routinely turns YBAs _ as young British artists
are now known here _ into showbiz stars. A look at why the Royal
Academy's new `sensation' show by YBAs is the talk of London. By
Alan Riding.

   OBIT-ELLIOTT (Undated) _ James Elliott, an innovative museum
director and curator and an amateur filmmaker, died Thursday at his

congestive heart failure, said his family. By Roberta Smith.
</P>
<P>
   MAXWELL-INTERVIEW (New York) _ An interview with Richard
Maxwell, the writer-director of ``Boxing 2000.'' His dialogue
resembles nothing you've heard before in the theater, except
perhaps a Pinter play. It sounds like a conversation overheard on a
street corner, bus, or public basketball court. And that, says
Richard Maxwell, who wrote and directed ``Boxing 2000'', which
opened last week on the Lower East Side, is exactly the point. He
wants his characters to sound like real people, not like actors
trying to sound like real people. By Robin Pogrebin.

</P>
<P>
   AIG-GREENBERG (Undated) _ Evan Greenberg, who until his
resignation last week had been in line to take charge of American
International Group, the powerful insurance company led by his
father, Maurice R. Greenberg, is not rushing to find a new job. But
when he decides to make a move, several executive headhunters said

</P>
<P>
   ORBITZ-WOES (Undated) _ Orbitz, the future online travel agency
funded with $50 million from five of the nation's largest airlines,
seems to have suffered the same problem that's plagued some of its

this month as planned, Orbitz officials found themselves

   NEW-ECON-COLUMN (Undated) _ The New Economy column: Dozens of
e-commerce portals are starting in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin
America, betting on the democratizing power of the Internet to
break down the traditional information and trade barriers that
confine most small companies in the region to doing business within
30 miles of home. But revolution doesn't happen in a day _ not when
there are so many technical bugs to be worked out. By Jennifer L.
Rich.
</P>
<P>
   ECOMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) _ The E-Commerce column: Among the
more popular recipes for e-commerce success is a mix of content,
commerce and community features. But sites have been blindsided by
the high cost of content _ whether they're producing it in-house,
buying pieces of content from a handful of partner sites, or both.
More recently, sites are turning to a new breed of Internet
businesses, online content syndicators, to manage the buying and
selling of everything from video and audio clips to feature
stories. By Bob Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ The Advertising column: The
firestorm last week over a Nike commercial during the Summer
Olympics, in which a female runner escapes a masked madman wielding
a chainsaw, has reignited a debate about images of women in
advertising. The spot, intended as a spoof of so-called slasher
movies, was widely castigated as making light of violence toward

Geffen, the entertainment industry braced for a new-style media
company. But so far, the Dreamworks moguls have demonstrated that
they are very good only at Hollywood's oldest profession: making

 &HT;    Bearing a resemblence to humans
 &HT;    By Gary Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Humans and bears look at one another,
and in some ways see themselves looking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching them explore their environments, we recognize a
consciousness somewhat like our own,'' wrote Paul Shepard and Barry
Sanders in ``The Sacred Paw: The bear in nature, myth and
literature.'' ``We have the uncanny feeling that beneath the fur is
a man. Skinned, the corpse of a bear is very much like that of a
human.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparent kinship between humans and ursines begins early,
said Tom Beck, the top bear researcher with the Colorado Division
of Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Bear cubs are all curiosity and rambunctiousness, much like
human youngsters, said Beck.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they age, bears seem never to grow up, say Shepard
and Sanders, summing up the similarity among mammals with the
description of the bear as ``a taciturn, churlish, hirsute little
kid weighing 200 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Physically, bears and humans are omnivores with digestive
systems that are similar, Beck said. They have digital dexterity
rivaling that of humans, yet with far greater strength, wrote
Shepard and Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Bears are known for their preference of solitude, but they
aren't without social skills, Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they transmit and process information at a high rate,
particularly with their noses, Beck said. Humans, said Shepard and
Sanders, might not understand the process but they envy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet it is clear from the path he takes, the adjustments in his
behavior and demeanor and the assertiveness of his feeding that he
is aware of every bear around him,'' the pair wrote in ``The Sacred
Paw.'' ``This combination of overall awareness and seeming
nonchalance is among the bear's most manlike capacities: a
taciturn, calculating mixture of knowing and blase sophistication
that can be unnerving to human observers.''
</P>
<P>
   The bonds between bear and man are social as well as
instinctive, said Dr. Bob Sammons, a Grand Junction psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us grew up with the Teddy Bear,'' said Sammons. Boys
had no dolls, but they had stuffed bears.
</P>
<P>
   The aura of innocence surrounding bears is reinforced by the
fact that so many people today know so little about them, Sammons
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society has been protected from bears,'' he said. ``We
have not had to fear them.''
</P>
<P>
   Smokey Bear and cartoon characters such as Yogi go even farther
to reinforce the early associations with bears as creatures of
innocence, comfort, even camaraderie, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bears pose a morbid fascination for humans, as well, said Beck.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can they kill humans, they also will eat them, a most
disturbing notion for the top of the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   And bears, what do they see when looking back at their fellow
omnivores?
</P>
<P>
   Beck's best guess: ``Maybe a funny-looking bear.''

 &HT;    Do yourself and bears a favor, don't feed them
 &HT;    By Ted Taylor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Consider the bears of western Colorado
the Cosmo Kramer's of the wildlife community.
</P>
<P>
   They mean no harm, but feed them once, and just like Jerry
Seinfeld's wacky next-door neighbor, they'll keep coming back for
more _ whether you like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Colorado Division of Wildlife officials say, is not
feeding them in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``When bears that end up feeding off garbage or if people feed
the bears intentionally, that bear probably ends up causing more
conflicts with people,'' said John Ellenberger, the big game
manager in the DOW's Grand Junction office.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation of wanting to provide a decent meal to a hungry
bear that's wandered down into the city from the Bookcliffs might
seem harmless, but wildlife officials say that's the best way to
assure that a bear will be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's involved in conflict with humans a second time, we
have to destroy the bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is that you don't want to habituate bears to
receiving handouts of food via garbage or leaving pet food dishes
outside,'' Ellenberger said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecue grills should be placed inside. Even full hummingbird
feeders are an attraction to a hungry bear, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But usually they only resort to bird feeders after they've
explored everything else,'' he said. ``You can prevent a lot of
problems by making sure you're not providing food to them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the bears have kept to themselves and a peach
tree or two during their visits from the hills into the city.
</P>
<P>
   One bear recently was spotted near a local elementary school,
but Ellenberger said it was an isolated incident and that DOW
officials have not spoken with School District 51 officials about
dealing with such situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation where he ended up near a school was
happenstance,'' Ellenberger said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters have reported seeing more bears than normal in lower
elevations.
</P>
<P>
   On the trails and in the woods, Ellenberger said people need to
remain calm and assess the situation before reacting irrationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally it will be a mutual freak out,'' he said. ``Don't
turn around and run because if the bear wants to catch you, he
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellenberger said people should try to make themselves look as
large as they can and talk to the bear in a low, soothing voice
while slowly backing away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually the bear is just holding his ground,'' he said. ``He's
going to let you back out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the city, the bear has become a furry pinball of sorts,
Ellenberger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pushed from place to place and as he starts moving,
people start honking, wanting to take pictures,'' Ellenberger said.
``It's like a comedy of errors. All the bear is doing is trying to
find a place where he can get food, shelter and quiet.''

 &HT;    $ticker shock in store for Rodeo Drive visitor
 &HT;    By D.L. Stewart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ It's a nice little lightweight suede
jacket, and I'm thinking it might be just right for wearing to
Dragons games in the evening or for raking leaves in the fall, so I
ask the sales guy at Georgio Armani how much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-nine ninety-five,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's reduced 40 percent,'' he says. ``So the actual price
would be two thousand, three hundred and ninety-seven dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Shopping on Rodeo Drive is not for people with champagne tastes
and Bud Lite budgets. It is the place where the truly wealthy come
to buy, while the rest of us window-shop and wonder how the decimal
points got so far to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising itself as ``the most famous shopping street in the
world,'' the fantasy world that is Rodeo Drive actually is three
blocks of shops, restaurants and people who are sincerely having
trouble deciding between $1,445 Chanel purses or $1,800 Sulka
suits. So they buy a couple of each.
</P>
<P>
   At the epicenter of extravagance is 2 Rodeo, an outdoor mall
that looks exactly like an Italian piazza would look if Italians
scrubbed their piazzas every 15 minutes. The shops lining the
cobblestoned Via Rodeo include Cartier, Tiffany, Gianni Versace and
Christian Dior, although there is a Cole-Haan thrown in so the
rabble will have some place to amuse themselves.
</P>
<P>
   2 Rodeo even comes with its own frock-coated, top-hatted,
white-gloved greeter.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Donovan claims he can say ``hello'' in 30 languages,
although the only two he really needs are English and Japanese. He
estimates that 50 percent of the visitors at 2 Rodeo are Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan's job is to make people feel welcome, even if they're
not famous, and there's a chance that they might even be poor. He's
part of an effort to combat the ``Pretty Woman Syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a day where a billion-dollar-a-year executive might
wear jeans and a street sweeper, a tux,'' notes Tom Korey,
president of the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   True to his mission, Donovan is affable and generous with his
time, guiding us to shops and chatting about famous people he has
met.
</P>
<P>
   ``This job is like being at the United Nations and the Oscars,''
says Donovan, who has way more personality than the average person
needs. ``I meet more celebrities in a day than David Letterman and
Jay Leno meet in a week.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he mentions that he had a role in helping
Jennifer Lopez find that dress she wore to the Grammys last spring,
and then he took her and Puff Daddy to Sulka for more shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I introduced them as Ms. Lopez and Mr. Daddy,'' Donovan
recalls. ``He thought that was very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan probably has a million more stories like that. But
before he can finish telling us about how he led a campaign to
procure knighthood for Bob Hope, he spots actor Lou Diamond
Phillips trying to get a restaurant reservation, and he drops us
like a hot credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Left to our own devices, we stop at the Piazza Rodeo, where we
land a table a few seats away from Ben Stein, the guy who lets
people win his money. It's a perfect place to snack on grilled
polenta Napoleon and watch the parade of tourists, celebrities,
tourists looking for celebrities, celebrities avoiding tourists and
camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 12 million people a year pass through the
intersection of Rodeo Drive and Wilshire Boulevard. It is not known
how many of those 12 million actually buy any of the merchandise
offered by the likes of Gianfranco Ferre, Gianni Versace, Pierre
Deux or Salvatore Ferragamo. Not only can't the average shopper
afford them, many can't pronounce them.
</P>
<P>
   When stars such as Whitney Houston, Lisa Kudrow, Farrah Fawcett
and Elizabeth Taylor need to take a little off the top, for
instance, they are likely to call on Jose Eber's at 224 N. Rodeo
Drive. While those of us who are linguistically challenged might
pronounce the name ``HoZAY Aye-Bear,'' those who live in the world
of Gucci know it's pronounced ``JoZAY.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you pronounce it, you hair is not the only thing
that can get clipped there.
</P>
<P>
   When we stop in, a receptionist whose own hair looks as if it
was styled by Jose Cuisinart informs us that a pre-cut consultation
with JoZAY would cost $175. Then, if all parties are agreeable, the
actual haircut would be another $300. However, JoZAY is booked
solid for the next three weeks and could not possibly see my wife's
follicles before we are scheduled to leave town.
</P>
<P>
   As disappointing as this is to me, it's nothing compared with
the letdown when we walk across the street to Ginza Sushiko. Until
recently, the five-star sushi joint was known as the most expensive
restaurant in America, with dinner for two averaging $500. But a
few weeks ago it lost its title to a French restaurant in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, chef Masa Takayama accepts only nine reservations
a night for dinner, the restaurant is solidly booked and it does
not offer early-bird specials or takeout.
</P>
<P>
   Denied the opportunity to spend hundreds of dollars on urchins,
fugu and other fish bait, we leave 2 Rodeo, cross Dayton Way and
stroll along the actual Rodeo Drive. We pass Moschino, where they
sell ``cheap chic'' clothes, play annoying music and proclaim ``if
you can't be elegant, at least be extravagant.'' We browse in Louis
Vuitton, Gucci, Hermes and Cartier. We stop, finally, at a men's
clothing store called Bijan.
</P>
<P>
   The writing on the window proclaims that Bijan is ``A salute to
the timeless taste, style and power of men!'' and cites the
tasteful, stylish and powerful men who have shopped there. The list
is top-heavy with princes and guys named ``Al Saud'' but also
mentions commoners such as Robert Redford, Jack Lemmon, Aaron
Spelling, Bill Clinton and Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   A sign on the door says, ``By appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   ````Did you remember to make an appointment for me?'' I ask my
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you made the appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Having blown my chance to become tasteful, stylish and powerful
and get my name on a store window, we turn around and head back to
Wilshire Boulevard to drown our sorrows in the bar of the Regent
Beverly Wilshire Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The Beverly Wilshire is where Julia Roberts spent quality time
with Richard Gere in ``Pretty Woman.'' The lobby is smaller than it
appears in the movie. But the room rates are fairly sizeable. The
cheapest single runs $345 a night. Suites start at $750 a night and
do not end until they reach $7,500. All rates are subject to
California state sales tax and city room taxes. On the other hand,
you can't beat the location. Not only is it the heart of Rodeo
Drive, it's only a $96 chauffeured limousine or sedan ride to LAX.
</P>
<P>
   In the bar, my wife thinks it over before finally deciding on a
``Pretty Woman'' Cocktail (champagne, Cointreau and a splash of
cranberry juice, $10).
</P>
<P>
   But when Subash, the bartender, asks what I'm having, my answer
is automatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud Lite,'' I tell him.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'm worried about the size of the bill. But this is,
after all, Rodeo Drive.
</P>
<P>
   And you never know where the decimal point might wind up.

FATHER OF U.S. GYMNAST IN CRITICAL CONDITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The father of the American gymnast Jamie
Dantzscher remained in critical condition with head injuries in a
local hospital Sunday after surgery to relieve pressure on his
brain.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, John Dantzscher was riding in a cab with
his 21-year-old daughter, Jennifer, when the taxi collided with a
bus in downtown Sydney. Jennifer, one of Jamie's seven siblings,
was released from the hospital Sunday. John Dantzscher is expected
to remain in the hospital one to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Tuesday, John and Jennifer Dantzscher were in the
front row at the Super Dome, sitting alongside the rest of the San
Dimas, Calif., family, leading the cheers for Jamie, who competed
for the United States, which finished fourth in the team final.

SPORTS COLUMN: U.S. CAN NOW GET A TASTE OF THE REAL OLYMPICS
</HEADLINE>
   (Sports of the Times) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia _ Welcome, Mia, Brandi and Julie, to the
Summer Olympics, or at least that part of it where Other Athletes
roam. Have a good time when you get to Sydney. Get some dinner with
a harbor view. Reacquaint yourselves with some of the people you
marched with in the opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Go see Marion Jones do her thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being outside of Sydney has been a blessing in disguise,''
said April Heinrichs, the U.S. women's soccer coach, following her
team's shaky 1-0 semifinal victory over Brazil. ``For us, the focus
has been on our team and keeping the distractions to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   That's great, when you're playing in some isolated outpost, or
even in Pasadena, in the finals of the World Cup. But these are the
Olympics, supposedly more than just another tournament. It's not
their fault, having been sent far away from the Olympic hub, just
as they were four years ago. But from the looks of Sunday's messy
yellow-card festival from which the referee had to flee the angry
Brazilians, all these women would be wise to lobby for a prime
in-town location and a more contextual experience four years from
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, we're spoiled again,'' Tiffeny Milbrett said, upon
learning the Americans would not be bunking in the athletes'
village upon their arrival in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone tempted to make a Dream Team case out of this shouldn't
bother. After two weeks in various soccer outposts, it would be
unfair to expect the Americans to plop themselves in the middle of
the village so close to Thursday's gold medal game against Norway,
which edged Germany Sunday. Those teams were already in Sydney, as
opposed to the higher elevation of this Australian capital, where
the weather was raw and the reception from the local fans was cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Americans, Australians always root for the underdog,''
Heinrichs said.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of it, but it's also become increasingly clear that
the Aussies don't relate to the Americans' belief that they are
typically supposed to win. From swimming to softball to soccer,
among other popular venues, the sense here has been that Americans
failing is almost as appealing as Australians winning.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that Mia Hamm scored the only goal Sunday after
the Brazilian goalie, Andreia, fell in a collision with Milbrett,
who merely jumped for a ball headed in front of the net by Lorrie
Fair. Then the United States really irked the Aussie fans with
their ``four corners'' offense in the games' closing minutes. The
stall worked, but the fans reacted as if the World Cup and
defending gold medalists from Atlanta _ actually, from Athens, Ga.
_ should have been above such a tactic.
</P>
<P>
   It was another example of legend obscuring reality, as if the
previous Olympics and the World Cup were won without significant
challenge, without close calls that would have killed many a
magazine cover, not to mention a run on a certain brand of sports
bra. Heinrichs knows all too well that against the handful of top
teams, ``it's a matter of inches, out of your control.''
</P>
<P>
   But because of how this particular team has been hyped and what
it has come to represent _ ``every young girl who signed up to
play,'' said Brandi Chastain _ its collective and individual
performances must now get critiqued, as if the outcome of a game is
based on technical merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't our best soccer today,'' Heinrichs finally
admitted, after conducting an impromptu team meeting on the field
to remind her players that, at this stage of the game, success is
whatever gets you to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were outplayed, and not by a little, but the
Brazilians insisted on playing Hamm physically, knocking her down
four times, three of which earned yellow cards. Why a finesse team
that had ball-handling advantages all over the field would want to
arouse a more physical opponent by targeting its star is a mystery.
For its troubles, Brazil saw the only goal score as a result of a
foul against Hamm in the 60th minute, while one of its best
players, Katia, wound up carried off on a stretcher after pulling
up lame as the game began to devolve.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, after slogging around ineffectually,
Chastain set up the goal with her well-placed free kick, and Hamm
was in the right place to left-foot the ball across the goal-mouth
and into the right corner. Maybe all the United States has left on
these other teams _ particularly Brazil _ is the ability to adapt
to game conditions, make the big play, such as the lunging hand
save Siri Mullinix came up with on a close-in, right-angle shot by
Brazil's Roselli, point-blank range, in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those balls you react to on instinct, like the
penalty kicks the U.S. men played, when they won their quarterfinal
for their own trip to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The women were awaiting a score from that game Saturday night,
when word came of the shootout. Soon a call was made, and they were
huddled around a cell phone, receiving play-by-play, live.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinix, who wasn't in Atlanta or Pasadena, said she wished she
could have seen it as well. In Sydney, at the real Olympics, she
will.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslie and Yolanda
Griffith combined for 46 points and 25 rebounds Sunday night as the
United States finished unbeaten in Olympic women's basketball
preliminary play with a 76-57 victory over Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Team USA moved to 5-0 in Group B, setting itself up for the
easiest draw in the eight-team medal round which begins at the
Super Dome in Olympic Park on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States meets Slovakia in a quarterfinal game. In the
other game on their side of the bracket, France faces South Korea,
with the winner almost certain to meet Team USA in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Australia increased its chances of meeting the Americans in the
gold medal game by holding off France, 69-62, to finish 5-0 in
Group A. Sandy Brondello scored 18 points and Lauren Jackson added
17 for the Opals, who will meet Poland in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   In what will probably be the most competitive quarterfinal
match, Brazil will meet Russia, with the winner most likely
matching up against Australia in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   By finishing unbeaten, the Americans escaped any possibility of
having to face the teams considered their biggest threats _
Australia, Russia and Brazil _ before the gold medal match.
</P>
<P>
   The United States did not make any friends against Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie grabbed an offensive rebound early in the second half and
cleared space with her elbow. The move sent Poland's Edyta Koryzna
sprawling backward to the floor, apparently knocking the wind out
of her. Koryzna was carried off the floor and later taken out of
the arena in a wheelchair. She was taken to the hospital for X-rays
to determine if she had any internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Although television replays seemed to show that the contact was
unintentional, Leslie and Team USA were showered with boos
throughout much of the second half. &QL;

MEDIA FASHION SITE FINDS GOSSIP IS A BIG DRAW 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cruise the chat forums on Style.com, a joint effort
from Vogue and W magazines, and you will get a taste for the gossip
that the fashion industry and its onlookers churn out with
particular gusto.
</P>
<P>
   A TV personality is a ``twit.'' Two party-prone heiresses are
``spoiled brats.'' One actress is ``a boozer.'' That married
magazine figure is cheating on his wife _ with an employee! A pair
of famous actors were caught having sex in Bliss, a spa favored by
the fashion set. That young actor favors ``speedballs,'' an
injected mixture of heroin and cocaine. And that style maven? She
is a closet lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   Vogue has long been known for its cool and distant elegance, as
well as for lively journalism by writers like Julia Reed and
Jeffrey Steingarten. But the Style.com chat rooms clearly show a
distinctly different side of the magazine's personality.
</P>
<P>
   The gossip forums have become a daily Internet stop for many
people in the fashion industry since they were introduced last
September. They are vicious. Protected by anonymity, senders are
free to sling as much mud as their slender arms can hurl. Last
Friday, the forums carried giddy missives exulting about the
reported death of a young actress and speculation that the secretly
gay husband of a well-known socialite married her for her wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, the gossip forums belonged solely to Vogue.com;
with the inception of Style.com last week, W magazine's name began
appearing on the site. Style.com incorporates fashion reporting
from Vogue and W and will eventually include material from other
titles owned by the Conde Nast and Fairchild units of Advance
Publications. It will also sell clothing through an arrangement
with Neiman Marcus. The gossip forums, of course, are a great way
to attract eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannette Walls, a gossip reporter for MSNBC and author of
``Dish: The Inside Story on the World of Gossip,'' said the
Style.com forums reflect the fashion world's sometimes cruel
penchant for gossip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, everybody in fashion loves to gossip, whether
they will admit it or not,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Walls noted that many of the items she read were ``the kind
of really nasty stuff that no one will talk about and no one will
publish, which makes it great for readers, but not great for
Vogue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not going to stand up and talk about this Web site at
a lunch for advertisers, I would guess,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many magazines sponsor chat rooms on their Web sites. Eight of
the 14 Hearst magazine Web sites have chat rooms, for example, but
they tend to focus on specific subjects, like investing (on the
Smart Money site) or the Boy-o-meter, where viewers are asked to
rate a boy's good looks (on the Cosmogirl site).
</P>
<P>
   ``I am such a Pollyanna when it comes to this stuff,'' said
Atoosa Rubenstein, editor in chief of Cosmogirl. ``We want to
create a really positive environment for girls.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rubenstein said she did not monitor the site to make sure no
one was posting anything offensive to Pollyannas like herself.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet service providers employ what is known in the
industry as ``T.O.S. police,'' or monitors who police the sites to
make sure that subscribers are following the service provider's
terms of service.
</P>
<P>
   Goli Sheikholeslami, Style.com managing director, said Style.com
is overseen by Conde Net, the Internet arm of Conde Nast, which
monitors all postings and removes any that are distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that is uncivilized, we make an effort to remove,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   So why did postings _ up on the site while Sheikholeslami spoke
to a reporter _ refer to several famous people, revealing their
drug or sexual habits in decidedly untasteful language?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not civilized,'' she said. ``We will make an effort to
better monitor the forums in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheikholeslami added: ``And there are several people going
through them as we speak, cleaning them up.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one thing to be said for the gossip forums: Even if the
missives are unfair, Conde Nast employees are treated as unfairly
as anyone else. On the forums, Conde Nast executives are the
targets of salacious morsels. Sheikholeslami said that Conde Nast
employees are not granted immunity from the gossip mill. ``The
standard is the same for everybody, whether you work at the company
or not,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Style.com viewers have complained about the meaner stuff.
One, using the name Young Socialite, wrote last month: ``This is
such a mean-spirited, cruel and stupid site. The people that are
written about are being abused because none of what is written is
true.'' Occasionally, even the subjects will respond to the
anonymous attacks. In August, Samantha Ronson, a disc jockey, said
she had finally decided to defend herself under her own name after
weeks of weathering gossip aimed at her.
</P>
<P>
   Is Conde Nast liable if someone posts a report that a former
``Beverly Hills 90210'' star is a drug addict? The
Telecommunication Act of 1996 essentially grants online services
immunity from prosecution over such matters, but some lawyers
believe that may be changing.
</P>
<P>
   Slade Metcalf, a lawyer in New York who specializes in media
law, said that viewers who post libelous gossip may, in fact,
become the subjects of lawsuits. More and more potential plaintiffs
are subpoenaing Internet service providers to learn the identities
of the anonymous people who make statements on Web sites or in
direct e-mails, Metcalf said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is to what extent Web site owners and Internet
service providers need to provide that information, and that is a
gray area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf added that there have been recent cases in which
potential plaintiffs have discovered the identities of people who
have posted offending statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those cases are the ones leveled by individuals or
corporations who are willing to spend the money to find out who the
people are who are placing offending statements about them on the
Internet,'' he said. ``It's a new area and those individuals who
thought they were going to be free of any liability because their
real names are not attached to the notices are going to find out
that is not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   David S. Korzenik, a lawyer who teaches media law at the
Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and who represented Spy magazine
for 10 years, said more such suits are being filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want to hold a Web site liable for the interaction on
it?'' he asked. ``I don't think we do. But the lawsuits are all
over the place. They are kind of ridiculous, but they are certainly
happening with greater frequency.''

OLYMPIAN WHINERS TO BLAME FOR LATE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So just how wussy are network executives?
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, all but NBC's demanded that the official
start of the fall TV season be delayed two weeks so they wouldn't
have to put their fall-season premieres up against the NBC telecast
of the Summer Olympics. The whining was so loud and constant, it
could be heard above the roar of their espresso machines.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption was that NBC would dominate the ratings, as
Olympic networks are wont to do, and that no one would notice the
new and returning shows on the other networks. To stop the whining,
the folks at Nielsen Media Research, the company that measures TV
viewership, decided it would be fairer to have the Olympic coverage
fall outside the fall season. Delaying the start of the fall
premieres, Nielsen reasoned, would level the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   But does it really? The new season officially begins next
Monday, with three new and seven returning series launching in a
blaze of promotional overstatement. From ``7th Heaven'' to ``Third
Watch,'' from ``Daddio'' to ``Deadline,'' the networks will be
filled with season premieres, making it tough for viewers to make
sense of it all. But the baseball playoffs also begin next week,
saddling NBC and Fox with a juggling act they must perform for most
of October. (Fox has the World Series, which will end Oct. 29 if it
goes seven games.) Is this really any fairer?
</P>
<P>
   To the networks that feared getting blown out of the water by an
Olympic juggernaut, it might be, because they can wipe their brows
and say, ``Whew, we dodged a bullet.'' But to viewers, whose
concerns generally don't come up for discussion when the network
suits are sitting in their planning meetings, it's foolish. Isn't
TV programming supposed to be about choice? Aren't the networks
supposed to be trying to get us to watch instead of surrendering to
the other guy?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes and no. In the summertime, when no one takes
ratings all that seriously because viewership plummets, the major
networks traditionally have gone on vacation and left us with
reruns. Pre-autumnal launches like ``Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire'' and ``Survivor'' have shown there's hay to be made
while the sun is shining. Fox and The WB also have had modest
success with summertime series. But the prevailing philosophy, one
that changes very slowly, seems to be that summer is when you
launch a weak show that never would have made the fall lineup in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   This philosophy _ that viewers don't matter in the summer _ is
precisely what the networks had in mind when they sought to delay
their fall launches. With the Olympics technically taking place
during the summer schedule, there was no pressure to put on
compelling counterprogramming, because the big advertisers pay
little attention to the summer ratings.
</P>
<P>
   And then the networks wonder why viewers are checking out what's
on cable.
</P>
<P>
   The question I get most often after another night of stultifying
Olympic coverage on NBC is: ``When is (fill in the blank with a
favorite show) premiering?'' Here's a blanket answer:
</P>

PERSONALIZED RINGS FOR CELL PHONES ARE LATEST CALLING CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WINDA BENEDETTI  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you want to stand out in the crowd. Well, forget piercing
your nose (too painful) or tattooing your bum (too permanent) or,
for that matter, dying your hair purple (too passe).
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to set yourself apart in this digital age,
you need a customized musical ringtone for your cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Why settle for that insipid bleeep-bleeeping sound when your
cell phone could brrrring to the tune of ``Burning Down the House''
by the Talking Heads? Nothing says ``I'm truly unique'' like a
phone that belts out ``Funkytown'' by Lipps Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Specialized ringtones are the latest fashion accessory for the
digital elite, a techno-trend that first swept cell phone-savvy
Europe and is now spreading among the mobile hipsters of the USA.
Myriad tuneful ringers can be ordered from myriad Web sites (most
notably www.yourmobile.com and www.voicestream.com) either for free
or for a few bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really helps people individualize themselves,'' enthuses
Ralph Simon, a music industry vet and chairman of the company that
owns YourMobile.com.
</P>
<P>
   Are you a rocker under those Dockers? Have your phone summon you
with ``Make Me Bad'' by Korn or ``Nothing Else Matters'' by
Metallica. Still living in the '80s? Set the tone with ``99
Luftballons'' by Nena or ``Keep on Loving You'' by REO Speedwagon.
</P>
<P>
   If you're feeling a little frisky set your ringer to James
Brown's ``Sex Machine.'' Or, if you want to irritate the living
bejesus out of everyone in earshot, the ``Macarena'' will do
nicely.
</P>
<P>
   One note of clarification: These ringtones do not sound like an
actual recording of the song, but instead are 8- to 10-second
excerpts of the song played in chirping MIDI format. And not every
cellular phone is capable of playing customized ringtones. It
depends on both the type of phone and the wireless service provider
used.
</P>
<P>
   Many Nokia, Ericsson and Siemens phones accept fancy ringtones.
For example, those who use Seattle-based VoiceStream Wireless on
their Nokia 6190 and 5190 phones can change their ringers. (Check
each ringtone site for a list of which phones and wireless services
work.)
</P>
<P>
   At www.voicestream.com, for instance, you can order two rings
(let's say ``Stairway to Heaven'' and ``Jumpin' Jack Flash'') for
$1.99. Simply go to the site, give them your telephone number and
credit card number, and the ring will be sent straight to your
cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a pretty popular feature, especially for groups that
have multiple phones that could possibly be ringing at the same
time in the same room,'' says Kim Thompson, VoiceStream
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Every cell-phone owner has experienced it: A phone rings in the
crowd, setting off a mad flurry of digging through purses and
rummaging through pockets as everyone rushes to see if they're the
lucky recipient of the call. Well, no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps them identify their ring and it also helps them to
personalize their phone a little bit more to fit their
personality,'' Thompson says.
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone, as it turns out, has become the modern palette
for personal expression.
</P>
<P>
   YourMobile.com, perhaps the best-known ringtone site, offers
more than 1,000 ringtones, all for free. The site, which began
offering the service back in May, has already gathered an
enthusiastic following, sending more than 18 million ringtones to
some 4 million mobile phones around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exceeded all of our wildest expectations,'' says Simon,
whose own cell phone jingle-jangles to the tune of ``Mambo No. 5.''
``Some people get three to six ringtones a week. They like to
change their ringtone every day. It's almost like changing their
earrings or their clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon says that YourMobile.com only offers songs that are in the
public domain or that his company has received permission to use
from the appropriate music publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   The use of pop songs as ringtones became a Napster-esque issue
back in August when EMI Music Publishing filed a $45 million
copyright infringement suit against Global Music One (the company
that owns YourMobile.com), accusing the company of offering songs
that it didn't have permission to use. Among the disputed ditties
were ``Imagine'' by John Lennon and ``Smells Like Teen Spirit'' by
Nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   The songs have since been removed from YourMobile.com, although
Simon denies any wrongdoing. He says YourMobile.com is working with
EMI to smooth things over. Meanwhile, EMI has announced a deal with
Nokia, which will begin offering ringtones to the tune of EMI songs
later this fall at their www.clubnokia.com site.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Maguire's ringtone du jour is ``Axel F'' (aka the ``Beverly
Hills Cop'' theme), but he's also dabbled with the ``Star Wars
Imperial Theme'' and a Fugees tune. As the resident cell phone
expert at Car Toys in downtown Seattle, he says specialized
ringtones are simply one of the many ways in which people are
making their phones stand out. ``Everyone wants to make their cell
phone different than everyone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   Trick out your phone with a fancy add-on faceplate (we suggest
the neon green or the one with bright yellow flowers). Wow friends
and acquaintances by exchanging your plain old antenna for one that
flashes every time someone calls. Replace the entire outer casing
of your phone with a see-through casing.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-core individualist can buy the Nokia Data Suite, a
program that allows would-be Mozarts to compose their own
ringtones.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the real ringtone breakthrough will come when someone
designs a tune that doesn't interrupt everyone in the middle of a
movie or, say, a nice restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   May we suggest a little ditty called ``Silence Is Golden''?

FALL FASHION, FROM A TO Z 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fall 2000 is a good time to re-write the ABCs of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   For too many years they've been centered around B for black, C
for clunky shoes and M (as in minimalism). But clothes are being
re-shaped and re-styled for the new millennium. With leather and
glamour heading the list, here's what makes getting dressed this
fall different and more interesting than years past.
</P>
<P>
   A  &QC;  Accessories. From earrings to belts, statement-making
necklaces to bracelets that bangle or cuff, it's time to adorn.
</P>
<P>
   B  &QC;  Blouses. Blouses with soft ties at the neckline and bias cut
shirts in vivid prints haven't been seen in years. Now they're
back. Too timid for a print? Try a solid color in a sumptuous shade
of red or purple.
</P>
<P>
   C  &QC;  Cashmere, Color and Camel. Luxurious fibers are key and
cashmere's at the top of the list for everything from sweaters to
coats. There's more colorful apparel to be found in stores,
especially in shades of red. But classic camel has emerged as one
of the most sought-after colors.
</P>
<P>
   D  &QC;  Dresses, Denim. Slim shirtdresses reminiscent of those made
popular by Halston in the 1970s, sheaths a la Audrey Hepburn, and
slinky jerseys make this an interesting category once again. These
dresses may have varied hemlines, but the shape is always
body-close. Denim pants are a given, but denim jackets are highly
desired. There's even a wool fabric around that looks like denim.
</P>
<P>
   E  &QC;  Elegant. It's a frequently used adjective, especially for
fur-trimmed suits and dresses, or for jeweled evening clothes.
</P>
<P>
   F  &QC;  Fabrics, Fibers, Furs. They have to be soft and luxurious,
or they don't count. They can come from chemicals or animals, but
they have to look and feel sumptuous. Neil Silverman, owner of
Bliss clothing store in Fremont, says faux fur is the rage this
season .
</P>
<P>
   G  &QC;  Gold, Glamour and Gloves. Gold is favored in jewelry. It's
also woven/painted on fabrics. Gloves are the finishing touch,
especially for suits. It all adds up to an understated glamour.
</P>
<P>
   H  &QC;  Hats, Hosiery, Handbags. All are back. Nordstrom's fall
preview featured fedoras. And oversized shoulder bags have been
shelved for smaller, nicely shaped handbags. Hosiery is colorful,
sheer black, or patterned all over.
</P>
<P>
   I  &QC;  Investment Dressing. When looking at price tags this fall,
it's a good term to keep in mind. These are not clothes to wear one
season and toss.
</P>
<P>
   J  &QC;  Jewelry. From the newest ``waterfall'' necklaces with
cascades of beads or chains, to classics like pearls, bangle
bracelets, gold cuffs and hoop earrings, jewelry has a fashion role
once again.
</P>
<P>
   K  &QC;  Kors. Designer Michael Kors. His collection inspired by
uptown New York socialites has become a style-setter for the
season. It's a chic, ladylike look based on a suit.
</P>
<P>
   L  &QC;  Leather. Leather is at the top of everyone's list. From
pants to bracelets, jackets to blouses, there's something available
in leather. At a recent fashion show presented by Mario's, leather
jackets or coats topped almost every costume. Lynwood Holmberg,
buyer for the store, says leather is just the right weight for this
region. It's also practical. It wipes clean and can handle drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Opposed to leather? Look for something called ``pleather.'' This
vinyl alternative can be found in exotic prints and solid colors,
but don't count on it being less expensive than leather. Prices
vary. Real or faux, leather is in first place for fall.
</P>
<P>
   M  &QC;  Maxi Coat. This floor-dusting greatcoat from the 1970s is
back. It can be leather, wool, cashmere or a blend of fibers. It
may be long, but it fits close to the body, and it's likely to be
belted for an even more shapely silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   N  &QC;  Narciso Rodrigues. Give this designer credit for giving
skirts with shirts a chic new look.
</P>
<P>
   O  &QC;  Opaque. There's more to opaque hosiery than black. Think
bright colors like teal, magenta or red.
</P>
<P>
   P  &QC;  Pants. They can be cropped at the ankle or knee. They can
flare, flop or hang straight. Shape isn't as important as fabric.
Leather pants are in first place, followed by soft wools, tweed, or
blended fibers. Pants in a reptile print are worth extra points.
</P>
<P>
   Q  &QC;  Queens. Royals tend to be all about ladylike dressing.
Britain's Queen Elizabeth may not be your style, but check out her
children's spouses and significant others.
</P>
<P>
   R  &QC;  Red. Designers haven't been able to get enough of this
clear, bright color. From a leather jacket by Jones of New York to
evening dresses by Donna Karan, red works.
</P>
<P>
   S  &QC;  Suits, Shearling. With skirts or pants, suits are key to
fall's ensemble dressing. They're fitted closer to the body, often
with a shorter jacket. They might be trimmed in fur.
</P>
<P>

VENTURA IS ONE POLITICO WITH THE WILL TO HAVE A SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As one American politician who managed to attract young people
to the polls, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura is getting impatient
with endless TV spots on seniors' prescription drugs and protecting
Medicare in the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would a 21-year-old give a damn about that at this stage
of his life?'' the irrepressible Ventura asked during a Seattle
stopover last week.
</P>
<P>
   He offered a pithy explanation for the campaign's geriatric
content: ``Elderly people vote. It's all about winning elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The former professional wrestler is having the time of his life
two years after being elected as one of only two independents to
occupy statehouses in America. (The other is Maine Gov. Angus
King.)
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is battling legislators who won't allow a public vote on
his proposal for a unicameral (one-house) state Legislature. He is
feuding with the statehouse press corps. He is the toast of
Washington, D.C., talk shows although he is openly contemptuous of
the capital's gaseous pundits.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... the inside-the-Beltway crowd, I don't think they're in
touch at all. They have no idea what is going on in America,''
Ventura declared.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has also written a book, ``Do I Stand Alone?'' (Pocket
Books, $23.95, 262 pages) that advocates a bottoms-up approach for
those hoping to break Republicans' and Democrats' stranglehold on
the nation's political life.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, third parties have suffered a succession of setbacks
this year. ``It is back to square one,'' Ventura reflected, talking
about feuds that have splintered the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   But he is touting the example of the Independence Party in
Minnesota, which he helped form after quitting Reform. It is acting
locally. ``We tell people, `The first thing you have to do is
solidify yourself in your own state,''' Ventura said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is a distinctive figure in American politics. He stands
6-foot-4, is completely bald, and is a former Navy SEAL in Vietnam
who later worked as a bodyguard for the Rolling Stones. After a
career in wrestling, he hosted a radio talk show and served a term
as mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's meteoric rise in politics came for one reason: He was
let into television debates during Minnesota's 1998 gubernatorial
campaign. He is furious at the two major parties ``shutting the
door'' in presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They unlevel the playing field,'' he said. ``They tell the
public they despise each other. When somebody else appears,
however, they gang up on him. ... Rest assured they don't want
another Jesse Ventura on the horizon. This is how they prevent
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, 49, is unusual in another way: Although colorful and
blunt, he vehemently opposes jingoism and any calls for a fortress
America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ventura is an outspoken free trader. He adamantly
takes issue with Green Party nominee Ralph Nader's call for putting
conditions on China's conduct as the price of trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would they listen to us?'' he asked. ``The only way to
change China is to have a relationship with them. I could
understand (Nader's) position slightly _ slightly _ if we were
giving up something. But we get access to one-fifth the world's
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rest assured, China would trade with everyone else if we put
up restrictions,'' he added. ``How many other countries do you
think hoped Ralph Nader's view prevailed here?''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is equally scornful of the guard-the-borders view of
immigration espoused by Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Buchanan should stop and think, `If it weren't for
immigrants, I wouldn't be here,''' he said. ``Just because your
ancestors come from Europe doesn't mean that you are better than
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura noted Minnesota needs workers, particularly to do
sweaty, dirty work. ``A lot of these jobs your traditional
suburbanite won't do,'' Ventura added. ``Immigrants will do these
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is also an outspoken advocate of mass transit and has
battled legislative Republicans who oppose light rail in the
Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``These Republicans, they're ridiculous,'' he said. ``Do they
actually think they will pave their way out of congestion?''

   TV-NETWORK-WHINERS (Undated) _ So just how wussy are network
executives? Earlier this year, all but NBC's demanded that the
official start of the fall TV season be delayed two weeks so they
wouldn't have to put their fall-season premieres up against the NBC
telecast of the Summer Olympics. To viewers, whose concerns
generally don't come up for discussion when the network suits are
sitting in their planning meetings, it's foolish.

Ventura is getting impatient with endless TV spots on seniors'

campaign. ``Why would a 21-year-old give a damn about that at this

<P>
   FALL-FASHION (Undated) _ Fall 2000 is a good time to re-write
the ABCs of fashion. For too many years they've been centered
around B for black, C for clunky shoes and M (as in minimalism).
But clothes are being re-shaped and re-styled for the new
millennium. With leather and glamour heading the list, here's what
makes getting dressed this fall different and more interesting than
years past.
</P>
<P>
   By Susan Phinney. (Story has moved in the ``l'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   CELL-RINGS (Undated) _ So you want to stand out in the crowd.
Well, forget piercing your nose (too painful) or tattooing your bum
(too permanent) or, for that matter, dying your hair purple (too
passe).
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to set yourself apart in this digital age,
you need a customized musical ringtone for your cell phone.

   OLY-SOC-WOMEN (Melbourne, Australia) _ In the 60th minute, Mia
Hamm was chopped down from behind by Brazil's Formiga. The referee
drew a yellow card and awarded the Americans a free kick from 45
yards. Brandi Chastain lofted the ball toward Lorrie Fair in the
penalty area. The resulting chaos left Brazil's goalkeeper on the
ground and the ball at Hamm's feet on a severe angle to the left of
an empty net. Pushed and kicked and jostled all evening, Hamm was
suddenly free, and she tucked the ball into the back right corner

and whispered under her breath: Please, no more heartbreak. An

on the overhead screen, Khorkina's naturally sullen exterior melted

Wilkinson broke three toes on her right foot while training as a
platform diver. With Olympic trials looming, she figured her dreams
of Sydney fractured that day as well. Sunday, Wilkinson roared from
fifth place to win the first U.S. gold medal in women's 10-meter
platform diving since 1964. 850 words. By Mark Landler.

   OLY-BKO-ANGOLA (Sydney, Australia) _ Fernandes Herlander
Coimbra, his left hand holding a duffel bag on his shoulder, laughs
when you bring up the name. ``I know you were going to ask me about
Charles Barkley,'' the 32-year-old forward of the Angolan national
team said. ``I just knew.'' Coimbra is playing in his third
straight Olympics, eight years after Barkley maliciously elbowed
him in the chest at the Barcelona Games in 1992. If the cheap shot
brought him international sympathy and portrayed Barkley as the
ugliest of Americans _ a quick Polaroid of the world's richest
nation beating up on an impoverished, war-torn African country _ it
also gave Coimbra a name. Noticing the temperament of the 2000 U.S.
team, Coimbra said he does not believe sportsmanship is improving
in America. 800 words. By Mike Wise.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-BOX (Sydney, Australia) _ There was a soundtrack to U.S.
flyweight Jose Navarro's second-round victory Sunday in the Olympic
boxing tournament. It was loud, passionate and mostly in Spanish,
and it came from Navarro's older brother, Carlos, who stood
ringside yelling instructions and encouragement that filled the
small converted hall that serves as Sydney's boxing venue. There
may be only one gold medal awarded in Jose's flyweight division
this week, but there are two Navarros chasing it. And if Jose wins
it, Carlos gets to keep it. It was supposed to be the other way
around, Jose in the grandstand, cheering for Carlos at the
Olympics. 900 words. By Bill Pennington.

   OLY-SOF (Sydney, Australia) _ Women's semifinals, U.S. vs.

Latin-American players have become `the kings of baseball' (For use
by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Simon Gonzalez 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best players in the American League the past two seasons,
according to the Most Valuable Player voters, were Juan Gonzalez
and Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The best player in the National League in 1998 was Sammy Sosa.
Last year, Sosa was the recipient of the Hank Aaron Award, which
goes to the player with the highest combined total of hits, runs
batted in and home runs. Manny Ramirez won the Aaron Award in the
AL.
</P>
<P>
   The best pitcher in the AL last year, according to the Cy Young
Award voters, was Pedro Martinez. The best rookie was Carlos
Beltran, and the best reliever was Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   The best team in the majors, the New York Yankees, won the World
Series because of big contributions from AL Championship Series MVP
Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, Rivera and center fielder Bernie
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having an abundance of talent, all those players
have something in common. They're all from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the teams that win the championships, look how
many Latinos are on those teams,'' said Omar Minaya, the former
Rangers scout and current assistant general manager with the New
York Mets. ``Break down the Yankees the past three years. Who have
been their central players?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, said Minaya, the highest ranking Hispanic in
baseball, is Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   It is an answer hard to refute.
</P>
<P>
   With the likes of Martinez, Sosa, Rodriguez and Rivera earning
major awards and winning championships, Latinos are impacting
baseball as never before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have taken over the game,'' Montreal Expos manager
Felipe Alou said before the season.  &LR; subheds:THE LATINO LEGACY
 &LR; body:There have been Latinos in the big leagues since 1871, when
Cuban-born Esteban Bellan played for the Troy Haymakers of the
National Association, but in a segregated society Latinos were only
slightly more accepted than African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Adolfo Luque, a pitcher from Cuba who won 193 games while
pitching for four teams from 1914-35, endured racial epithets even
though he was light-skinned. But at least he got to play in the big
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Most dark-skinned Hispanics who came to the United States had to
ply their trade not in the major leagues, but in the Negro leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Dihigo is considered by some to be the best player ever
to come from the Caribbean basin. His bust at Havana's Estadio
Latinoamericano reads, ``El Immortal.''
</P>
<P>
   He was big (6-foot-3, 220 pounds) and athletic, a pitcher with a
blazing fastball, an outfielder with an exceptional arm and range,
and a batter who could hit for average and power. According to
legend, he hit a 500-foot home run in 1936 and once threw a ball
over the center field wall from home plate in a contest against a
jai-alai player using his basket-like cesto. In 1977, he became the
first Cuban ever selected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   However, he never played in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Minnie Minoso, another dark-skinned Cuban, had the talent to
play in the majors at an early age, but he didn't make it until he
was 28 in 1951, four seasons after Jackie Robinson broke the color
barrier and paved the way for dark-skinned people of all
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   More Latinos began to trickle into the majors after Robinson's
historic breakthrough, with most of the 1950s stars from Cuba,
including Minoso and Camilo Pascual.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba was the first Caribbean nation to play baseball. The sport
was carried to the island by American sailors, students and
businessmen, and it was embraced passionately by the Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans took the sport to their Caribbean neighbors, and Cuba
sent the most players to the major and Negro leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban pipeline began to dry up when Fidel Castro came to
power in 1959, but other Caribbean countries began to supply talent
to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans Roberto Clemente and Orlando Cepeda and Dominicans
Juan Marichal and Matty, Felipe and Jesus Alou became stars in the
'60s, along with Cubans Tony Oliva, Zoilo Versalles and Luis Tiant.
Players from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Panama, Mexico and Colombia also
made it to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the quality of the Latinos _ Clemente and Cepeda won
back-to-back MVP awards in 1966-67, Mike Cuellar was the Cy Young
winner in '69, Tony Perez was a steady run producer for
Cincinnati's Big Red Machine in the '70s, and Rod Carew won seven
batting titles between 1969-78 _ there wasn't a great deal of
quantity.  &LR; subheds:THE CARIBBEAN WAVE  &LR; body:Sandy Johnson played in
the Pittsburgh Pirates' minor-league system, for the organization
that produced the legendary Clemente, so he knew of the abilities
of Latinos. When he became scouting director for the San Diego
Padres, he worked extensively in the Caribbean basin. He signed
Benito Santiago and Sandy and Roberto Alomar out of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw how much ability the players coming from those countries
had,'' Johnson said. ``They were aggressive, hungry and had great
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson took the same philosophy to Texas when he was hired by
the Rangers. He stationed Minaya in the Dominican, and had Luis
Rosa as a full-time scout in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   During Johnson's tenure, the club signed Rodriguez and Gonzalez
out of Puerto Rico, Sosa from the Dominican Republic and Wilson
Alvarez from Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were able to sign the future stars because their
scouts had an eye for talent, certainly, but also because they were
one of the few clubs aggressively going after Latino players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't nearly as many clubs,'' said Johnson, who's now
the Arizona Diamondbacks' assistant general manager. ``The
competition was maybe five, six, seven clubs that were really
active and aggressive over there in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Those days are gone.
</P>
<P>
   As expansion brought more and more teams into the majors, the
competition for talent became more intense. Full-time scouts in the
Caribbean became the rule, not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago there were some teams that just weren't involved,''
said Rangers general manager Doug Melvin, who is credited with
securing Williams for the Yankees when he was that club's scouting
director in 1985. ``Nowadays, everybody's involved in the Dominican
and Venezuela. It makes it more difficult to get the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus shifted from Puerto Rico when players from that
country were included in the June amateur draft, to the Dominican
and Venezuela, where clubs still can sign teen-agers as free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Today, every club has a baseball academy in the Dominican and/or
a team in the Dominican Summer League, and most also have them in
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clubs have their school and academies, where they're able to
bring a player in and look at him for 30 days,'' Melvin said.
``Years ago, you had a one- or two-day tryout then had to make a
decision. Now you try to convince the player to stay for 30 days
with you, look at him, give him some fundamentals and then make a
decision.''  &LR; subheds:THE LATINO PASTIME  &LR; body:Twenty years ago,
there were 37 players from the Dominican on 40-man rosters, and
seven from Venezuela. On Opening Day this year, there were 71
Dominicans and 31 Venezuelans on clubs' 25-man rosters.
</P>
<P>
   With players also continuing to come from Puerto Rico, Panama
and Mexico, the number of Latinos in the majors continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Latino players constituted about 10 percent of
major-league rosters. On Opening Day this year 175 of the 839
players, or 20.8 percent, on major-league rosters were Latino. And
that doesn't include Hispanic players born in the United States,
such as Alex Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, 42 percent of all players under contract in the
majors or minors as of Jan. 1 were foreign born, with 94 percent of
them from Spanish-speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more and more and more,'' Ivan Rodriguez said.
``Baseball is growing in Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fertile ground for talent because virtually every young
athlete in those countries plays baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is No. 1 in the Dominican,'' Rangers outfielder Ruben
Mateo said.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers reliever Darwin Cubillan grew up playing soccer in
Venezuela, but said that's not the biggest sport in his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most popular sport is baseball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Sierra said it's one of the two most popular in Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball and basketball,'' Sierra said. ``The way that Puerto
Rico is, basketball and baseball are the most popular sports.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, on the other hand, baseball competes with
many other interests for the attention of young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids here get their car at 16 and hang around the malls,''
Sandy Johnson said. ``There's Nintendo, there's soccer, there's
hockey, there's tennis, there's so many things. Nobody plays in an
open field any more. In the Dominican, little kids from 5, 6 years
old play with a stick and a cloth ball. That's every lot you go by.
Any spot in the middle of nowhere, there's kids all over swinging
the bat. Here, you can drive by five, six high schools and the
fields are empty. We just don't play as much as we used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball is recognizing the trend with initiatives
designed to be friendly to Latino players and countries.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics on the Rangers and the visiting Kansas City Royals
were honored before a game during the club's homestand last
weekend, a ceremony that was duplicated in other ballparks around
the countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a ceremony like this in the United States is good, for
me and all the Latin players,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   MLB declared March as ``Month of the Americas,'' a celebration
of the sport's Hispanic heritage, and conducted fan-fests in Latin
American countries.
</P>
<P>
   There were exhibitions in the Dominican, Venezuela and Mexico in
March, played before sold-out stadiums. The San Diego Padres and
Colorado Rockies opened the 1999 season in Mexico. The Rangers and
Toronto Blue Jays likely will begin next season in Puerto Rico.
 &LR; subheds:RENOWN AND RESPECT  &LR; body:Fans in the Hispanic countries
aren't the only ones passionate about their players. Latino players
are regarded as heroes in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez is a star in Boston. Rodriguez is one of the most
popular Rangers, and he was the leading vote-getter for the
All-Star Game this year. Sosa became a folk hero after his home run
duels with Mark McGwire the last couple of seasons, and has several
national television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get the respect they deserve right now,'' Tony Perez
said. ``Not back then. I remember Clemente always complained about
how the players from Latin America then didn't have the respect and
the publicity and the ink in the papers they deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when a player with dark skin and a heavy accent
like Mateo would have encountered prejudice. But the young
outfielder said he has had no such problems during his five years
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's been nice,'' he said. ``That hasn't happened to
me, and I hope it never happens.''
</P>
<P>
   That reflects not only a change in society's attitudes, but in
the way clubs take care of their Hispanic players. Latinos used to
be on their own after signing with a U.S. team, but now they
receive help in adjusting to a strange culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another reason for the schools, to acclimate that
player and educate him to what he's going to go through when he
comes over here to the United States,'' Doug Melvin said. ``Now a
lot of these young Latin players speak English by the time they get
to the big leagues. They're better prepared for the big leagues and
more accustomed to major-league cities. Years ago, you just signed
them and if they learned English, fine, if they didn't learn
English, fine. Clubs are a lot more aware of having programs set up
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The dream of signing the next Martinez or Sosa or Guerrero or
Rivera should accelerate the trend. Some scouts have estimated that
one-third of all major-league players could be Latino in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be even more,'' Johnson said. ``I see it
gaining momentum. More and more players are going to come out of
there.''

TV SPORTS: NBC ALSO FAILED TO MEASURE UP
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia &UR;  &LR; _ It is a predictable outrage that NBC is
carrying the Olympics on tape. It is predictable that the
complainants forget that NBC ``time-shifted'' about half of the
Summer Olympics in Atlanta and all of them in Barcelona and that
the tactic was born at ABC long ago.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not convinced that a mass audience would adore the Seven
Network's Olympic production here, where everything is live, where
there are no features or profiles and at 10 o'clock on a Sunday
night, as I write this, I can watch the Australia-Kazakhstan men's
water polo game from start to finish, with no cuts to any other
sport going on around Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about Seven's coverage is an 11 p.m. program
called ``The Dream,'' with two inspired knuckleheads who savage the
Games (His Excellency Juan Antonio Samaranch must not be watching)
and have caused a mini-craze with their mascot, a crude wombat
named Fatso.
</P>
<P>
   While attending a baseball game (it was live and so was I)
Saturday night, I could see Marion Jones and Maurice Greene win
their 100-meter sprints on TV monitors in the press area, a half
day or more before they would be seen doing the exact same things
on NBC. My confession here is that live is better than tape. It's a
no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones won her race at 8:08 p.m. Sydney time, or 5:08 a.m. in
New York. No matter the allure of her chase for five gold medals, I
wouldn't get up to watch that if I were back in the cozy confines
of Forest Hills in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the very few who are devoted to track would _ those same
hardy few turn up in dismal numbers for meets televised on Saturday
afternoons _ but that does not make a network audience.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an issue caused by the taped repackaging of the
Olympics that requires discussion. What happens when news happens?
News is the enemy of a taped Olympics. Yes, Bob Costas is live in
the studio, introducing and commenting and interviewing. But all
else is on tape. Except when it changes the formula. For example,
Costas delivered news about Marie-Jose Perec's hurried departure
from Sydney and the Patrick Ewing trade as soon as he could.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, news happened unrelated to a score or a result.
On that night, the vaults of one gymnast after another were
executed off a horse that was set five centimeters too low. The
unforgivable error wrecked the medal chances for the Russian
Svetlana Khorkina and the American Elise Ray. By the time they were
given the chance for do-overs, they were goners in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Yet NBC chose to cover it as it covers everything else: on tape,
as if it were live. NBC's Al Trautwig, Elfi Schlegel and Tim
Daggett expressed their appropriate outrage, but at least a
half-day after the incident occurred. In fact, they covered the
situation well once the error was discovered. Daggett, especially,
fulminated about the need to offer the gymnasts a chance to vault
again.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing them rail about the impact of the vault's
mismeasurement, a genuine news story that rose above the usual
goings-on at the Olympic gymnastics venue, made me wonder what we
would think of CBS, ABC or Fox tape-delayed a football game and
didn't show the reversed instant-replay call that dramatically
altered the score of the game until 14 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Handling this situation differently would have meant NBC
breaking out from its standard format. It would have meant, in a
sense, ruining the suspense in order to tell a riveting news story.
</P>
<P>
   It probably would have required Costas to introduce the story
and quickly describe how gymnastics officials had set the horse too
low. Setting up the tale would not have ruined the tale. If NBC is
correct in its philosophy that viewers care more about storytelling
than the results, then here was a test of its skills. Give the
result up front _ that the favorite, Khorkina, and Ray, had been
cheated out of their rightful chance at a medal by the incompetence
of venue officials.
</P>
<P>
   And then weave the narrative. But the way NBC ended up telling
the story, waiting nearly two hours into prime time, was not the
best one. The compelling news was told too late, as if the lead had
been buried. Had NBC used its resources more fully, it could
potentially have created a better taped narrative. There was only
one story that night.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, said
the mismeasured apparatus was not crucial enough to change the
evening's narrative style. ``You needed to see it play out, and see
how it affected Khorkina and Ray,'' he said. ``Khorkina was
destroyed emotionally. We did it in exactly the time it happened in
real time.''
</P>
<P>
   What is newsworthy enough to tear up the format, to offer the
news upfront, in a headline of sorts, then tell the story in
detail? A positive drug test for a gold-medal winner, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's beyond what happens in a competition,'' he said.

NEW TYPE OF E-BUSINESS IS PROVIDING AN ATTRACTIVE MIX OF CONTENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the epiphanies that Internet executives had last year, as
they pondered routes to profitability, was the notion that Web
sites need a healthy mix of the three C's _ content, commerce and
community.
</P>
<P>
   Following that mandate was easy enough as long as venture
capitalists were elbowing for a seat at the poker table. But as the
venture folks pulled their chips off the table, executives were
forced to realize that dealing with even one of the C's was
difficult and expensive enough _ let alone all three.
</P>
<P>
   Generating content, in particular, proved much harder than many
Internet companies had expected. Given the Web public's insatiable
appetite for new information, sites must constantly refresh their
editorial content, either with their own stables of writers and
multimedia producers, or by striking deals with other sites that
can provide that material.
</P>
<P>
   But both approaches have given Internet executives headaches.
Sites that license content from media companies or other
content-heavy businesses must go to great lengths to synchronize
their technology, so the articles and multimedia clips can flow
easily from one place to another. Such partnerships also require
close monitoring: the last thing executives of RollingStone.com,
for instance, want to see is one of their stories running, heavily
edited, on some portion of a partner's site that has nothing to do
with music.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, producing one's own material can also have drawbacks
_ like working with writers who don't grasp the meaning of
deadlines, or video producers who don't grasp the meaning of
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   These problems have not been lost on so-called online content
syndicators, a relatively new category of Internet businesses that
act as intermediaries between sites that need content and sites
that want to sell it. Companies like iSyndicate, ScreamingMedia,
YellowBrix and NewsEdge are quickly building their client lists as
Web executives look for help in filling their sites with material
that will keep users on the page.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, media companies and others that supply content have
found that syndicators have given them a much-needed, and
unexpected, revenue source.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand for these services is definitely growing,'' said Dan
O'Brien, senior analyst with Forrester Research, an Internet
consulting firm. ``And the law of supply and demand indicates that
as the Web grows _ and as the need for content grows faster than
the supply _ this will pay off much more than it does now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jupiter Communications, another research firm, forecasts
that online content syndication and licensing will amount to a $1.5
billion market in 2004, up from $343 million this year. Analysts
say the leading content syndicators are iSyndicate and
ScreamingMedia.
</P>
<P>
   ScreamingMedia, which went public in the summer, sells the
content of more than 2,800 online publishers to roughly 1,100 Web
sites, while iSyndicate offers the content of about 1,200
publishers to some 270,000 sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of iSyndicate, which rolled out in 1997, the company
takes video, audio, photos and text from publishers and offers the
material to customers in categories like health or sports. For fees
ranging from $50,000 to $500,000 per year, iSyndicate can also
publish the content on its own servers, track the performance of
the content and advise companies on how to improve that
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ScreamingMedia filters content to suit each particular site's
needs. If a health site wants news about leukemia or allergies, for
example, ScreamingMedia's technology will filter all stories
related to those subjects and send the most relevant ones to the
site. In addition to a one-time set-up fee of between $3,000 and
$40,000, subscribers pay between $500 and $50,000 per month, which
buys thousands of articles or multimedia clips.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, in both cases, the syndicators screen the sites that
buy the content, to make sure it is used in ways that conform to
the original publisher's standards. Syndicators also send the
content to their customers in a format that suits their particular
computer systems. Executives say the benefits of this formatting
are difficult to quantify, but crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Fritz, president of FringeGolf.com, a content site that
also sells its own brand of merchandise, said that when the site
rolled out in 1998, it wanted to run golf-related stories and
scores from The Associated Press wires. ``But with the AP, there
was a pretty long process to integrate systems with them _ you
either had to set up a satellite dish or wire your building for
it,'' he said. ``And it cost about $1,000 or $1,500 a month, which
was a lot for us then.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also lacked the resources to generate that content
on its own. ``But iSyndicate let us buy just AP's golf sports news,
whereas with AP we'd have to buy the whole sports category,'' Fritz
said. ``So it's actually less expensive _ something like $500 a
month _ for us to just get AP's golf information from iSyndicate,
and we don't need to spend any energy integrating it into our
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Fritz said FringeGolf.com was now negotiating with iSyndicate to
have its original content sold to iSyndicate's affiliates. ``Being
able to play both sides is a real advantage for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to O'Brien of Forrester, Web executives looking to
sell their content through syndicators should not get too excited
about becoming rich in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company makes a lot of money through this, it's the
exception rather than the rule,'' he said. Because the syndicators
typically keep 70 percent of each sale, O'Brien said, ``it wouldn't
be worth doing the deal if money was the sole focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, media companies and Web site publishers that
provide content are more intent on using syndicators to get their
information _ and their brand names _ on thousands of other sites,
while letting marketing executives concentrate on other matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's also a matter of competitive displacement,'' O'Brien
said. If ABC's video clip appears on a given site, for instance,
NBC, CBS and Fox lose that opportunity for exposure.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means, of course, that media companies are
interested in spreading all of their content to the outer reaches
of the Web. ``We have to make sure we're not giving away too
much,'' said Dan Chiss, director of marketing and business
development for RollingStone.com, which licenses its content and
that of Rolling Stone magazine to both iSyndicate and
ScreamingMedia. ``We want to keep our best content close to the
vest.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, online syndicators can never sell Rolling
Stone's cover story, ``because that's our most precious asset, and
we want to keep people coming back to our site.'' But the company
does sell enough articles and photos through syndicators to earn
monthly revenues ``in the five figures,'' Chiss said. ``And it
comes at really no cost to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sales should continue to grow, as the Web's global reach
grows, Chiss said. ``Rolling Stone is a pretty ubiquitous brand,
and music is something that really has no language barriers,'' he
said. ``So we're definitely looking forward to seeing where this
goes.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Javier Sotomayor was standing nearby,
preparing to walk back into the wet and windy stadium to receive
his silver medal in the men's high jump, when Stefan Holm made it
clear that he did not believe Sotomayor should be competing in
these Olympic Games at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't be here; it should have been my medal,'' said
Holm, a Swede who finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the event was won by Sergei Kliugin of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old Sotomayor is the 1992 Olympic champion and still
holds the world record of 2.45 meters (8 feet 1/2 inch), set in
1993. He is a national figure in Cuba and the most consistently
brilliant jumper in the history of the sport, but at last year's
Pan American Games he tested positive for cocaine. Sotomayor denied
ever using cocaine, and despite being cleared by the Cuban
federation, his two-year ban was upheld this past July. Yet in
August, his suspension was cut in half and he was allowed to
compete in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   As Sunday's weather conditions worsened, Sotomayor cleared 2.32
meters, but failed three times to match Kliugin's winning jump of
2.35 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Abderrahmane Hammad of Algeria became the first African medalist
in the men's high jump. Even though Hammad, Holm and three other
jumpers also cleared 2.32 meters, Sotomayor won the silver because
he cleared 2.25 meters and then 2.32 on his first attempts. The
other competitors all missed at least once on their way to 2.32.
But if not for the rain and strong, gusting winds, which
intensified as the event reached its decisive phase, they all might
have jumped higher.
</P>
<P>
   Kliugin, a 26-year-old without a previous major title whose
personal best was 2.33 until Sunday, cleared the winning height
before the rain and wind reached their peaks. And while it is true
that many pundits were predicting a Russian victory in this event,
the Russian expected to win was the defending world champion
Vyacheslav Voronin, whose jump of 2.40 last month was the best in
the world for five years. Voronin finished 10th on Sunday after
clearing 2.29 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I believe I lucked out,'' Kliugin said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Holm's sentiments, Sotomayor defended his right to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't steal a medal from anybody,'' Sotomayor said
afterward. ``I've been jumping for 17 years. The international
federation stole one year of my career. I don't need to take any
substances to jump higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to put up with a lot in the last year. I'm a victim
of something that didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sotomayor's positive test, the Cuban federation contended
that the second of his two urine samples might have been tampered
with in the testing process.
</P>
<P>
   He missed last year's world championships and after nearly a
year of legal debate and hearings, an arbitration panel from the
IAAF, track's governing body, upheld the two-year ban on June 27,
which meant that Sotomayor was ineligible to compete until July 30,
2001.
</P>
<P>
   That would have kept him out of these Games and potentially put
an end to his career, but the Cuban federation continued pursuing
the case, appealing to the IAAF and citing a clause in the IAAF
rule book that permits drug bans to be modified if there are
``exceptional circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, invoking that clause and citing the hundreds of drug
tests Sotomayor had passed during his long and exceptional career,
the IAAF council cut Sotomayor's penalty in half and made him
eligible to compete immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a unanimous decision. Council member and IAAF
medical commission chairman Arne Ljunqvist of Sweden disassociated
himself from the move. As Ljunqvist watched Sunday night's
competition, the fact that a fellow Swede had missed out on a medal
because of Sotomayor was hardly lost on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something completely against the spirit behind our rules
and totally against the spirit of our anti-doping work,'' Ljunqvist
said Sunday night of the council decision.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hammad, who occasionally trains with Sotomayor in Cuba, said he
did not feel he had been robbed him of a silver medal, but Holm
said Sotomayor's appearance was not right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules say a two-year ban for cocaine,'' Holm said. ``It
should be two years not one year. The IAAF can't even follow it's
own decision. They kept dragging it out and because he's a good guy
and because he's done so much for the sport, they cut it to one
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same with Merlene Ottey,'' Holm said of the
Jamaican sprinter, whose two-year ban for testing positive for
nandrolone was overturned earlier this year by an IAAF arbitration
panel. ``I'm glad she finished fourth in the women's 100. I'm
glad.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTION TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Kliugin said he was fortunate to win the high jump, Denise
Lewis' gold medal in the heptathlon had little to do with luck. The
British star won a bronze medal in the last Olympics and silver
medals in the last two world championships. On Sunday, she took the
final step, coming from behind in the last two of the seven events,
recording a personal best in the javelin to take a 63-point lead,
and then muddling through in the 800 despite ankle and foot pain to
win with a total of 6,584 points. That was 53 better than silver
medalist Yelena Prokhorova of Russia. In the night's two other
medal events, Bulgaria's Tereza Marinova won the women's triple
jump with a leap of 15.20 meters in benign weather that no one
could match as conditions worsened. Poland's Szymon Ziolkowski won
the men's hammer with a throw of 80.02 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson, the Texan who is the world-record holder and
defending Olympic champion in the men's 400, advanced to the final
in the chill by finishing second in his semifinal on Sunday to
teammate Alvin Harrison. Neither American pushed his hardest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get in the top two, so I could get a good
lane in the final,'' Johnson said. We had to stand around in the
rain for 15 minutes waiting on a medal ceremony. Fortunately,
nobody got injured.''

 ADVERTISING: AD CAMPAIGN REVAMPED TO IMPROVE PORTRAYAL OF WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The firestorm last week over a Nike commercial during the Summer
Olympics, in which a female runner escapes a masked madman wielding
a chain saw, has reignited a debate about images of women in
advertising. The spot, intended as a spoof of so-called slasher
movies, was widely castigated as making light of violence toward
women and was soon pulled off the air by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   That outcry still reverberates, as the Advertising Women of New
York prepares for its annual event to encourage Madison Avenue to
improve the portrayal of women in campaigns. The event, called the
Good, the Bad and the Ugly Awards, is scheduled to be held Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth presentation of the organization's honors and
dishonors has been revamped from previous years to try to make the
event less of a novelty that powerful and influential executives _
particularly male executives _ have found ``easy to dismiss,'' said
Alison Burns, one of the three co-chairwomen of the awards, and the
president of Fallon New York, part of the Fallon Worldwide unit of
the Publicis Groupe S.A.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, men were recruited to serve as judges for the
first time, and a men's magazine, Maxim, was signed as a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to elevate the status of the awards because it's
important they really effect change in advertising toward women,''
said Cindy Gallop, another co-chairwoman of the event and the
president of the New York office of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, which is
49 percent-owned by the B Com3 &UR;  &LR;  Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``To really effect change, we have to talk to men, because the
creative departments are still heavily male,'' Gallop said. ``Women
sitting around talking to each other will never get anything to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the nine judges are men. One is John Hegarty, chairman at
Bartle Bogle. The other is Jamie Barrett, executive creative
director at Fallon New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very enlightened to include men,'' Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of many creative directors out there who are very much
on the hunt for great female creatives,'' he added. ``It's very
frustrating not to have a diversity of voice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, said his colleague, Burns, the awards ceremony was
``a ladies-who-lunch, Midtown-hotel event.'' Rescheduling it as an
evening event and moving it to the Puck Building in Lower Manhattan
will help ``make people realize it's not `your mother's awards
show,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to change perceptions, said Mary Warlick, another
judge, was to cast a wider net in considering ads deemed
patronizing, insulting or annoying.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could pull a lot of ads with busty women out of mechanics'
magazines to attack, and they'd be what you'd expect,'' said
Warlick, who is the executive director of the One Club for Art and
Copy in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's important to look at ads from larger
advertisers that are not sending out the appropriate messages,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one ad the judges declared ``bad'' is for the
Jell-O brand, sold by the Kraft Foods unit of Philip Morris, the
nation's fourth-largest marketer. The commercial, by Young &AMP;
Rubicam Advertising in New York, shows a girl rushing to fix Jell-O
pudding for a cute new neighbor, a boy playing baseball, as the
comedian Bill Cosby declares, ``They say the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more. When the girl presents the pudding to
her budding beau, two other girls turn up with similar treats for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boy hasn't done anything but bounce a ball and move in
next door, and all of a sudden there are three Graces delivering
votives to him,'' Warlick said ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   Another judge, Jane Talcott, is a senior partner and group
creative director at Y.&AMP; R. Advertising; judges excused themselves
from evaluating their agencies' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not embarrassed for Y.&AMP; R.,'' Talcott said. ``Obviously,
in any year, a big agency is going to take some hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Y.&AMP; R. Advertising took another hit for a commercial for another
big marketer, Colgate-Palmolive. The spot, for the Palmolive Spring
Sensations line of dishwashing liquids, shows two women dancing
around a kitchen as flowers fall from the ceiling; they chirp lines
like ``Springtime every time you do dishes!''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Mel Brooks could include a song titled ``Springtime for
Dishes'' in the coming Broadway version of his 1968 film ``The
Producers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other major advertisers and agencies to be chastised Monday
night include Bristol-Myers Squibb, for a commercial for Clairol
Herbal Essences by the Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, part of B
Com3, which will get the Grand Ugly Award, and Volkswagen of
America, for a commercial for the Audi A8 by McKinney &AMP; Silver in
Raleigh, N.C., part of MarchFirst.
</P>
<P>
   The top award for campaigns praised for positive portrayals of
women, called the Grand Good, will be shared by two World Wide Web
sites and their agencies. One honored pair is Nordstrom and the
Fallon Minneapolis office, for ads for Nordstromshoes.com, and the
other is Women.com and Citron Haligman Bedecarre in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by organizers of the event to ask Maxim to become a
sponsor _ along with Business Week magazine, part of McGraw-Hill,
Reebok International and Women.com _ may raise some eyebrows (or
even hackles) because of its reputation as the leader of the ``beer
and babes'' category of the men's magazine market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd urge women to read the magazine before they make a formal
judgment,'' Gallop said. ``It has an enormous sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maxim is supporting us,'' she added, ``because they know that
to build their business as a mainstream men's magazine, they need
the `girlfriend vote.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lance J.O. Ford, general manager at Maxim in New York, published
by Dennis Maxim Inc., echoed Gallop by describing what he termed
``the `girlfriend test.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're lucky enough for a girl to come back to your
apartment, and Maxim is on the coffee table, what does she think of
you?'' Ford asked. ``If she thinks you're a pig and walks out,
we've failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. Sounds like the basis for another Nike commercial.

PATENTS: UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF TRADEMARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  In the world of intellectual property, the business of trademarks
exists in the shadow of patents. Patent owners are inventors, while
trademark owners are simply people who control brand names, slogans
and logos.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trademark experts _ lawyers, lobbyists and others _ think few
people understand that establishing and protecting brand names is a
critical part of the economic success of many patented devices or
systems, and that trademarks are increasingly important to
companies competing in the global, digital marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Some big trademark owners are particularly worried that Congress
does not grasp the importance of brands. While Congress recently
extended the life span of patents to conform with standards in
Europe and Japan, it has not acted to adopt similar changes to
trademark law contained in a 1989 international agreement known
among specialists as the Madrid protocol.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement which updates an international trademark treaty
negotiated in 1891, allows anyone to apply for or to renew a
trademark anywhere in the world by submitting one form in one
country. The amendment took effect in many nations in 1995, but not
in the United States because of a dispute whether the European
Union should have a vote as well as each of its 15 member nations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a phalanx of officials from the International
Trademark Association went to Capitol Hill to try to persuade
Congress to adopt the trademark agreement. The U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office supports it, as does the Clinton administration.
The dispute over voting rights is resolved. The trademark
association officials said there was no opposition in Congress to
the Madrid protocol, but they still were not sure the vote would
occur. Evidently, trademark law is not a front-burner issue.
</P>
<P>
   So they took to the hallways of Congress, seeking to ensure that
their bill was not lost in a last-minute flurry of voting on sexier
legislation. Indeed, the vote is now scheduled this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to strike while the iron is hot and make sure it moves
before the end of this session,'' said Michael Heltzer, the
trademark association's government relations manager, just before
the officials left for Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The International Trademark Association was established in 1878
as the U. S. Trademark Association and changed its name 10 years
ago to reflect its global membership. Lately, the issues that most
concern trademark owners _ such as the counterfeiting of designer
handbags, or determining the rights to Internet domain names _ have
become increasingly international. For this reason, inducing the
United States to join the 48 countries already signed onto the
Madrid protocol is the group's top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we'll have a centralized way to submit one application,
pay one fee in one currency and get quicker action,'' said Kimbley
Muller, the trademark associations president and senior counsel for
intellectual property at Shell Oil. He said the new regulations are
more important for midsize and small businesses than for companies
like Shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get a trademark approved and then I change my address, I
only have to send one letter instead of 180 letters around the
world,'' he continued. ``Big companies like Shell can afford those
administration costs, but for a small company, that could be a
life-or-death difference in their worldwide business.''
</P>
<P>
   If the bill passes, the trademark association would be able to
focus more attention on counterfeiting and domain-name disputes,
issues important to some of its largest members. Both affect brands
that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars to their owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Warner Brothers, first and foremost, the concern is for
the cartoon characters we protect around the world through
trademark and copyright,'' said Nils Montan, a vice president and
senior counsel for intellectual property of the studio. ``We have
thousands and thousands of registrations, from Bugs Bunny to Fred
Flintstone and now to Harry Potter. We spend a lot of time, effort
and money in the registration process around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Secure trademarks are also increasingly important because they
are becoming the key to obtaining easily recognizable Internet
addresses. The Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers began
arbitrating disputes in December over the ownership of Internet
addresses based on trademarked brands. About 1,000 cases have been
heard, and 75 percent have been won by trademark owners.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling a brand name is ``more important when you go into
cyberspace because there's no salesperson there, nobody to reassure
you,'' Muller said. ``All you have is the name.''
</P>
<P>
   If the United States adopts the new standards, the next goal
will be to sign up as many smaller countries as possible, said Alan
Drewsen, the trademark group's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many jurisdictions, they're just beginning to appreciate
the value of intellectual property,'' he said. ``We have to educate
officials in those countries to understand how it affects their own
economic development, both for local businesses and for their
attractiveness to foreign investment.''

DREAMWORKS SCALES BACK ITS ONCE-GRAND VISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphics clients.

or 888-346-9867.) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT with RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As described in October 1994, the dream was a new-style
entertainment company in which three of the most successful people
in the media business would have total freedom to create films, TV
shows and music albums, while also developing new-media
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   So bold and exciting were the plans laid out by Steven
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen that The New York
Times and many other publications put articles about them on Page
1. The ``dream team,'' as they called themselves, named their
company DreamWorks SKG, implying that its future was as unlimited
as their fertile imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   But after six years that saw the rise of the World Wide Web, the
proliferation of digital music and the advent of digital
television, the bold DreamWorks trio has found true success only in
Hollywood's oldest and financially riskiest profession _ making
movies. The lesson, if there is one, may be that the multimedia
game is a hard one for even media moguls to master.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, what DreamWorks does well, it does exceedingly well.
Through early September, the 20 films it had released since 1997
had averaged $78.7 million at the box office, a batting average
some 15 percent ahead of any other studio, according to the
research firm ACNielsen EDI. And those hits included two multiple
Academy Award winners: 1998's ``Saving Private Ryan'' and 1999's
``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   This year so far, three of DreamWorks' seven releases have
surpassed the $100 million threshold that separates the superlative
from the so-so. And ``Almost Famous,'' the director Cameron Crowe's
reminiscences of his teen-age years as a rock 'n' roll reporter, is
off to a hot start, grossing an estimated $10.3 million since its
limited-release opening two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Overall this year, DreamWorks ranks a close second behind Walt
Disney's Buena Vista in total box office revenue _ even though
Buena Vista has released nearly twice as many movies. ``It's an
awesome record,'' one rival said. But industry analysts note that
the movie business is the most volatile part of the entertainment
industry, giving the DreamWorks portfolio a dangerous lack of
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks, of course, does not owe the world popular culture in
all flavors and formats. Nor is it under the stock market scrutiny
to which the media leviathans like Disney and Time Warner are
subjected. As a privately held company, it is financially
accountable only to its investors, who seem content.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are long-term investors,'' said William Savoy, who
represents the billionaire Paul Allen, owner of a roughly $600
million stake in DreamWorks. ``We believe that huge value is being
created for the long term. As long as that is the trajectory we are
on, we are thrilled to be investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in creative fields other than films, the dream team has
worked little magic. ABC's ``Spin City'' is the only TV hit to have
emerged from DreamWorks, though the company routinely produces
network pilots.
</P>
<P>
   In music, the industry where Geffen made his name and money,
DreamWorks expects revenue of $100 million this year, which he said
was ahead of the pace his former company achieved in its early
years. Still, DreamWorks has but one album, Papa Roche's
``Infest,'' among Soundscan's top 50.
</P>
<P>
   As for new media, the DreamWorks trio has had to learn the
meaning of a word previously unfamiliar to them: flop. Last month,
after spending at least $7 million to develop Pop.com, an
entertainment Web site, DreamWorks and its partner in the venture,
Imagine Entertainment, terminated the business before the Web site
had even opened.
</P>
<P>
   Like other companies trying to create entertainment Web sites,
Pop.com found that developing compelling material was a costly
proposition that presented no clear revenue opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   And so, for better or worse, these days ``we're essentially in
the movie business,'' Geffen said in a recent interview at his
10-acre estate in Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   With him was Katzenberg, who had been one of the most powerful
producers and executives at Disney before leaving to start
DreamWorks. The two executives, both wearing khakis and T-shirts,
were joined by the top executives of DreamWorks' live film
operation: Walter Parkes and his wife, Laurie MacDonald. (Spielberg
was away working on ``A.I.,'' a techno-thriller about artificial
intelligence that will star Jude Law and Haley Joel Osment.)
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that they had scaled back the original
DreamWorks plan, the executives betrayed little disappointment over
their curbed ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that I wish we were more lucky or better,''
Katzenberg said of DreamWorks' limited success in network
television. But like Geffen, he spoke not of failure but of changed
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every business has changed in significant ways,'' he said,
though several industry critics say the company's performance has
been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen noted, for instance, that the record business had become
``extraordinarily'' expensive. ``It used to be a cheap-entry
business, where you could sign an artist for less than $100,000,''
he said. ``Today you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   And Katzenberg pointed out that changes in federal regulation
that allowed the TV networks to take bigger ownership stakes in
programs mean the networks produce more of their own programming
now than they did five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen added that television, which DreamWorks had originally
seen as a core business, was now ``one of those businesses that are
in the margins of what we do but give Steven and Jeffrey an
opportunity to do things they really enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   But that joy has its limits. Just last week, for instance, NBC
pulled the plug on ``Semper Fi,'' a big-budget dramatic series
about life in the Marine Corps that Spielberg was to have produced
for introduction in midseason. After viewing the pilot, NBC
executives concluded it would not work as a series.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Katzenberg said that for the first time ``the company
is generating free cash flow.'' He offered no specific numbers, but
he meant that DreamWorks still had cash left over after meeting
interest payments and capital expenditures. Cash flow is the
preferred metric for media companies because it speaks to the
ability to generate enough revenue to pay stars and underwrite
multimillion-dollar production and marketing budgets _ to get the
next show on the road, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   But generating free cash flow is not the same as being
profitable, which DreamWorks is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies are the most capital-intensive, volatile and low-margin
of the entertainment businesses,'' said David Londoner, who follows
entertainment for ABN Amro. ``Profit margins run from negative 10
percent to only about 10 percent when a company is doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   It is to the dream team's credit that so far it has beaten the
odds in movies. But forecasting future performance is notoriously
hard in a business dependent on hits _ and harder yet at
DreamWorks, where the library of existing films does not yet
provide enough revenue to offset periods without new hits.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Katzenberg, Geffen and Spielberg put up a total of
$100 million for two-thirds of the company. They have raised an
additional $900 million, principally from Allen, the co-founder of
Microsoft, who now owns 24.5 percent of the company, and from the
Cheil Jedang Corp., a Korean company. The company has also borrowed
about $500 million from Chase Manhattan, and $350 million from Bear
Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the price of $500 million Allen paid in 1995 for an
initial 18 percent stake, DreamWorks at the time would have had a
market value of $3 billion. ``A pure financial investor with a
preferred stock might look for a compound rate of about 20
percent,'' one venture capital expert said. By that reasoning,
DreamWorks should have a market value of about $6.4 billion today,
but no financial analyst interviewed for this article thought it
could fetch such a price.
</P>
<P>
   The founders, who say they are not looking to sell, note that
DreamWorks would not be the kind of company to start if the point
was a huge payoff by traditional measures. ``If we were simply
about where is the most amount of money for us to make, we wouldn't
be in this area,'' Geffen said. ``This is not the best arena for us
to make money. But it is the best arena for us to do what we do
with the least amount of interference. And what we believe is, over
time, we will build a very, very attractive, substantial library.''

</P>
<P>
   Geffen said DreamWorks had even begun paying down the money it
had borrowed from Chase Manhattan. ``Our investment spending has
peaked,'' he said. Just two weeks ago, Columbia Pictures wrote
DreamWorks a check for $100 million for half-interest in ``Almost
Famous'' and two yet-to-be-released films, ``Evolution'' and
``Everlasting Piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the cost of film production with other big studios is
one way to hedge against the industry's inherent financial risks.
Spielberg, who raised industry eyebrows during DreamWorks' early
years by making some films for other companies, plans to produce
and direct at least two and possibly three movies that will be
co-productions between DreamWorks and other studios. After ``A.I.''
for DreamWorks and Warner Brothers, he will produce and direct
``Minority Report,'' a science fiction film with Tom Cruise that
will be shared by DreamWorks and 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   It is Parkes and MacDonald who make the day-to-day decisions
about the live- action movies, while Katzenberg oversees the
animation division. But Spielberg's presence is felt throughout the
company's film business.
</P>
<P>
   When the producer Jake Eberts met with Katzenberg for dinner to
discuss DreamWorks' financing Eberts' film ``Chicken Run,'' for
instance, Spielberg joined them because he was familiar with the
work of the movie's directors, Nick Park and Peter Lord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeffrey did not just trot Steven out,'' Eberts recalled.
``Steven was very knowledgeable about their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Eberts said that Disney had also expressed interest in backing
the film. ``But Jeffrey pursued me with a terrierlike passion,'' he
said. ``Disney didn't have that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``A.I.,'' Geffen recalled, he and Spielberg were
flying to New York one day in 1996, when Spielberg told him that
``the best project he had read was `A.I.,' but he couldn't get hold
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The script, by the filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, was under
development by Warner Brothers. Geffen said he began a
two-and-a-half year effort to secure the project for Spielberg _ an
effort that involved ``endless conversations with Terry Semel,''
who was then the Warner Brothers chairman. ``Steve kept telling me,
`You're wasting your time; this is never going to happen,''' Geffen
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But after Kubrick died in March 1999, DreamWorks was able to
work out a joint venture with Warner Brothers for the project, with
Spielberg as director.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its success in films, the dream team has shown no
particular edge in the Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   A person familiar with the development of Pop.com said several
Internet experts had warned DreamWorks that the involvement of
Allen could ``make it harder to get distribution on AOL, Yahoo and
Microsoft because there was some resentment toward Allen at those
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   And with its substantial financing, Pop.com too often seemed to
throw money at problems, critics said. For example, Pop.com offered
Steve Martin $100,000 to make a two-minute film for the Web site,
even though there was no evidence Web audiences want short films.
</P>
<P>
   As Geffen is quick to note, DreamWorks is not the only
entertainment company to have failed on the Web. But the DreamWorks
failure was particularly public, and its executives were singularly
thin-skinned. After a critical article about Pop.com in The Los
Angeles Times in July, the unit's head, Kenneth Wong, brought a
pinata to work, pinned the writer's name on it and encouraged
staffers to batter it, a former employee recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Pop.com was dying last month, reports appeared about a
possible merger with Ifilm, which never materialized. It was only
the latest of rumors that DreamWorks was about to merge or sell or
mutate in one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   But the dream team is not interested in merging with anybody,
and there are no such talks under way at the moment, Geffen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started DreamWorks because it allows us to do what we do in
an atmosphere where we are in charge of it,'' Geffen said. ``We're
not frustrated by having to deal with other people and their
agendas and their priorities and their tastes. We're dealing with
our own.''

 &HT;    Sierra Leone refugees plea for humanitarian assistance

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Civil war has thrust a Greenville couple into
the democratic process in ways they never imagined a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel and Dorcas, 55 and 51, respectively, are newly
naturalized American citizens from the war-torn West African nation
of Sierra Leone. Anxious to vote in their first United States
presidential election, they are taking a crash course in American
politics by becoming advocates for their countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   The couple is urging the state's congressional delegation to
attend with them a Tuesday morning briefing on the Sierra Leone
civil war that will feature six child war victims explaining the
atrocities that left them with amputated arms, legs and ears.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Washington D.C. hearing, the amputees will undergo
medical treatment and receive prosthetic limbs donated by a Staten
Island, N.Y., businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel and Dorcas also are taking their story to the people of
Pitt County, who they hope will urge U.S. Reps. Walter Jones,
R-N.C., and Eva Clayton, D-N.C., to attend the briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know things are done through the people, through the
senators and the representatives,'' Daniel said. ``When the
American people learn (about people suffering) things can get
done.''
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA LEONE AND ITS WAR
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone is a hot, tropical nation the size of South
Carolina with a population of 5 million people, according to the
Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook 2000. A predominately
agricultural country, it is rich in mineral resources, namely
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   A former British colony, the country gained its independence in
1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most peaceful countries. We had one of the
first universities in the region,'' said Ibrahim, 36, a native of
Sierra Leone studying at East Carolina University.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ibrahim, Daniel and Dorcas fear their activism could
result in their families being harmed, they do not want their last
names published. Seeing how the war has destroyed that education
system upsets Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting here in the United States I see how important
computers are and I think about my son, watching him at 2 playing
on the computer, and think about the children at home. They have no
opportunity in this computer age.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this war they are being left back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The country is made up of multiple native tribes _ who practice
Islam, Christianity and indigenous beliefs _ but has never suffered
widespread ethnic, religious or tribal disputes, Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Civil war came to Sierra Leone in 1991. A rebel military leader
started the war, proclaiming the existing leadership corrupt,
Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Liberian dissidents, angry at Sierra Leone's
involvement in peacekeeping activities in that country in the
1980s, were backing the rebels, Daniel said. The two groups also
sought to control Sierra Leone's diamond industry, according to
Daniel and the human rights group Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   THE HUMAN COST OF WAR
</P>
<P>
   Daniel is a former professor of education. Dorcas is a nurse
mid-wife currently working at East Carolina University. They were
educated in the United States in the early 1970s. Although they
were given an opportunity to remain here, they wanted to return
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we should go back home and work and educate our own
people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorcas returned to the United States in 1989 to pursue an
advanced nursing degree. Daniel and their children remained in
Sierra Leone, but watched with increasing anxiety the civil war in
Liberia and the growing problems in their own country. Their
children came to the U.S. in 1990 and Daniel followed a year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult decision for me to make,'' Dorcas
said. A petite, bespectacled woman, her eyes tear up and her voice
quivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our country we used to take care of each other, we were a
very caring country. Now we find ourselves in this chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim left the country in 1996 with the help of a friend
already living in Greenville. His family lived in Makeni, whose
residents make up the majority of the diamond mine workers. The
town is a constant battleground between rebel and government
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he arrived in America, Ibrahim's mother and 20
other relatives were forced to flee Makeni for Freetown, the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   No one has seen his father in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to believe he is dead. But since it's been more
than four years, I believe I have a dad no more,'' Ibrahim said
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   An only child, Ibrahim is the sole supporter of his family. He
works on a hog farm to support his mother, his wife and son, and
other relatives. Last week he sent $1,000 to Sierra Leone so his
family could move out of their current one-bedroom apartment into
larger quarters. He also sends the family $100-$200 a month for
their living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel and Dorcas are helping support more than 200 family
members trapped in Sierra Leone. Nearly all of them have been
driven from their homes because of fighting. Three of the couple's
nieces have been raped with two becoming pregnant from the attacks,
they said. One girl was only 12 years old and the baby died shortly
after birth, Dorcas said. The third girl was so badly injured
during the attack, she nearly died.
</P>
<P>
   One of Dorcas' brothers also is missing. Daniel's sister and her
family were missing for months because they got lost in the bush
running from rebel forces invading their village.
</P>
<P>
   Many family members are living in refugee camps in neighboring
Guinea, Dorcas said. The government there forcibly expelled
thousands of refugees from the camps. The couple's parents also
died, having been driven from their homes by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not have been shot, but they had to suffer inclement
weather in the bush and they were old so their resistance was
low,'' Daniel said. Other than his father, Ibrahim said he does not
think any other family members are missing or dead. He wonders if
there is news his family hides from him.
</P>
<P>
   LEND A HAND
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to end the war, the Sierra Leone government held
democratic elections in 1996. The government's candidates
campaigned under then slogan ``give a hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels used the slogan to inflict a new form of terror _
amputating the hands, feet and limbs of men, women and children,
Daniel said. They would tell the victims to ask the president for a
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International reported 500 mutilation victims were being
treated in Freetown hospitals in early 1999. Recent figures are
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intimidation, Sierra Leoneans voted for the
government political party and locked out the rebels. However
President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah gave rebel leaders four key cabinet
positions, including supervision of the
</P>
<P>
   diamond mining region to prevent additional violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how our people are, they wanted peace so badly they
gave these four cabinet positions,'' Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations sent a peacekeeping force consisting of
Nigerian, Indian and Kenyan soldiers to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Kabbah's plan failed and the violence grew. In early 1999, rebel
forces attacked Freetown, but were repelled by Nigerian
peacekeepers. Up to 200,000 were left homeless and thousands were
killed, according to Amnesty
</P>
<P>
   International.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping mission has been a failure. United Nations
relief workers have been killed, humanitarian observers were taken
hostage, but later released.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer 11 British soldiers and several civilians
were taken hostage by rebels. When rebels staged mock executions
with the soldiers, the British government launched a rescue mission
that left one solider, one
</P>
<P>
   civilian nd numerous rebels dead.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights observers have accused Nigerian soldiers of
summarily executing people suspected of aiding the rebel forces.
The Indian government announced Thursday it is withdrawing from the
peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   NO EASY SOLUTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Currently the United States has 100 special forces troops in
Sierra Leone training 3,000 Nigerian and Ghanian peacekeepers to
better fight the rebels. Daniel said if these troops could get U.S.
air support, they would stand a
</P>
<P>
   better chance of beating the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   That idea sits uneasily with Ibrahim, who fears rebuilding the
country's military will only result in Sierra Leoneans killing more
Sierra Leoneans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost the solution to this problem and we need somebody
who can help us solve this problem,'' Ibrahim said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just tired and I do believe if the war stops. We'll
forgive. Our country is very, very small ... this is not a very
difficult war, it is not ethnic or tribal.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel wonders if there is any other solution other than more
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point I don't now how to get out of this without
further bloodshed,'' he said. The rebels are entrenched in the
mining region and he cannot see them negotiating until they are cut
off from their money supply. There are no current plans for the
United States to commit additional military resources to Sierra
Leone, said Malik Chaka, an African policy analyst with the House
International Relations committee.
</P>
<P>
   However the United States is providing humanitarian assistance
by helping disarm and integrate rebel forces back into their
communities and re-educating children kidnapped by the rebels and
forced into fighting. Since ownership of the diamond industry is
the heart of the civil war the international community has imposed
sanctions against the purchase of diamonds from Sierra Leone.
Still, sales are made on the black market and money for weapon
purchases is plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Dorcas said the international community should impose a ban on
the sale of ammunition and weapons to Sierra Leone and nations
suspected of supporting the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any country that cannot buy food for its people shouldn't be
allowed to buy ammunition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Until peace returns to Sierra Leone, either through diplomacy or
at the end of a gun barrel, Ibrahim, Daniel and Dorcas remember how
things use to be and hope for better times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so lonely (in America). There's no family, no children,''
Dorcas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I'm an American, let me go home and be a
missionary in the country of my birth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Friends of Sierra Leone is a non-government organization
consisting of returned Peace Corps volunteers and other Americans
concerned about the Sierra Leone Civil War. To learn how to assist
the victims of that war, contact the organization at

educated in the United States in the early 1970s. Although they
were given an opportunity to remain here, they wanted to return
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we should go back home and work and educate our own
people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorcas returned to the United States in 1989 to pursue an
advanced nursing degree. Daniel and their children remained in
Sierra Leone, but watched with increasing anxiety the civil war in
Liberia and the growing problems in their own country. Their
children came to the U.S. in 1990 and Daniel followed a year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult decision for me to make,'' Dorcas
said. A petite, bespectacled woman, her eyes tear up and her voice
quivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our country we used to take care of each other, we were a
very caring country. Now we find ourselves in this chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim left the country in 1996 with the help of a friend
already living in Greenville. His family lived in Makeni, whose
residents make up the majority of the diamond mine workers. The
town is a constant battleground between rebel and government
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he arrived in America, Ibrahim's mother and 20
other relatives were forced to flee Makeni for Freetown, the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   No one has seen his father in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to believe he is dead. But since it's been more
than four years, I believe I have a dad no more,'' Ibrahim said
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   An only child, Ibrahim is the sole supporter of his family. He
works on a hog farm to support his mother, his wife and son, and
other relatives. Last week he sent $1,000 to Sierra Leone so his
family could move out of their current one-bedroom apartment into
larger quarters. He also sends the family $100-$200 a month for
their living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel and Dorcas are helping support more than 200 family
members trapped in Sierra Leone. Nearly all of them have been
driven from their homes because of fighting. Three of the couple's
nieces have been raped with two becoming pregnant from the attacks,
they said. One girl was only 12 years old and the baby died shortly
after birth, Dorcas said. The third girl was so badly injured
during the attack, she nearly died.
</P>
<P>
   One of Dorcas' brothers also is missing. Daniel's sister and her
family were missing for months because they got lost in the bush
running from rebel forces invading their village.
</P>
<P>
   Many family members are living in refugee camps in neighboring
Guinea, Dorcas said. The government there forcibly expelled
thousands of refugees from the camps. The couple's parents also
died, having been driven from their homes by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not have been shot, but they had to suffer inclement
weather in the bush and they were old so their resistance was
low,'' Daniel said. Other than his father, Ibrahim said he does not
think any other family members are missing or dead. He wonders if
there is news his family hides from him.
</P>
<P>
   LEND A HAND
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to end the war, the Sierra Leone government held
democratic elections in 1996. The government's candidates
campaigned under then slogan ``give a hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels used the slogan to inflict a new form of terror _
amputating the hands, feet and limbs of men, women and children,
Daniel said. They would tell the victims to ask the president for a
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International reported 500 mutilation victims were being
treated in Freetown hospitals in early 1999. Recent figures are
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intimidation, Sierra Leoneans voted for the
government political party and locked out the rebels. However
President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah gave rebel leaders four key cabinet
positions, including supervision of the
</P>
<P>
   diamond mining region to prevent additional violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how our people are, they wanted peace so badly they
gave these four cabinet positions,'' Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations sent a peacekeeping force consisting of
Nigerian, Indian and Kenyan soldiers to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Kabbah's plan failed and the violence grew. In early 1999, rebel
forces attacked Freetown, but were repelled by Nigerian
peacekeepers. Up to 200,000 were left homeless and thousands were
killed, according to Amnesty
</P>
<P>
   International.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping mission has been a failure. United Nations
relief workers have been killed, humanitarian observers were taken
hostage, but later released.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer 11 British soldiers and several civilians
were taken hostage by rebels. When rebels staged mock executions
with the soldiers, the British government launched a rescue mission
that left one solider, one
</P>
<P>
   civilian and numerous rebels dead.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights observers have accused Nigerian soldiers of
summarily executing people suspected of aiding the rebel forces.
The Indian government announced Thursday it is withdrawing from the
peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   NO EASY SOLUTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Currently the United States has 100 special forces troops in
Sierra Leone training 3,000 Nigerian and Ghanian peacekeepers to
better fight the rebels. Daniel said if these troops could get U.S.
air support, they would stand a
</P>
<P>
   better chance of beating the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   That idea sits uneasily with Ibrahim, who fears rebuilding the
country's military will only result in Sierra Leoneans killing more
Sierra Leoneans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost the solution to this problem and we need somebody
who can help us solve this problem,'' Ibrahim said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just tired and I do believe if the war stops. We'll
forgive. Our country is very, very small ... this is not a very
difficult war, it is not ethnic or tribal.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel wonders if there is any other solution other than more
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point I don't now how to get out of this without
further bloodshed,'' he said. The rebels are entrenched in the
mining region and he cannot see them negotiating until they are cut
off from their money supply. There are no current plans for the
United States to commit additional military resources to Sierra
Leone, said Malik Chaka, an African policy analyst with the House
International Relations committee.
</P>
<P>
   However the United States is providing humanitarian assistance
by helping disarm and integrate rebel forces back into their
communities and re-educating children kidnapped by the rebels and
forced into fighting. Since ownership of the diamond industry is
the heart of the civil war the international community has imposed
sanctions against the purchase of diamonds from Sierra Leone.
Still, sales are made on the black market and money for weapon
purchases is plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Dorcas said the international community should impose a ban on
the sale of ammunition and weapons to Sierra Leone and nations
suspected of supporting the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any country that cannot buy food for its people shouldn't be
allowed to buy ammunition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Until peace returns to Sierra Leone, either through diplomacy or
at the end of a gun barrel, Ibrahim, Daniel and Dorcas remember how
things use to be and hope for better times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so lonely (in America). There's no family, no children,''
Dorcas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I'm an American, let me go home and be a
missionary in the country of my birth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Friends of Sierra Leone is a non-government organization
consisting of returned Peace Corps volunteers and other Americans
concerned about the Sierra Leone Civil War. To learn how to assist
the victims of that war, contact the organization at

 &HT;    I gave it a sporting chance, but this Game show's a flop
 &HT;    By The Practical Man
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The practical man had one heckuva column
worked up for you today, but you can't read it.
</P>
<P>
   Nope. 'Fraid not. Can't let you see it. How come? Because you're
too dang stupid!
</P>
<P>
   Hold your fire! The practical man didn't say that. His boss did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practical Man,'' she said. ``What is this garbage? `Legendre
Polynomials and Your Lawn,' `Better Parenting Through Resonance
Points.' Have you lost your mind? People don't want to read this
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could throw in a section on `Handbag Dynamics.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get smart with me. Now get out there and write about
something people care about. Write about clothes, or movies. Hey,
write about the Olympics!''
</P>
<P>
   Yuck! Do people care about the Olympics? But the practical man,
being a practical man, wasn't going to argue. Besides, it all pays
the same.
</P>
<P>
   So he went home and whipped out his beer cooler, wrapped himself
in the flag, wedged his widest end into a couch corner and cozied
up to watch and wonder. He saw a parade of princesses perform some
jungle gym tricks. He saw some fat dudes flip four tons of iron
over their heads. He saw that knuckleheaded Equatorial Guinea
swimmer flail and flop all alone in the wide, wide pool. He even
saw that Thorpedo joker and his size 17 feet.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to like it. Honest he did. But it just wasn't there.
The juices weren't flowing. The whole thing had no mo.
</P>
<P>
   The Games were lame. That was obvious. But who was to blame?
That would take some thinking, so the practical man pondered the
puzzler during two nights of TV torture. He tore it up, broke it
down, examined it piece by piece _ and he came up with two reasons
why Sydney's a snooze.
</P>
<P>
   REASON 1:
</P>
<P>
   THE EVENTS ARE PHONY.
</P>
<P>
   Do we really care who's balance beam champeen of the world? Of
course not. It's not only dull to watch kid after kid prance on a
fence post, it's downright depressing to imagine childhoods piddled
away in pursuit of such pointless perfection. And speed swimming _
why? Someone, and the practical man hereby volunteers, should pluck
those pimply punks out of the pool and bellow: ``Sweet mother of
heaven, move on! Cure the sick, write a book, build a bridge _ but
you've played Flipper long enough!''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the Olympics has lost its way. Originally,
the events were grounded in real life. Spectators could relate to
the javelin toss, the hammer throw, the chariot race, wrestling,
running, jumping, etc., because they were hunters, farmers and
warriors who swung, flung, fought, rode and ran every day. You
could admire the winners not only for their skill. You could admire
them as valuable members of society. Plus, you might pick up a few
tips.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Olympics is just a freak show. Here's a guy who can
run full-blast at a sawhorse, bounce on a springboard, twist and
tumble like a two-bit top and land on his feet! Here's another
who's devoted his life to pingpong! Wait! That fella's going to
launch himself kicking and flailing through the air and butt-flop
in a sand pit! And look, over there! Some maniac is going to ram a
3-foot sword down his gullet while walking through fire!
</P>
<P>
   Oops! Wrong circus.
</P>
<P>
   But you get the idea. Instead of the parallel bars, we need
Parallel Cars _ show us some fancy moves for getting around dumbo
drivers on I-95. Instead of the 1,000-meter relay, give us the
1,000-Errand Relay _ and see how many working parents perk up.
Instead of the high jump, institute the Teen Whump _ lots of us
have surly 16-year-olds whose attitudes we'd like to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   If we could see ourselves in the Olympics, it wouldn't be so
hard to care.
</P>
<P>
   REASON 2:
</P>
<P>
   WE ALREADY WON.
</P>
<P>
   Ugh! Oof! Ow! Arghhhh!
</P>
<P>
   That hurt, but don't worry. Extracting the painful truth is the
practical man's favorite pastime, and here's what he pulled out
today: The Olympics isn't about sports. It's not about ``human
drama.'' It's not about ``being the best you can be,'' or
``overcoming the odds,'' or any of that hokey bull they blare on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics is about war. It's weeny, watered-down war, but
it's war all the same _ and here's the kicker: We like it that way.
Nations can't wait to fly their colors, trumpet their fight songs
and pretend to send their champions onto the gory field to compete
for global dominance. And, heck yeah, we love the bloodless battles
because we get to see how our clan stacks up against potential
enemies _ without risking any real harm.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least we used to love them. We used to think it meant
something if the U.S. hockey team stomped the Russkies. We used to
get a jolt of comfort when our big, strapping boys whupped up on
those little Asian guys. We used to get worried when those
stone-cold European blondies marched over our hapless heroes. We
used to think the medal count pointed to some larger truth because
we used to think the Olympics resonated far beyond sports.
</P>
<P>
   But not anymore. For the U.S., the war's over. We won. We don't
seriously consider any other nation a threat, and so from our lofty
perch as the world's Big Daddy, The Games have become mere games.
And as games _ let's face it _ they stink. As games, they're just a
bunch of goofball, graybeard, gym-class mumbo jumbo that's just too
boring to watch. As games, in short, they're not even football, and
we all know how riveting that is.

JOB OUTLOOK GOOD FOR EX-AIG EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evan Greenberg, who until his resignation last week had been in
line to take charge of American International Group, the powerful
insurance company led by his father, Maurice R. Greenberg, is not
rushing to find a new job.
</P>
<P>
   But when he decides to make a move, several executive
headhunters said last week, he is likely to have an abundance of
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people will want to talk to him,'' said Robert R.
Stone, a partner in the recently formed executive search firm
Ceannas Inc., who has been in the business 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Greenberg, 45, may have received mixed reviews in the last
few years as he worked as an understudy to his acclaimed father,
the chairman and chief executive of AIG; and he may have been
somewhat in the shadow of his brother, Jeffrey, 48, who left AIG in
1995 and became chief executive of Marsh &AMP; McLennan, the world's
largest insurance brokerage firm. But out on his own, the experts
say, Greenberg is likely to be a hot commodity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a tremendous set of experiences at an incredibly
high-performing company,'' said Francis J. Lattanzio, another
partner at Ceannas. ``If you're going to compare him to Michael
Jordan,'' Lattanzio said, alluding to Greenberg's superstar father,
``everyone is going to fall short.''
</P>
<P>
   For Greenberg, this is a time for reflection, for standing back
after 25 years in insurance and thinking about whether the next 25
years will be in insurance or some other aspect of financial
services, or perhaps something entirely different. ``I'm going to
weigh things carefully,'' he said in a brief conversation.
</P>
<P>
   AIG says that instead of immediately picking a replacement, it
expects to parcel out Greenberg's responsibilities to several other
executives. Alice Schroeder, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, said that the company was likely to consider insiders as
well as executives throughout the industry, including some AIG
alumni, as the new leader.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, who had been president and chief operating officer,
gave up his claim on one of the most prestigious jobs in insurance
last Monday, just nine months after his father formally designated
him as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   He has been unwilling to speak in detail about what prompted him
to resign, and his father, who is 75, has been equally unwilling to
shed any light on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time for a change,'' Evan Greenberg said at one point.
``We're going to have to leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   People who have followed the company for years say the senior
Greenberg, who sets an exhausting pace, always expected even more
from his sons than from others. Moreover, even though Evan was the
heir apparent, it was not apparent that the top job would be
available any time soon _ while he was still relatively young. His
father is still trim enough to fit into the army uniform he wore as
an officer in Europe and Korea; he's still a killer on the tennis
court and still gleefully insists he has no plans to do anything
other than keep running the nation's most successful insurer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, Evan wanted to have more responsibility sooner
than Hank was willing to relinquish it,'' said M. Evan Lindsay, a
partner who specializes in insurance at Heidrick &AMP; Struggles
International, one of the biggest executive search firms.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely because he was being groomed to replace his father,
or, in the early days, at least to take some high position,
Greenberg has had an unusually wide range of experience. Rather
than becoming a specialist in life insurance, say, or property
casualty or investments, as is more typical, he has had a chance to
work in all those areas.
</P>
<P>
   He has had several jobs dealing with life insurance and was
responsible for both life and property casualty insurance when he
was in charge of AIG's businesses in Japan and Korea. He has headed
the company's lucrative international commercial insurance
division. And among his latest duties was oversight of commercial
coverage in the United States, as well as automobile and life
insurance. He has also been heavily involved in technology.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Greenberg, who became a master of insurance
without benefit of a college degree, was his father's designated
hitter made it difficult for outsiders to evaluate his performance.
``People weren't sure whether he got there entirely on the
merits,'' Lindsay said.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance there are not a lot of great job openings in the
upper strata of the insurance business or elsewhere in financial
services. But, Lattanzio said, it is not just a matter of what jobs
are visible right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unlike a high-profile athlete becoming a free
agent,'' he said. ``You can't just look at the existing openings. A
lot of things could develop.''

LIBERTY MEDIA AND NEWS CORP. SAID TO BE NEGOTIATING A DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John C. Malone and Rupert Murdoch are considering a deal that
would increase their investments in each other's companies,
according to people close to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The complex transaction would streamline the holdings of Liberty
Media, the company controlled by Malone, and would give Murdoch's
News Corp. a larger interest in Gemstar-TV Guide International, in
which News Corp. already has a 20 percent stake. And the deal could
put News Corp. in a better position to bid for the Hughes
Electronics division of General Motors. GM has said it is
considering an outright sale of the company, a merger or
partnerships and joint ventures with other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Media is a tracking stock of AT&AMP;T. Liberty's primary
business is owning stakes in cable programming companies, including
a 20 percent interest in Gemstar-TV Guide, which owns TV Guide and
provides electronic program guides like VCR Plus. That stake is
worth about $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, the cable entrepreneur, is considering putting that
asset, along with some cable holdings in Latin America, into News
Corp. In exchange, Liberty, which already owns 8 percent of News
Corp., would see its stake in the company increase to 20 percent
and would receive stock in News Corp.'s global satellite TV
operations, which the company is planning to take public in the
next month as a concern called Sky Global.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's willingness to take News Corp. stock is likely to be
seen as an endorsement of that company.
</P>
<P>
   For Murdoch, the deal, which has been under discussion for
months, would increase News Corp.'s stake in Gemstar-TV Guide to 40
percent. It could also provide more leverage in a bid for Hughes
Electronics, which owns DirecTV, the satellite TV business. Murdoch
has long wanted to expand his global satellite business, which
includes British Sky Broadcasting, to include a U.S. operation, and
the potential sale of Hughes affords that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the immediacy of News Corp.'s Sky Global offering,
along with any potential offer for Hughes, Murdoch and Malone are
under more pressure to resolve their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But there are important issues to be resolved in the talks. For
one thing, GM has told analysts it does not want News Corp. stock,
or at least wants part cash and part stock, largely because News
Corp. stock, tied as it is to the entertainment industry, is viewed
as particularly risky.
</P>
<P>
   If Sky Global, however, were able to raise more capital, that
might make a deal more attractive to GM, as might the possibility
of owning stock in Sky Global. But whether GM would take that stock
is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the GM move, Liberty and News Corp. are likely to
proceed with their talks. But it appears unlikely that Murdoch, who
has been zealous in maintaining the 30 percent control his family
has of News Corp., would give Malone anything but nonvoting stock.
Two of his four children, Lachlan and James, both work in the
family business.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is particularly complex because of Liberty's status as
a tracking stock of AT&AMP;T. It is not entirely clear whether Liberty
could make such a deal without AT&AMP;T's approval, and AT&AMP;T, or even
the government, might object to Liberty's attempt to increase its
holdings in News Corp.

NEW ECONOMY :  WEB-BUSINESS REVOLUTION CATCHES ON IN LATIN
AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   By   JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ At the recent Florida Trade Expo in the
American Chamber of Commerce here, a middle-aged man in a crumpled
business suit stepped up to a lectern that held a laptop computer
and, with two fingers, began to tap out responses to the onscreen
questionnaire. Name. Company. Number of employees.
</P>
<P>
   As he filled in the form, the staff from 1hemisphere.com _ a
Miami-based Internet company specializing in hemispheric trade _
detailed the benefits of his free membership: free e-mail; Web
service for his company's site; and a free virtual storefront to
transact business.
</P>
<P>
   With his registration complete, the small-business man, whose
Brazilian company exports technological components to Europe,
shrugged. ``We'll see what it is going to do for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees from 1hemisphere.com, along with one of its
competitors, latintrade.com, had come from Florida to Brazil to
participate in the trade show and try to convince the local small
and midsize businesses that a revolution is afoot. Operators of
these so-called e-marketplaces _ Internet portals through which
companies do business with one another _ are betting on the
democratizing power of the Internet to break down the traditional
information and trade barriers that confine most small companies in
Latin America to doing business within 30 miles of home.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of e-marketplaces for Latin America are potentially
enormous. With help from the Internet, sellers could reach a
significantly wider base of clients, raising profits for 10 million
small companies that still serve as the main employers and drivers
of growth throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   With greater access to information, buyers, in turn, might get a
better price in a more globalized market, increasing
competitiveness all around. And everyone could save money, compared
with the costs of closing the same deals in a world based on faxes
and phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   But revolutions don't happen in a day. E-marketplaces are still
struggling to work out the kinks that so far have impeded Latin
America's small businesses from reaping the benefits of
Internet-based trade. The payoff, if it comes at all, may not
happen for years.
</P>
<P>
   But the obstacles are not deterring Internet companies from
racing to stake a claim in the market for business-to-business
e-commerce in Latin America _ a market that is forecast to reach
$5.5 billion a year by 2003, according to figures published in a
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter report in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just had the big bang,'' said Anna Giraldo Kerr,
research manager for IDC Latin America, an Internet consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, hemispheric portals are following the lead of
various e-marketplaces already in operation in the United States.
The owner of a zipper company in Rio de Janeiro, for example, can
post his products on a bulletin board on the 1hemisphere.com Web
site. While surfing the site, a jeans maker in Lima, Peru, finds
that the Rio zippers are cheaper than those available locally,
clicks over to the zipper maker's Web site via 1hemisphere.com and
places an order. From the 1hemisphere.com site, the zipper maker
lines up a shipping company, calculates the price of import duties,
converts the whole thing into Peruvian currency and e-mails a bill
to the jeans maker.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 1hemisphere.com earns a commission on the completed
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last two years, we have seen that small businesses in
Latin America are finding out that they get a better return on
their money if they export, especially if they send their products
into the North American market,'' said Jose Matto, president and
chief executive of 1hemisphere.com. ``Part of what we are doing is
just match-making.''
</P>
<P>
   But the challenges are huge, starting with the typical mind-set
of the very professionals who are expected to use the service _
business executives who are battle-scarred by the region's history
of economic troubles, like the sky-high inflation that once plagued
Brazil. Today, of the 10 million or so small and midsize businesses
in Latin America, only about a million have any kind of Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   While substandard networks and high costs can partly be blamed
for the delay to adopt new information technology, much of the
reticence may also be psychological. The Internet may still be seen
as too cold and anonymous in a region where many people are more
comfortable sealing deals with a handshake and a thump on the back.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome such resistance, some portals are signing up large
corporations to serve as anchor buyers. The premise is that small
companies will be eager for the opportunity to land a big contract
with a big customer they might not otherwise have access to. For
example, Asista.com, another of the Miami crop of e-marketplaces,
recently signed a letter of intent with the Mexican conglomerate
Axa SA de CV to buy all its office supplies and equipment through
the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not going to start from the small guys getting religion
all of a sudden,'' John Mein, president of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Sao Paulo, said of the e-marketplace movement. ``It is
going to push through the economy from the top down. For the small
companies to compete, they are going to have to step up their
investments in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if more small Latin American companies do venture
online, they will still face other obstacles to cross-border
commerce. Shipping companies are few. Export financing is hard to
come by. Legal issues can be confusing. And many costs remain
hidden within stacks of bureaucratic paperwork. Through strategic
agreements with banks and logistics companies, the region's
e-marketplaces are just now starting to find ways to confront these
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these models have to be proven, and they require the
backing of banks and other institutions to prove that they are
going to be done in the proper way,'' said Jaime Vargas, chief
executive of Mercantil.com. ``It will require some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Time, of course, takes money. Which is why the region's
e-marketplace players will need to fine tune their approaches and
marshal their resources, if they hope to be still in business when
the revolution finally catches up with them.

JOINT EFFORT SET TO COMBINE CELL PHONE AND HAND-HELD COMPUTER
</HEADLINE>
  By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Motorola Inc. and Palm Inc. plan to announce Monday that they
will collaborate on a new portable phone that would put the
features of a Palm hand-held computer into a device closer to the
size and shape of a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said they had signed an agreement to use
Motorola's wireless technologies, product line and distributors and
Palm's core hand-held software technology. The effort is an
extension of an agreement in December 1999 under which Motorola
took a minority stake in Palm.
</P>
<P>
   This deal, coming after a similar agreement last year between
Palm and Nokia, could be a blow to Symbian, a consortium set up by
Ericcson, Psion, Nokia and Matsushita Electric Industrial. Symbian
has created a standard operating system, called EPOC, for wireless
devices. In addition to Palm OS, the competition for Symbian also
includes the Microsoft Windows CE operating system for mobile
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Zafirovski, president of the Motorola PCS division, said
the company had been working with its own operating system, as well
as Palm and Symbian, and planned to continue all three efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously a number of companies are working with various
devices,'' he said. ``We're absolutely convinced that putting our
two companies together will produce the right product for the first
quarter of 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palm arrangement with Motorola differs from those it has
with Nokia, Qualcomm and Kyocera, which are straight licensing
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes Motorola unique is it's jointly branded, and we're
working closely together,'' said Alan Kessler, Palm's chief
operating officer for products and platforms.
</P>
<P>
   The first product of the collaboration is to be a GSM wireless
phone, expected to be available early in 2002, which will initially
be distributed through the existing Motorola sales channels. GSM is
the cell phone standard commonly in use in Europe and Asia, and the
use of it is beginning to expand in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Combining technologies from both companies, the device will
contain a larger color screen than standard mobile phones and will
include Palm's HotSync software and over-the-air synchronization
using the Starfish TrueSync software from Motorola. Synchronization
allows the hand-held device to keep up to date with information on
the user's desktop computer. Zafirovski said the device would be
larger than the smallest cell phones, but smaller than a typical
Palm device.
</P>
<P>
   Prices have not been set yet.

Washington; one of her closest advisers, Harold Ickes, a lawyer, is
renowned in national political circles for his mastery of the use
of so-called soft money. So it was that, her public posturing
notwithstanding, Clinton did not come easy to the deal she and her

A PLAYWRIGHT WHO CREATES PEOPLE, NOT ROLES  
 BY ROBIN POGREBIN  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dialogue resembles nothing you've heard before in
the theater, except perhaps in a Pinter play. It sounds like a
conversation overheard on a street corner, bus or public basketball
court. And that, says Richard Maxwell, who wrote and directed
``Boxing 2000,'' which opened last week on the Lower East Side, is
exactly the point. He wants his characters to sound like real
people, not like actors trying to sound like real people.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I ask somebody to read a piece of what I've written,
typically the first reaction is to make it into something that is
`real,''' Maxwell said. ``My feeling is, it's already real because
you're doing it. It's not another reality that you're trying to
create. You're seeing what happens in the moment, which is, for me,
the highest reality.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this too-true-to-be-true quality of ``Boxing'' that Ben
Brantley of The New York Times said makes Maxwell a talent worth
marking. Audience members may ``experience the quickened, hopeful
heartbeat that comes from watching that rare phenomenon, a
genuinely original new talent at work,'' Brantley wrote in his
review. ``It's a sensation that's felt all too rarely these days.
Watching Mr. Maxwell's work makes you think of what it must have
been like to stumble upon the baffling but seductive creations of
the young Sam Shepard in the early 1960s in the East Village.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Boxing'' _ which was produced by the New York City Players
and runs at the Present Co. Theatorium through Saturday _ and in
Maxwell's other works like ``House'' and ``Cowboys and Indians,''
characters speak in the flat tones that have become the
playwright's signature. But Maxwell said he does not tell his
actors to talk that way, nor does he conceive of his own work as
having a certain consistent style. Rather, he said, he simply
encourages the people who perform his work to strip away artifice,
say the lines and not move too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a specific quality that I'm going for,'' Maxwell
said. ``For me it's a process of removing the things that are
encouraging the person to be a performer as opposed to a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were a style, I don't think it would have the life that
it has under the surface,'' he added. ``Even though they're
standing still, these people are always working, they're always
looking for moments together.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, while on the surface the characters in ``Boxing
2000'' seem devoid of emotion, delivering their lines without
inflection, one comes away with a sense of knowing them,
understanding where they are from and caring about where they end
up. Somehow the less demonstrative their behavior, the deeper they
seem. There is Jo-Jo and his brother, Freddie, who talk about
boxing and what to buy their father for his birthday; Marissa, who
together with Freddie does a tentative verbal and physical dance of
flirtation; and Freddie's father, who pushes his son to perform in
the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm conscious when I write something that this has the
potential to be tender,'' Maxwell said. ``At the same time if you
try to make it tender, it ruins it.''
</P>
<P>
   The actors who play these roles don't seem to be acting. Many of
them don't even know how to act; while a few came to the show with
professional experience, the rest have little or none. That is why
Maxwell cast them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of trained and nontrained people creates some
interesting and unexpected effects,'' he said. ``A lot of what
training does is allow you to cope with the fear of performing, to
deal with that extraordinary thing, to go up in front of people and
perform these tasks. I think a lot of times training allows you to
deny the anxiety, the fear. And I would much prefer to see people
afraid and brave.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Tejeda, who plays Freddie's father and delivers his
lines in both English and Spanish, has worked for the last 11 years
at the Brooklyn Hebrew School for Special Children. According to
his program biography, ``This is his acting debut and he is putting
everything he has into this role.'' Lakpa Bhutia, who plays the
referee, has appeared in several of Maxwell's plays (and said in
his biography, ``He would like to thank Maxwell for the new bell on
his bike'').
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell, a lanky 32-year-old with choppy hair and pale skin, is
no household name either. Though he has developed a loyal following
in downtown theater and his previous work has been well received by
critics, he continues to succeed slightly below the radar. He comes
from West Fargo, N.D. The youngest of six children, Maxwell was
raised with an appreciation of theater, given that his father, a
district judge now retired, was an amateur playwright and active in
community theater. (His mother, also retired, was a lawyer for the
Environmental Protection Agency.)
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell watched his sister, Jan Maxwell _ now an accomplished
actor who will be appearing in the Neil Simon play ``The Dinner
Party,'' on Broadway this season _ perform in high school plays,
appeared in a few himself and went on to study acting at Illinois
State University. After college he won a fellowship with the
Steppenwolf Theater Company and while in Chicago helped found the
Cook County Theater Department, a company that challenged the
principles of traditional acting training, like the idea that a
scene cannot work without the presence of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to just kind of break things down,'' Maxwell said.
``We were convinced we could come up with our own rules, so we
broke them all.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to New York to seek out the Wooster Group, a theater
company whose experimental approach Maxwell and his colleagues had
long admired. He started out sweeping the stage, stayed on for
about five months and then one thing started leading to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself in a community of downtown theater people,''
Maxwell said. His first play, ``Burlesque,'' was produced by the
Ontological Theater. Then ``Clowns Plus Wrestlers'' was staged at
the Kitchen. His plays _ many of which have songs that Maxwell
wrote _ have toured Europe. On Oct. 2 he is going to Dublin and
then on to Paris with ``House,'' which was produced at Performance
Space 122 and won an Obie award last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing'' was originally commissioned by New York University's
experimental theater program in December 1999. Maxwell said he was
interested in writing about boxing because when he was about 10 his
father _ who had fought a few times in his youth _ showed him a few
moves and told him he had real promise. Maxwell described the
moment: ``He said you have some skills, and I'll train you on one
condition, that you give up everything and focus on boxing. There
will be compromises and sacrifices, and if you do this, you will be
the greatest fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell added: ``I think I know my dad a little bit better now.
He's got a pretty dry sense of humor.'' Maxwell _ his young head
spinning with nightmarish thoughts of brain damage _ said he was
``scared out of my wits'' at the prospect of a boxing career and
never mentioned the subject again. Nevertheless boxing remained an
interest, and Maxwell said that writing this play prompted him to
start training at a gym near his home in the Greenpoint section of
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only meant to the dramaturgical,'' Maxwell said. ``It's
a great way to stay in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he added, ``everybody's doing it.''

mess.'' But look at the stories she has to tell. This sequel to her
acclaimed 1995 memoir, (beginitalic)The Liars' Club(enditalic),
takes her from a scrappy adolescent to a bored and rebellious
teenager about to leave for California with a truck full of boys,
her ticket out of the dreary Texas refinery town that had held her
captive for so long. Though she tries to make us think otherwise,
Karr's life in this book has an air of stability. Both parents are
finally under one roof for good (Karr's mother was married seven
times, twice to Mary's father), and her adolescent longings are not
so different from those of a thousand other girls. But if it's less
harrowing than (beginitalic)The Liars' Club(enditalic), its appeal
is the same: Karr is a born storyteller. Mary's voice is funny,
irreverent, profane, defiant and irresistible. And just think.
She's in her 40s. There might be more memoirs to come.

   He called her things like ``Nancy Pants'' and ``Nancy Poo'' and
``First Mommie'' in his letters, and they are so guileless and
unabashedly adoring that it seems almost voyeuristic to read them.
Over the years she kept them in a shopping bag, of all things, and
when Alzheimer's disease began to destroy his memory and his
ability to write anything at all, she took the letters out and
found solace in them. Now Nancy Reagan has written a biography of
her marriage and sprinkled it with her husband's letters. Many are
reproduced as he wrote them, some on White House stationary. The
book ends with a photograph of the couple on his birthday in
February, and with her thoughts on seeing her husband through this
last, difficult chapter of his life. Alzheimer's is truly a long
goodbye, she writes, ``but it's the living out of love.'' Royalties
will go to the Alzheimer's Foundation and to the Ronald Reagan

<P>
   By Edward Kanze

<P>
   This was their plan: They would have no plan. Inspired by the
writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson (''The health of the eye seems to
demand a horizon.'') to dump their dreary office jobs and travel
unfettered, and drawn to Australia by Kanze's recurrent dream about
kangaroos, they pulled up stakes and followed their noses. Kanze
and his wife were naturalists. Setting out to make the acquaintance
of Australia's wildlife, they met up with monitor lizards, snakes,
crocodiles and quicksand, as well as some friendlier natural
wonders. They spent nine months driving around the country. That's
a lot of Australia for readers to absorb, but our appetite for it
is big right now. And Kanze? He overplays his role as a latter-day
Odysseus, but there's something engaging about a man who deplanes
in Melbourne and says to his wife, ``We're not in Kansas anymore.''
And what do you know, he's still dreaming about kangaroos.

LUCENT AND MAPINFO TO SELL LOCATION-BASED WEB SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Responding to a growing sector of the wireless Internet
industry, Lucent Technologies and MapInfo Corp. are expected to
announce Monday that they will jointly develop location-based
services for mobile communications devices.
</P>
<P>
   Location-based services are one of the fastest-growing and most
heavily promoted parts of the wireless Internet industry. According
to one example of technology that companies like MapInfo, Lucent
and others are developing, a cell-phone user would be alerted when
near a restaurant serving a cuisine he or she likes and would be
provided the chance to view the menu and make reservations.
</P>
<P>
   MapInfo, based in Troy, N.Y., develops software to let
businesses use geography to analyze their markets. Lucent, based in
Murray Hill, N.J., is a leading maker of communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   While concerns over individual privacy and the technical
feasibility of location-based applications have been raised, some
companies are betting that the advertising and revenue potential
for wireless communications carriers will be substantial. Lucent
and MapInfo plan to package their services and sell them to network
carriers instead of to individual consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll provide the picks and shovels to make the pinpointing of
a consumer globally an attractive option,'' Mark Cattini, president
of MapInfo, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   MapInfo and Lucent plan to base their services on existing
technical formats that are more common in Europe than the United
States _ like the wireless application protocol, or WAP, and the
global standard for mobile communications, or GSM. The companies
plan to make their services available for mobile phones and Palm
handheld devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been concern over the fortune spent on wireless
licenses in Europe, so we're presenting carriers there with a way
to recoup some of their costs,'' said Stacey J. Gelman, Lucent's
vice president for mobile Internet operations.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the companies plan to upgrade their services to be
made compatible with the next generation of wireless formats
expected to appear over the next several years. The next generation
of formats may allow for much faster wireless Internet access, but
the slow pace of the rollout has been a stumbling block for
companies seeking to develop wireless Internet applications.

SHOCKING BRITISH ART IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE ROUTINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It is far from proven that newspapers sell art, but art
certainly seems to sell newspapers in Britain these days. At least
that must be one explanation for the enormous space given to
London's contemporary art scene by the British press. Newspapers no
longer cover major art shows as cultural events but as news
stories, while the media's devotion to the celebrity cult routinely
turns YBA's _ as young British artists are now known here _ into
show-biz stars.
</P>
<P>
   True, the key variable in all this is perhaps not art, but
shock: art and artists are usually only deemed worthy of the news
pages if their work or behavior can be presented as scandalous.
Thus, given the intense competition among Britain's nine morning
newspapers, any art that might conceivably give offense _ say, a
maggot-filled cow's head (Damien Hirst) or an unmade bed plus used
condoms, soiled underwear and liquor bottle (Tracey Emin) _ is
assured of ample coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Young artists, new galleries and old museums all seem eager to
play their part in this Faustian bargain: loads of publicity,
rising prices for contemporary art and good crowds for exhibitions
in exchange for what a British art critic, William Feaver, calls
``headline art.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before it opened this week, the Royal Academy of Arts' new
exhibition, ``Apocalypse: Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art,''
received press coverage here that even Monet and Cezanne would
envy. It helped of course that the show includes a life-size wax
figure of Pope John Paul II being struck down by a meteorite, a
large pile of garbage and a jumbled video that includes brief
images of live sex (forbidden viewing for those under 18).
</P>
<P>
   The once-venerable Royal Academy is again playing the game,
eager to match the success of ``Sensation: Young British Artists
From the Saatchi Collection,'' which drew 300,000 visitors in 1997
thanks to massive media attention and a controversy over a portrait
of an English child murderer made with handprints of children.
(When ``Sensation'' went to the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1999, it
was Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's noisy objection to elephant dung
attached to a painting of the Virgin Mary that ensured the show was
noticed.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, in fairness, ``Apocalypse'' is not simply more of the
same. It escapes some of the criticism aimed at ``Sensation'' in
that it does not show works from the private collection of Charles
Saatchi, the wealthy former advertising executive who more than
anyone is responsible for the rise of the YBA's. Only 5 of the 13
artists in this show are British, only 2 of them _ Darren Almond
and Dinos Chapman and his brother, Jake _ are YBA veterans of
``Sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems not to have changed is the desire of the Royal
Academy _ and its exhibitions secretary, Norman Rosenthal _ to
cause an uproar, although Rosenthal describes his intent as that of
challenging received wisdom about art.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole, people like what they know, and the older they
get, the more they insist on liking only the things that they
know,'' he explained in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph.
``Their minds don't want to open up. They don't want to face
psychological, social and aesthetic realities about the world
they're living in. They want it to be pretty.'' And he added, ``Art
is not there to make the world a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   As a self-supporting institution, though, the Royal Academy does
need art that draws good crowds in order to pay its way. And it
doesn't hurt to have a high profile in the media.
</P>
<P>
   And the Royal Academy is hardly alone.
</P>
<P>
   The massive publicity that surrounded the opening of the new
Tate Modern this spring has already brought more than two million
visitors Tate Britain, housed in the old Tate Gallery on Millbank,
recently made a bid for attention by holding its own contemporary
show, ``Intelligence: New British Art 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   This month in the run-up to ``Apocalypse'' the London press
opened its columns to a Gillian Wearing retrospective at the
Serpentine Gallery through Oct. 29. Wearing, a video and photo
artist who won the coveted Turner Prize here in 1997, does not in
fact exploit shock. Rather, her thoughtful work focuses on the
clash between external and internal appearances, as in ``Trauma,''
in which mature people wearing youthful masks recount painful
moments of their childhood. What caught the media's eyes, though,
was ``Drunks,'' a 23-minute three-screen black-and-white video of a
group of drunks staggering about her studio.
</P>
<P>
   Days later the Saatchi Gallery opened ``Ant Noises II'' _ ``ant
noises'' being an anagram of ``sensation'' _ to display the latest
additions to the Saatchi collection. The show, which runs through
Nov. 26, includes works by Hirst, Emin, the Chapman brothers, Jenny
Saville, Sarah Lucas, Gavin Turk, Ron Mueck and Gary Hume, who were
all part of ``Sensation.'' They and assorted other opening night
London trendies duly filled the gossip columns.
</P>
<P>
   Reviews by art critics may stir interest, but even negative
coverage in the news pages awakens curiosity and draws crowds. For
example David Aaronovitch, a columnist in The Independent, poked
fun at many of the works in ``Apocalypse,'' but he nonetheless said
he enjoyed himself. ``It's innovative, brash, callow, shallow and
sentimental, which itself is significant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of commentators ready to trash the entire
YBA boom as a market-driven exercise in self-promotion. ``The shed
is Art now, you see,'' wrote Anna Murphy, the arts editor of The
Sunday Telegraph, of the beach hut in Emin's latest work, ``and if
you don't understand why, that's because you are not clever or cool
enough _ a case of emperor's clothes if ever there was one.'' On
the other hand, to draw attention to her article, it was
accompanied by photographs of Mick Jagger, Stella McCartney, Steve
Martin and ever-present YBA's at the opening of ``Ant Noises II.''

BP AMOCO AND RWE'S OIL UNIT ARE EXPLORING A JOINT VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  By SUZANNE KAPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ BP Amoco is in talks to form a joint venture with the
oil and gas arm of RWE AG, the German utility, people close to the
discussions said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, RWE is expected to announce on Monday that it has
agreed to buy Thames Water for 4.3 billion pounds, around $6.25
billion, or 12.15 pounds a share, in cash, these people said. RWE
would also assume 2.4 billion pounds, or $3.5 billion, in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations with BP Amoco, the British energy concern, are
preliminary and an agreement is not imminent, these people said.
They also did not rule out the possibility of an outright sale of
the unit.
</P>
<P>
   A joint venture between RWE's oil and gas arm, called DEA, and
BP Amoco would have about 2,600 service stations and a leading
position in Germany's market. The venture could be valued at more
than 2 billion pounds, said one person close to both companies'
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would bolster BP Amoco's presence in Germany, where
it holds a 7 percent market share. The company, already a leading
oil and gas supplier in Britain, has said it is looking to expand
its refinery and service station operations in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For RWE, shedding DEA, which it acquired from Texaco in 1988,
either through a joint venture or an outright sale would allow the
company to gain economies of scale that would help mitigate rising
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   DEA produces about 4 million tons of oil a year, but its
refineries _ of which it owns two and has stakes in two others _
sell 19 million tons to service stations. That gap leaves DEA
vulnerable to price fluctuations on the 15 million tons it must buy
in the open market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have high oil prices, the big multinationals can use
economies of scale to ride this out,'' one person close to the
talks said. ``For RWE, this deal would make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   RWE has also discussed possible options with Royal Dutch/Shell,
but those talks were unsuccessful, the person said.
</P>
<P>
   An outright sale as opposed to a joint venture of DEA would be
more in line with RWE's strategy of divesting noncore businesses in
order to better focus on expanding its presence in the European
utility market.
</P>
<P>
   RWE currently operates electric, water and waste-management
services in about 120 countries, but its purchase of Thames Water
would be its first foray in Britain.

 &HT;    Each fall, magic of nature paints trees with new colors
 &HT;    By Jill Young Miller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pretty soon you'll start to notice something magical
happening outside.
</P>
<P>
   Leaves will start turning amazing colors. It will be fall.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists don't understand all the complicated things that go
into the trees' yearly display of color. But here's some of what
they do know:
</P>
<P>
   Three factors affect the colors you'll see: weather, pigments
found in the leaves, and the length of the nights.
</P>
<P>
   COLORS TO KNOW
</P>
<P>
   Two of the pigments are always present in leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chlorophyll'' produces the leaves' green. It also produces the
tree's food.
</P>
<P>
   Chlorophyll captures the sun's energy and uses it to make food
from water and carbon dioxide. During the food manufacturing
process, chlorophyll is constantly used up.
</P>
<P>
   During the growing season, chlorophyll keeps being replenished
and the leaves stay green. As autumn creeps in, though, the
chlorophyll is replaced more and more slowly. Finally, other colors
_ yellow, brown and orange _ begin to show through when the
chlorophyll isn't replaced. ``Carotenoids,'' which are always
present in leaves but are masked by chlorophyll during the spring
and summer, cause the changing color of hickories, ash, maple,
cottonwood, sycamore and many other trees.
</P>
<P>
   Carotenoids are in many living things, including carrots, corn,
canaries, egg yolks and bananas.
</P>
<P>
   The third pigment isn't present in leaves during the growing
season. It develops in late summer in the sap of leaves. This
pigment is called ``anthocyanins,'' and it brings out the reds and
purples you see. Anthocyanins also color cranberries, red apples,
blueberries, cherries, strawberries and plums.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer growing season, the chemical ``phosphate'' is
at a high level. It helps break down sugars made by chlorophyll.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, phosphates move out of the leaves and into the
stems. When this happens, the sugar breakdown changes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, anthocyanins are produced.
</P>
<P>
   Anthocyanins show up most vividly in Georgia's maples, oaks,
sourwood, sweetgum, dogwood, black gum and persimmon trees. These
pigments often combine with the carotenoids' colors to produce deep
oranges, fiery reds and bronzes.
</P>
<P>
   BEST AND BRIGHTEST
</P>
<P>
   As we pass through fall and into winter, the days grow shorter
and the nights longer. Trees stop producing chlorophyll because
there is less light.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest color comes when trees are exposed to sunny days
and crisp, cool nights. Why? Such weather produces a lot of sugar
in the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cool nights and the gradual closing of the leaves'
veins will prevent their sugar from moving out. As a result,
anthocyanins are produced.
</P>
<P>
   After the veins close completely, the leaves fall from the tree.

 &HT;    Sacred Jewish days are almost here
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is an Awesome time for Jewish people. For 10
days, beginning at sundown Friday, they will observe the Days of
Awe.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning and end of this time are the most sacred days of
the year for Jews. The Days of Awe begin with Rosh Hashana and end
with Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Rosh Hashana means ``head of the year'' and is the Jewish New
Year's Day. The Jewish New Year will mark the beginning of the year
5761, according to the Hebrew calendar. The best-known symbol of
the day is the shofar, or ram's horn. A person blows the horn,
which makes a loud piercing noise, during worship services.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jews buy new clothes and get haircuts to symbolize a fresh
beginning at New Year. Round bread, or challah, is served as part
of the New Year meal to symbolize the circle of the year as another
one is ready to start.
</P>
<P>
   Jews think of Rosh Hashana as the anniversary of when God
created the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yom Kippur, or the Day of Atonement, ends the Days of Awe. On
Yom Kippur, Jews are supposed to say they are sorry to people they
have hurt and to God for mistakes they have made. They also are
expected to do without food during the holiday and are supposed to
concentrate on thinking about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish holidays begin and end at sundown, so Rosh Hashana and
Yom Kippur are celebrated from one evening to the next. At the end
of Yom Kippur, the ram's horn is blown a final time.
</P>
<P>
   When the 10-day period is over, many Jews share a festive meal
to celebrate their fresh start.

 &HT;    Gore wants more oil
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore called on the
president last week to use several million barrels of emergency oil
to help ease the cost of fuel. Gore said he was concerned that
current high oil prices could make it more difficult for some
low-income people to heat their homes this winter.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, Republican George W. Bush, said the move was
purely political and could threaten the country's national
security. Middle Eastern countries recently agreed to produce more
oil, but Bush says they could strap the United States if they
slowed production after the United States taps into its emergency
supply. Oil reserves are held in case the nation goes to war or
loses its oil supply from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   BOMB AT SPY HEADQUARTERS
</P>
<P>
   England's secret agents appear to be the target of a small
missile fired at the country's international spy headquarters in
London. Officials say the terrorist attack last week was done at
night and caused little damage to the building. The British
government does not know who fired the missile.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups opposed to the peace process between Britain and
Northern Ireland have been blamed for planting bombs in London this
year. But a London anti-terrorist officer says any number of groups
being investigated by the spy agency could be responsible for the
missile.
</P>
<P>
   The building was shown in the James Bond movie ``The World Is
Not Enough,'' and was blown up by a terrorist bomb in one of the
movie's scenes.
</P>
<P>
   MAYOR UNDER INVESTIGATION
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell (above) said last week he was being
targeted by the FBI because he is black. The three-term mayor
admitted that federal officials are looking into whether he is
involved in a possible corruption case in Atlanta and Fulton
County. This summer a Fulton County commissioner, a high-ranking
county staffer and a local contractor pleaded guilty to charges of
accepting or offering bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has called the probe ``an inquisition'' and said the
FBI has ``never been a friend of the African-American community.''
However, Atlanta's chief federal prosecutor and the agent in charge
of the FBI in Atlanta are both black.

 &HT;    Jim Lehrer will bring respectability to presidential debates
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The winner in the debate over the debates is . .
. Jim Lehrer. And maybe viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The low-key, soft-spoken anchor of PBS's ``NewsHour'' was chosen
as the moderator for all three presidential debates between George
W. Bush and Al Gore. Do we care? Sure. We're civic-minded citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Bush lobbied for Tim Russert and Larry King; Gore didn't
publicly express a preference. Does the man or woman in the middle
of a debate make a difference?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that interviewers can make a tremendous
difference,'' says Roderick P. Hart, professor of government and
communication at the University of Texas. ``If the interrogator is
confrontational or flippant, it can throw a candidate off his
stride.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: During the 1988 debate, CNN's Bernard Shaw asked
Gov. Michael Dukakis how he would feel about the death penalty if
his wife Kitty were raped and murdered. It was a tasteless,
incendiary question that deserved to be ignored or criticized.
Instead of expressing outrage, however, Dukakis responded like an
unemotional wonk, reiterating his opposition to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think viewers would turn on the questioner instead of the
politician, and sometimes they do. When Dan Rather's interview with
President Bush turned hostile years ago, the CBS anchor was deemed
arrogant. Similar feelings emerged about ABC's Sam Donaldson,
accused of being disrespectful for shouting questions at President
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``But ultimately, the reporter's influence only has an
immediate, not a long-term effect,'' Hart says. ``People tend to
remember a faux pas made by the candidate, rather than the
interrogator's behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to imagine Lehrer firing off insulting
questions. He moderated both presidential debates between President
Clinton and Sen. Bob Dole in 1996 without ruffling any feathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Lehrer is a good choice, provided the rules permit him to
follow up, which they didn't last time, and provided candidates are
able to engage each other with cross-questioning, which they
weren't last time,'' says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the
Annenberg School of Communications at the University of
Pennsylvania. ``The format and the rules are much more important
than the moderator.''
</P>
<P>
   The three debates are set to take place Oct. 3, Oct. 11 and Oct.
17. The first one will follow the traditional format recommended by
the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, with Gore and
Bush standing at attention and Lehrer asking questions. The second
will have a talk show format with the candidates sitting at a table
with Lehrer. And the third will be a town hall meeting, with the
candidates taking questions from the audience and Lehrer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp pushed for the nontraditional formats because Bush
is more comfortable in conversational settings. Gore is considered
a stronger debater in the traditional format.
</P>
<P>
   Hart says he understands why the Bush camp initially pushed for
CNN's Larry King, but says he's perplexed by the choice of NBC's
Tim Russert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry asks the kind of questions Bush is adept at answering,''
Hart says. ``Larry creates a chatty, homey kind of encounter that
allows the candidate to reveal personal experiences and attitudes,
how he feels about the issues. Tim Russert, on the other hand, is
issue-based and a lawyer by training. His investigative tactics are
very much there, and he might investigate things that aren't the
governor's strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer may not swoop in and bang away on tough questions or bark
out multiple follow-ups. And he definitely won't ask Bush or Gore
hypothetical questions about violent acts and their wives. He's too
smart and too polite for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Lehrer probably won't affect how the governor or the vice
president will be perceived,'' Hart says. ``That's why he's
acceptable to both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Lehrer moderate a scintillating debate? Probably not. If
the debates take their tone from the moderator, they'll be fair and
even-handed, but the candidates will have to spark their own
excitement. If the commission really wanted to entertain us, they'd
bring in Geraldo Rivera and Rush Limbaugh to moderate.
</P>
<P>
   HALFTIME REPORT ON OLYMPICS:
</P>
<P>
   Bob Costas is doing a fine job holding the prime-time coverage
together, and the tape-delay hasn't ruined my viewing experience so
far. BUT, the NBC Sports gurus have made a few bad decisions that
ticked off more than a few people during the first week in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The commentary during most of the women's and men's triathlon,
except for the last half-hour or so, was clearly added after the
races had take place. Nobody expects NBC to carry time-heavy sports
such as the triathlon and marathon in full, but bounding in and out
of the events with a dramatic narration instead of real-time
commentary is irritating.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pleasure to see NBC including profiles of non-American
athletes. All too often, U.S. television ignores the rest of the
world, but NBC had good pieces on Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe and
tiny Turkish weightlifter Halil Mutlu, to name just a couple. But
when it came to covering women's team gymnastics, the network
showed the American and Australian women, who stumbled, and
practically ignored the super-talented Romanian, Russian and
Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming coverage, on the other hand, has been fine _ good
play-by-play and analysis and entire competitions shown.
</P>
<P>
   With all the time NBC has to package its tape-delayed
broadcasts, it should reassess and improve its packaging at the
halfway mark.

 &HT;    'Spilling Open' touches hearts across the country
 &HT;    By Sharyn Wizda
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat on the bench outside of class today and talked to Jon.
</P>
<P>
   I read to him from my journal, it was the part about the
accordian player I was watching on the street last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   He said that an accordian is such a perfect metaphor for love,
because you are always opening, and closing, shifting and getting
air, and that's how the music happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Could you spill yourself onto a page and publish it? Sabrina
Ward Harrison didn't intend to, either.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison was 18 when her art teacher told the class to go get a
big blank book and start a journal. She'd never kept one, and at
first she resisted. But then she found a welcome respite for all of
her feelings _ light and dark.
</P>
<P>
   What happens after age nine?
</P>
<P>
   Because of the fear, we don't trust our life, our story, or our
magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I had really respected my voice a little
bit and could look back and see the evolution of my life,'' says
Harrison, now 24. ``So as I was beginning to keep this journal and
doing book covers for graphic design class, I started thinking
about what's inside all these books. Why were we just doing the
covers? Why didn't we know what was inside of them?''
</P>
<P>
   That was the seed of ``Spilling Open,'' a lush, illustrated
journal of Harrison's 18th year that is as much art as it is book.
At the urging of a trusted friend and author, Harrison submitted a
sample of the pastiche of drawings, photos and collage to a
publisher in her native San Francisco. Weeks passed, and just after
she got ``the rejection talk'' from her dad, Harrison got the nod
from editor Becky Benenate.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Women have this sadness, and they don't know where
it comes from, and I hope you'll be able to speak about that and go
into those places,' '' Harrison remembers. ``I knew at that point
that I wasn't going to be made into this cookie-cutter
inspirational (writer).''
</P>
<P>
   I think that what is left un-lived + unexpressed in love, hurts
the most.
</P>
<P>
   There was no launch, no advertising, no slick releases mailed
out. But ``Spilling Open'' spoke to people. Maybe it was the
multimedia look of it _ huge loopy script in some places, tiny
block printing in others, layered over swatches of deep color,
charcoal drawings and old photos. It sold more than 20,000 copies
on word of mouth, garnering reviews on Amazon.com such as, ``I
opened this book and found myself,'' from an Indianapolis reader.
And so Random House picked it up, reissued it and is sending
Harrison out on a mini-tour to spill open at book readings. She'll
be in Austin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been absolutely incredible. It's so scary, because I'm
not an extrovert, but OK, I'm going to stand up and read a bunch of
really personal writing and wonder what they're thinking,''
Harrison says. One really poignant comment a woman made in Seattle
was that, `This isn't just for women to give their daughters. We
need to be following this, we need to be our authentic selves.' ''
</P>
<P>
   I've been consumed by all this living up to something, to ``be
something!'' ``express something!'' we have such a longing to be
understood and loved why? can't it be just this now? without armor
and sheilds just myself.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, much has changed for Harrison since she penned
``Spilling.'' She painted the sets for Sixpence None the Richer's
video for ``There She Goes,'' she traveled through Italy (the
subject of her next book, due out next fall), and she's currently
designing clothes. But ``Spilling'' still serves as an anchor, one
she's reminded of each time she does a reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm finally feeling strong and brave and feeling very
comfortable with myself,'' he says. ``It's been so many years of
struggling with that _ I think that's an exciting thing to have:
`Wow, I'm reading this and I'm realizing I've come through it.' ''

RENEWAL 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, network executives have bemoaned the fact that the
audiences of their flagship 6:30 p.m. newscasts have slowly
dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   With a variety of cable television and Internet outlets now
offering the news of the day, at any time of day, people are less
compelled to watch the evening news shows on CBS, NBC or ABC.
</P>
<P>
   But one audience for general news is actually expanding: the
growing Hispanic population. The combined audience for the 6:30
p.m. evening newscast on Univision and Telemundo, the two major
Spanish-language TV networks, has increased by more than 40
percent, from an average of 1.4 million in 1993 to nearly 2 million
in 2000. During the same period, the three network newscasts have
lost nearly 30 percent of their household audience.
</P>
<P>
   So the broadcast news executives are starting to take notice.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Oct. 2, ABC will begin running a Spanish-language
audio track for ``World News Tonight.'' It will be offered each
night in 33 major TV markets over SAP, or secondary audio program,
which is available on television sets equipped with stereo sound.
Though many viewers probably do not even know they have it, the
system, which runs alternative audio tracks for programs when
provided, is activated with the push of a button on the remote
control or TV set.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives said they were considering offering a similar
service during ``NBC Nightly News,'' with Tom Brokaw. CBS said that
it was planning to provide an SAP translation of the presidential
campaign debates and that it was seriously considering offering SAP
audio tracks for other CBS newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Though it seems like an attempt to simply draw a larger
audience, the decision to offer the translation, said Paul Slavin,
the ``World News Tonight'' executive producer, was made on
principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pure gut,'' Slavin said. ``It is a large population,
which I don't think is particularly well served by any of the
broadcast networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a study released last week by the National Association
of Hispanic Journalists found that the number of news segments
focusing on Hispanics or Hispanic-related issues increased 35
percent on CBS, ABC and NBC from 1998 to 1999. But those segments
still represented only 1.2 percent of the total shown that year.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason for that increase? The Elian Gonzalez story.
</P>
<P>

   China Relents a Bit In Censorship Case &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The coffee table book about the Clinton administration looked
innocuous enough: 227 pictures of the president clowning with staff
members, smiling with his family and hob-nobbing with foreign
dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   But, like many illustrated books, the album, by the former White
House photographer Robert McNeely, was manufactured in China, and
Chinese customs officials saw it differently. Spotting one picture
of President Bill Clinton chatting with the Dalai Lama, the
spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism and an icon of Tibet's
cultural autonomy from China, they stopped 17,000 copies of the
book at its bindery last month. To top it off, customs officials
then blocked the printing of two other books from the same
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Chinese officials apparently loosened when they
agreed to allow the White House book out of the country. The book's
publisher, Nicholas Callaway, of Callaway Editions, said Chinese
officials offered no explanation and never relented on the other
two titles.
</P>
<P>
   China officially controls the content of everything printed in
its territory, but several publishers of illustrated books could
not recall any other books blocked for political or religious
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very pleased,'' said Patricia Schroeder, president of the
American Association of Publishers, adding that censorship remains
a problem in the United States, too. The publishers' association
and other book industry groups are holding a ceremony on Monday at
the Library of Congress to honor four people who supported the
wildly popular Harry Potter books when some religious groups
criticized the books for glorifying wizardry. Translations of the
Harry Potter books go on sale next month for the first time in
China, where the government officially discourages superstitions,
and publishers await official reaction.

   `Big Brother' Has Not Been Voted Off CBS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' the CBS reality series that did not become a
hit, winds up its run on Friday, hoping to light some last-minute
ratings sparks.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of how well the show does this week, the series
is close to winning a second life on CBS. Executives from both the
network and the show's production company, Endemol, said a renewal
announcement awaits only some last details.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest is over control of things like casting and
daily production, elements that CBS executives believe Endemol fell
short on largely because it misread both American television and
American culture. CBS will want more hands-on control of future
versions of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Even Endemol executives have conceded that the American version
of the show played out in ways radically different from previous
European versions, all of which were far bigger ratings successes.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, CBS said it was satisfied with the ratings, which,
while never spectacular, always improved the network's previous
summer showing, especially among young viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, many CBS executives expressed disappointment with
the show _ but never so much that a second edition was threatened.
A new session could be ready as soon as February, Endemol
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' will eliminate one of the four remaining house
guests on Wednesday and collect votes from the audience on Thursday
and Friday to choose among the final three.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's finale will be a live show, with the third-place
finisher announced first. Then the host, Julie Chen, will enter the
house and sit down with the last two contestants before she tells
them who gets the first prize of $500,000. Second place is worth
$100,000, and third $50,000.

 By SARA PARETSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some months ago I had a letter from a reader who was so furious
she covered four pages by hand, demanding to know why my books were
``infested'' with political issues. ``When I buy a mystery, I
expect to be entertained,'' she wrote, ``and when you bring in all
that stuff about homeless people, you aren't entertaining me.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought of writing back to say that mysteries ARE political.
Peter Wimsey staunchly defends an England where everyone knows his
(or her) place and is happy in it. Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade
inhabit a landscape filled with explicit sexual politics. Raymond
Chandler's women reek of sex, as Marlowe complains in ``The Little
Sister''; Dashiell Hammett's women, like Brigid O'Shaughnessy, try
to make good boys do bad things. But Marlowe and Spade are both too
moral for them.
</P>
<P>
   Mysteries, like cops, are right up against the place where
people's basest and basic needs intersect with law and justice.
They are by definition political. That's one reason I like to write
them as well as read them.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, it seemed too hard to explain this in a
letter, so I did what I usually do with such an angry reader: sent
the woman the price of a book and got on with my work, which is as
a storyteller, a writer whose stories take place in the world of
law, justice and society.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of my correspondent again later, when I was giving a
reading at the Newberry Library in Chicago. A group of nine women
stayed until everyone else had left. They told me then that they
were married to steelworkers, to men who had not been able to find
work for more than a decade as the global economy sent their jobs
out of the country. They themselves were working two jobs to keep
roofs over their families and food on the tables. These weren't
great jobs; a neighborhood with 50 percent unemployment doesn't run
to great jobs. They were cashiers at convenience stores or
waitresses in diners. They told me they hadn't read a book since
they graduated from high school, until one of them heard on the
radio that the heroine of my detective novels, V.I. Warshawski,
came from their own neighborhood, South Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   V.I. grew up under the shadow of the steel mills. She went to
the University of Chicago on scholarship, but she's a blue-collar
gal. The women at my reading said they had never thought that a
book could tell them something about their lives until they read
one of mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We buy them in hardcover,'' one of them said. ``V.I. helps us
face the terrible things that have happened to our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   My first impulse was to say, no, don't put your hard-earned
money into a hardcover book. But fortunately I had the grace not to
blurt that out, to see that buying the books was an important
physical touchstone.
</P>
<P>
   My next, meaner-spirited impulse, was to go back to the woman
who'd written me and say, see, this is the point: I'm a
storyteller, I'm an entertainer, but the stories that come to me
are almost always those of voiceless people, not those of the
powerful. These South Chicago women were entertained, they had a
few hours' escape from the relentless round of work, housecleaning,
angry depressed husbands, adolescent sons who couldn't find jobs,
daughters marrying too young with nothing to live on. My books
entertained them, but they also gave them courage.
</P>
<P>
   I don't like social-political novels, books written only to make
a point to show that four legs are better than two, or all males
are testosterone-crazed villains, or that women invariably use
their bodies to subvert male morality. There's a reason that the
writers we know from Stalin's Soviet Union are Pasternak and
Akhmatova, not Gribachev, who wrote ``Spring in the Victory
Collective Farm.'' Pasternak may have wanted to make a point, a
most ardently felt point, about human freedom, about the confusion
that one feels in the midst of social upheavals and how hard it is
to know how to act. But he wanted to write about human beings
caught up in events, not idealized political types.
</P>
<P>
   I don't sit down to write books of social or political
commentary. Both as a reader and a writer, I'm pulled by stories,
not by ideas; I see the world in the stories of the people around
me. It's just that the stories that speak most to me are those of
people like the women from South Chicago who can't speak for
themselves, who feel powerless and voiceless in the larger world.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that all writers come to their craft from a sense of
being on the margins of life, of seeing the world with an
outsider's eye and needing to make sense of it. Certainly that was
true of those master storytellers Dickens and Eliot, and I suppose
it's true of me as well.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in the '50s, in eastern Kansas, in a time and place
that contemporary moralists point at as the golden era in America,
before Vietnam and drugs and feminism and black power caused
permanent upheaval in our landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time and place where we girls knew our inevitable
destiny was marriage, where only bad girls had sex beforehand and
then reaped our inevitable punishment. I grew up the only girl in a
household of boys, where my parents _ eccentric outsiders in a
Protestant and Republican landscape when it came to religion or to
civil rights _ conformed rigidly in their sexual politics. Home was
for me personally, specifically, a place where my value lay in
housework and baby-sitting, not in an education leading to the
careers envisioned for boys.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up barely able to speak above a whisper, so fearful I was
of the criticism that dogged almost anything I said or did. I
retreated young into the world of stories, of happy endings, for
the heroines I created, as well as the ones I read about.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When I first escaped from that milieu, it was to come to Chicago
in the late '60s. The same summer that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. was trying to organize for open housing and equal pay in
Chicago, I arrived to do community service work on the city's South
Side. He was organizing near the blue-collar, mostly Lithuanian and
Polish neighborhood where I had been assigned.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't then and don't now hold any brief for the fears that
turned into bottle-throwing, car-burning hate in Marquette Park
that summer, or led whites to sell their five-room homes at a loss
and flee in terror for the western suburbs. But even at 19 I could
see that neither the banks, the real estate agents, nor the city
government cared one iota about the dreams or fears centered on
those tiny bungalows. Everyone around me felt powerless, the blacks
denied access to jobs and decent housing, the whites living just
half a rung above on the economic ladder and clinging to it in
panic.
</P>
<P>
   That summer I felt a sort of desperate need to start writing
down the lives of people without voices. Instead of princesses who
lived happily ever after, after that summer I began writing about
ordinary people whose lives, like mine, were filled with the anomie
that comes from having no voice, no power. Even then I still felt
so voiceless myself that it was another 12 years before I tried to
sell my work: so fully had I absorbed the indoctrination of my
Kansas childhood that I couldn't imagine myself writing outside the
home, couldn't imagine that my words might speak to other people.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens moved from the remotest margin _ the debtor's prison _
to the center of the Victorian page, as the most-sought-out man of
his age. The big house, servants, important visitors, high-fee
lecture tours, five-figure contracts never brought him security.
Nor did they obscure for him the underpinnings of Victorian
affluence: the array of homeless children without nutrition or
education, sweatshops, crime arising out of pressures of the vilest
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens romanticized the virtues of the poor, but he didn't
sentimentalize the circumstances of their poverty. His books are,
as my letter writer put it, infested with social politics, but
people still lined up by the thousands on the wharves in Boston to
wait for the ship that was bringing the next installment of his
work.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred fifty years later we still live an affluent life
with an array of homeless children suffering from malnutrition and
maleducation under our noses: the elephant in the living room we
all ignore. A century after my grandparents met walking a picket
line for the ILGWU, we still have sweatshops in this great land of
ours. We still have crime, homelessness, parents selling their
children for a nickel bag and a host of other ills. If a master
storyteller like Dickens could find his most compelling stories
within that landscape, who am I to turn away from it?

 &HT;    M'Bengue's star not shining as bright
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Truth in advertising _ that's what worried Maty
M'Bengue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did an Olympic commercial with IBM,'' said M'Bengue, the
former Ohio's Central State basketball star who's playing for the
Senegal women's team here in Sydney. ``The thing is playing on
television in Australia and they play it up on the big screen at
the arena here, too. In that commercial, I talk about African
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   She lowered her voice and glanced in the direction of the
basketball court where Slovakia had just run roughshod over her
winless Senegal team, 68-32, Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm a little concerned,'' she said. ``I wish our play
matched my words.''
</P>
<P>
   M'Bengue's lament follows a string of Olympic losses: 96-39 to
Australia, 82-48 to Brazil, 62-41to Canada and 75-39 to France.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been horrible,'' said Marieme Lo, the all-time leading
scorer for Central State basketball, who is now a Wright State
graduate student working in the school's athletics department. ``We
didn't have much time to prepare our team _ nothing like the U.S.
team and some of the others _ but even so, we should be playing
better than this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back home in Senegal, they say people are criticizing us. In
the newspaper, they said they did not know us. They said we play
like little girls.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a falsehood for you.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who has followed CSU's nationally-ranked teams knows,
M'Bengue and Lo are two of NAIA program's greatest stars.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the early 1990s, the sturdy, 6-foot-3 M'Bengue was
the school's first NAIA All American and one of its most prolific
scorers. Her biggest contribution, though, may have come a couple
years later when she convinced Lo, her younger cousin, to skip
studying in Paris and instead, follow her to CSU.
</P>
<P>
   Lo, like M'Bengue, was close to an all-A student even though
classes were in English, not her native Wolof or the French she
learned in school. As a basketball player, she was a two-time Kodak
All-America selection and,
</P>
<P>
   in 1998, was named the NAIA Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Sydney, those skills were basically kept under wraps.
The overwhelmed Senegalese coaches played Lo very little. Even so,
Lo made the entire Sydney Dome crowd roar Sunday when she drove on
a Slovakian player and scored easily.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old M'Bengue _ a veteran of 110 iternational matches
_ got more playing time and had more success. She had 16 points
against Brazil and in the opener against France, her defense helped
shut down their top post
</P>
<P>
   player.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, there were few shining moments for the
Senegalese, except the play of Astou Ndiaye, who parlayed a college
career at Southern Nazarene into her current berth on the WNBA's
Detroit Shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astou didn't join us until last week,'' M'Bengue said. ``The
rest of us have only been together two weeks. We just weren't
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Lo agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have money like a lot of the other teams, so we don't
travel,'' Lo said. ``But to compete at this level, you have to play
a lot of international games.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the 28-year-old Lo said it was ``an honor'' to
represent her nation as an Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always watch the Olympics on television and you wonder
what it would be like to actually compete in the Games,'' she said.
``It was exciting and yet I wish I could have played to my
potential here. I wish I could have
</P>
<P>
   shown some of the things I did at Central State.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two women talked, both brought up their former college on
several occasions. ``Just last week, I called Coach Pat
(Tramble),'' M'Bengue said. ``I stay in touch with her. She and
Coach (Theresa) Check always gave us so much support.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what was missing here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until today, we had the Minister of Support coming to our
games,'' Lo said. ``Today, I didn't see him here. Maybe he got
tired of the losing and decided to stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minister of Support pulling his support, now there's a case
of someone not living up to his billing.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A cool rain will occur to the north of a low pressure center as
it moves from the western Ohio Valley early on Monday to the Middle
Atlantic Coast on Monday night. High pressure over southeastern
Canada will block the northward progress of the rain, keeping most
of the Great Lakes states and northern New England dry. Farther
south, showers and some strong thunderstorms will erupt in the
humid air from the northern Gulf of Mexico States to the Carolinas
and northern Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   After a cold dawn in the northern and central Plains, abundant
sunshine will raise afternoon temperatures to within a few degrees
of normal. The southern Plains will remain cool for this time of
year. Showers will dampen the lower Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, a strong warming trend will begin in the Rocky
Mountains. The Southwest will be sunny and hot.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: EQUINOCTIAL STORMS
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes in the Midwest and blinding snow in the northern
Rockies late last week were part of an unusually stormy period
around the autumn equinox. Ancient mariners believed that the
vernal and autumnal equinoxes were likely to be accompanied by
severe storms. In fact, there is no meteorological basis for these
so-called equinoctial storms. Strong storms derive energy from
contrasting air masses. It is true that thermal differences tend to
be large in the transitional seasons of spring and fall. But,
fierce storms are no more likely around the equinox than on other
days at this time of year.

 &HT;    Buford- Bailey's comeback came up short
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ It was a bittersweet realization.
</P>
<P>
   ``My baby turns 2 on Wednesday,'' Tonja Buford-Bailey was saying
Sunday night. ``And now, I guess I'll have a lot more time to plan
a big birthday party for him.''
</P>
<P>
   She managed a smile, but it didn't hold.
</P>
<P>
   That's not how she wanted to do things at the Sydney Olympics.
The idea here simply had been to handle those birthday plans on the
run.
</P>
<P>
   A bronze medalist at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, Buford-Bailey
wanted to be running in the 400 meter hurdle finals here, Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hoped to be make it through the rounds and maybe even give
him a medal,'' she said. ``That would have been a great gift. It
would've been great to take to show and tell.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, little V.J. still will have quite a rollercoaster tale
to tell.
</P>
<P>
   It would be about his mother's unlikely comeback from a two-year
layoff _ an absence that left her running such poor times she
considered quitting the sport until a stirring performance at the
U.S. Olympic Track and Field
</P>
<P>
   Trials sent her to her third straight Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike 1996, Buford-Bailey didn't come in here one of the
favorites. She was part of a pack of contenders a stride off the
pace and that is how it played out in Sunday's preliminary heats.
</P>
<P>
   Running a 57.02 _ considerably off the 54.80 seconds qualifying
time she ran in the Trials to get here _ Buford-Bailey finished
fourth in her heat. Only the top two finishers from each of the
five heats _ along with the next six fastest times _ advanced to
the semi-finals. In all, the top 16 hurdlers moved on.
Buford-Bailey ran the 18th fastest time.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco's Nouzha Bidouane topped everyone with a 55.38. Deon
Hemmings _ who runs for Jamaica and won gold in the event at
Atlanta _ was second at 55.44. Catherine Scott Pomales, who also
runs for Jamaica, advanced as well with a 56.17. The other two
American hurdlers in the event, Sandra Glover and Kim Batten made
the semis, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran better when I was just a kid in Barcelona,''
Buford-Bailey admitted once the cameras were gone. Just 21 at the
1992 Games, she was the youngest member of the U.S. Track and Field
team and advanced to the semifinals before being ousted with a
55.04.
</P>
<P>
   She still holds the record for the second fastest time ever run
by a woman in the 400-meter hurdles. The 52.62 she ran in the world
championships in Goteborg, Sweden, was just 1/100th of a second off
the 52.61 Batten ran in the same race. The two marks have stood
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's toughest,'' Buford-Bailey said. ``When you're
number two in history and have been at a certain level, it's hard
to go out like this. I know I've got better in me. Some of the
girls who beat me tonight, I've beaten this year. But that's the
kind of up- and-down year it's been for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings said that's been the case for several people this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '96, there were three of us (Batten, Buford-Bailey and
herself) who were dominating everything, but this year, there's
been so many of us at one level, you never know who's going to be
at their best that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings won her heat convincingly and that means a Sydney
postcard soon will be arriving at Central State: ``This is my third
Olympics and at each one, I send a postcard back to Ohio for my old
coach (Josh Culbreath) and his son, Jahan (the current track coach
of the Marauders.) I want them to know that because of them _
because of a lot of the things I got at Central State _ I am
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Buford-Bailey's didn't need to put a stamp on her thanks. She
could just look in the stands where her mother, son and husband,
Victor Bailey, were sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the costs of travelling to the other side of the
world, her mother, Georgianna Buford, originally had planned to
come to Sydney and stay in a tent, thanks to a trip donated by
Dallas church group. At the last minute _ due, in part, to her
daughter's Olympic star power _ she was included in a program
funded by Anheuser Busch. She is staying in a plush Sydney resort.
</P>
<P>
   Everything had seemed to fall into place for Buford-Bailey at
these Olympics. After an arduous comeback that often had her on the
verge of quitting the sport she first learned back home at the
Northwest Track Club, she pulled off an unbelievable
come-from-behind finish at the Trials. In sixth place with just two
hurdles left, she passed three women before the tape to make the
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   She made up her mind to enjoy this trip and early on she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``This chick is a riot,'' said Batten, her rival and friend.
``I've been hanging around with Tonja and she makes you laugh
anyplace, anytime. I'm sort of the big sister and she's the fun
sister. Her energy gets into everyone around her.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that wasn't the only infectious thing going
through the Olympic Village. Several American track and field
athletes have fallen sick in the last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a virus going around,'' said Buford-Bailey,
who said she was felled by it, as were most of her 12 housemates.
``Monique Hennegan (400 meters) got sick, then Amy Rudolph (5000
meters), Kelly Blair (heptathlon), one of the pole vaulters, a
triple jumper and even Kim got something. People are getting
diarrhea, they're vomiting and they have headaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been taking people out and quarantining them. We all
were definitely afraid. Kim and I went to the coach and said 'get
us Lysol, Pinesol _ whatever.' I poured the stuff on a cloth and
wiped down everything, toilets, doorknobs, sinks, the entire room.
I did everything I could and I thought I had it whipped.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday night, Sydney's Games-long superb weather suddenly
turned miserable. It became cold and windy and soon after
Buford-Bailey's race, it was pouring. Whether it was the
conditions, the lingering virus, or simply
</P>
<P>
   the rusty truth, Buford- Bailey's comeback came up short.
</P>
<P>
   Relegated to lane 8, she started well, but after the fifth
hurdle, it looked as if she suddenly dropped an anchor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really doing good until about 5,'' she said. ``Then, my
body started talking to me. I thought I just burned out. I hit the
wall and could barely lift my legs. That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Batten said, don't count Buford-Bailey out in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind that laughter is one tough lady,'' Batten said. ``I've
competed against her so long, I know just what she's made of. She
just needed a little more time to come around. By this time next
year, she'll be right back up there at the top
</P>
<P>
   And that means little V.J. better enjoy this birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   If Mom has anything to do with it, next year's will be done on
he run.

   NAZI-SOAP _ On a cool March day in 1970, four green-gray bars of
soap were buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Atlanta. About 35 people,
most of them survivors of European concentration camps, attended
the service. None had any doubt that they were laying to rest the
remains of human victims transformed by a last act of Nazi cruelty.
Ben Hirsch escaped the Holocaust as a child and assisted in the
burial. He devoted a chapter to the incident in a memoir published
this spring, urging scholars to take a closer look at the topic. As
a result, historians of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum have
barred Hirsch from conducting a book-signing on the premises in
Washington. Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt, who
triumphed over a Holocaust denier in a British libel trial this
year, endorses the decision. Nazis certainly gassed, tortured and
starved millions to death. But there's no proof that Nazis made
soap of their victims, the museum officials said, and the
institution won't endorse any book that argues otherwise.

   WIS-SWING-VOTERS (Green Bay, Wis.) _ After almost 14 years in
office, Tommy Thompson bestrides Wisconsin politics like a
colossus. But he has never managed to carry his state for his
party's presidential nominee. This time, however, the governor
recently proclaimed, ``I'm not worried.'' If not, he's the only
politician in Wisconsin who isn't. The race between Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore is breathlessly close, in
the estimation of political pros in both parties. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   CHILDREN-MEDIA (Undated) _ In Washington, the debate has focused
on violent films, recordings and electronic games and how they are
marketed. But some childhood development experts contend that the
issue is not just what children see, but how and where they see it.
Private household choices _ where to put the family computer or
video game console, how many television sets a household owns _ can
greatly affect the impact these entertainments have. As more of the
machines find their way into children's rooms, ``the whole pattern
of use of mass media works to isolate children from adults,'' said
William Damon, director of the Stanford University Center on
Adolescence. By John Leland.

   INVESTOR-PROTECTION (Undated) _ At a time when millions of
Americans have taken their money out of federally insured banks and
put it into brokerage firms, the Securities Investor Protection
Corp., charged with protecting the investing public, has never been
more important. But a close look at the organization shows that the
safety net that investors believe SIPC offers is in fact full of
holes. Indeed, it is a far cry from the agency on which it was
loosely modeled, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (A Special
Report.) By Gretchen Morgenson.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-WEB-RIGHTS (Undated) _ The XVII Olympic games may eventually
be remembered for many things, but it will surely be a benchmark in
the struggle between those who hold intellectual property rights in
sporting events and those seeking to cover it for the
ever-expanding universe of news outlets on the Internet. Worried
that the power of the Internet will undercut the television
audience and undermine the economic foundation of the modern
Olympic movement, the International Olympic Committee is going to
extraordinary lengths to control how and where the images and
accounts of the Sydney extravaganza reach the public. By Felicity
Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   PRISON-HEALTHSERVICE (New York) _ It was founded 22 years ago by
a registered nurse who was disturbed by slipshod medical care he
witnessed at a suburban Philadelphia county jail. Today, Prison
Health Services is the central piece of a $400-million-a-year
corporation, one that delivers everything from dental check ups to
cardiac care to 175,000 inmates in 28 states across the country.
But as PHS moves to take on the greatest challenge in its history _
a nearly $100-million-a-year contract to care for 13,000 prisoners
at New York City jails _ some government officials say it has
occasionally failed to deliver quality care.

REAL FIGHT OVER MEDIA VIOLENCE IS BEING FOUGHT IN LIVING ROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Ohio, Calif.)  By JOHN LELAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In their home in Yellow Springs, Ohio, Will Lapedes and his
parents were negotiating a conflict over electronic turf. Will, 14,
wanted a computer in his room. For his parents, this raised a red
flag. ``We wanted to be able to see the screen,'' his mother,
Maureen Lynch, said. So they compromised, putting the machine in
the hallway outside his room. From this roost, he chats online,
looks at sports Web sites, and plays an array of video games. Most
of them, he said, are ``pretty gory.''
</P>
<P>
   As members of the Senate Commerce Committee prepare for Round 2
on Wednesday in the debate over violent entertainment, they may
want to peek over the shoulders of children like Will. Well-spoken
and polite, he described a game called Team Fortress Classic, which
he plays online. ``There are ways to make it very funny and gory,''
he said approvingly. ``When you kill somebody, it makes 25 times as
many body parts fly.'' His parents used to talk to him about the
carnage on-screen, he said, but now they rarely say anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't love it,'' his mother said. ``But if we said he
couldn't, he would go to a friend's house and play them.'' Like
many children who play grisly video games, Will seems able to leave
his aggression on the screen. He plays such games, he said,
``because I like it. What more reason do I need?'' Keeping the
computer in the open at least lets his parents see what he is up
to.
</P>
<P>
   In homes across the country, this has become the private front
of the culture war. In Washington, the debate has focused on
violent films, recordings and electronic games &UR;  &LR; and how they are
marketed. But some childhood development experts contend that the
issue is not just what children see, but how and where they see it.
Private household choices _ where to put the family computer or
video game console, how many television sets a household has _ can
greatly affect the impact these entertainments have.
</P>
<P>
   As more of the machines find their way into children's rooms,
``the whole pattern of use of mass media works to isolate children
from adults,'' said William Damon, director of the Stanford
University Center on Adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Even where the programming is benign, the array of video games,
televisions, computers, DVD's and music systems creates a virtual
world where adults often fear to tread. ``Parents don't feel they
have access to their children's electronic worlds,'' Damon said.
``In lots and lots of ways, parents have stepped back from
believing kids need their guidance, including a `no.'''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a few decades ago, most children did not have
their own bedrooms, let alone the electronic isolation available to
today's teenagers. Among children ages 8 to 18, 45 percent have
video game players, and 21 percent have computers there, says
``Kids and Media at the New Millennium,'' a 1999 survey by the
Henry J. Kaiser Foundation, 65 percent have TV's in their bedrooms.
Though televisions in children's rooms may seem commonplace, their
takeover has been sweeping. In 1970, only 6 percent of
sixth-graders had sets in their rooms; by last year, the figure had
risen to 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a family room in Jersey City, N.J., last weekend, Jamie
Niskanen-Singer, 12, loaded a Nintendo 64 game called Turok 2:
Seeds of Evil, which is rated ``Mature 17+. Animated Blood and
Gore. Animated Violence.'' His father, Howard Singer, watched as
Jamie used the ``cerebral bore'' gun to rip a character's head
open. Jamie said the action helped him relax, ``because I have
control of what's going on,'' unlike with television.
</P>
<P>
   His father, apparently getting his first taste of Turok,
conceded, ``It is a little violent, but we think he can
differentiate between a game and real life.''
</P>
<P>
   This separation in the home contributes to a ``fracturing of
family life,'' said John Murray, a professor of developmental
psychology at Kansas State University, who studies the impact of
television violence on children. Parents can have more influence
than they think, Murray said. Informed parents can urge their
children to question the motives of the companies selling the
violence, or the ways it stimulates young nervous systems. ``You
can say, `Do you feel a jolt when you kill 10 people''' in a video
game, Murray suggested. ``Or discuss whether a program is demeaning
to women.'' But parents can only do this, he stressed, if they know
what is on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Warren, 14, feels the push and pull between privacy and
isolation in this new terrain. In her home in Brookville, an
affluent community on Long Island, she and her brothers, 11 and 9,
share three computers in the playroom. Alison uses the computer to
visit fashion and music sites, and to send Instant Messages to her
friends. ``Sometimes my mom will be behind me and I'll be like,
`Are you lost?''' Alison said. ``There's nothing really I have to
hide. I just don't like people looking over my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Warren family connects to the Internet through America
Online, the nation's biggest service provider. It allows parents to
give children private passwords and mailboxes but still set limits
on where each can go. Alison is on a setting called ``general,'' or
unrestricted, but her parents have sometimes busted her down to
``mature teen,'' which prevents access to explicitly mature
newsgroups or Web sites, as punishment for ``having an attitude,
which I so commonly do,'' she said, or for not cleaning her room.
</P>
<P>
   A ``substantial majority'' of America Online's 24 million
subscribers use some parental controls, said Tricia Primrose, a
company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   When Alison was 13, her parents once found her in a chat area.
``She covered the screen when we walked by,'' said Michelle Warren,
who is a stay-at-home mother. ``She was telling someone, `I have
green eyes and I'm wearing a towel. I got her off that pretty
quick.'' Now Alison is not allowed to enter chat areas, and an AOL
feature automatically shuts the account down after 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother does not know Alison's passwords. ``I think they
should have their privacy,'' she said. But she sometimes checks the
computers' history files, which automatically record the last 25
Web addresses visited by the AOL browser (other browsers leave
complete history trails).
</P>
<P>
   The privacy question can also lead to games of cat and mouse
between parents and their children. In his apartment on the Lower
East Side of New York City, Javier Ortega, 16, fired up the family
computer and scanned the hard drive. For the sake of a reporter, he
was going to go online ``invisibly,'' with a program he got from a
friend that masks the user's identity and leaves no history. He got
the program, he said, so sites could not target him for junk e-mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Such programs, which are easily downloaded from a number of
sites, have been around as long as the World Wide Web. ``But kids
using the programs is something new,'' said Parry Aftab, a lawyer
who specializes in issues of child safety and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As he searched the computer's directories, Javier could not find
the program. His mother, Luz Montero, who is studying programming,
was not surprised. ``I deleted that program,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Javier said he was more annoyed than lured by the
culture's dark side. ``Even movies that don't need violence have
it,'' he complained. He mentioned a brutal game called Redneck, in
which a severed foot is used as a weapon. ``Why?'' he asked.
``We've come so far as a society, but we go back to that.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of electronic entertainments converges with
other trends that isolate children from adults. Bigger houses,
smaller yards, longer commutes and the rise of big regional high
schools all limit the opportunities for generations to mix, said
Damon of Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Community planners similarly build playgrounds, but ignore the
need for public spaces where older children can play in the
presence of grown-ups, said William Morrish, director of the Design
Center for the American Urban Landscape and professor of urban
design at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   In her home in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Marya
Grupsmith, 15, and her family test the limits of communal
entertainment. Most evenings, Marya, her brother, Evan, 12, and
their parents all flop down in the upstairs living room to tap on
laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Marya is trading instant messages with four friends
from out of town, ``and Evan is blowing things up and dominating
small countries on the computer,'' said their mother, Roberta
Newman. Marya does not play violent games but does enjoy R-rated
movies like ``American Psycho.'' She said the Internet gets a bad
rap. ``People focused on the kids in Columbine using violent video
games,'' she said. ``They should have focused more on the guns in
the rooms, and the disturbed behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Though her daughter might spend hours online, Roberta Newman
said she did not feel out of the picture. ``We hang around a lot
more together, because she doesn't need privacy, like she would on
the phone,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This arrangement, of course, requires some resources. It is
inaccessible for women like Joselyn Fernandez, who is raising two
sons while working at night and going to nursing classes by day.
Her older son, Brian Garcia, 14, said he rarely uses the computer
in the library, ``because it is too crowded.'' Instead, he often
immerses himself in a cocoon of high-carnage video games and rap
music. He takes pride in figuring out a new game without reading
the instructions. ``That's a little skill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez is troubled by the violence in her son's
entertainments, she said, but more by the world outside her West
Harlem door. The drug dealers, she said, do not bother her or her
family. ``But the cops will throw someone against a wall, they
don't care that there's children around, watching,'' she said.
``Someday it might be my son.''
</P>
<P>
   But on weekends, she said, Brian's friends crowd into the
apartment to play games on his Dreamcast player. Sometimes they
come too early, shattering her one morning of rest. They play a
sports game or an action game, yelling and laughing above the
mayhem. In their family play, they find connection, leaving the
problems of the streets _ and the Washington debates about
regulating media violence _ a world away, for the moment.

   &UR; THE BACK OF HIS HAND TO ARKANSAS? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; President Clinton &LR;  is so annoyed about the slim possibility of
disbarment in Arkansas, says the Washington newspaper The Hill,
that he might build his presidential library at Georgetown
University instead of in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The location is entirely up to the president,'' said  &UR; Skip &LR; 
 &UR; Rutherford &LR; , who is leader of the fund-raising drive for the
facility, ``and I think he has every intention to build his library
in Little Rock. But again, if he decides to change locations, that
would not be without precedent.'' The Nixon, Kennedy and Reagan
libraries were all relocated from the sites where they were
originally envisioned, said Rutherford.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Yakking on a cellular phone is not yet an
Olympic sport, even at an Olympics that has featured the debut of
trampoline jumping. But after a week of record-breaking mobile
chatter, Sydney can lay reasonable claim to being the first
wireless Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile telephones are everywhere at these Games _ in the hands
of spectators, officials, athletes, even visitors, who are taking
advantage of agreements on roaming use to bring their phones from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   With 8.5 million subscribing to cellular service _ more than 40
percent of the population _ Australia is already one of the world's
most concentrated wireless markets. The high penetration has been
magnified by Samsung Electronics, an Olympics sponsor, which has
flooded Sydney with 15,000 free phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aussies love their mobiles,'' said Michelle Mazzarella, a city
transit employee, who took her phone to a soccer match to receive
minute-by-minute updates on Australia's swimming champion, Ian
Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   Many calls are flowing over the newly upgraded digital network
of Telstra, Australia's publicly traded but still state-controlled
phone company. The company connected 500,000 mobile calls in
Olympic Park on the first day of the Games. About 125,000 of those
were made inside Stadium Australia, which was packed with 110,000
people for the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Telstra experienced huge spikes in use at dramatic moments, like
when the Olympic torch was lighted and when the athletes entered
the stadium. Plenty of those calls were made by the athletes
themselves, some of whom were too busy racking up long-distance
charges to wave to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Telstra said it was fairly simple to equip smaller arenas, like
the Aquatic Center, with an adequate cellular network. The
engineering challenge was how to equip the enormous Olympic
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The company installed a galaxy of microcells _ many hidden in
lampposts _ that shower a signal over the audience in much smaller
segments than a typical macrocell. This allows slices of the radio
spectrum to be reused more efficiently, expanding its capacity
beyond that of a normal network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it's the densest cellular network in any structure
in the world,'' said Anthony Goonan, regional manager of Telstra's
mobile division. He said the network's only potential rival had
been at the Stade de France in suburban Paris, where the World Cup
soccer final was played in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Goonan carried three phones around the stadium throughout the
opening ceremony, testing Telstra's service against those of its
rivals, Optus and Vodafone. They are allowed to lease capacity on
Telstra's network inside the stadium, but must complete calls on
their own networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective was for people to get through the first time,
most of the time,'' Goonan said. ``The congestion levels were quite
low, and we didn't have any complaints from customers about poor
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Telstra has the biggest market share here, at 50
percent, it is waging a fierce battle against Optus and Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   With its revenue under attack, Telstra announced steep rate
increases earlier in the month on land-line local and long-distance
calls. The company, which has been part-privately owned since 1997,
also said it would lay off 10,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   For Telstra, the Olympics are a chance to redirect attention
from its business fortunes to its technical prowess. The company
has invested $50 million to upgrade its mobile network throughout
Sydney for the Olympics. And the bells and whistles go beyond
Stadium Australia. Despite all their efforts, Telstra still cannot
guarantee that calls will not connect at peak moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobile service is one of the most visible contributions we're
making to the Games, but also the most vulnerable,'' Pilbeam said.
``There will be massive spikes in usage that no network in the
world can handle.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the number of people talking on cellular phones
that makes these Games seem to some like a wireless convention with
athletic events thrown in. It is also the pervasive presence of
Samsung, the Korean conglomerate, which hopes to use Sydney to
vault itself into the major leagues of mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung began making cellular telephones in 1989, but only began
exporting them to the United States in 1997. It is fourth in the
industry, after Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola, with 6.2 percent of
the global market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the powerful marketing tool of the Olympics to catch
up, because we're a latecomer,'' said Jay Kim, a Samsung spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps hoping to make up in hype what it lacks in history,
Samsung donated about 15,000 phones to the Sydney Olympic
committee, which in turn lent or leased them to athletes,
volunteers and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   The company also erected a cavernous tent pavilion in Olympic
Park to promote the Samsung name. A slick showroom features its
latest gadgets, including a phone so tiny that one wears it _ Dick
Tracy-like _ on the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case anyone misses the message, Samsung has hired
performers, dressed in zoot suits and wraparound sunglasses, to
march through public places around Sydney in tight formation,
chattering on their phones.
</P>
<P>
   No word yet on whether team cellular will become an Olympic
event.

AT&AMP;T BOARD SEEKS WAYS TO LIFT STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At its annual strategy session late last week, AT&AMP;T's board
opted to continue discussions with British Telecommunications about
a potential combination of the two carriers' units that sell
communications services to business customers, a person close to
AT&AMP;T said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   No deal between AT&AMP;T and British Telecommunications is imminent,
however, the person said, and the negotiations with the British
carrier remain among the options that AT&AMP;T is pursuing as the
company tries to bolster its flagging stock. The person said that
AT&AMP;T's board was less enthusiastic about a potential combination of
the wireless communications divisions at AT&AMP;T and British
Telecommunications but that such a deal had not been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Unless AT&AMP;T's shares stage a remarkable comeback over the next
month or so, AT&AMP;T is all but sure to embark on some sort of
restructuring aimed at ``unlocking'' the value in its operations.
</P>
<P>
   As AT&AMP;T has made acquisitions to become the United States' No. 1
cable television provider, the company has taken on new directors
who have large holdings of AT&AMP;T stock, namely John C. Malone, the
former chairman of Tele-Communications Inc., and Amos B. Hostetter,
formerly the largest shareholder at Mediaone Group Inc. As AT&AMP;T's
stock has plunged from over $60 a share this spring to its close of
$29.63 Friday, the value of their holdings has declined by hundreds
of millions of dollars, at least.
</P>
<P>
   People close to AT&AMP;T have said that the chairman, C. Michael
Armstrong, wants to make a decision on any potential restructuring
by the end of this fall. British Telecommunications, the top phone
company in Britain, has said that it expected its discussions with
AT&AMP;T to reach a conclusion, with or without a deal, by the end of
the year. Representatives of AT&AMP;T and British Telecommunications
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's directors convened near the company's headquarters in
Basking Ridge, N.J., on Thursday night for the meeting, which
lasted through midday Saturday. A person close to AT&AMP;T's board said
the meeting was meant to allow the directors to winnow the menu of
restructuring options that the company's executives and investment
bankers had been considering.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the potential deals with British
Telecommunications, that menu has included a spinoff, the issuing
of a new tracking stock, or a combination with AT&AMP;T's cable
operation for AT&AMP;T's shrinking consumer long-distance telephone
unit, as well as an acquisition of Nextel Communications Inc., the
wireless carrier.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear which, if any, of those options were rejected by
the board. One person close to AT&AMP;T's board said Sunday that the
directors heard presentations from executives about ``a dozen or
more'' alternatives. The board approved about five of these for
consideration.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, the nation's No. 1 communications company, is casting
about for new directions because the company's stock, like that of
many big U.S. communications carriers, is in a rut. Fears that too
many companies are chasing too few customers and concerns that
long-distance telephone calls have become a low-margin commodity
have scared many investors away from the communications sector.
</P>
<P>
   Last week one of AT&AMP;T's major competitors, Sprint Corp., said it
would not meet analysts' financial expectations for the current
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For AT&AMP;T, a combination of its business-services unit with that
of British Telecommunications would theoretically give the combined
unit a leg up in pursuing contracts with the world's biggest
corporations, perhaps the most lucrative niche in the
communications market. The two companies are already partners in an
international venture known as Concert, but that operation has not
been a major success.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Concert may have done more harm than good for AT&AMP;T.
AT&AMP;T mismanaged its relationship with some of its biggest corporate
customers over the last year as the company tried to transfer those
accounts into Concert. Those missteps led AT&AMP;T's business-services
unit to miss its financial targets, helping send AT&AMP;T's stock into
the tailspin.

 (NEW YORK)-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN NEW YORK _ The fashion crowd bent on seeing designer John
Bartlett's collection entered a black and dimly lighted tent to a
pulsing sound resembling the ping of submarine sonar.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the middle of the huge space, white paint dripped into a
strobe-lighted red vase, as the lights gradually brightened. When
the doors to the stage finally opened, the audience was presented
with a wall of men, 50 or so buff bodies stacked on five levels,
all the men in white briefs and painted white from head to toe.
Except one, who was brilliant red.
</P>
<P>
   What did it mean? Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Did it have anything to do with the name of Bartlett's spring
2001 women's wear collection _ ``rope?'' Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Did the program note _ ``erotic sacred tightening the knot that
frees our duality'' _ have a sexual connotation? Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Models came down a ramp through an opening in the wall of men,
and unlike the puzzling setting, the clothes were completely
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   While some of Bartlett's collections are filled with ideas and
modern twists on couture techniques, these clothes beg to be worn.
Most have a Zen quality, whether in the cut of their samurai and
kimono jackets, the black or white jersey, keyhole cutouts or
twisted sarongs.
</P>
<P>
   A crisp white shirt takes a sleeve that is a mere visor over the
arm. A cotton crepe T-shirt has short sleeves twisted into a knot.
One dress is reversed, with its silk chiffon closing in back. A
black suit is worn with a brilliant red obi sash. And there are
rope prints _ on cotton canvas and silk chiffon _ and on a group of
white dresses, red leather ropes that loop over one arm.
</P>
<P>
   As things progressed, the solitary red hunk in the wall of white
men began dripping white paint from his head, so that at the show's
conclusion, he was at least half white. What did it mean? Who knew?
But none of the goings-on bothered Bartlett's dog Sweetie, who sat
calmly in the front row, looking not at all puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   At Helmut Lang's show, fashions for both men and women were as
wearable as Bartlett's and the presentation more straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage clothing shops in New York report a run on designs by
Azzedine Alaia, who is also being honored with an installation at
the Guggenheim Soho Museum. Lang's women's wear includes a healthy
dose of that Parisian's form-fitting yet architecturally cut tops
and dresses. But he also pays homage to Herve Leger, known for his
``bandage'' dresses that wrap the body in yards of stretchy tape.
</P>
<P>
   Lang's bodices include portholes backed with fabric, then bound,
wrapped, crisscrossed and bisected with matching black or white
bands. Sometimes the portholes are left open to reveal matching
leather bras beneath the bandaging. While this may sound kinky, the
effect is curvy, seductive and modern.
</P>
<P>
   Lang's other color choices _ cream, chamois, a dull ocher, tan,
blue and dark gray _ make his designs seasonless choices. From a
good black pantsuit with skinny legs to V-punched leathers
guaranteed to let in cooling breezes, these are the kinds of
clothes that have made Lang a cult hero.
</P>
<P>
   If there was one nod of Lang's head to the overly avant-garde,
it was in the strange tabs he included at the upwardly curved hems
of skirts, almost like separate-and-unseal tabs on some food
packages. They are not, however, as distracting as some of Lang's
past designs that have trailed tails and poufed all over.
</P>
<P>
   Another cult hero, Anna Sui, sent out a surprising spring
collection. Unlike her usual assortment of outfits sure to grab the
hearts of teeny-boppers, Sui showed groups of slash-and-tie stretch
matte jerseys and airy-light floral tea dresses.
</P>
<P>
   African warrior print and ``deco tech'' prints she accessorized
with chandelier-length earrings, crochet, gloves with fingers cut
off, headbands, fishnet hose and black patent pumps. All very
ladylike but looking much older than the usual Sui customer.
</P>
<P>
   Usual customers be damned at Bill Blass. At least that appeared
to be the marching orders as understood by designer Steven Slowik.
Blass, who sold his company a year ago, has completely bowed out,
although many of his society-lady clients did attend the tent show.
</P>
<P>
   What greeted them was a collection with some of the Blass icons
_ glen plaid, checks, mackintoshes, floaty evening wear _ but
little of the quality and substantial design they expect.
</P>
<P>
   A brown-and-white-checked luncheon suit was OK, but then there
were the raincoat with a puzzling circle of stones sewn center
back, a gold sequin dress scattered with blue sequin butterflies
and big tacky symbols on chiffon evening wear _ symbols that looked
as if they might have been scraped off the boxes of toddler toys.
</P>
<P>
   Slowik's collection was all the more disappointing as it
signaled a failed attempt by a major U.S. design house to make a go
of it with a second-generation designer, a business approach that
often works with great success in Europe.

   Cynthia Rowley had a cute idea for her show in the tents _ 40 or
so birdcages suspended above the runway with cute, live birds
twittering inside. A theme of ``human nature'' _ birds and bees,
get it? _ was fine, although the audience was a bit worried about
whether to expect any bees.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, however, cute themes can often go awry, and the
birds apparently took the darkening of the house lights as a signal
to relieve themselves before retiring for the night, much to the
chagrin of the models below. Rowley's is one sample sale that won't
be drawing a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Her fashions, however, are as imaginative as ever. Men's jeans
sport grass and rust stains, while women can choose from tops that
resemble cutoff bridesmaid dresses, honeycomb prints or garments
composed of gobs of string.

<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ After almost 14 years in office, more than any
other governor in the state's history, Tommy G. Thompson bestrides
Wisconsin politics like a colossus. He has built a national
reputation as a reformer and innovator, and this summer he headed
the committee that drafted the Republican platform in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But he has never managed to carry his state for his party's
presidential nominee. Not for Bob Dole four years ago, and not for
George Bush in 1988 or 1992. He tried hard. On Halloween Day, 1992,
he whistle-stopped across the state with Bush, from Mukwonago and
Waukesha to Oshkosh and Chippewa Falls, a made-for-the-cameras trip
on a train called the ``Spirit of America.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the governor recently proclaimed, ``I'm not
worried.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, he is the only politician in Wisconsin who is not. The
race between Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al
Gore is breathlessly close here, in the estimation of political
pros in both parties. Like several other Great Lakes states, this
is one of the year's main presidential battlegrounds, although it
is a bit smaller than most, with only 11 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent private polls, like one taken for a big Wisconsin
union, show an inconclusive edge for Gore; others show the race
even.
</P>
<P>
   This is a quirky state, politically speaking, hard to read, full
of ticket-splitters and independents. It produced both the
LaFollettes, the great clan of Progressive reformers, and the
right-wing zealot Joseph R. McCarthy. Both of its senators, Herb
Kohl and Russell D. Feingold, are Democrats, but both take offbeat
positions on some issues and work closely with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot pulled 16 percent of the Wisconsin vote in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 35 percent Republican and 35 percent Democratic and 35
percent independent,'' said Bill Dixon of Madison, a Democrat who
managed Gary Hart's 1988 presidential campaign. ``It doesn't add
up, but then, neither do we.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin is made to order, one might think, for Ralph Nader,
the Green Party candidate, and he campaigned here on Wednesday,
pounding away at ``the concentration of power in the hands of a
few.'' Nader sounded a bit like Fighting Bob LaFollette, and he
drew sizable crowds _ more than 1,000 at a rally in Milwaukee and
about 1,800 in Madison. In a poll taken in June, he had 16 percent
of the vote in traditionally liberal Dane County (Madison), and
some Gore backers have warned that he could hurt Gore in that area.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's daughter Karenna Gore Schiff, who
campaigned here on Tuesday, and other surrogates argue that a Nader
vote is a Bush vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they have much to fear,'' said John Bibby, a
retired political scientist at the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee. ``The closer we get to Election Day, the more
people will worry about throwing their vote away. He'll do well in
Madison, but not so well elsewhere. Obviously, if it turns out to
be really close, even a few percentage points could be decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader is handicapped, of course, by a shortage of money and a
resultant inability to match the major parties' television
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore have been carpet-bombing the state with
commercials for months. According to a continuing national study by
Kenneth Goldstein, a professor of political science at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison, they have spent $2.6 million in
Green Bay and Milwaukee alone since June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Those cities were two of the places where Gore has advertised
most intensively; this summer, only Flint, Mich., Scranton, Pa.,
and Pittsburgh saw more Gore commercials than Green Bay and
Milwaukee. This month, Green Bay has seen more Bush commercials
than any other city except Scranton. This week, the Republicans
were touting the governor's new slogan, ``real plans for real
people,'' and the Democrats were replying with the taunt, ``George
Bush's real plans hurt real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor have the candidates missed opportunities to campaign here.
Bush spoke to the American Legion national convention in Milwaukee;
both nominees spoke to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in August.
Gore's first postconvention event was a riverboat trip down the
Mississippi, complete with a Mark Twain impersonator, starting from
La Crosse in southwest Wisconsin. Perhaps with an eye on possible
defectors to Nader, Gore arranged for his erstwhile rival, former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, to issue a belated endorsement
here in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wisconsin,'' said Goldstein, whose study is underwritten by
the Pew Charitable Trusts, ``is seeing action like it's never had
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Mayers, a political reporter in Madison who runs a Web site
that has been covering the campaign intensively
(http://wispolitics.com), sees the election as a fight, in essence,
between Thompson's organization and the state's most powerful
union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, a teachers'
group with 90,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The union's president, Terry Craney, was one of the few Gore
delegates at the 1988 Democratic convention, and his organization
has helped to set up the vice president's major Wisconsin
appearances in the last eight years. In 1996, it turned out a crowd
of 30,000 for a Gore rally, one of the biggest political gatherings
in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who attributed the elder George Bush's 1988 defeat to
``just mistake after mistake'' by Bush and his strategists, has
helped George W. Bush raise money in the state. Several politicians
here said they thought that in the event of a Republican victory in
November, Thompson hoped to be named as U.S. ambassador to Vatican
City.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's top national strategist, said in Wisconsin on
Thursday that Bush would return to the state three or four times
before Election Day. Thompson's support, he asserted, will not
transfer directly to Bush but will ensure that those who like the
governor and his policies ``give us a better hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Bush is ``a couple points up, a couple points
down'' in the state, Rove said.

POLICE ARREST 25 IN CONNECTION WITH INDONESIA BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The Indonesian police said on Sunday that
they had arrested 25 people in connection with a recent series of
bombings in Jakarta, including one that killed 15 people at the
stock exchange. The police said that the suspects admitted carrying
out the bombings and indicated that their next target was to be the
American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the suspects were arrested in Jakarta on Friday
and Saturday based on tips and information gathered by police
investigators. One suspect, armed with a grenade, indicated after
he was picked up that he had been on his way to attack the American
Embassy and a nearby crowded department store, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspects have all admitted to being involved in recent
bomb attacks, and one of them said that he intended to blow up the
United States Embassy,'' said Superintendent Nur Usman, a spokesman
for the Jakarta police.
</P>
<P>
   American Embassy officials said they were aware of the arrests
but declined to comment on them. Last week, the State Department
warned U.S. citizens that American companies and interests in
Indonesia might be the target of such attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, there have been numerous anti-American
demonstrations across Indonesia, during which American flags were
burned. The protests followed a visit by Defense Secretary William
Cohen, who warned Indonesia that it could face economic sanctions
if it does not disband violent militia groups that are accused of
killing three U.N. aid workers on the divided island of Timor. The
militias are linked to the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
   The police spokesman said that three of the people detained are
believed to be the ringleaders, while the others either knew about
the plot or played minor roles. Usman declined to provide any
details on the suspects or a motive for the bombing campaign, which
included attacks on the Indonesian attorney general's office, the
Philippine ambassador's residence and the Malaysian Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the investigation is continuing, Usman said there was
so far no indication that the suspects were connected with the
military or the police. There had been widespread speculation that
the blasts were the work of disaffected members of the armed forces
loyal to former President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings have coincided with major developments in the
government's corruption case against Suharto, the country's
longtime dictator, and law enforcement officials have said that
attacks were meant to derail President Abdurrahman Wahid's
democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests brought a sigh of relief to residents of this
bustling capital city of 11 million people, who had grown
apprehensive in recent weeks as the government appeared helpless to
solve the bomb attacks. Last week, the president, frustrated that
not a single arrest had been made in the case, replaced the
national police chief and ordered the arrest of Suharto's son, whom
police questioned, then released for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   With Suharto's trial scheduled to resume this week, Jakarta had
been bracing for perhaps another round of bomb attacks. Suharto's
lawyers contend that he is too sick after three strokes to attend
his trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, the Indonesian government, facing
mounting pressure from other nations to contain the violence on
Timor, began an ambitious campaign this weekend to disarm the
militia groups that are accused of killing the three U.N. aid
workers in West Timor early this month.
</P>
<P>
   The police in West Timor, which is controlled by Indonesia, said
that by Sunday evening the militias had surrendered 34 automatic
rifles, 9 grenade launchers, about 1,000 homemade guns and an equal
number of rounds of ammunition. The government has said it will use
force to disarm the militias if they do not hand over all their
weapons by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But almost no one expects the crackdown to bring an end to the
violence. Authorities have conducted several campaigns to disarm
the militias in the past, collecting hundreds of weapons. But the
gangs, which are friendly with the military, continue to resurface
with guns.

`BLONDES': THE FAIR-HAIRED LIFE, FROM TWO POINTS OF VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By   JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are pictures of Mary Elizabeth Smith throughout her
memoir, and she seldom looks the same twice. That chameleon quality
has been all-important to her life and career. She wrote for Sports
Illustrated and Cosmopolitan simultaneously. She morphed from the
child her father called ``my best boy'' to flirty ingenue. She took
potshots in print at Frank Sinatra but melted into goo when courted
by the singer. (``I loved him. I had a feeling for what it would be
like to be in his strong and capable arms.'') And throughout it all
Liz Smith was in it for the fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gossip makes you interesting and boosts your self-esteem at
having information to relate,'' she says at the start of ``Natural
Blonde,'' while also pointing out that ``among the first gossips of
history was Homer.'' But relax: this isn't that kind of book. Sonny
and Cher's names are more likely to be dropped than those of any
further ancient Greeks, and the author's natural tone remains that
of a breathless pajama-party confidante. ``I can't begin to find
space to write about all the sexy major stars I've known in this
odd career,'' she declares, apropos of Warren Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from a Fort Worth girlhood and college years at the
University of Texas (where Jayne Mansfield was a fellow student),
Smith realized what attracted her: the glamorous ideal of fame, New
York-style.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived there after two brief marriages and, quicker than
you can say El Morocco, began working her way into that world. From
her first bold phone call to Randolph Scott for Modern Screen to
her scoop about Madonna's pregnancy, Smith felt perfectly at home
in a journalistic realm where the latter qualified as earthshaking
news. And she understood that the way to navigate star-infested
waters was to avoid making waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't you rather I dealt with it Liz Smith-style?'' she
says she asks when trying to persuade celebrities to send news
items her way. Because this is a nicer alternative than seeing the
same story doused with flaming gasoline in the supermarket
tabloids, Smith has found herself in perk-filled proximity to many
well-known figures, and her book describes them with exhaustive
affection. ``To Sir, With Love'' is the name of a chapter about Sir
David Frost. Barbara Walters is ``the biggest star and the grandest
VIP in the world.'' By the time Smith reprints a Vanity Fair
questionnaire in which she named ``self-defeating generosity'' as
her most marked characteristic, no reader need wonder what she
means.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, for reasons that are basic to Smith's very calling,
it is far preferable to read snarky tales of those, like Phil
Silvers, Allen Funt and Shelley Winters, who had the poor acumen to
treat a budding gossip badly. Or to learn that when she offered
advice to George Cukor on the set of ``The Bluebird,'' he told her:
``Are you the person who directed Spencer and Kate in `Pat and
Mike'? Stick to writing for Cosmo!'' To her credit Smith tells
these stories in a good-humored, self-effacing way that makes it
easy to see why she has so many friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may wonder if during all these comings and goings, to-ings
and fro-ings, I had any personal life outside of work,'' she
writes. And you may keep on wondering, because a lifetime's worth
of weighing others' privacy has left her cautious about her own.
</P>
<P>
   All in all Smith sounds like a good person with whom to share a
lifeboat, particularly if you happened to be well known. Candace
Bushnell, on the other hand, would toss you overboard without
batting an eye. In ``Four Blondes,'' her own more entertainingly
reprehensible take on the fair-haired life, Bushnell writes with
the same acerbic ruthlessness that has made ``Sex and the City''
such a touchstone of its times. ``I heard he was pulled over for
drunk driving and got caught stuffing a vial of cocaine in his
sock,'' one character tsk-tsks from the Hamptons. ``Socks! In the
summer!'' Who says these aren't moral tales?
</P>
<P>
   In her understandably best-selling collection, Bushnell has
assembled four stories, named them for hair-lightening methods
(``Single Process,'' ``Nice N'Easy'') and arranged them in
declining order of coherence and success. She begins with the tale
of a model named Janey, who may be selfish and ambitious but
otherwise has nothing in common with heroines by the Jackies
(Susann and Collins) who are Bushnell's spiritual forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Janey, an anomie-filled creature of this moment, is simply too
bored and jaded for the old-fashioned scheming that might be
expected of her. She would rather wait and see what, or whom, falls
into her lap and only occasionally is moved to real emotion. ``I
loved him,'' she tells herself about the loss of a rich boyfriend
(the only kind who interests Janey). ``Did not,'' she replies to
herself. ``You're only upset because he was going to take you to
Bouley to dinner and you wanted the foie gras.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, since anxiety and vanity are all-important among
Bushnell's wisecracking characters, Janey begins to feel that even
her body is out of vogue. ``I could take out the implants,'' she
suggests to a friend. ``But,'' he answers, ``can you take out
everything else?''

   MALONE IN TALKS TO INCREASE STAKE IN NEWS CORP.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Malone and Rupert Murdoch are considering a deal that
would increase the size of their investments in each other's
companies, according to people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the complex transaction, Malone is considering putting his
20 percent stake of Gemstar-TV Guide International, along with some
cable holdings in Latin America, into Murdoch's News Corp. In
exchange, Malone's Liberty Media, which already owns 8 percent of
News Corp., would increase its stake in the company to 20 percent
and would receive stock in News Corp.'s global satellite TV
operations.

<P>
   HOLES SEEN IN INVESTOR SAFETY NET
</P>
<P>
   At a time when millions of people have taken their money out of
banks and put it into brokerage firms, the Securities Investor
Protection Corp.'s responsibility for protecting the investing
public has never been more important. But a close look at the
organization shows that the safety net that investors think the
corporation offers is in fact full of holes.
</P>
<P>
   STAKING A CLAIM IN LATIN AMERICA
</P>
<P>
   Operators of e-marketplaces _ Internet portals through which
companies do business with one another _ are betting on the
democratizing power of the Internet to break down the barriers that
confine most small companies in Latin America to doing business
within 30 miles of home. E-marketplaces are still struggling to
work out the kinks, but the obstacles are not deterring Internet
companies from racing to stake a claim in the market for
business-to-business e-commerce in Latin America.

<P>
   THE MIDDLEMEN OF ONLINE CONTENT
</P>
<P>
   Generating content for Web sites has proved much harder than
many Internet companies had expected. The problem has not been lost
on so-called online content syndicators, which act as
intermediaries between sites that need content and sites that want
to sell it. Meanwhile, media companies and others that supply
content have found that syndicators have given them a much-needed
revenue source.

   CHINA ALLOWS PHOTO BOOK TO LEAVE
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Chinese officials reversed course and agreed to allow
a book by a former White House photographer out of the country.
Chinese officials had stopped 17,000 copies of the book at its

`WHERE DID VINCENT VAN GOGH?': A PARADE OF LOST CHARACTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A veteran of the Second City comedy troupe and more
recently, on television, ``The Tracey Ullman Show,'' Dan
Castellaneta may be best known as the voice of Homer Simpson, but
he's a sketch comedy guy, and a good one.
</P>
<P>
   In his one-man show ``Where Did Vincent van Gogh?'' at the
Chelsea Playhouse, he is making an effort to knit a variety of
character sketches together with a narrative, and though that idea
is ambitious and reasonable enough, the result is baffling. Many of
the sketches themselves _ about a variety of yearning, misguided
people _ bristle with dark laughs. The portrait gallery presented
here could easily stand together as a satisfying cabaret evening.
</P>
<P>
   But the story that unites them is so, well, dopey, and so
completely irrelevant that its incomprehensibility is barely an
issue. The concept is this: The body of an actor playing van Gogh
in a one-man show is overtaken by an alien, a being sent to Earth
to gather nine people for some purpose or other that is never quite
clear, except that in the end it is supposed to teach us that we _
the characters, the audience, all earthlings _ ``are all part of
the ultimate one-man show.''
</P>
<P>
   Played on a set that is meant to suggest van Gogh's studio, the
show begins with Castellaneta in a crazed portrayal of the artist
on the brink of suicide. He fires off a good line or two, and to
his credit there's not a single ear reference, but van Gogh has
little to do with what follows. Very early on, the actor morphs
into the alien, who (which?), Mork-like, begins receiving bleeps in
his brain that indicate the onset of a character sketch. The first
concerns a florist who arranges bouquets that convey literal
messages according the symbolic meaning of the individual flowers.
From then on the show has a form:
character-bleep-alien-bleep-character.
</P>
<P>
   A small man with the face of an earnest ferret, Castellaneta has
always been persuasive and endearing in the guise of ordinariness,
someone who wants something ordinary: a job, a date, understanding.
There is something imploring about him; his fundamental character
is rooted in a very real grasp of insecurity. This alien, though,
is alien to him, and playing its silly contortions, he looks
uncomfortable, even a little embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing is just odd, because when Castellaneta gets down
to what he does best, he can be wickedly engaging, and the show has
some fine nuggets. There is, for instance, the little girl showing
off paintings ostensibly of her family that end up telling a
violent story taken directly from a made-for-television movie.
</P>
<P>
   There is the ballplayer who begins hallucinating as he stands at
the plate, holding a bat; he's seeing everything in slow motion.
It's a spectacularly weird conceit, performed with marvelous
deadpan, as he conveys the batter's fear, and eventual delight, at
his surrealistic predicament.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a spot-on sendup of a theater producer at a
backer's audition performing the numbers from a musical based on
the animosity between cats and dogs. ``This will never work out
between us,'' he sings as a cat named Mittens to a dog named
Buster. ``We are pets of a different genus.''
</P>
<P>
   These are sketches you would happily watch on television, or in
a comedy club, without wanting or needing a collective context.
Castellaneta evidently does. Maybe he's searching for greater
meaning in his life; if so, he still has some thinking to do.

   RUNNERS WORLD: So the Olympics have given you that
every-four-years desire to start a running program. What now? With
the immediacy of e-mail and the Internet, runners of all abilities
have access to world-class advice just by downloading a workout,
executing it, then e-mailing the results to a coach. There is the
added psychological boost of getting advice from the best. Many
current and former athletes and coaches recognize the potential and
are cashing in, offering personalized programs for between $30 and
$150 per month. One of the biggest names to enter the online arena
is Arturo Barrios, five-time world record holder in the 10,000
meters and two-time Olympian. Barrios lives in Boulder, Colo.,
where he coaches national champions and potential Olympians through
the Army's World Class Athlete Program. He also coaches, via
e-mail, several average runners in Chicago, New York and elsewhere
in the U.S.

 &HT;    Olympic experience not getting old for Edwards
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Marching in another Opening Ceremony was cool. Bunking
in the same hotel with the men's team has been really cool.
Watching Marion Jones run 100 meters in person was waycool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just trying to enjoy the moment,'' Teresa Edwards said of her
farewell Olympic experience.
</P>
<P>
   No woman _ person, maybe _ has had a lifelong basketball jones
like Edwards. At age 36, with creaky knees and without a pro
contract like all of her teammates, she took the fifth this year,
accepting invitation No. 5 to the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after the United States completed a five-game sweep
in the preliminary round by blitzing Poland 76-57, Edwards observed
that the end is near. Though she has developed a rough exterior,
partly from two decades of playing pick-up with NBA almosts and
wanna-bes in guys' gymnasiums, she acknowledged that maybe some
emotions will come pouring forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' she said. ``Stick around.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three more games, beginning with Slovakia in the
quarterfinals Wednesday. A gold medal would be her fourth, to go
with a silver.
</P>
<P>
   If this is anyone's team, it is Edwards'. The starting point
guard, she is a coach on the floor. On a roster made to delight
star-gazers, it is her voice that rings out in huddles on the court
_ though no longer in the harsh tones she once used.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get on them anymore,'' she said. ``I used to do
that. You do that now, you don't have a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have their roles _ scoring, rebounding, playing defense.
Hers? ``To do whatever I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, it's passing to the honor roll of scorers. Averaging
just under 24 minutes per game, she has 17 assists and a mere four
turnovers. Against Poland, she shot only twice, making both. For
the duration, she has 20 attempts, hitting 14.
</P>
<P>
   She bounced off the bench Sunday for her second shift of the
game with the U.S. ahead 23-14. When she sat down, it was 32-14,
time to turn out the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards still finds much to appreciate. ``Everybody loves the
game now,'' she said after entertaining 8,471 mostly raucous fans.
``It's a lot more exciting. I'm thriving on that.''
</P>
<P>
   She's as fit as can be expected after a summer of strength and
sprint training with a group including college and pro football
players, followed by hoops at an Atlanta gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me strength in areas where you need it,'' she said.
``Now, it comes down to endurance. This is an eight-game tournament
(in two weeks).''
</P>
<P>
   Part of her misses the old days. Staying in the athletes'
village, where she could eat anything at any time of the day.
Wearing shorts that don't touch her knees and unfashionable Chuck
Taylor sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a kid then,'' she said wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she refers often to getting old, feeling old, being old.
But the joy is still there, with the wrap-arounds, the half-court
shovel passes, the high-fives and the postgame feel-good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' Edwards called out to someone official-looking after
what she considered a raggedly called game. ``Talk to those refs.
Take 'em out. Get 'em drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   And she laughed.

 &HT;    Khorkina still best on bars
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ At first, Svetlana Khorkina couldn't bear to look. She
squeezed her eyes tightly shut. Would her uneven bars score hold up
against China's Ling Jie? Would she still be ``Queen of the Bars?''
</P>
<P>
   When Ling's score finally flashed on the board Sunday, the
21-year-old Russian peeked and saw that she had defended her 1996
Olympic title by .025. She punched the air and rushed over to kiss
the bottom bar of the apparatus. This gold medal eased some of the
pain of finishing 11th Thursday in an all-around competition that
was tainted by the vault being set at the wrong height and by her
second fall of the Games on uneven bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't get over the disappointment of the other night, I
wouldn't be Khorkina, standing here with a gold medal,'' she said.
But Khorkina later added, ``I could cross this out of my life, but
it can never be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she simply tried not to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you realized I have a different hairstyle,'' said
Khorkina, whose short blond hair was cropped even shorter. ``The
next day I had a manicure, went to the beautiful Sydney Aquarium,
which was wonderful. . . . I want to keep this (bad memory) far
away from me, preferably the North Pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Khorkina was also cheered to see her 16-year-old sister, Yulia,
who arrived half an hour before the event, and by all the flowers
delivered to her in the Olympic Village. The temperamental Khorkina
is a celebrity around the world and posed topless for Russian
Playboy.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-5 _ so tall that her early coaches tried to discourage
her from doing gymnastics _ Khorkina whipped around the uneven bars
Sunday. She effortlessly executed the release move that she'd
missed on the other two occasions, stuck her dismount and scored
9.862. Two gymnasts later, it was Ling's turn. Ling was nearly
perfect, but took a tiny hop on her landing: 9.837.
</P>
<P>
   Khorkina was supposed to also compete on vault Sunday, but an
hour before the event she gave her slot to teammate Elena
Zamolodtchikova, who had been the alternate. Zamolodtchikova won
the first women's gold of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave her the opportunity to win the gold because I had a
feeling inside that she would win,'' said Khorkina, who will
``dance for Russia'' Monday in floor exercise, her final event.
``She deserved it and I'm glad I gave her the joy.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had a sore knee and didn't feel that she would be
at her best.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Hamm was the only U.S. competitor Sunday, his 18th
birthday, and finished seventh in floor exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more motivated now than I've ever been,'' he said. He and
his twin brother, Paul, are considered the future of U.S. men's
gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Men's all-around champion Alexei Nemov won a silver medal in
floor exercise and a bronze on pommel horse for his fourth medal of
2000. Nemov has won 10 career medals and has three more events
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Blaine Wilson, the highest qualifier on vault, and Elise Ray on
balance beam have the last U.S. chances for gymnastics medals at
this Olympics. America has not been shut out since 1972.

SPECIAL REPORT: VICTIMS OF FAILED BROKERAGE FIRMS FIND LITTLE
HELP 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Pa., Ala., Texas, Ill., N.Y., Fla., Okla., Mich.) (Eds: An abridged version of this story, slugged
INVESTOR-PROTECTION-ABR, is being sent.) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Heebner, owner of a building-supply store in Temple, Pa.,
got a call four years ago from his longtime stockbroker
recommending an investment in short-term bonds. Assured the bonds
were safe, Heebner invested $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Heebner received a stunning phone call. The
broker told him the money he had put into the bonds was gone. The
president of the broker's firm, Old Naples Securities, had stolen
it.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife about to deliver their third child, Heebner, 36,
reeled at the thought of a $100,000 loss. Then he remembered with
relief that his account was insured by the Securities Investor
Protection Corp., created by Congress in 1970 to protect investors'
brokerage accounts from just the sort of theft he had been a victim
of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that if they didn't find the money from Old Naples
Securities, I was insured through SIPC,'' Heebner recalled. The
broker's ``business card and letterhead all had SIPC logos on them;
I figured SIPC would cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Heebner figured wrong. For over four years, the corporation
maintained he was entitled to nothing _ even though three federal
courts ruled that SIPC should pay him $87,000. Only last week, days
after a reporter interviewed the lawyer representing the
corporation about Heebner, did the investor receive a check in the
amount of $87,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got the sense that SIPC was in any way trying to help
my client,'' said William P. Thornton Jr., a lawyer at Stevens &AMP;
Lee in Reading, Pa., representing Heebner against the corporation.
``They are very aggressive in attempting to prove that investors'
claims do not come within certain legal definitions within the SIPC
statute. And the loser is the investor.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when millions of U.S. citizens have taken their money
out of federally insured banks and put it into brokerage firms, the
Securities Investor Protection Corp.'s charge of protecting the
investing public has never been more important
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the SIPC defend the corporation's record and say
they must be vigilant in protecting against invalid claims by
investors.
</P>
<P>
   But a close look at this little-understood organization shows
that the safety net that investors believe the corporation offers
is in fact full of holes.
</P>
<P>
   Industry-financed but not government-backed, the corporation is
a far cry from the agency on which it was loosely modeled, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which protects bank customers
against losses.
</P>
<P>
   Created three decades ago after a number of brokerage-firm
failures and securities thefts, the corporation is chartered to
protect each investor with securities held at a member brokerage
firm for up to $500,000; claims for cash are limited to $100,000 a
customer.
</P>
<P>
   But convincing the corporation to pay can be extremely
difficult. The organization, requires investors to run a gantlet of
legal technicalities that would challenge even those knowledgeable
about securities law.
</P>
<P>
   Some securities lawyers say this is because trustees overseeing
the cases are chosen by, and paid by, the corporation. This differs
from the independent trustees who are appointed by the court to
handle corporate bankruptcy cases, and who are working for the
people owed money.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the trustees working for the investor protection
corporation _ many of them from a coterie of lawyers who have made
a lucrative specialty of such cases _ have received far more from
representing the corporation than the corporation itself has paid
to investors. Their critics say that trustees wanting repeat
business from the corporation have an incentive to minimize payouts
to investors. One trustee is the former president of the
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   In Heebner's case, the corporation made several arguments.
First, because the investor had sent his money not to Old Naples
but to a subsidiary, his investment was not covered. In addition,
because the corporation could find no proof that bonds had ever
been bought with the $100,000, the organization assumed Heebner had
given the money to the brokerage firm as a loan. Lenders are not
covered by the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although these legal arguments may follow the letter of the
investor protection act, SIPC's reliance on them is reminiscent of
a private insurance company trying to use every conceivable
esoteric legal stratagem to avoid customer claims,'' said Lewis D.
Lowenfels, a lawyer at Tolins &AMP; Lowenfels in New York and a leading
authority in securities law.
</P>
<P>
   The list of what the corporation does not cover is long. For one
thing, while $100,000 placed in a bank account insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is covered regardless of why the
bank failed, assets lost in a failed brokerage firm are not covered
if the loss is a result of most kinds of securities fraud,
including a failure to execute a purchase or sale of securities or
misrepresentation in the sale of a stock or bond.
</P>
<P>
   Losses from unauthorized trading, a large problem among small
brokerage firms in the 1990s, are covered only if an investor can
prove to the satisfaction of corporation representatives that he
complained promptly to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, because the act that created the corporation covers
only securities held by a failed brokerage firm, customers whose
firms handle their trades through other brokerage firms may not
have a claim for coverage by the corporation. Additionally, cash
held in a brokerage account that is not earmarked for a securities
purchase is not covered by the organization. Nor is an investment
in gold, other commodities or a limited partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is SIPC is outdated and needs to be
reviewed,'' said Joseph P. Borg, securities commissioner for
Alabama. ``It's been around since 1970, when one in 10 Americans
were in the markets. Now everyone is in the markets. And everyone
thinks that SIPC logo reads `FDIC,' but the protection is very
limited.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporation's president, Michael E. Don, disagrees with
accusations that his organization does not put investors first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It simply is not true that protecting our fund is our
interest,'' he said. ``Our interest is to see to it that customers
get paid.'' Don added that when the corporation considered an
investor's claim invalid, it had no choice but to fight the
investor in court, as it did Heebner.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Beginning
</P>
<P>
   Create an Equivalent of the FDIC
</P>
<P>
   The corporation started as an idea of Edmund Muskie, the former
Democratic senator from Maine. He introduced a bill in 1969 to
create a Federal Broker-Dealer Insurance Corp. that would insure
brokerage firm customers against losses, as the FDIC does with bank
depositors.
</P>
<P>
   A group representing the securities industry countered with a
proposal that its chairman said would maintain public confidence in
the securities markets without creating ``a vast new governmental
agency.'' The Securities and Exchange Commission joined the group
and drafted a proposal that was largely accepted by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The investor protection corporation and the FDIC are vastly
different. While the FDIC is an agency of the federal government
and its insurance fund is backed by the full faith and credit of
the government, the corporation is financed by the securities
industry and can borrow from the government, with special approval,
only in emergencies. It also maintains a $1 billion line of credit
with a consortium of banks.
</P>
<P>
   And while bank examiners employed by the FDIC routinely monitor
risks at banks, the corporation steps in only when a brokerage firm
has collapsed or is close to failure.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is that a brokerage firm, no matter how large
or troubled, pays just $150 a year to be a member of SIPC, while
payments into the FDIC insurance fund are based on a bank's size
and financial health: the riskier the bank, the larger the fee.
</P>
<P>
   Although the healthiest banks have not had to pay into the fund
for several years, because it has grown so large and bank failures
have been few, a financially vulnerable bank with $100 million in
insured deposits would have had to pay $270,000 a year to the FDIC
fund this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, brokerage firms paid much more to be members of
the corporation. Between 1991 and 1995, firms were levied an amount
based on their net operating revenues. In 1995, for instance,
members were required to pay 0.095 percent of such revenues and the
organization received $43.9 million. But when the SIPC fund reached
$1 billion, the corporation cut the levy to $150 a member. Last
year the corporation received $1.14 million in fees.
</P>
<P>
   When a bank fails, the FDIC steps in to keep it operating or
close it and return assets _ up to $100,000 per depositor _ to
their rightful owners. The FDIC, created in 1934, typically
resolves bank failures by arranging for another institution to
assume the crippled bank's deposits and other assets. This has the
effect of keeping most failed banks open and operating, if under a
new name.
</P>
<P>
   When a brokerage firm fails, the wheels grind much more slowly.
First, the corporation applies to the appropriate court to issue a
protective order. If it does, the corporation chooses a trustee to
oversee the liquidation of the brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation has presided over the liquidation of 282
brokerage firms. In the 247 cases completed through the end of last
year, the corporation had returned $3.38 billion to customers in
cash and securities. Over 90 percent of this money _ $3.15 billion
_ came straight from the accounts of customers of the failed firms.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation itself has paid investors $233 million over
almost 30 years. But that amount is far less than the money
received by the lawyers that act as trustees and the firms that
help them shepherd the cases through the bankruptcy courts, trying
to recover additional assets from the failed brokerages and
assessing customer claims for validity. Since 1971, trustees have
received $320 million, 37 percent more than has been paid to
wronged investors.
</P>
<P>
   The money the trustee receives comes from two sources: the
assets of the failed brokerage firm and the corporation itself. As
is typical in most bankruptcy cases, the corporation's trustees are
paid first, and customers second.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation made its biggest payout to investors last June
when it paid $31 million to about 10,000 customers of Sunpoint
Securities, a Texas brokerage firm that failed last November when
some of its officials stole $25 million, according to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation's move to repay Sunpoint customers was swift
indeed. But according to people close to the case, the failure was
unusual in its simplicity. Unlike most brokerage failures, which
involve accounts that hold a variety of stocks and bonds, in the
Sunpoint case the missing funds had been placed in a money market
fund at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, all the customers' claims were identical and a
result of the same theft, making it comparatively easy for the
corporation's trustee to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Most brokerage-firm liquidations drag on for years. For
instance, the trustee was recently still billing for litigation in
the 1985 failure of Donald Sheldon &AMP; Co., a New York brokerage
firm. The corporation said that all the customers' claims it
considered valid were paid early on, but that the trustee had been
trying to recover assets from principals of the firm to defray the
costs of administering the liquidations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the trustee recently won $11 million from an insurance
company that had underwritten officer and director insurance for
the firm.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A Nasty Example
</P>
<P>
   A Look at the Case of Stratton Oakmont
</P>
<P>
   The case of Stratton Oakmont, a small but notorious brokerage
firm based in Lake Success, N.Y., has been particularly protracted
and acrimonious. The firm was expelled from the industry by
securities regulators four years ago, and the corporation stepped
in after the firm was closed.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Stratton's two owners pleaded guilty to federal
charges of securities fraud and money laundering; investors lost
hundreds of millions of dollars during the 10 years the firm
operated.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, of the 3,368 customers who submitted claims for
SIPC coverage in the failure, as of last May only 34 had been
deemed entitled to be reimbursed, for a total of $2.1 million,
according to the trustee overseeing the case. The corporation's
executives and Weil Gotshal &AMP; Manges, the law firm representing the
trustee in the case, argue that only 1 percent of the Stratton
customers seeking remuneration from the corporation are entitled to
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Rogoff, a partner at Weil Gotshal &AMP; Manges who is the
lawyer for the trustee, Harvey R. Miller, also a partner at the
firm, said: ``We look for credible evidence that there was a
contemporaneous reaction; we look for a letter to the company; for
a complaint; for a lawsuit or an arbitration. Otherwise people take
advantage of an opportunity to revisit trades and say they were
unauthorized when they weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Don, the corporation's president, said, ``The Securities
Investor Protection Corp. was not chartered by Congress to combat
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   While 34 investors had received $2.1 million, the professionals
overseeing the case had received $7 million as of the end of May.
Most of that amount _ $4.3 million in fees and expenses _ has been
paid to Weil, Gotshal. The payments do not yet include the fees
charged by the trustee, Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and his colleagues have spent a lot of time trying to
recover assets of Stratton Oakmont principals. So far, success has
been limited. According to bankruptcy court documents through May,
Weil Gotshal, which has spent $8.8 million, has recovered $3.6
million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Rogoff, the counsel to Miller, said: ``You can't analyze it from
a balance-sheet perspective. There are costs attendant to
administering the case. We have a staff; we have office space _
these are all costs relating to the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the corporation is concerned about Miller's
spending, Don said: ``We have reason to believe that Harvey Miller
has a reasonable shot at collecting substantial sums of money in
this case. We take very seriously our responsibility to make sure
that the trustees don't overspend the general estate's money and
our money.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Don argued that the fees charged by trustees are
necessary to fend off false claims filed by investors and to locate
hidden assets held by principals of failed firms.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Harbeck, general counsel at the corporation, said that
trustees' bills were typically paid as submitted. ``I don't believe
we have made any substantial requests for adjustments, because we
believe the fees they have charged are appropriate to the task
involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A key problem with SIPC liquidations, some securities lawyers
say, is that trustees overseeing the cases have allegiance to the
corporation that appointed them, rather than to wronged investors.
</P>
<P>
   To be truly in the corner of investors, these people say,
trustees in brokerage-firm liquidations should be completely
independent of the corporation, which naturally wants to protect
its assets. Trustees are indeed independent in corporate or
personal bankruptcy cases because they are appointed by the
bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   Don denied that trustees work to deny claims on the
corporation's behalf. ``It is a false argument,'' he said. ``Since
1970, SIPC has advanced $354 million in order to make possible the
recovery of $3.3 billion in assets for an estimated 440,000
investors. SIPC estimates that more than 99 percent of eligible
investors have been made whole in the failed brokerage-firm cases
that it has handled.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is impossible to say how many investors that the
corporation has considered ineligible over the years might have
prevailed if they had had the money or tenacity to battle the
corporation in multiple courts, as Heebner did.
</P>
<P>
   A coterie of bankruptcy lawyers does get repeat business from
the corporation. Irving H. Picard, a partner at Gibbons, Del Deo,
Dolan, Griffinger &AMP; Vecchione in New York, has been appointed
trustee in four brokerage-firm failures in the last nine years, and
J. William Holland of Holland &AMP; Holland in Chicago has overseen
three liquidations since 1990. Five other lawyers have overseen two
or more liquidations for the corporation the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, Don said. ``We look for trustees who have developed
expertise in liquidating stockbrokers and satisfying customer
claims,'' he said. ``That's why we've gone back to Harvey Miller,
Irving Picard, and we went to Ted Focht, because there's probably
no one in the country who knows more about liquidating a
stockbroker than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore H. Focht is the trustee in the Old Naples case who kept
Heebner at bay until this month. Retired and living in Florida,
Focht was general counsel at the corporation when it was created
and remained its chief lawyer for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Don, Focht wrote the 1970 statute that gives the
corporation its charges. He was the corporation's president for a
decade until he retired in 1995. The next year, he was appointed by
the corporation to oversee the Old Naples liquidation. Focht hired
the law firm of Foley &AMP; Lardner to help him litigate the case.
</P>
<P>
   Focht denied Heebner's $100,000 claim for SIPC coverage from the
outset. First, he said, Heebner erred by sending his investment
money not to the brokerage firm but to a related entity, Old Naples
Financial Inc. SIPC protection is afforded only to investors whose
assets are held by the brokerage firm that fails.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Focht argued that the $100,000 that Heebner had
sent to his broker represented a loan to Old Naples and was not for
the purchase of bonds, as the investor said. Loans are not covered
by the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Heebner's lawyer objected to the trustee's ruling, and at a
hearing in February 1998 in federal bankruptcy court in Florida,
the investor told his story. The next month a judge ruled that
Heebner was entitled to SIPC insurance in the amount of $87,000,
reflecting a reduction of $13,000 in interest that the investor had
earned on the investment before the failure of Old Naples.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Focht appealed to a Florida district court, which ruled for
Heebner in February 1999. Focht then appealed the district court
decision to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard
arguments on the matter last May.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 23, the appellate court ruled in favor of Heebner and
two other customers with similar cases who lost $610,000. Because
the president of Old Naples had misappropriated clients' funds, the
firm's failure was just the situation the corporation was supposed
to protect against, the appellate court opinion stated.
</P>
<P>
   Reached on Sept. 6, Focht said he was still deciding whether to
appeal the ruling. Less than a week later, Heebner received a
letter stating that he would be paid the $87,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting Heebner and the two other investors that are now
receiving remuneration on their claims, 21 of the 156 Old Naples
customers seeking remuneration from the corporation had received $2
million since the firm failed. As of last May, the most recent
filing made in the case, Focht and Foley &AMP; Lardner had billed
approximately $660,000 for their services.
</P>
<P>
   The Catch
</P>
<P>
   A Key Argument Used to Deny Investor Claims
</P>
<P>
   Some securities lawyers and regulators say that the arguments
used by the corporation to justify the denial of Heebner's claim
for over four years are characteristic of the corporation's
approach to investor protection. ``It's part of the gantlet to make
it as difficult as possible for an investor to make a recovery,''
said Mark Maddox, a former Indiana securities commissioner who is
now a lawyer representing victims in the Stratton Oakmont case.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one argument used to deny many investors' claims in the
Stratton Oakmont case, if applied to all brokerage-firm failures,
would disqualify millions of investors from SIPC coverage even
though their brokerage firms are members of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the trustee at Weil Gotshal, has argued successfully to
the bankruptcy court that Stratton customers do not qualify for
SIPC coverage, because their assets were not held physically at
Stratton; they were held at the firm that cleared Stratton's
trades. The act of Congress that created the corporation states
that the coverage extends only to customers of firms that hold
their assets. Customers of a failed broker that used another firm
to clear its trades and conduct administrative duties do not
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   This delineation may have made sense in 1970, when most
brokerage firms cleared their own trades. But today most of the
United States' brokerage houses use clearing firms to carry out
their customers' transactions and administer accounts. Using
Miller's argument, customers of these firms, were they to fail,
could get no satisfaction from the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument may be technically correct under the law,'' said
Borg, the Alabama securities commissioner, ``but it insulates a lot
of people who sell stocks. It indicates even more reason why SIPC
has to be re-examined.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporation is overseen by a board of seven, five of whom
are appointed by the president. Three of the five represent the
securities industry and two, including the chairman and vice
chairman, are appointed to represent the general public. The two
other directors are appointed by the secretary of the Treasury and
the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Clifford Hudson, is chief executive of Sonic
Corp., an Oklahoma City operator of fast-food restaurants. Hudson,
who has been chairman for six years, declined to discuss specific
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief is that as the statute was originally intended, SIPC
management does a good job of implementing it,'' he said. ``There
are people today who would like to see the nature of that coverage
expanded. That could happen, but Congress would have to change the
statute.''
</P>
<P>
   How the corporation compensates investors and whether it does so
fairly is the subject of a study being done by the General
Accounting Office that was requested by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
The report is due next March.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, in New
York City, who has aggressively pursued fraudulent brokerage firms
to help wronged investors recoup some of their losses, said: ``The
investor protection act has to be revisited for two reasons. It
doesn't cover a majority of investors' losses, such as those
incurred by fraud or malfeasance, and the red tape that is involved
for investors trying to recover is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporation has been relatively free of scrutiny since it
was created. In that period, the Securities and Exchange Commission
has inspected the organization twice, once in 1985 and again in
1994. Three months ago, the SEC began another regular inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're telling people to go into the market _ it's safe, it's
transparent _ and that we're going to watch out for their
interests,'' Borg said. ``But SIPC does not provide for a lot of
protection, and I think that's a defect of the law.''

BLAIR TELLS PARTY: STOP BICKERING AND BE A SURVIVOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Gordon broods over Tony becoming leader. Tony wishes
Gordon would get a life. Mo has gotten too popular, and Peter,
unpopular and banished, returns to stab her in the back. Tony takes
Peter back in and shuns Mo. Mo says she's leaving the group.
</P>
<P>
   The latest rumors from the ``Survival'' island or the ``Big
Brother'' house? No, merely the latest reports about the men and
women cohabiting the Cabinet room at 10 Downing St.
</P>
<P>
   Once ruthlessly disciplined to stay on message, the members of
Tony Blair's administration _ chief among them the chancellor,
Gordon Brown; the former Northern Ireland secretary, Mo Mowlam; and
her successor, Peter Mandelson _ have been falling into personal
feuds.
</P>
<P>
   The spats and snits are all being published just as the Labor
government has fallen dramatically in public estimation and meets
in Brighton this week to prepare for elections expected next May.
</P>
<P>
   Blair called on his restive party Sunday to ``stand firm'' and
``hold its nerve'' and not be diverted by the ``froth'' of internal
Cabinet disputes. What is important for Labor this week is to start
to recover the unity and momentum that carried it to a landslide
victory in 1997 and kept it 20 points ahead of the floundering
Conservative opposition for more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   But any hopes Labor had of staging an American-style celebratory
convention to send happy activists out on the campaign trail are
threatened by its current loss of public following and by
rabble-rousing struggles.
</P>
<P>
   There will be fights over pensioners' demands for more than the
modest $1.10 rise in weekly benefits they got last year and
motorists' outrage at high fuel taxes that have taken the price of
a gallon of gasoline to more than $4.
</P>
<P>
   Blair faces the challenge no longer as the high-riding commander
of a party lined up behind him in smart formations. It was his
poorly presented refusal to give in to nationwide fuel protests
earlier this month that sent his ratings into a free fall, and
surveys now show Labor from four to eight points behind the
Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Cushioned from dissent by his huge parliamentary majority, Blair
was caught unawares in the fuel crisis, and the voters now say his
actions showed him to be arrogant, incompetent and out of touch
with public sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said Sunday that while he took seriously the public dismay
at the internal bickering and the need to listen more to what is
happening far from 10 Downing St., ``In a funny way, although I
think our popularity may have been dented in the last few weeks,
our credibility has been enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly published feuds record Brown's recurring resentment
over Blair's decision in 1994 to contest the party leadership and
Blair's past comments to friends that his intense and moody
Treasury head should get married and settle down. Brown, a
49-year-old bachelor, finally wed his longtime girlfriend, Sarah
Macaulay, in July.
</P>
<P>
   The other disputes center on Blair's removal of Mowlam, the most
popular member of his Cabinet, as Northern Ireland secretary last
year, giving the job to his closest political strategist,
Mandelson, who had earlier resigned from the Cabinet in disgrace.
Mowlam announced this month that she would be leaving her marginal
Cabinet post and quitting Parliament at the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's central political ambition remains to transform public
services, available to all, with a stable economy and sound public
finances. But announcing initiatives has proved easier than
producing results.
</P>
<P>
   This shortfall has been aggravated by Labor's tendency to
repackage the same amounts of money and to extend pledges that
cannot be readily fulfilled. At a past convention, Blair promised
that 1999 would be the ``year of delivery.'' More recently he
assured Britons that the fuel supply blocked by protesters would
start to return to normal in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Two festering scandals have reignited during the troubled recent
weeks to keep the Cabinet divisions on the front pages.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing poor performance of the Millennium Dome, the
government's pet attraction, and evidence that its finances are in
a chaotic state have prompted repeated calls for the resignation of
its overseer, Lord Falconer, one of Blair's oldest friends and
closest political advisers. While government ministers reluctantly
fell in behind the defense of the project, Clare Short, the
outspoken international development secretary, this week called it
a ``disaster'' and a ``flop.''
</P>
<P>
   And new reports suggested that Brown had lied to the BBC about
the government's most damaging brush with corruption _ the linking
in 1997 of a secret $1.6 million donation to the Labor Party from
Formula One racing's chief, Bernie Ecclestone, with a decision by
Blair favoring the sport. Denying knowledge of the affair, Brown
did not let the matter rest there. His aides put out word that he
suspected the source of the charge was Blair.

   GBADOLITE, Congo _ It is mostly jungle here but the runway can _
and did, at least twice _ handle the Concorde. This is the hometown
of Mobutu Sese Seko, the former dictator who usually wore a
leopard-skin hat, and he spared it little.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for starters, a splendidly tacky Chinese palace in
Gbadolite. The hydroelectric plant is big enough to power the whole
region. It does not and was not meant to. But Gbadolite is
certainly well lit, 24 hours a day, even in the middle of a war.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the headquarters of the Movement for the Liberation
of the Congo _ what one influential African newsletter recently
called ``the most successful opposition militia'' fighting to
overthrow Congo's current president, Laurent Kabila. And the
movement's location here feeds in to the perception that of the
three rebel groups fighting Kabila, this one is most closely tied
to Mobutu, and by association to the excesses in nearly every
corner of Gbadolite.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation infuriates Jean-Pierre Bemba, the rebel leader, a
former businessman who happens to have flourished under the Mobutu
era. Bemba, 38, is a large, enthusiastic, even impressive man whose
boyish face struggled to rein itself in when an interview turned to
Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the link,'' he insisted at his headquarters here,
on Mobutu Sese Seko Avenue. ``I know the people have been really
disappointed by Mobutu.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a Mobutuist?'' he said a minute later. ``A Mobutuist
is a tribalist, a nepotist, a thief. He's corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Bemba said he and the other leaders of his movement are none of
those things, though he was quick to suggest that the description
fit Kabila, who toppled Mobutu in 1997. Mobutu _ who stole untold
billions in government money in 32 years in power _ died shortly
afterward in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Bemba and his advisers know that the perception could hurt him
if he is able, as he hopes, to transform himself from a rebel in
northwest Equateur Province to a top leader of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard for him to shake the association. Raised and
educated in Belgium, he was the successful owner of aviation and
mobile phone companies under Mobutu's rule. His father, Jeannot
Bemba Saolona, was once an economy minister and one of the richest
businessmen in what was then called Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   Bemba's finance secretary served Mobutu, as did the father of
his second in command. Africa Confidential, a newsletter on African
politics, reported that Mobutu's former security adviser, Jean Seti
Yale, ``is said, quietly, to be a friend of Bemba's.''
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter asserted, however, that ``Bemba junior has broken
with most of Mobutu's barons,'' including two generals not
permitted in the territory he controls. Bemba made it poignantly
clear that he has also broken with his father _ who went on to
serve Kabila, though he was recently fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't belong to a family anymore,'' he said. ``I have to
justify what I'm doing to the people first. I lost maybe a father
but I gained another family _ the people of Congo. And I like them
very much.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly two years since he began in Kisangani with 154 men
(and the undisguised help of Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni,
who would also like to see Kabila fall), Bemba has sought to
develop an economic program distinct from Mobutu's grab-all
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that his rebel movement does not get involved in
business itself _ trading the diamonds or coffee in its region _
but imposes taxes, like any modern government.
</P>
<P>
   While the other two rebel movements are not as tainted by an
association with Mobutu, Bemba has something they lack: popularity
with the people. This is in part because of his personality, which
is forceful, personable and geared more to business than ideology.
In addition, his movement is not associated with Rwanda, which is
strongly disliked in Congo and which backs another of the rebel
groups, the Congolese Rally for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   While no one compares Bemba to Mobutu directly, people here in
Gbadolite have the habit of comparing Mobutu's reign favorably with
Kabila's. As Kabila was winning control, people say, soldiers
harassed them and imposed a curfew. Bemba replaced the soldiers
with calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mobutu was here, life was fine and people lived
peacefully,'' said Matembe Mabena Embula, 47, who sells onions,
rice and garlic at the main market here. ``Mobutu was a dictator
but we were all right. And today we're all right too.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is any dissatisfaction with Bemba here it is not
because of ties to Mobutu but because they want him to fight harder
against Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is no fighting in Gbadolite at the moment, people
are suffering with little money and few jobs. For example, a
university student, Amani Itebo, 23, recently visited his family
outside the city. They could not give him money for books and
supplies but handed over a baby chimpanzee, which hung sick and
weak the other morning around Ibelo's neck. He was trying to sell
the chimp for $25 to keep his studies going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the MLC fighting quickly and taking more territory,''
he said. ``Because life is very difficult.''

RISE OF THE WEB FORCES IOC TO PROTECT ITS IMAGE FROM SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Mo., N.C., Va.)  By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christie Ambrosi, the hard-hitting outfielder for the U.S.
Olympic women's softball team, has long had friendly dealings with
her hometown newspaper, The Kansas City Star. So, when asked, she
readily agreed to write an Olympic diary for The Star's World Wide
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before she left for Sydney, Australia, in August,
she sent an e-mail message to the newspaper, saying, ``As far as
the diary entry, we aren't allowed to do them during the
Olympics.'' The International Olympic Committee was putting teeth
into its often-ignored rule against publication of athletes'
Olympic diaries during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrosi was not alone. Siri Mullinix, the North Carolina-born
goalkeeper of the women's soccer team, stopped her online chats
with The Greensboro News &AMP; Record said she could not contribute a
diary during the Games. The Hartford Courant got the same message
from Karen Scavotto, the 18-year-old archer from Enfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The 27th Olympic Games may be remembered for many things _ world
records, peacetime logistical planning _ but it will surely be a
benchmark in the struggle between those who hold intellectual
property rights in sporting events and those seeking to cover
sports, especially for the ever-expanding universe of news outlets
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that the power of the Internet could eventually
undermine the economic foundation of the modern Olympic movement,
the Olympic committee is going to great lengths to control how and
where the images and accounts of the Sydney extravaganza reach the
public. The committee's actions echo what is happening in other
areas of sports, as both amateur and professional teams and leagues
aggressively invoke their property rights to control how and by
whom events are covered.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the committee's attention is focused on the Web. Here,
streaming video _ still in its infancy _ may eventually attain both
the technical quality and reach to cut into television audiences.
This could, in turn, dilute the value of the most valuable asset of
the Olympics: broadcasting rights. The Web could also spawn a horde
of virtual storefronts where those with no rights to Olympic
trademarks piggyback on the Olympic name to hawk their wares
without returning anything to the nonprofit committee, which
supports the athletes and the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects are worrisome enough to make Olympic officials
take a hard line now. No athlete diaries or online chats. No
streaming video of events _ even months-old replays of the
Australian Olympic swimming trials, as the Austrialian site
www.ninemsn.com.au discovered. No use of the trademarked Olympic
rings to promote news organizations' own Olympic coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Two months before the Games began, the committee filed a lawsuit
in federal court in northern Virginia to dislodge 1,800 so-called
cyber-squatters, who had registered domain names using terms
trademarked by the IOC. Names of the defendants took up 40 pages;
among the domain names were bet-on-the-olympics.com,
olympiccasinos.com, alienolympics.com. and olympicsexellence.com.
The lawsuit is pending.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 private Web monitors have been chosen on three
continents, using the latest search engine technology to monitor
possible violations of the IOC's property rights. One inadvertent
violator was TV Azteca of Mexico, which has broadcast rights within
Mexico. It had to drop a video clip of the opening ceremonies from
its Web site, which could be seen outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   The strict enforcement of the diary rule hit local newspapers
hard. Mike Fannin, the sports editor of The Kansas City Star, said,
``I would assume that it is their ball and if you want to play, you
play by their rules.'' But, he added: ``The readers miss that
connection with their local athlete. Christie Ambrosi's a softball
player in the Kansas City suburbs. When she walks into a bar,
people know who she is. The Olympics _ it's all about representing
your hometown, your city, your country.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Servan-Schreiber, the director of communications and
new media for the International Olympic Committee, is keenly aware
of the tension between property rights and unfettered coverage of
the Games. But, he said, ``I don't think the IOC can be seen in any
way limiting speech about the Olympics.'' He pointed out that
20,000 journalists are in Sydney _ nearly twice as many media
people as athletes, all free to cover the Games as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that the most important pieces of news, the
results, are released immediately and sent instantly by wire
services to all publications, online and off. Any journalist can
interview the athletes, he added. ``It's the most written-about
event every four years,'' he said of the Summer Games. ``We're very
far removed from any notion of limiting speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive enforcement effort, he said, is meant to ensure
that ``the association between the athlete, the sport, the values
and the symbol that represents all this is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has offered little revenue to the Olympics so far.
There are concerns that the Web could cut into television audiences
and undermine the economic underpinnings of the Olympic movement.
The committee took in about $1.3 billion for television rights to
the Sydney games alone. NBC paid $705 million for U.S. rights.
</P>
<P>
   And though great technological improvements are needed before
the Internet can offer high-quality video to large audiences, even
in print, the Web's reach still expands the power of once-small
publications. The existing rule against diaries was never enforced
against ``small newspapers,'' Servan-Schreiber said. Now, on the
Web, ``nothing is small.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   (At least one newspaper, however, has printed an athlete's diary
without repercussions. The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., ran a
first-person account Thursday from Joetta Clark Diggs, an 800-meter
runner. An editor there said no Olympic officials had objected.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Servan-Schreiber also said he feared that the better-known
athletes might use their own Web sites to communicate with fans
instead of giving interviews to journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want athletes competing with mass media,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new emphasis on restrictions like the diary ban is
infuriating to some. ``It's outrageous,'' said Bruce Keller, a
lawyer in New York who has represented both sides in intellectual
property cases. ``They are prohibiting these diaries as a condition
of participation in the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, the noted constitutional lawyer, said it was odd
that ``the increased availability of a means of communication leads
to a ruling seeking to assure that less is said.'' But he said the
IOC is not a U.S. governmental body and so is not bound by the
First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The gradual fencing off of information and imagery by sports
franchises was well under way before the Olympics. In the last few
years, debates have been joined over whether game developments can
be distributed instantly by pager (they can, a federal appeals
court has ruled).
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, NASCAR, the stock-car racing league, backed
off an attempt to make reporters seeking credentials at races like
the Daytona 500 agree that NASCAR was sole owner of ``images,
sounds and data arising from and during any NASCAR event'' _
including the racing times and scoring information.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Persinger, the sports editor of The Charlotte Observer
in North Carolina, the epicenter of the NASCAR universe, rebelled.
``They were saying, `If it happens during the event, we own the
intellectual property rights to it,''' Persinger said. ``And you
can't own the news.''
</P>
<P>
   John Griffin, the managing director for communications at
NASCAR, agreed that the proposed language went too far; the
franchise was trying to protect itself, he said, from freelance
photographers who put drivers' images on mugs or other commercial
paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For the International Olympic Committee _ a nonprofit
organization that gives more than 90 percent of its revenue to
sports federations, local Olympic committees, organizing committees
of host cities and athletes _ the stakes in controlling the Web
loom increasingly large, particularly in four, six or eight years,
when streaming video on the Web may be light years ahead of the
current fuzzy, jumpy images.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of the results. In January, the
committee proposed to The Associated Press, Reuters and three other
international news agencies that they hold off one hour before they
made the results available to commercial Web sites. The news
organizations objected, and the IOC backed off.
</P>
<P>
   All the issues raised by the Web will be discussed at an Olympic
committee meeting in December.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far in the Games, all scores had been sent out to news
organizations instantaneously, said the A.P.'s sports editor, Terry
Taylor. ``It's been going fine,'' she said. ``We're moving it as
fast as we get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the 15-hour to 18-hour time difference between Sydney and
the United States, many dedicated fans are turning to the Web for
results. Traffic on the sports sections of all major sites, like
sports.yahoo.com, msnbc.com and cnnsi.com, surged in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Weiner, NetRatings' vice president for analytic services,
says he does not think the Web has cut into the broadcast audience.
``People have been using it to determine what they want to watch on
TV,'' he said. ``If you were a basketball fan and heard they had a
close game against Lithuania, you might be interested in
watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fannin of The Kansas City Star said, ``I think all these
leagues are getting more proprietary about their rights and what's
theirs and what's theirs exclusively _ especially when it pertains
to the Internet.'' And when it comes to sports, ``it's a seller's
market.''

SPECIAL REPORT: VICTIMS OF FAILED BROKERAGE FIRMS FIND LITTLE
HELP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This is the abridged version of INVESTOR-PROTECTION.) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Heebner, owner of a building-supply store in Temple, Pa.,
got a call four years ago from his longtime stockbroker
recommending an investment in short-term bonds. Assured the bonds
were safe, Heebner invested $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Heebner received a stunning phone call. The
broker told him the money he had put into the bonds was gone. The
president of the broker's firm, Old Naples Securities, had stolen
it.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife about to deliver their third child, Heebner, 36,
reeled at the thought of a $100,000 loss. Then he remembered with
relief that his account was insured by the Securities Investor
Protection Corp., created by Congress in 1970 to protect investors'
brokerage accounts from just the sort of theft he had been a victim
of.
</P>
<P>
   Heebner figured wrong. For over four years, the corporation
maintained he was entitled to nothing _ even though three federal
courts ruled that SIPC should pay him $87,000. Only last week, days
after a reporter interviewed the lawyer representing the
corporation about Heebner, did the investor receive a check in the
amount of $87,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got the sense that SIPC was in any way trying to help
my client,'' said William P. Thornton Jr., a lawyer at Stevens &AMP;
Lee in Reading, Pa., representing Heebner against the corporation.
``They are very aggressive in attempting to prove that investors'
claims do not come within certain legal definitions within the SIPC
statute. And the loser is the investor.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when millions of U.S. citizens have taken their money
out of federally insured banks and put it into brokerage firms, the
Securities Investor Protection Corp.'s charge of protecting the
investing public has never been more important.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the SIPC defend the corporation's record and say
they must be vigilant in protecting against invalid claims by
investors. But a close look at this little-understood organization
shows that the safety net that investors believe the corporation
offers is in fact full of holes.
</P>
<P>
   Industry-financed but not government-backed, the corporation is
a far cry from the agency on which it was loosely modeled, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which protects bank customers
against losses.
</P>
<P>
   Created three decades ago after a number of brokerage-firm
failures and securities thefts, the corporation is chartered to
protect each investor with securities held at a member brokerage
firm for up to $500,000; claims for cash are limited to $100,000 a
customer.
</P>
<P>
   But convincing the corporation to pay can be extremely
difficult. The organization, requires investors to run a gantlet of
legal technicalities that would challenge even those knowledgeable
about securities law.
</P>
<P>
   Some securities lawyers say this is because trustees overseeing
the cases are chosen by, and paid by, the corporation. This differs
from the independent trustees who are appointed by the court to
handle corporate bankruptcy cases, and who are working for the
people owed money.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the trustees working for the investor protection
corporation _ many of them from a coterie of lawyers who have made
a lucrative specialty of such cases _ have received far more from
representing the corporation than the corporation itself has paid
to investors. Their critics say that trustees wanting repeat
business from the corporation have an incentive to minimize payouts
to investors.
</P>
<P>
   In Heebner's case, the corporation said that because the
investor had sent his money not to Old Naples but to a subsidiary,
his investment was not covered. In addition, because the
corporation could find no proof that bonds had ever been bought
with the $100,000, the organization assumed Heebner had given the
money to the brokerage firm as a loan. Lenders are not covered by
the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The list of what the corporation does not cover is long. For one
thing, while $100,000 placed in a bank account insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is covered regardless of why the
bank failed, assets lost in a failed brokerage firm are not covered
if the loss is a result of most kinds of securities fraud,
including a failure to execute a purchase or sale of securities or
misrepresentation in the sale of a stock or bond.
</P>
<P>
   Losses from unauthorized trading, a large problem among small
brokerage firms in the 1990s, are covered only if an investor can
prove to the satisfaction of corporation representatives that he
complained promptly to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is SIPC is outdated and needs to be
reviewed,'' said Joseph P. Borg, securities commissioner for
Alabama. ``It's been around since 1970, when one in 10 Americans
were in the markets. Now everyone is in the markets. And everyone
thinks that SIPC logo reads `FDIC,' but the protection is very
limited.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporation's president, Michael E. Don, disagrees with
accusations that his organization does not put investors first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It simply is not true that protecting our fund is our
interest,'' he said. ``Our interest is to see to it that customers
get paid.'' Don added that when the corporation considered an
investor's claim invalid, it had no choice but to fight the
investor in court, as it did Heebner.
</P>
<P>
   The investor protection corporation and the FDIC are vastly
different. While the FDIC is an agency of the federal government
and its insurance fund is backed by the full faith and credit of
the government, the corporation is financed by the securities
industry and can borrow from the government, with special approval,
only in emergencies. It also maintains a $1 billion line of credit
with a consortium of banks.
</P>
<P>
   And while bank examiners employed by the FDIC routinely monitor
risks at banks, the corporation steps in only when a brokerage firm
has collapsed or is close to failure.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is that a brokerage firm, no matter how large
or troubled, pays just $150 a year to be a member of SIPC, while
payments into the FDIC insurance fund are based on a bank's size
and financial health: the riskier the bank, the larger the fee.
</P>
<P>
   A key problem with SIPC liquidations, some securities lawyers
say, is that trustees overseeing the cases have allegiance to the
corporation that appointed them, rather than to wronged investors.
</P>
<P>
   To be truly in the corner of investors, these people say,
trustees in brokerage-firm liquidations should be completely
independent of the corporation, which naturally wants to protect
its assets.
</P>
<P>
   How the corporation compensates investors and whether it does so
fairly is the subject of a study being done by the General
Accounting Office that was requested by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
The report is due next March.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, in New
York City, who has aggressively pursued fraudulent brokerage firms
to help wronged investors recoup some of their losses, said: ``The
investor protection act has to be revisited for two reasons. It
doesn't cover a majority of investors' losses, such as those
incurred by fraud or malfeasance, and the red tape that is involved
for investors trying to recover is incredible.''

SWISS VOTERS REJECT LIMIT ON NUMBER OF FOREIGNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Swiss voters rejected a proposal Sunday to impose a
constitutional limit on the percentage of foreigners in their
country, apparently heeding government warnings that it risked
harming the economy and ties with the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would have set a ceiling of 18 percent on the
number of foreigners in this country of 7.2 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, more than 63 percent voted against the measure, which
had been proposed by center-right groups seeking to close
Switzerland's borders to ``unqualified'' workers and to many
refugees. Despite the relief in official Switzerland, which had
fretted that a yes vote would have harmed the country's
tourist-dependent image, there was concern over the relatively
large vote in favor of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The vote had been closely watched because of rising xenophobic
sentiments in Europe, which have increased under the flood of
refugees seeking to flee war-torn regions, especially the countries
that were once part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment here against refugees from Kosovo and, earlier,
Bosnia helped secure surprising electoral gains a year ago for the
right-wing Swiss People's Party, which campaigned against reported
abuses by asylum seekers.
</P>
<P>
   The success, and inclusion in the government, of the
anti-immigrant Freedom Party in Austria revealed the fears of an
aging European population that national identities were being
eroded. Opponents of the Swiss measure worried that this sentiment
might be strong enough to win a majority of Swiss voters, even
though similar restrictions have been rejected a half dozen times
in past decades.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting diplomats and workers for international agencies
and some other excepted categories, Switzerland's population is now
19.3 percent foreign.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of foreigners is much higher in the
French-speaking part of the country; they make up one-third of
Geneva's population, for instance. As expected, though, this area
rebuffed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But the mostly German-speaking cantons in the eastern part of
the country that have the biggest influx of people from the former
Yugoslavia had larger proportions favorable to the ceiling. The
narrowest defeat came in the central state of Schwyz, where 51.6
percent voted against the measure. No canton approved it.
</P>
<P>
   To be passed, the proposal would have required a majority both
of voters and of the 26 cantons.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's supporters began collecting signatures to put it
on the ballot shortly after Bosnian refugees began to arrive in the
early 1990s, coinciding with the beginning a decade of economic
doldrums in Switzerland. Supporters insisted that barriers needed
to be erected against cheap labor's taking Swiss jobs.
</P>
<P>
   One organizer, Philipp Mueller, denied accusations that the
measure was racist and said he hoped the vote would force an
overhaul of immigration policies. The government already has
proposed new laws that would limit the numbers of workers from
countries outside the European Union and better integrate
foreigners into Swiss life.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But there was some concern that the nearly 40 percent support
for the measure represented a deeply disgruntled segment of Swiss.
``The vote shows that the government must take these people's views
into consideration,'' argued another organizer for the measure,
Luzi Stamm. He said much of the support for the measure had come
from blue-collar workers who feared losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But Swiss companies argued that closing borders would prevent
recruiting for people with specialized skills. With unemployment at
1.8 percent last month, the lowest since 1992, companies are
looking outside the country for workers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed cap would have counted European Union citizens as
foreigners, which also would have jeopardized agreements the Swiss
just approved with the 15-nation union.
</P>
<P>
   In the voting Sunday, a series of proposals to encourage
renewable energy were also defeated, even though Switzerland, like
other European countries, has seen increases in gasoline and
heating oil prices.

 &HT;    Stain of drugs persists
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Another day, another Olympic drug bust. This time we
lost a Latvian, one Andris Reinholds, who stands accused of rowing
under the influence of muscle helper.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, ol' Andris may want to speak with his steroid
supplier when he gets home. The stuff he got must have been way
past its expiration date, or cut with lilac water. The man was only
ninth in the men's single sculls when his urine tested super
premium. Just think if he hadn't been juiced. He would have needed
a tow to get back to shore.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sunday here _ which I believe is May 14 in the States _
there have been five athletes caught during Games testing. In
addition, two Romanian weightlifters were expelled from the
athletes' village because of dirty pre-Games tests. China kept a
number of its own home. No one you've heard of, which means this
doesn't qualify as a controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The drug follies are as much a part of the Olympic program as
flags and anthems. This quadrennial has been, at times, inspired:
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the Romanian weightlifters claimed to go on a hunger
strike to protest his expulsion. Perhaps if he had thought of that
before trying to make weight, he wouldn't have been caught with
diuretics in his system.
</P>
<P>
   _ Canadian equestrian Eric Lamaze had been suspended for a
diuretic positive. He was later cleared, and his horse shipped to
Australia. Only during his banishment, his depression would lead
him back to an old vice, cocaine. Another test showed that and
cemented his expulsion. The horse, meanwhile is still in Australia,
awaiting a rider. Perhaps it can keep busy working birthday
parties.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Bulgarian weightlifters officially earned the title of
worst cheaters in Olympic history. They were tossed from the 2000
Games for using the same diuretic that got them expelled from the
1988 Olympics. Hopefully, their supertankers of the stuff are
nearly empty.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several lesser Bulgarians had rented themselves out to Qatar
in order to make a weightlifting team. When the positives on their
brothers started coming back, two of them developed a mysterious
stomach ailment on the day they were to compete and headed for
cover. The sight of a specimen bottle made them sick.
</P>
<P>
   _ The very first gold medalist in women's weightlifting,
Bulgaria's Izabel Dragneva, also became its first disgraced
champion. The U.S. broke a 40-year gold medal weightlifting drought
after Dragneva was deemed dirty and silver medalist Tara Nott
promoted over her. One champion, one footnote. My, that was quick.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two trampoline medal winners were stripped when they tested
positive for helium. OK, I made that one up.
</P>
<P>
   According to the International Olympic Committee, it's on the
case. It claims to have conducted 1,073 tests so far during the
Games, on top of the 361 tests it did outside of competition and
260 for the hormone EPO. Don't you pity the person in charge of
that inventory?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced everybody has progressed in the fight against
doping,'' said Francois Carrard, IOC general director. ``I think
more people are aware. Still, some people cheat and hopefully we
are catching them.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the medalists in the men's shot put, you'd think
there has been some real progress in one of the traditionally
dirtiest events. They don't need any tests to prove they're clean.
Just look at their results. They were too unspectacular to be
drug-aided (the shortest winning throw in a non-boycotted Olympics
since 1976). In these strange days, not breaking a record can be a
good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Great, if they really believe in breakthroughs. But no number of
tests or testimonials will eliminate the kind of shadowy suspicion
that has trailed swim sensation Inge de Bruijn through these Games.
</P>
<P>
   The distrust has gone too deep. The stain is permanent. There is
always the thought: For all those caught, how many have slipped
through the net?
</P>
<P>
   Did you see how his times dropped? Did you hear how deep her
voice was. Did you check out that complexion?
</P>
<P>
   As long as ambition intersects with science, the Olympic drug
follies will continue. This pitiful burlesque will never die.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANSHYA, Zambia _ In a nation that has seen its hopes for
prosperity fade like the luster of a old coin, this struggling town
in the country's Copperbelt has suffered more than most at the
hands of copper's cascading fortunes and government's lamentable
efforts to manage the nation's most precious natural resource.
</P>
<P>
   So it is hardly happenstance that the politicking likely to
frame the campaign for presidential elections next year is
centering on this eroded expanse of industrial promise. Copper has
always been the biggest export for this country of 10 million and,
despite the industry's struggles, it remains Zambia's most
important commodity and its greatest hope for improving an economy
saddled with enormous debt, high inflation and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The first volley in the presidential campaign by Ben Mwila, a
wealthy former cabinet minister, will be fired here on Tuesday,
when he hopes a special election will put his month-old Republican
Party on the political map. Winning even a few of the seven seats
the party is contesting could help Mwila, who was expelled in July
from the governing party he helped found, the Movement for
Multiparty Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Republican Party _ so new that it is still planning
its inaugural convention _ can tap the discontent of this
impoverished country and turn it into a political platform will
become clear within months. The desperation that has settled over
this town and others around it will certainly remain for years,
even if Mwila succeeds in winning power from President Frederick
Chibila.
</P>
<P>
   Chibila, who won election in 1991 and 1996 and is
constitutionally barred from a third term, wants to guarantee that
his successor is firmly in his mold.
</P>
<P>
   With the presidency and 130 of the 150 seats in Parliament held
by the governing Movement for Multiparty Democracy, the party is
loathe to cede its tight grip on power. And, says its national
secretary, Michael Sata, it won't. ``We're winning all of our
seats,'' Sata said in an interview. ``They have no manifesto, they
have no plan, they have no original ideas,'' he said of the
Republicans, dismissing the new party as a fleeting curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people showed up Thursday for a rally by Mwila in
Kalulushi, a township near here, listening intently but applauding
sparingly and resisting invitations to join in crowd chant or
singing. ``They are waiting to see what he has to offer,'' said
Donald Chola, a businessman in the Copperbelt who attended the
rally. ``People are still assessing him. They want to hear from
him. They want to hear what new ideas he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Mwila railed against cronyism and corruption in government and
then promised to devote more money to building homes and cutting
the costs of raw agricultural supplies. His party, he said, is
about empowering people. ``This is the time to redeem yourself and
redeem your economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a drive around Luanshya and the mining compound that once was
its economic engine, it is possible to see much to redeem: a
shuttered library, an empty market, one dormant mining shaft after
another. Bumpy dirt roads are pocked by patches of pavement as well
as bustling bottle shops, as the people here call the neighborhood
liquor stores.
</P>
<P>
   Even by the standards of the Copperbelt, Luanshya is suffering,
he said. Like the rest of the country's mines, Luanshya's were
nationalized more than three decades ago on the heels of
independence from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   After years of government mismanagement, Luanshya's mines were
among the first to be returned to private hands in 1997. Little has
changed. Where thousands of people once worked, clutches of men
stand idle. Where once children bathed at home, crumbling
infrastructure now leaves them to splash in the waste water still
pumped out of the mothballed mine shafts.

 &HT;    Braves getting into the swing of things
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ There is a Canadian exchange rate to be calculated
somewhere in here but mounting evidence suggests the Atlanta Braves
have once and for all calibrated their swings. Celebrating the
biggest offensive day of the season with a 14-5 thumping of
Montreal, the Braves are now hitting like this is one big pinata
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are keeping the motivation up,'' said catcher
Javy Lopez, whose three-run homer in the eighth was the final
chop-buster to the Expos' beleaguered bullpen. ``Especially with
the (New York) series coming up (Tuesday), games like this are
really going to pump us up.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's 21 hits and 14 runs represented season-high totals,
while the club scored in double-figures for the second consecutive
game and the fourth time in eight games. The Braves hit two more
homers, making for 14 in the past nine dates. Rookie Rafael Furcal
hit a bases-empty shot in the sixth, his fourth homer this month.
``I don't swing hard,'' said the rookie, who hit just two homers in
his three minor-league seasons. ``I try to put the ball in play and
if it's a good swing, sometimes the ball, I hit it good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves reduced their magic number to four, while New York
won its second of three in Philadelphia. With six wins in eight
games, the Braves have outscored opponents 68-35 during that span.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's biggest recipient was Braves starter Andy Ashby, who
gave up three runs in the first and could laugh about it by the
second, after an Andruw Jones bases-loaded double opened up a 6-3
lead. Ashby (12-12) won for the fourth time in a row and has
allowed 10 earned runs in his past 29 1/2 innings (3.03 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to contribute,'' said Ashby, 8-5 as a Brave.
``It's kind of frustrating to give up five runs. The offense
allowed us a little leeway. Some games, you need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Every starter except Wally Joyner and Brian Jordan drove in at
least one run and Andruw Jones reached 99 RBIs. Reggie Sanders had
his sixth multi-hit game in three weeks with three hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hits the ball and it goes in,'' manager Bobby Cox said.
``If they had dropped in like this in the first month of the
season, he never would have gotten into his slump.''
</P>
<P>
   The legitimacy of Atlanta's offensive thrust will be tested
twice in the next 48 hours, first this afternoon by Montreal's
Javier Vazquez and then Tuesday by New York's Al Leiter.

 &HT;    Back to square one for Cowboys
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Charlie Garner left. Charlie Garner right.
Charlie Garner up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   That was what the Dallas Cowboys witnessed in their surprisingly
lopsided loss to old rival San Francisco on Sunday. By the time
Garner quit running, he had amassed 201 yards rushing, carrying the
49ers to a 41-24 victory before 64,127 fans at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A game that was marked by bizarre behavior by both teams really
belonged to Garner, who should become the third NFL player to be
named NFC offensive player of the week after playing against
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Garner's 201 yards on the ground came only three weeks after
Philadelphia's Duce Staly ran for 201 against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Excuses for the Cowboys? No, only shameful pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go back to square one,'' said Cowboys Coach Dave
Campo, who for first time this season appeared truly upset about a
game. ``Until we do that, every game will be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (1-3) fell behind early and never had the lead. A field
goal by Tim Seder and Emmitt Smith's short touchdown run kept the
Cowboys in the game early. Yet offensive and defensive breakdowns,
which eventually led to a chorus of boos aimed at Dallas
quarterback Troy Aikman, doomed the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (1-3) had lost 14 of its last 15 games before
getting comfortable at 64-degree Texas Stadium. Quarterback Jeff
Garcia outplayed Aikman, finishing with four touchdown passes, two
to Jerry Rice, the leading receiver in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Garner was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw what Duce did to the Cowboys, so we knew we could run
on them,'' Garner said. ``I didn't know that I carried the ball
that many times (36). Sometimes when you get in a groove, you just
go without thinking too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The game will be remembered for bad blood between the players,
namely San Francisco receiver Terrell Owens and Dallas defensive
backs Darren Woodson and George Teague.
</P>
<P>
   Owens lit a fire under the Cowboys after his two touchdown
catches. After each score, he ran to the painted star at the middle
of the field, raised his arms, and taunted everybody who bleeds
blue and silver.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was so incensed by Owens' actions, he ran to the center of
the field after scoring a touchdown of his own. He shoved the ball
into the ground and pointed at the entire 49ers bench, bringing the
sellout crowd to life.
</P>
<P>
   That was only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Owens scored San Francisco's last touchdown, a short pass from
Jeff Garcia late in the fourth. Owens ran to the star, intending to
mock the Cowboys again. As soon as he reached the star and raised
his hands, he was blind-sided by Teague, who ran nearly 50 yards to
prevent Owens from showing up the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Teague was immediately tossed from the game, and earned a
standing ovation from the crowd before he left the field.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Woodson was so frustrated that he flung his helmet with
both hands toward the Cowboys late in the game. He was involved in
a confrontation with the 49ers and was thrown out, too.
</P>
<P>
   Teague and Woodson showered, changed clothes and left the
stadium before the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams said referee Jeff Triplette and his crew did a poor
job of handling the game. San Francisco was denied a touchdown when
49er Kevin Williams returned a kickoff for a touchdown late in the
second quarter but was incorrectly ruled down by contact. Later,
49ers quarterback Jeff Garcia had an apparent fumble wiped away
because he was ruled down by contact.
</P>
<P>
   TV replays indicated the officials botched both plays.
</P>
<P>
   Triplette had some interesting comments when asked about the
Owens-Smith-Teague act. Many believed the entire problem would have
been solved if Owens had been penalized for ``excessive
celebration'' after his first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Why was it not called?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a rule in the league on excessive celebration with
a single player celebrating,'' Triplette told a pool reporter.
``Only if he's taunting to the bench or to another player.''
</P>
<P>
   So Owens' running 50 yards and drawing attention to himself did
not constitute a penalty?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasn't one that was in the rules at this point,'' Tripplette
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the comical ending, the Cowboys have more problems to
worry about than Owens' behavior. After playing an overall solid
game last Monday against Washington, the Cowboys failed in every
aspect against the previously winless 49ers. Next up for Dallas
will be Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be up early (today) and go about our business,''
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. ``I'm very critical of the entire
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys lost control of the game in the third quarter, which
showed in their play selection. Trailing the entire half, the
Cowboys amazingly had only one rushing play in the third quarter
and one in the fourth. Smith, who had 29 yards after the first
quarter, finished with 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even compete today and that is tough on this team,''
he said.

ARKANSANS REFLECT ON THEIR NATIVE SON 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Jason Maynard loves his grandfather and
wishes he were still alive. But sometimes he thinks it may be just
as well that his grandfather, Marion Crank, died in 1994, before
Bill Clinton's presidency had so many dents.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, a 20-year veteran of the Arkansas Legislature,
had a fondness for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandfather was around to see him elected president in 1992,
but not the rest of it,'' said Maynard, a marketing manager for a
publishing company who recently left Little Rock to work in
Chicago. ``In a way I'm glad he never saw what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But his grandfather, who died at 79 and has a bridge named for
him in Little River County, would have found good in Clinton's
flawed presidency and would not have been surprised that it
endured, Maynard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knock him down, and he keeps coming back,'' his grandfather
once said of Clinton, at a 1981 Democratic fund raiser, as Clinton
was trying to rebuild his political career after losing re-election
as governor in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   When Crank died, Clinton called his widow to offer his
sympathies _ from the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, as the long-running Whitewater investigation
concluded that there was insufficient evidence to bring charges
against Clinton, so, too, evaporated the threat of one more blemish
on his battered presidency. Perhaps it is the final one, say some
in his home state, as his presidency nears its end and Arkansans
here and around the country form his legacy in bars, cafes,
boardrooms, church pews and construction sites.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to it than the usual breakdown of likes or
dislikes, divided by party lines. His strength was always said to
be his personal touch, Arkansans say, so it is only natural that
they take his life personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had tremendous talents and abilities, and they were
misguided,'' said Edward M. Penick Sr., who was born in Little Rock
in 1922 and has lived here all his life.
</P>
<P>
   Like many here, Penick speaks of Clinton with a mix of sadness
and weariness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll remember him as a person who could have done a lot for
this country, but somewhere in his makeup he lost character and
integrity, and that's tragic,'' said Penick, a retired banker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still trying to establish his legacy, and I don't think
it will be what he thinks it will be. The power of the presidency
fed his ego, and he thought no one could do anything to him.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not hate Clinton, he is only disappointed in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Arkansas, he's remembered as a great embarrassment,''
Penick said.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they were tired of the ribald jokes and the talk
show jabs that are finally beginning to subside now that Vice
President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas are providing
fresh material.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave us a black eye, but not a lasting one,'' said Martin
J. Borchert, an affluent retired contractor who was Little Rock's
mayor in 1967 and 1968. ``We'll get over it, if we haven't
already.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said Clinton never did much for the state that was his
springboard to the presidency, that he did not deliver even one
interstate highway, a sore point here.
</P>
<P>
   But as easy as it is to find someone who regrets this state's
connection to Clinton, it is just as easy to find someone who would
vote for him again _ for president, for governor, for anything.
</P>
<P>
   In the dust of a construction site on the northwestern edge of
downtown, Robert J. Keeling wiped the grime and sweat from his face
and thought back on a quarter-century of Bill Clinton-style
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The sex scandals did not turn Keeling, a carpenter with a
master's degree in education, from Clinton. ``It didn't bother me
much,'' Keeling, 45, said. ``If you did a roll call in Congress on
who'd had an affair, hands would go up all over the place'' if the
lawmakers were honest about it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitewater meant nothing to him.
</P>
<P>
   The economy stayed strong, and there was plenty of construction
work. On Friday, he and other workers labored to transform an old
Oldsmobile dealership on the edge of downtown into a temporary
warehouse for Clinton's papers. A permanent library is planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't start with much,'' said Keeling, with admiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't born rich. Look where he got. He did us proud,'' he
said, and then paused, thinking. ``Proud enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Maynard said there was no pure right or pure wrong in the
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He survived Monica,'' Maynard said. ``He survived Whitewater.
And now Al is looking pretty good,'' he said, weighing Vice
President Al Gore's chances of winning the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard said he believed Clinton was not the pure political
animal he has been called. ``He does care about people,'' he said.
That, he said, is not an act.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the city, people say Clinton's legacy will be one
of neither great pride nor great embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think history will treat him well, when it's all said and
done,'' said Joe D. Bell, the son of a state senator and a senior
partner in the influential law firm of Friday, Eldredge &AMP; Clark
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not be a superstar president, but he won't be
remembered as a Herbert Hoover,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said that reaction from outsiders to his being from
Clinton's state is neither always good nor always bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a mixed reaction when I travel out of state,'' he said.
``Some people ask if it's as bad as they say it is, but others say
he's a sharp guy, and we're glad you gave him to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Bell said, Clinton's success _ and then his survival _
may have actually improved the way some Arkansans feel about
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's enduring strength is that he never quits,'' Bell
said. ``It's just another example of the true grit of Arkansans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legacy is formed in Maynard's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard said he will have regrets about Clinton, of unrealized
potential, of a potentially great but flawed man.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that when he thinks about Clinton, whom he has voted
for as long as he has been old enough to do so, he thinks about the
day his grandfather died and how the phone rang in his
grandmother's house, and Clinton's words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting here in the Oval Office, thinking about the good
times Marion and I had,'' Maynard recalled Clinton saying.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard said he will never regret giving that man his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an impressive person,'' he said. ``Anybody who doubts
that should just be introduced to him, and after two minutes of
conversation, they would know that.''

JOSE FELICIANO TRIES TO KINDLE HIS FIRE ONE MORE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jose Feliciano doesn't mind riding some coattails
back into the spotlight. At Carnegie Hall on Wednesday night he
praised the newest Latin-American hit makers and added, ``All these
wonderful artists are reopening the door for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Feliciano, who is Puerto Rican, took his version of the Latin
tinge to the U.S. Top 10 in 1968 when he remade the Doors' ``Light
My Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   With lightly plucked Afro-Cuban guitar syncopations behind an
imploring vocal, the record was a few minutes of ardent virtuosity
amid the psychedelia. His U.S. hit streak lasted only to 1974, but
he has a loyal international audience for his songs in Spanish. He
plans to release an American album early in 2001 called ``I'm Back,
Jack.''
</P>
<P>
   The concert fondly recalled Feliciano's American commercial
heyday. He sang hits from the late 1960s and early '70s by the
Temptations, Bill Withers and Santana. Guest musicians _ Paul
Simon, Peter Yarrow (of Peter, Paul and Mary) and Sam Moore (of Sam
and Dave) _ shared '60s songs with him, including ``Homeward
Bound,'' ``Puff, the Magic Dragon'' and ``Soul Man,'' as Feliciano
made folky, foursquare rhythms lilt and flex. His rhythmic
enhancements had Simon dancing with his hands in the air when they
performed ``Late in the Evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Feliciano didn't restrict himself by era or style. Trading solos
with the Cuban trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, he played the romantic
boleros that started his career and American pop songs like ``The
Shadow of Your Smile.'' He played hard-strumming three-chord rock
(``La Bamba''), easygoing pop-jazz (an instrumental version of
Orleans' ``Dance With Me'') and a modern Latin pop ballad recorded
for his next album.
</P>
<P>
   He has always been an eclectic musician. His guitar technique
pulls together the pinpoint attack of flamenco, the insinuating
chords of bossa nova, the linearity of jazz and the blues
inflections of rock lead guitar, and he can sing with the dramatic
inflections of a bolero singer or the floridity of a soul belter.
</P>
<P>
   At Carnegie Hall, however, his versatility sometimes left him
sounding simply like a mimic, and his fingers were so fast that he
tended to favor flashy guitar filigrees over melodic lines. He was
never less than skillful. But only a few songs _ the Harold Melvin
and the Blue Notes hit ``If You Don't Know Me By Now,'' some
boleros with Sandoval and a still-impetuous ``Light My Fire'' _
translated technique into heart.

 &HT;    Art for the masses in Sydney
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ They don't give Olympic laurels for lyric writing like
they did back in the old days. Probably wouldn't play very well on
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   But something strange and wonderful is happening in Sydney.
Though artists don't compete like they did at the ancient Games,
they are nonetheless being cheered on by spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to see the opera house,'' says Prudence Upton,
an Olympic Arts Festival media coordinator. The city's No. 1 icon
has created a stir among out-of-town visitors. Suddenly, tickets
for ``Tosca'' and ``Troilus and Cressida'' are as hot as those for
tennis and track.
</P>
<P>
   People are wearing sports shoes to the theater, checking their
cell phones at the door and getting an endorphin rush from the
energy of live performance. It's no coincidence that Michael
Scott-Mitchell's Olympic caldron is a direct quotation of Jorn
Utzon's sunburst design on the ceiling of the opera house concert
hall. The Olympic Stadium and the Sydney Opera House are the twin
beacons of the 2000 Games, the architectural pillars supporting the
proscenium of this Olympic experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Arts Festival has been going for some three weeks
now. Some 30 performances _ including choreographers Bill T. Jones
and Pina Bausch and the Australian Youth Orchestra conducted by
Robert Spano _ had come and gone before the Sept. 15 Opening
Ceremonies. But over the last few days, everyone from German singer
Ute Lemper to American chanteuse Barbara Cook have filled the
2,700-seat main hall of the opera house. Is cabaret a dead art
form? Not in this city.
</P>
<P>
   In the smaller spaces of the mammoth, five-theatre arts complex,
British director Michael Bogdanov's sexy and electric production of
Shakespeare's ``Troilus and Cressida'' has been running alongside a
world premiere by the Bangarra Dance Theatre and a double bill by
the Australian Ballet. Meanwhile, Opera Australia has been running
five productions in repertory since Aug. 19, and a Verdi double
bill (``Simon Boccanegra'' and ``La Traviata'') continues through
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Have we mentioned that there are more than 25 visual arts
exhibits at major museums and galleries and an additional baker's
dozen at commercial spaces around the city?
</P>
<P>
   It's too much for any visitor to soak up in a few days' visit.
But here are some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ute Lemper. She is the legitimate heir of Brecht and Weill and
a singer who carries the torch of Edith Piaf and Lotte Lenya
(Weill's wife) like no one else performing today. In a slinky red
velvet dress and trench coat, Lemper was a cross between Marlene
Dietrich and Courtney Love. With icy deadpan wit, she sent up the
British monarchy (``Is she still on that $5 bill?''), the greedy
record industry and the shallow end of fashion (``My teeth are
Gucci'').
</P>
<P>
   In her vocal displays, which showcased material from the Tom
Waits, Philip Glass, Nick Cave and Weill, she was a siren of erotic
tension and emotional regret, proving that '30s angst remains very
much in the bloodstream of her native Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bangarra Dance Theatre. Choreographer Stephen Page and his
composer brother David are the geniuses behind this Aboriginal
company, whose primal-charged work was showcased in the Opening
Ceremonies' most memorable sequences.
</P>
<P>
   This work isn't so much about dance technique as it is about
archetypal shapes and images: life and death, womb and tomb, fire
and earth. ``Skin'' is divided into two pieces of roughly the same
length. ``Shelter,'' a dance for the company's women, is Page's
answer to Michelangelo's ``Pieta,'' a poignant exploration of
motherhood and loss. ``Spear'' tells the journey from the masculine
point of view. Though ``Spear'' sometimes read like a preachy
statement on poverty and alcoholism, Bangarra's work is hauntingly
beautiful and full of contradictions. This is quite possible
Australia's most authentic dance company.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bell Shakespeare Company's ``Troilus and Cressida.'' This
rarely performed Shakespeare play was causing a sensation even
before it opened. There are orgy scenes replete with nudity and
simulated sex and drug use, live video projections on multiple
screens and a campy emcee who's like a gay Jerry Springer. Achilles
and Patroclus are cross dressers, and Troilus and Cressida are
extremely randy.
</P>
<P>
   That said, this over-the-top take on the ancient Greeks and
Trojans is as good as anything you will see in New York and London.
At three hours, it's a bit long, but who cares. There's also the
extra bonus of caldron designer Scott-Mitchell's set _ a
dungeon-like room, juxtaposed against a series of gold iconic
columns, some of which have been exploded by war.
</P>
<P>
   Art Gallery of New South Wales. There are three
Olympic-sponsored exhibits here: the Dead Sea Scrolls, a landmark
exhibit of Aboriginal paintings and a survey of Australia's
greatest artists.
</P>
<P>
   The indigenous show, ``Papunya Tula: Genesis &AMP; Genius,'' is a
testament to spiritual life of the Aboriginies, which is earth- and
ancestor-centered. The naive-looking geometric patterns are in fact
loaded with a highly complex iconography and individualism. These
paintings are every bit as sophisticated, and as moving, as the
works of Rothko, Mondrian and others. That there are no human
figures depicted is a measure of the Aborigines' ethos, in which
life is found in nature and the unconscious mind. The exhibition is
a knock-out.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Australian Icons'' show makes an argument for the
significance of Australian art on the world canvas. Beginning with
Tom Roberts' ``The Golden Fleece,'' a sheep-shearing scene that
captures the essence of the nation in the 19th century, it puts out
everything from Margaret Preston's stylized aesthetic floral
arrangements to Lloyd Rees' mythologies and Brett Whiteley's
psychological torment. Taken all together, the works make a
powerful statement about Australia's identity and often
under-appreciated position on the global art map.

RICH NATIONS AND SOME OIL PRODUCERS URGE PRICE CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Rich nations claimed a breakthrough
Sunday in their battle against high oil prices after persuading
several oil-producing countries to join them in calling for cheaper
crude. But their intensive campaign to stabilize commodity and
currency markets awaited the verdict of traders on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Russia and the United Arab Emirates
joined the Group of 7 industrialized nations and other members of
the committee that governs the International Monetary Fund in
condemning current oil prices as harmful. Their agreement did not
constitute a binding commitment, but financial officials presented
it as tangible progress before the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries holds a meeting in Caracas, Venezuela, this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee is concerned that current oil prices, if
sustained, could hamper global growth, add to inflationary
pressures and adversely affect prospects for many countries,'' its
communique said.
</P>
<P>
   Finance ministers gathered here for the annual meetings of the
monetary fund and the World Bank hope that their sustained
oratorical campaign against a $30-plus barrel price for oil will
have a marked impact on a volatile commodity market that is
sometimes moved by psychology and speculation.
</P>
<P>
   But they are financial officials, not energy ministers, and they
have so far been unable to announce concrete steps that would lead
to a greater supply of oil by winter. Sunday's communique, like one
released Saturday, praised the United States' decision last week to
tap its substantial strategic oil reserves to help dampen prices.
But though the statement noted that other nations would also
consider using emergency reserves to increase supply, none had made
such a commitment by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Finance ministers once expected that their meetings would be
overshadowed by anti-globalization protests. So far, those protests
have proved mostly peaceful and far smaller than anticipated. But
the high price of oil and the falling euro _ what the ministers
have called twin threats to the global economy _ have overtaken the
agenda. The big test will come Monday, when markets reopen and
traders vote on whether official promises to corral prices are
credible.
</P>
<P>
   Central bankers from the United States, Britain, Japan and
Canada joined the European Central Bank on Friday in a concerted
intervention to prop up the battered euro, which had fallen almost
30 percent since it went into use at the start of last year.
</P>
<P>
   In delicately worded statements, they have effectively promised
to buy euros and sell their own currencies again if the market does
not get the message. They could be dragged into defending their
stance as early as Monday if the euro slumps.
</P>
<P>
   Nations that control the monetary fund gave Horst Koehler, the
former German finance ministry official who now runs the
Washington-based International Monetary Fund, the chance to present
his vision for the global lending agency.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has come under sustained attack for practicing bad
economics and imposing too much on poor nations, though the finance
ministers gathered here are strong supporters of the fund because
they see its as a bulwark against financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not come to the fund to turn it upside down,'' Koehler
said before the meeting began. ``But there is a further need for
change, and even accelerated change.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the nations that control the fund backed a plan to
provide debt relief to 20 nations by the end of this year, up from
10 that have already been granted relief. The effort, intended at
least in part to head off demands from protesters, requires that
the monetary fund and the World Bank ease some conditions they have
imposed on debt relief in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The nations also approved changes to the fund's lending programs
designed to preserve the fund's capital for crises and wean it away
from some long-term lending to more financially stable nations. The
overhaul was pushed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
   But finance ministers did not endorse specific changes to the
way the fund imposes capitalist economic and financial conditions
on nations that borrow its money. Though Koehler has spoken of his
vision of streamlining and even eliminating some such conditions,
the committee's communique on Sunday warned against any severing of
strings attached to loans. It did back a review of the matter,
however.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Protesters favoring debt relief held a mock funeral Sunday for
children who they say die needlessly because their countries are so
poor; it attracted hundreds of people to central Prague. Organized
by Jubilee 2000, a London-based umbrella group that advocates debt
forgiveness, the march was significantly smaller than similar
events held recently in Washington, Seattle, and Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Other protest groups have vowed to blockade World Bank and
International Monetary Fund delegates around town on Tuesday. But
some organizers are worried that the number of activists arriving
in Prague will fall short of the expected 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters are blaming overly zealous authorities for the
low turnout. The police on Sunday halted an Italian train carrying
protesters at the Czech Republic's southern border and refused to
let it pass until four blacklisted activists got off.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Sustar, an American who said he writes for a socialist
newspaper in Chicago and who had come to Prague to cover the
demonstrations, said by telephone from the Prague airport that he
had been stopped there by border authorities and refused entry. He
said the local police told him that he was on a blacklist given to
them by U.S. officials. He added that he had been detained during
last year's anti-globalization protests in Seattle.

   My first Olympic ticket arrived last week. It was attached to
the windshield wiper of my car. The City of Los Angeles'
parking-enforcement department delivered it personally.
</P>
<P>
   Ya see, every Wednesday the street sweeper comes around sometime
between 8 a.m. and noon. Signs are all over the place so you can be
sure to get out of the way when it comes hauling around the corner,
knockin' over trash cans with brushes ablazin'.
</P>
<P>
   I know this. I consciously do not park on the street Wednesday
mornings.
</P>
<P>
   Except last week, I did. Because I thought it was Tuesday. But
it was really Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Olympics' fault. And NBC's. And Dick Ebersol's.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the excuse I'm using when I contest this $40 ticket.
If it works, I'll letcha know. . . .

MEXICO'S DETHRONED PARTY IS LOOKING FOR A FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ There is more at stake in the race for governor of
the Mexican gulf coast state of Tabasco than who will succeed its
powerful lame-duck incumbent. The outcome is likely to decide the
fate of the dethroned political party that had ruled Mexico for
seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes become clear during a whirlwind day in Tabasco with
the outgoing governor, Roberto Madrazo Pintado. Although barred
from serving a second term, the governor is rushing through the
typical Mexican campaign rituals: handing out vouchers for
textbooks, presiding over ceremonies for new roads and drinking
water systems as well as making promises for a better tomorrow. A
suave, back-room operator who relishes flouting the rules, Madrazo
knows he must deliver a victory to his handpicked successor, Manuel
Andrade Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   A win in Tabasco would be the first political lifeline for the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (known by its acronym in Spanish,
PRI), which has been flailing about since losing the presidency
last July. And, Madrazo hopes, it will propel him into the post of
president of the party.
</P>
<P>
   By tending tirelessly to the needs of his constituents, Madrazo
holds himself up as a model of the politician his party needs to
survive. But because of his reputation as a PRI strongman, his
critics warn that the governor would only hasten the party's
demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest errors of the party was that it stopped
representing the interests of the people, and represented the
interests of small groups,'' said Madrazo, whose frail physique and
unassuming air belie his strongman reputation. ``The people felt
this and so they abandoned the party. If we give the power of the
party back to the people, the people will come back to the party.''
</P>
<P>
   People inside the PRI say the party never completely developed
an ideological core because it always bent to the will of the
president in power. In the 1930s, the PRI supported the
nationalistic policies of Lazaro Cardenas; in the 1990s, the free
market reforms of Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the first time since its creation in 1929, the party
must walk on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The party should be able to exert some political power. It still
holds slight majorities in both houses of Congress. After Vicente
Fox Quesada assumes the presidency in December, some 19 of the
nation's 31 governors will be members of the PRI. And the party
will control 65 percent of the nation's local legislatures. But
without the power of the countrys presidency as a unifying force
for the PRI, long-simmering differences between the party's
technocrats, who advocate free-market reforms, and its traditional
political strongmen, who rely more on paternalistic handouts, have
blown into full-scale battles for control.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term, we are going to have to accept that there
is going to be only bad news for the PRI,'' said Humberto Roque
Villanueva, a senator and former president of the party. ``It will
continue to lose elections, but that is the least of its problems.
There is so much internal hostility, that reaching agreements will
be very painful. Our worst nights are still to come.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While he has been president, Ernesto Zedillo and other leaders
of the PRI helped enact laws that strengthened opposition parties
and established transparent electoral agencies. Voters, however,
blamed the party for rampant corruption, soaring crime and economic
policies that bailed out banks and wealthy borrowers, while
lowering wages for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Now it seems the PRI has lost the ability to enforce discipline
within its own ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare display of rancor, the party's congressional delegates
gave only lukewarm applause during President Zedillo's State of the
Union address earlier this month. And one PRI legislator stood
during the address with his back to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, at a conference of a reform wing of the party
called Alternative, there were calls for a ``democratic rebellion''
that would allow the party's leadership and platform to be decided
by a vote of its members across the nation. And at the most recent
convention of the National Campesino Confederation, a farm group
that has been the PRI's most loyal bastion of support, delegates
shouted insults at the party's secretary general.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the party in crisis, it is likely that the selection of the
party's next president will decide its fate, and Madrazo is
considered the most likely to prevail. During a recent meeting with
governors from southern Mexican states, Fox greeted Madrazo with a
hug, while giving handshakes to the others.
</P>
<P>
   At age 47, Madrazo leads one of the most traditional factions of
the party and, much like a Chicago ward boss, he has kept his party
the dominant political power in largely poor and rural Tabasco.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo has won the support of most of the governors in the
party, and he is widely popular among poor farmers, organized labor
and local political leaders. In a race among four candidates, he
placed a distant second to Francisco Labastida in last year's
national party primary to select a candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   But to people outside the party, Madrazo represents the corrupt
and repressive reputation that cost the party the election in July.
His political career is tarnished by numerous accusations of misuse
of funds and illegal business deals.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Madrazo was elected governor of Tabasco six years
ago, opposition leaders produced volumes of receipts and ledgers
that offered evidence that he had illegally spent millions of
dollars of public funds on his campaign. Zedillo tried to force him
to resign but Madrazo, who has always denied the charges,
orchestrated a furious public backlash against the president, who
was forced to back down.
</P>
<P>
   It was a victory that helped propel the bad-boy image that
Madrazo wears like a badge of honor, calling himself a disciple of
his father, Carlos Alberto Madrazo, who led a popular reform
movement in the late 1960s to open up the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to bring unity to the party will be to select a
leader who has real legitimacy,'' said Madrazo, ``and that
legitimacy must come from a democratic election.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a good bet Michael Johnson wasn't thinking about
giving NBC a much-needed boost for tonight's telecast by actually
losing to a race leading up to the finals of the men's 400 meters.
The defending Olympic champion will still be the headliner on a big
day of track and field, but Alvin Harrison did beat him in the
semifinals, and Antonio Pettigrew did stop Johnson's eight-year,
58-race winning streak in the 400 three years ago. Also sharing the
prime-time spotlight is Australia's Cathy Freeman, the favorite in
the women's 400 meters; America's Stacy Dragila looking to win the
first-ever Olympic gold medal in the women's pole vault; and a
men's 110-meter hurdles field led by Allen Johnson. The women's 800
meter final is also on the schedule, but Hazel Clark is a longshot
to medal. The gymnastics continue with the last day of the men's
and women's individual event finals, most notably the women's floor
exercise, and in men's springboard diving, Mark Ruiz and Troy Dumas
are the U.S. medal contenders. MSNBC wii show the U.S. vs. China in
the medal round of softball, while CNBC will have the NBA stars
showcasing their skills against France.

 &HT;    Women play cautiously to beat Brazil
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Canberra _ For much of its contentious 1-0 win over Brazil in
the women's Olympic soccer semifinals on Sunday, the United States
found itself mired in the atmosphere of a typical men's
international match.
</P>
<P>
   Poorly played by both teams, with ill-mannered tackles and a
referee letting the game out of control early, the ruthless state
of affairs was as unwatchable as it was appalling.
</P>
<P>
   After the final whistle blew, Brazilian players rushed the
officiating crew, shouting and pointing fingers, while the U.S.
team looked on blankly near the center circle.
</P>
<P>
   On top of it all, the American players were subjected to a
chorus of boos from the stands late in the match after resorting to
a ``four corners'' defensive tactic. Instead of letting the fleet
Brazilians push forward to snare an equalizer, the U.S. was dogged
in keeping the ball near its opponents' corner flags to wind down
the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, with a head coach and the heart of its team hailing
from the University of North Carolina, such a negative strategy
shouldn't be much of a surprise.

<P>
   What just as easily could have earned the derision of the 11,000
paying customers was the inferior quality of play from both teams.
In one of its most lackluster performances in a major tournament in
recent years, the U.S. won ugly, getting a 60th-minute goal from
Mia Hamm on a broken play in front of the net and then pinching off
the speedy Brazilians down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we played our best soccer of the tournament,''
U.S. coach April Heinrichs said. ``Our players know that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the U.S. will meet Norway in Sydney for the gold
medal in one of the oldest, and most evenly Even after Brazil ran
the Americans ragged for a good portion of the game, the U.S. camp
denies that it is missing the take-charge, intimidating presence on
the field that has marked its success for nearly two decades.
Michelle Akers, who retired last month after undergoing surgery,
arrived in Australia on Saturday to see her teammates play in
person for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look a little flat out there,'' Akers said at halftime,
her right arm wrapped in a sling to protect the tender shoulder.
``I just didn't see a sense of urgency out there. But I think
they're doing great (in the Olympics). This team has been prepared
to play without me. I'm replaceable.''
</P>
<P>
   Swiss referee Nicole Petignant called 45 fouls, 23-18 in favor
of the U.S., and booked eight players, four on each team.
</P>
<P>
   A free kick set up the only score of the game. Brazil's Formiga
was yellow-carded for decking Hamm roughly 35 yards out. Brandi
Chastain's free kick went into the box, off Joy Fawcett's head and
toward the near post, where Tiffeny Milbrett was waiting.
</P>
<P>
   She missed the ball after colliding with Brazilian keeper
Andreia and defender Juliana, but Hamm was there to poke home the
rebound into an empty net. Milbrett said later a fould just as
easily could have gone against her; the Americans were glad simply
to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That performance was what we needed to win this game,''
Chastain said. ``It was going to be a battle to see who would bend
first, and they did.''

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ There is more at stake in the race for governor of
the Mexican gulf coast state of Tabasco than who will succeed its
powerful lame-duck incumbent. The outcome is likely to decide the
fate of the dethroned political party that had ruled Mexico for
seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes become clear during a whirlwind day in Tabasco with
the outgoing governor, Roberto Madrazo Pintado. Although barred
from serving a second term, the governor is rushing through the
typical Mexican campaign rituals: handing out vouchers for
textbooks, presiding over ceremonies for new roads and drinking
water systems as well as making promises for a better tomorrow. A
suave, back-room operator who relishes flouting the rules, Madrazo
knows he must deliver a victory to his handpicked successor, Manuel
Andrade Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   A win in Tabasco would be the first political lifeline for the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (known by its acronym in Spanish,
PRI), which has been flailing about since losing the presidency
last July. And, Madrazo hopes, it will propel him into the post of
president of the party.
</P>
<P>
   By tending tirelessly to the needs of his constituents, Madrazo
holds himself up as a model of the politician his party needs to
survive. But because of his reputation as a PRI strongman, his
critics warn that the governor would only hasten the party's
demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest errors of the party was that it stopped
representing the interests of the people, and represented the
interests of small groups,'' said Madrazo, whose frail physique and
unassuming air belie his strongman reputation. ``The people felt
this and so they abandoned the party. If we give the power of the
party back to the people, the people will come back to the party.''
</P>
<P>
   People inside the PRI say the party never completely developed
an ideological core because it always bent to the will of the
president in power. In the 1930s, the PRI supported the
nationalistic policies of Lazaro Cardenas; in the 1990s, the free
market reforms of Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the first time since its creation in 1929, the party
must walk on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The party should be able to exert some political power. It still
holds slight majorities in both houses of Congress. After Vicente
Fox Quesada assumes the presidency in December, some 19 of the
nation's 31 governors will be members of the PRI. And the party
will control 65 percent of the nation's local legislatures. But
without the power of the country's presidency as a unifying force
for the PRI, long-simmering differences between the party's
technocrats, who advocate free-market reforms, and its traditional
political strongmen, who rely more on paternalistic handouts, have
blown into full-scale battles for control.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term, we are going to have to accept that there
is going to be only bad news for the PRI,'' said Humberto Roque
Villanueva, a senator and former president of the party. ``It will
continue to lose elections, but that is the least of its problems.
There is so much internal hostility, that reaching agreements will
be very painful. Our worst nights are still to come.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While he has been president, Ernesto Zedillo and other leaders
of the PRI helped enact laws that strengthened opposition parties
and established transparent electoral agencies. Voters, however,
blamed the party for rampant corruption, soaring crime and economic
policies that bailed out banks and wealthy borrowers, while
lowering wages for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Now it seems the PRI has lost the ability to enforce discipline
within its own ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare display of rancor, the party's congressional delegates
gave only lukewarm applause during President Zedillo's State of the
Union address earlier this month. And one PRI legislator stood
during the address with his back to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, at a conference of a reform wing of the party
called Alternative, there were calls for a ``democratic rebellion''
that would allow the party's leadership and platform to be decided
by a vote of its members across the nation. And at the most recent
convention of the National Campesino Confederation, a farm group
that has been the PRI's most loyal bastion of support, delegates
shouted insults at the party's secretary general.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the party in crisis, it is likely that the selection of the
party's next president will decide its fate, and Madrazo is
considered the most likely to prevail. During a recent meeting with
governors from southern Mexican states, Fox greeted Madrazo with a
hug, while giving handshakes to the others.
</P>
<P>
   At age 47, Madrazo leads one of the most traditional factions of
the party and, much like a Chicago ward boss, he has kept his party
the dominant political power in largely poor and rural Tabasco.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo has won the support of most of the governors in the
party, and he is widely popular among poor farmers, organized labor
and local political leaders. In a race among four candidates, he
placed a distant second to Francisco Labastida in last year's
national party primary to select a candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   But to people outside the party, Madrazo represents the corrupt
and repressive reputation that cost the party the election in July.
His political career is tarnished by numerous accusations of misuse
of funds and illegal business deals.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Madrazo was elected governor of Tabasco six years
ago, opposition leaders produced volumes of receipts and ledgers
that offered evidence that he had illegally spent millions of
dollars of public funds on his campaign. Zedillo tried to force him
to resign but Madrazo, who has always denied the charges,
orchestrated a furious public backlash against the president, who
was forced to back down.
</P>
<P>
   It was a victory that helped propel the bad-boy image that
Madrazo wears like a badge of honor, calling himself a disciple of
his father, Carlos Alberto Madrazo, who led a popular reform
movement in the late 1960s to open up the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to bring unity to the party will be to select a
leader who has real legitimacy,'' said Madrazo, ``and that
legitimacy must come from a democratic election.''

A CITY WINCES IN THE GLARE OF THE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT

<P>
   DECATUR, Ill. _ For residents here, no news would definitely be
good news.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, they had their first encounter with the national
news media when workers at the city's three biggest employers went
on strike. A year later, the Archer Daniels Midland Co. got caught
up in a global price-fixing scandal.
</P>
<P>
   And last November, reporters descended when the Rev. Jesse
Jackson marched through the streets to protest the expulsion of six
black high school students who had gotten into a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Now the national spotlight has turned to the city's
Bridgestone/Firestone plant, which produced the bulk of the faulty
tires blamed for more than 100 deaths and about 400 injuries.
</P>
<P>
   People here call their city of 89,000 residents the Pride of the
Prairie. Still, all the bad news can be a bit demoralizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Per capita, we seem to be generating more news than other big
cities,'' Mayor Terry Howley says. ``And it's not nice. Some have
suggested: Why would anyone want to live here in this snake pit?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one here doubts Decatur is a fine place to live.
But the mayor and other residents say the unflattering coverage is
a blow to civic pride and could hurt efforts to attract business.
</P>
<P>
   Angered at the slant of coverage, the local press has struck
back. Recently, an editorial in The Decatur Herald &AMP; Review said
national news organizations had committed the journalistic
equivalent of a drive-by shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A further scan of national publications brought out all the
stereotypical adjectives used to modify the proper noun Decatur,''
the editorial read. ``They seem to trip off the keyboards of people
who have spent all of one afternoon in Decatur _ `small, troubled
city,' `a once-proud factory town,' `gritty, blue-collar community'
_ anyway, you get the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The national coverage has clearly upset Decatur, in central
Illinois amid some of the most fertile farmland in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, the A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co., the giant food
processor, transformed agriculture when it helped introduce
large-scale farming of soybeans, now one of the world's major food
staples. That earned Decatur the title Soybean Capital of the
World.
</P>
<P>
   Staley's soybean processing plants _ giant steel skyscrapers
that still foul the air with the smell of crushed and cooked
soybeans _ eventually lured the Archer Daniels Midland Co. from
Minneapolis, which has since surpassed Staley as a grain processing
giant and now has its headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   This is also where George Halas founded the Chicago Bears
football team (originally the Decatur Staleys) and where heavy
industry has erected many a plant. Caterpillar, the giant
construction equipment maker, and Bridgestone/Firestone, a
subsidiary of Bridgestone Corp., have manufacturing plants here.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, day and night, this city turns out tires, tractors
and mining equipment. During harvest, railroad cars parade to the
city delivering bushels of corn and soybeans to be processed into a
variety of products, including vegetable oil and the sweeteners and
additives that go into soft drinks and detergents.
</P>
<P>
   That the city owes its success to farming and manufacturing is
evident in the names of a local radio station (WSOY) and some of
the biggest financial institutions (Soy Capital Bank, Union
Planters Bank and the Earthmovers Credit Union).
</P>
<P>
   The city is so old-fashioned that it still has no Starbucks and
no Borders or Barnes &AMP; Noble. And Walgreens goes head-to-head with
Huck's Convenience Stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a little small town,'' says Karen Holliday, the
owner of Grandma's, a popular eatery near the Firestone plant on
the northeast side of town. ``I wouldn't want to live anywhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents say they are proud of their working-class ethic and
the small-town flavor. And some say the bad press is just another
fact of life they have learned to cope with.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are used to getting the raw end of the deal
because they're blue-collar,'' said Chris Anderson, who moved to
Decatur from Champaign, and is now a disc jockey at WSOY. ``They're
working people. So I don't think they think twice about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a shock to people at Firestone, though, when a camera
crew from the NBC News program ``Dateline'' appeared on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driving and my wife called me in the car and said the
folks from `Dateline' were at our house,'' Chuck Hilton, a
Firestone employee, told the local paper. ``They just showed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, residents have not exactly turned their backs on the
press. Everyone seems to have an opinion. And plenty of time to
share it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At ADM, that was just too high up, not the working people,''
Holliday said, taking a break from making biscuits. ``Jesse
Jackson? He needs to let the locals take care of it. And Firestone?
There was talk about sabotage but I don't think the guys would do
that. They would be jeopardizing their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people in Decatur have been generally supportive of the
workers at the Firestone plant, which Bridgestone has hinted could
be shuttered. Many here _ including the Firestone workers _ do not
even believe the Decatur plant was primarily at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the city of Decatur is trying to do its best to turn the
tide. It is promoting its Forbes ranking as the No. 1 best small
town metropolitan area and circulating buttons that boast:
``Decatur Downright Delightful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to accentuate the positive,'' says Howley, the
mayor. ``For every bad story there are 10 good ones here.''

WAR CRIMES PROSECUTOR SEEKS FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR TRIBUNAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE _ Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of the war
crimes tribunal here, is too busy to smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a prosecutor, not a politician,'' she says, impatiently.
</P>
<P>
   But when she begins a series of meetings Monday with senior US
officials in Washington, the 53-year-old will be forced to pay more
attention to the political side of her job.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the notoriously brusque prosecutor can win friends and
influence in her first trip to Washington since her appointment a
year ago remains to be seen. She has already angered some
Republicans by scrutinizing the actions of American generals and
pilots during the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte, the former attorney general of Switzerland, is a
hard-nosed, no-nonsense prosecutor who made her name by fearlessly
stepping on important toes, including those of the Mafia and
Russian politicians. For the last year, she has set her sights on
alleged war criminals, most notably Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But at the White House and on Capitol Hill, del Ponte will be
expected to schmooze with the likes of US Secretary of Defense
William Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. Besides seeking continued
American financial support for the war crimes tribunal, which at
about $30 million a year makes up nearly one-third of its budget,
del Ponte will try to impress upon her American hosts the need for
US troops in Bosnia to aggressively hunt the two most-wanted
fugitives besides Milosevic: former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic and his military henchman Ratko Mladic.
</P>
<P>
   Some have accused the Americans of avoiding confrontations with
heavily-protected war crimes suspects because casualties during an
arrest would lead to congressional pressure to remove US troops
from the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who admire del Ponte wonder whether her direct, curt
approach will win over the Americans, especially Republicans whose
traditional ambivalence toward the tribunal turned to open
hostility last year when del Ponte announced she was reviewing
allegations that NATO forces, most of them American, had committed
war crimes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Her aides were trying to arrange a meeting with her chief
American critic, US Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina
Republican in charge of the powerful Foreign Relations Committee.
Del Ponte is a heavy smoker, so she and Big Tobacco's most
vociferous congressional advocate may have something to talk about.
But the virtues of tobacco may be the only thing they agree on.
</P>
<P>
   Helms leads a cadre of Republicans who want the US to pull back
from its international commitments _ including its support of the
tribunal, which is charged with prosecuting war crimes committed in
Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte's decision to launch a legal review of NATO's actions
during the war in Kosovo infuriated Helms and other Republicans.
Helms said it was outrageous that a court created by the United
Nations could judge the conduct of American soldiers. He and other
Republicans say the UN is prone to manipulation by countries that
hate America.
</P>
<P>
   But del Ponte said she was duty-bound to look into allegations
made by Serb sympathizers, law professors, and the Russian
parliament, that NATO pilots and those who directed the air
campaign against Yugoslavia had engaged in war crimes by targeting
civilians. She and other prosecutors here point out that, after an
11-month review, she rejected the allegations in June before they
rose to the level of a formal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   During his recent appearance at the United Nations, Helms
referred derisively to del Ponte as ``that woman,'' a choice of
words that her staff noted was how President Clinton described
Monica Lewinsky when he denied having sexual relations with her.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the Senate Appropriations subcommittee
chaired by Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican, made a
sneering reference to del Ponte's review of NATO. The subcommittee
recommended that whatever amount del Ponte's office spent on
investigating NATO be deducted from the US contribution to the
tribunal next year. The report also accused the tribunal of being
``fat'' and not spending money already appropriated.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte is the first career prosecutor to lead war crimes
investigations. Her two predecessors were judges. She made a name
for herself by lining up the money-laundering prosecution of former
Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto, and by smashing a
money-laundering operation run by the Mafia in Switzerland. She
also went after former Soviet officials who were stashing cash in
Switzerland and Swiss bankers who embezzled funds, sometimes in
cahoots with Latin American gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   It was during her crusade against Mafiosi that del Ponte earned
her repuation for bravery. In 1989, during a visit to Palermo, she
decided at the last minute not to accompany Giovanni Falcone, the
Italian magistrate who worked with her targeting the Mafia, to his
beach house. Police found 100 pounds of explosives near the beach
house. Three years later, Falcone, his wife, and bodyguard were
killed by another bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Risley, the American who has served as del Ponte's
spokesman for the last year, said she was the first Swiss public
figure to require round-the-clock protection. When Arkan, the
notorious Serb paramilitary leader was assassinated in Belgrade
last winter, Risley broke the news to del Ponte.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked me where he was shot and when I said, `In the head,'
she nodded and said, `They shoot you in the head because they
assume you're wearing a bullet-proof vest.' It was then that I
realized this is a woman for whom the threat of assassination is
part of the job,'' Risley said.
</P>
<P>
   UN Secretary General Kofi Annan hoped her Swiss neutrality would
allay complaints of bias emanating from some Republican critics and
nearly all Serbs. But while Switzerland is neutral, del Ponte is
hardly neutral about going after suspected war criminals. In June,
after The New York Times reported that the White House and other
NATO allies were considering a compromise in which Milosevic would
be allowed to avoid prosecution in exchange for stepping down as
president, del Ponte abruptly dismissed the idea as being
outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will not be stability in the Balkans if Milosevic is not
brought to justice in The Hague,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   American and British officials are concerned that del Ponte
seems determined to change the ethos of the tribunal, which since
its inception in 1993 has been dominated by English-speakers and a
legal approach common in English-speaking countries. Del Ponte's
two predecessors were Canadian and South African. The deputy chief
prosecutor since the court's inception, Graham Blewitt, is
Australian, while most of the 1,011 tribunal staff are English
speakers. Del Ponte speaks four languages _ Italian, French,
English, and German _ but doesn't like to conduct business in
English because it is her weakest language.
</P>
<P>
   Some English-speaking diplomats complain that del Ponte is
``Frenchifying'' the tribunal, replacing English speakers with
French speakers. Risley, for example, will be replaced next month
by a French journalist from the Paris newspaper Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
   American and British diplomats insist their concern is not
chauvinistic or rooted in language, but in legal philosophy. They
contend that the adversarial legal traditions common to America,
Britain, Canada, and Australia are better suited to criminal
prosecutions than the legal approach common in France, Switzerland,
and other parts of continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But del Ponte's defenders say she is uniquely placed to lead the
tribunal into its next phase, one aimed primarily at getting cases
to trial and securing convictions. Even del Ponte's critics
acknowledge that she is a formidable prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want her going after me,'' said one, bestowing the
ultimate compliment on a prosecutor, if not a politician.

MEDICARE TAKES CENTER STAGE IN GORE CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore opened a week dedicated to
highlighting his differences with Gov. George W. Bush over Medicare
by asserting Sunday that Bush's plan for providing prescription
drug benefits would force some low-income elderly people to go to
welfare offices to qualify. Bush's aides called that contention
``pure fantasy'' and ``a classic scare tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, meanwhile, vowed to wage a war against
America's ``education recession'' in the week before the 2000
campaign becomes consumed by the long-awaited first debate between
the Democratic and Republican presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Aides at Bush's headquarters in Austin, Texas, buoyed by a
polling rebound that accompanied the Texas governor's first good
week in a month, also disparaged Gore for what they portrayed as
his recent misstatements.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comments came in a 25-minute conference telephone call
with reporters this afternoon from his official residence at the
Naval Observatory here.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president departs on Monday for Florida, where he hopes
to solidify his position among the state's pivotal elderly voters
by releasing a new booklet containing his proposals for
strengthening and expanding Medicare. He also plans to campaign
this week in Michigan and Iowa before devoting the weekend to
preparing for the first of three scheduled debates with Bush, on
Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who spent the day in Texas and had no public schedule,
embarks on a western swing to Oregon, Washington and California on
Monday. By focusing on education, his campaign hopes to close the
gender gap _ more women than men favor Gore. Bush's aides also
believe that the issue allows them to point to concrete
accomplishments and statistics in Texas that demonstrate Bush's
effectiveness in a given area of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   The week dawns with a series of polls showing the race
tightening into a dead heat, which underscores the importance of
the debates, on Oct. 3 in Boston, Oct. 11 in Winston-Salem, N.C.,
and Oct. 17 in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Newsweek magazine gave Gore a lead of three
percentage points, a gap within the margin of sampling error. Gore
led by 14 percentage points in a Newsweek poll a week ago. A daily
Gallup tracking poll showed Bush with a lead of one percentage
point, while a Fox TV poll had the candidates even.
</P>
<P>
   The polls were taken during a week in which Bush seemed to
regain his footing after nearly a month on the defensive. He did
his best to keep attention focused on a series of Gore campaign
missteps, charged Gore with political opportunism for calling for
the release of oil from the country's strategic petroleum reserve,
and accused his rival of ``misleading Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Sunday that he would remain focused on the issues, and
that he would devote the week to discussing Medicare policy as a
way to draw contrasts with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some real and very significant differences,'' Gore
said. ``The other side treats the Medicare surplus as a piggy bank
they can use for a tax cut that primarily benefits the wealthiest
Americans. I'll veto the use of any money from Medicare for
anything other than Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed a plan to extend Medicare's solvency by five
years, from 2025 to 2030, by placing the anticipated $400 billion,
10-year Medicare surplus in a secure fund that could be used to
reduce the federal debt. That, he projects, would save $75 billion
in interest payments that would be used, in turn, to shore up
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore would spend $338 billion over 10 years to
provide a universal prescription drug benefit under Medicare.
Individuals making about $12,000 or less would have their drugs
covered without charge, while those with higher incomes would pay
premiums on a sliding scale.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore plan also would spend $40 billion to increase funding
for nursing homes, teaching hospitals, rural hospitals, home health
agencies and rehabilitative services, all areas that suffered deep
Medicare cuts under the balanced-budget act of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Medicare plan, which would cost a total of $198 billion,
would create a system where private insurers compete with the
government to provide coverage.
</P>
<P>
   His market-based approach would essentially provide subsidies to
older people who could spend the money on a variety of
government-approved plans, some of which would include prescription
drug coverage. For those with the lowest incomes, the government
would provide drug coverage free.
</P>
<P>
   During the four years that Bush estimates it would take to
implement his plan, he would spend $48 billion on a temporary
series of grants to states to subsidize coverage for the low-income
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first five years, they would force many seniors to go
to welfare offices to sign up for state programs,'' Gore said,
``and middle-class seniors would be left out completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, said that the
welfare-office accusation was wrong and that Bush's plan would
expand an existing program in 23 states where applicants return
forms by mail.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Al Gore spent last week making things up, and today he's
continued,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's assertion of an ``education recession,'' a phrase that
aides said tested well in internal campaign polling with women and
independent voters, will coincide with the release of a Republican
National Committee advertisement that makes the same point. The
campaign will attempt to back up the charge by discussing declining
test scores, safety concerns, and widening achievement gaps between
rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer used the phrase several times in a conference call
with reporters Sunday, saying the recession had ``been present for
the last 10 years,'' a span that dates to President George Bush's
administration.

   SYDNEY _ Just call him Sir Steven Redgrave.
</P>
<P>
   British newspapers began a campaign Sunday to win knighthood for
the 38-year-old British rower who won a fifth consecutive Olympic
gold medal Saturday in rowing's coxless fours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arise Sir Hero,'' said the Sunday People tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   Of Sunday's dozen nationwide papers, every one had Redgrave on
the first page.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent wants the five-time Olympic champion to oversee
British sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put him in the House of Lords as a sports supremo with the
power to propel us in the right direction,'' the paper said. ``Now
that he has stopped rowing the boat he may relish the chance to
start rocking it on behalf of sport.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning his fourth gold four years ago in Atlanta,
Redgrave announced his retirement with one of the best remembered
quotes of those games: ``Anyone who sees me go anywhere near a boat
again, ever, you've got my permission to shoot me.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite being diagnosed in 1997 with diabetes, he returned
to make history as the only athlete in an endurance event to win
five straight. Will he be back in 2004?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it for me. It's over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   TV SYDNEY
</P>
<P>
   Sydney television ratings show swimming was clearly the favorite
local sport during the first week of the Games. A look at the
most-watched events during the first week (number of viewers):
</P>
<P>
   Opening Ceremony 10,436,000
</P>
<P>
   Men's 800 freestyle relay 7,464,000
</P>
<P>
   Women's 200 butterfly 6,753,000
</P>
<P>
   Men's 200 freestyle 6,641,000
</P>
<P>
   Men's 400 freestyle relay 6,638,000
</P>
<P>
   IN KOREA, ``PR'' MUST MEAN ``PERSISTENT RIDICULE''
</P>
<P>
   The media guide for the South Korean baseball team has this to
say about assistant coach Kang Byung-chul:
</P>
<P>
   ``Kang has been a manager in Korea for almost 10 seasons, but
has not been so successful in recent times. He was fired midway
through last season because of a losing record. After he was
replaced, the team won the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is currently manager of SK Wyverns team, which has the
worst record in the entire league and is seen as somewhat of a
surprise choice to the roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa!
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the page about the Korean coaches is much kinder to
manager Kim Ung-yong, calling him ``Korea's answer to Tommy
Lasorda.'' Kim and Lasorda will manage against each other Tuesday
when their teams play in the medal semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   COSTAS TURNING RED
</P>
<P>
   Bob Costas, NBC's prime-time host, has sandy brown hair, so why
was it looking red, with lovely auburn highlights? He hasn't been
dipping into the henna _ or so he says _ but he heard the murmurs.
Even Hannah Storm, the daytime host, asked why Costas was becoming
a redhead.
</P>
<P>
   Within NBC's compound here, no one saw Costas' hair reddening.
But technicians examined how Costas looked to viewers in his
hometown of St. Louis and in New York, and concluded that it was a
combination of lighting on his set and color enhancements used to
transmit the prime-time telecast.
</P>
<P>
   TRACKING OLYMPIC FEVER
</P>
<P>
   How bad to the Aussie's have Olympic fever? Some late-night
party-goers have been known to hire a taxi to follow the blue line
that winds through the city marking the marathon route. It costs
about $170 and takes a couple of hours. The course can't be
followed exactly, because in several spots the course veers to the
wrong side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   MC MASS CONFUSION
</P>
<P>
   When Tom Dolan's cell phone rings, a classical tune plays. So
what happened to ``MC Mass Confusion?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting too old for that,'' said the 25-year-old, who swam
to his second straight gold medal in the 400 individual medley and
added silver in the 200 IM.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, a rap music fan, still does a little of his own record
scratching. But his DJ name, MC Mass Confusion, seems a thing of
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's classical _ at least when it comes to his cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big with the ladies,'' Dolan joked.
</P>
<P>
   NO MOTHS ALLOWED
</P>
<P>
   One unwelcome visitor to the Games is the bogong moth, Agrotis
infusa to all the entomologists out there. Actually thousands upon
thousands of bogong moths, swarming during the night session of
track and field. Runners practically have to pick them out of their
teeth at the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing unusual, say the experts. Every spring, the moths
migrate from lowland breeding areas to the high country, swooping
through Sydney en route. Attracted by the lights of the Olympic
Stadium, they have made quite a nuisance of themselves. Organizers
have begun lowering the lights after competition in order to
discourage their loitering.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of Australia's critters, the bogong is not
poisonous. Nor does it snack on clothing. It simply annoys.
Indigenous Australians used to eat the bogong, which has a high fat
content in order to see it through its migrations. It's said they
can be eaten roasted or popped with corn. However, they really
don't make such an appetizing post-race snack.

PERU SPY CHIEF FLIES TO PANAMA LOOKING FOR ASYLUM 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ The disgraced spy chief who until recently was
Peru's second-most powerful figure left the country Sunday, flying
to Panama to request asylum in the wake of a bribery scandal that
threatened to topple the government of his boss, President Alberto
K. Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   The ousted intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, boarded a
private jet accompanied by bodyguards and took off from a military
air base here just after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, unthinkable until a bribery scandal involving
Montesinos broke 10 days ago, appeared to be the result of
diplomatic intervention by the United States, other Latin American
countries and the Organization of American States. All have put
pressure on Fujimori to introduce more democracy and have urged all
sides in Peru to avoid violence after Fujimori's stunning
announcement last week that he would hold new elections, in which
he would not run, and would ``deactivate'' Montesinos' widely
feared National Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian officials refused to discuss the circumstances of
Montesinos' departure and left it to the Panamanian government to
explain the maneuvering that made it possible.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, 55, a cashiered former army captain, has been
Fujimori's most trusted aide, so powerful that the two men are
known here as ``the Siamese twins.''
</P>
<P>
   But that relationship and Fujimori's hold on power were
jeopardized on Sept. 14 with the broadcast of a videotape that
showed Montesinos paying $15,000 to an opposition member of
Congress, apparently to get him to go over to the government side.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Fujimori, after a decade of increasingly
authoritarian rule that culminated in May with what many outsiders
and Peruvians considered fraudulent re-election to a third term,
announced a new vote, but without specifying a date.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos immediately dropped out of sight, and for a week it
was unclear whether he was defying the president with the backing
of the military or relying on Fujimori to protect him from
opposition demands that he be arrested and tried on corruption
charges.
</P>
<P>
   At first Panama and Brazil were reported to have received and
rejected Peruvian requests that they grant asylum to Montesinos.
For decades Panama has been a favorite place of exile for deposed
leaders from all over the world, ranging from the shah of Iran to,
more recently, Gen. Raoul Cedras of Haiti and former President
Abdala Bucaram of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials said the first solicitation on behalf of
Montesinos came Friday from Peru's prime minister, Federico Salas.
After an emergency session of the Panamanian Cabinet on Saturday,
though, Alfredo Castillero, a Panamanian Foreign Ministry official,
said his government had rejected the asylum request to show that it
was ``against authoritarianism, fraud, irregularity and corruption,
not just at the national level but internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   But after considerable pressure from abroad, Panama reversed
course. Harmodio Arias, the country's deputy foreign minister, said
at a news conference Sunday that the presidents of five South
American countries, the OAS and ``high-level functionaries of the
United States,'' among them Deputy Secretary of State Thomas
Pickering, had all urged Panama to take Montesinos, to ``facilitate
the democratic process in Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias took pains to make it clear that while Panama had agreed
to allow Montesinos to land there, it had not yet granted him
political asylum. A formal request is under study, the Panamanian
official said, but he added that he could not predict ``the moment
or date'' of a decision.
</P>
<P>
   At observances here Sunday to commemorate Armed Forces Day,
Fujimori made no explicit reference to Montesinos, referring merely
to what he called ``a week of political decisions of the greatest
importance for our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But he twice singled out the National Intelligence Service,
which Montesinos controlled for the last decade, praising the
agency for its role in helping to liquidate two left-wing guerrilla
movements.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never navigated in calm waters, and that is a story
known to all my countrymen,'' Fujimori said in an effort to play
down the importance of the crisis. But, he added, ``it can never be
said of me that I am a man or a president whom circumstance has
paralyzed or forced to buckle.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's speech followed ceremonies in which the commanders of
all three branches of the military and the head of the national
police made their first public demonstration of support for the
president since the crisis erupted.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Gen. Jose Villanueva Ruesta, the armed forces
chief, pledged that the military would fulfill ``our constitutional
responsibility to guarantee the independence, sovereignty and
integrity of the fatherland.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Fujimori's public thanks to the armed forces for their
display of ``professionalism and unshakable loyalty,'' doubts
remain here about the ultimate allegiances of the military high
command. The majority of the top brass graduated in the same class
as Montesinos, two more are related to him by marriage and most of
them are said to owe their appointments to him.
</P>
<P>
   By law, all members of Montesinos' class are to retire at the
end of the year, including Villanueva. The officer who would
normally succeed him based on seniority, Gen. Carlos Tafur, was
forced to step down last week, an action that military analysts
here said could pave the way for the appointment of one of a pair
of Montesinos loyalists as military commander.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Fujimori sent a bill to Congress that would formally
abolish the SIN, as the spy agency is known here, within 15 days of
being signed into law. He met another key opposition demand later
that day, promising to announce the formal dismissal of Montesinos
no later than Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Montesinos' departure was greeted with mixed
feelings by the political opposition. A group of members of Peru's
Congress released a letter Sunday condemning the arrangement to let
him leave the country, saying he had no legal ground to seek asylum
abroad, since he was facing well-founded criminal charges and not
political persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire opposition and the nation have demanded and
continue to demand a fair trial'' for Montesinos, Congressman Henry
Pease said. ``They cannot give him impunity to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Montesinos out of the picture, it now becomes easier
for the Fujimori government to negotiate an accord with the
opposition for new elections. Opposition parties vowed to boycott a
``national dialogue'' sponsored by the OAS until Montesinos was
fired, arguing that his control of the electoral commission made a
clean and fair vote impossible.

U.S. ENVOY TO ISRAEL IS SUSPENDED FOR BUSINESS AS USUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chastising of the American ambassador to
Israel, Martin S. Indyk, whose security clearance has been
suspended during an investigation of his handling of classified
material, raises questions about how senior diplomats can conduct
business while remaining within security regulations, officials
said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-charging diplomat who was appointed in 1995 by President
Clinton and reappointed last year, Indyk is said to have used an
unclassified laptop computer for writing a classified document and
to have taken classified documents home to review them.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior has not been uncommon among senior officials, who
work arduous hours and often travel long distances on a tight
schedule, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Laptop computers are routinely issued to diplomats by the State
Department and are used, they said, to compose cables after
conversations with foreign leaders or to write talking points for
meetings. This material is then transferred to an office computer
and marked classified.
</P>
<P>
   A former senior official who served under Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Sunday that if he had been held to the
same standard, he would have been unable to carry out his duties.
It appeared, the former official said, that Indyk was being held up
to a standard that many State Department officials could not meet.
</P>
<P>
   This official noted that investigators had gone out of their way
to say that Indyk's case does not involve espionage or the
compromise of any confidential material.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel W. Lewis, who was ambassador to Israel from 1977 to 1985,
said the stringency of security being imposed means that ``either
you don't do your job or you are breaking some regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are scores of us, hundreds of us who have done similar
things because there is no other way to do your job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morton I. Abramowitz, a former ambassador to Thailand and
Turkey, said: ``This is the tip of the iceberg. I guess many others
have done the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The question,'' Abramowitz said, is, ``How do you enable
senior officials to manage sensitive information without keeping
them up for 20 hours a day?''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's assistant secretary for diplomatic
security, David G. Carpenter, briefed two congressional committees
last week on Indyk.
</P>
<P>
   His appearance came after the chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, Richard Shelby, called Albright and asked
her what she was doing about an investigation concerning Indyk that
began during an inspection of the use of department laptops in the
summer, State Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That review was ordered after a series of security lapses in the
State Department building. Albright, under pressure from Congress,
gave a tough speech saying security was a top concern.
</P>
<P>
   After Shelby's telephone call, Albright decided to go ahead with
Carpenter's recommendation that Indyk's security clearance be
suspended, pending the outcome of the investigation, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Indyk is considered important to the Middle East
peace talks, the restrictions will prevent him from going to his
Tel Aviv office or enter the State Department unescorted.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Carpenter acknowledged to lawmakers that the
handling of classified material was a problem with many
ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambassadors ought to be able to work with classified materials
in their residence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A vast majority of State Department material is classified. When
filing reports from abroad, American diplomats routinely mark their
cables classified, often in an effort to attract the attention of
people back at headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the treatment of Indyk, the first Jewish American
ambassador there, was greeted with disbelief. One newspaper
columnist, Hemi Shalev, spoke of America's ``compulsive zeal for
regulations.'' A senior Labor Party politician, Eitan Haber, said
that if similar violations were investigated in Israel, ``half the
government would be in jail right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who had asked Clinton to send
Indyk back as ambassador for a second tour, said the security issue
was an ``internal American matter.'' He praised Indyk for his
contributions to the peace effort.

BUSH TO CUT SHORT HIS STAY AFTER FIRST DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ George W. Bush may have finally agreed to next week's
debate in Boston, but his campaign is scheduling as little time
there as possible _ confirming Sunday he will not even spend the
night in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has made no secret of his disdain for the liberal
establishment of his business school alma mater, Harvard, had
tentatively planned to stay over Monday night. But those plans are
now off, and campaign officials do not expect that to change
between now and Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's obvious: This is so we can maximize time spent in
battleground states,'' Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer declined to say which battleground states are on the
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, is planning an overnight stay
in Boston on Oct. 3 after the debate, campaign officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking forward to being in Massachusetts for the debate
and spending the night in Boston,'' said Gore spokesman Doug
Hattaway, who, as a Cambridge resident, admitted a personal
interest in the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is considered such a long shot for Bush that he
has not set foot in the state since June, focusing his New England
resources instead on New Hampshire and Maine. During the primaries,
the Texas governor suffered an overwhelming defeat there to John S.
McCain, as thousands of Democrats switched registration to vote for
the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has since displayed an almost allergic reaction to Boston,
initially rejecting next week's debate in part because of its
affiliation with the John F. Kennedy Library, an institution with
obvious Democratic ties. But his aides have also said his
reluctance to spend time there is logical, given that he has
virtually no chance of winning the state on Nov. 7.

 &HT;    Bitter fight over details of Holocaust
 &HT;    By Jim Galloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before sunrise on a cold March morning in 1970, a
rabbi and an architect slipped over the fence to Greenwood Cemetery
in Atlanta to scout out a burial site for four bars of soap.
</P>
<P>
   A hasty funeral service was conducted later that afternoon _
Jewish law required quick interment for the green-gray cakes, which
had surfaced days before. About 35 people, most of them survivors
of European concentration camps, gathered around a small hole dug
at the base of the local Holocaust memorial.
</P>
<P>
   None had any doubt that the soap bars were made from human
beings.
</P>
<P>
   The architect, Ben Hirsch, devoted a chapter to the incident in
a memoir published this spring and urged scholars to take a closer
look at the topic.

<P>
   As a result, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has barred
Hirsch from conducting a book-signing on its premises in
Washington. Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt, who
triumphed over a Holocaust denier in a British libel trial this
year, endorses the decision.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the Nazis killed millions through gassing
and starvation, torture and firing squads. They conducted bizarre
human experiments, harvested hair and gold fillings, and used human
skin for lampshades. But there's no proof that Nazis made soap of
their victims, museum officials said, and the institution won't
endorse any book that argues otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hirsch) was advocating that we explore what is essentially a
dead end,'' said Peter Black, chief historian at the Holocaust
museum.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become a bone of contention between scholars and
the dwindling number of Holocaust survivors, who now watch a
post-World War II generation take control of their story. ``I think
I've piqued the fraternity,'' said Hirsch, 68, who still designs
churches and synagogues in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a generational rift is at work. The making of soap
from murdered humans has long served as a particularly horrific
example of the Final Solution's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that symbolizes the ultimate horror of using
every molecule of the murdered,'' conceded Black, the museum
historian. Survivors are loathe to see that symbol reduced to a
60-year-old rumor.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors wonder whether, in an effort to secure the historical
record against those who argue that the Holocaust never happened,
scholars have set a standard for proof that is too high _ and have
unilaterally cut off the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a religious issue here,'' Hirsch said. ``These are not
just bars of soap. They were buried as if they were human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   And that indeed raises the uncomfortable question of what lies
in the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Holocaust museum in Washington emphasize that
they are not censoring Hirsch or any other survivor. ``Hearing a
Different Drummer'' (Mercer University Press) remains on the
shelves of the museum's bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   But a book signing would be interpreted as a sanctioning of
Hirsch's views, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch had timed the signing to coincide with a November reunion
of Jewish children who were sheltered from the Nazis by a French
network. Hirsch was one of them. His parents and two siblings died
in the camps. Most of ``Different Drummer'' is devoted to Hirsch's
experience as a U.S. soldier in post-war Germany. But in the 10
pages of Chapter 23, he expresses his disappointment in the verdict
of historians on Nazi soap-making. He cites the example of his
uncle, a chemist who was forced to work in Auschwitz making soap.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch says his uncle, who died in the 1950s, confessed to
Hirsch's brother that he had saved his own life by using human
corpses _ something that historians say never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch also tells the story of the four bars of soap in Atlanta.
They were found by a Jewish soldier who was part of a U.S. force
that liberated a concentration camp near Stettin, Germany, near
Frankfurt. The soldier saw the soap cakes, which had been stamped
``RIF.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians say the initials stand for ``Reich Industrie Fett,''
or Reich Industrial Fat. But at the time, the ``I'' was widely
interpreted as a ``J'', and the initials for ``Reines Juden Fett
``_ or Pure Jewish Fat.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier stuffed the soap bars in a bag and took them home.
He eventually married a concentration camp survivor. Twenty-five
years later, the couple was living in Atlanta. The soap bars were
stashed in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   One night, the husband came home from work and found that his
wife, having run out of detergent, was using the soap on the
laundry. As he explained what they were, they both became highly
disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m., the distressed couple called Rabbi Emanuel Feldman of
nearby Congregation Beth Jacob, who consulted rabbinical scholars
in New York and Israel, then set the burial service in motion.
Feldman accompanied Hirsch to the cemetery on that early morning in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (the soap bars) would be buried if they were
found today,'' said Lipstadt, the Emory historian. She is a member
of the Washington museum's executive council.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with scholarly research of the Holocaust has been
the seamless manner in which World War II flowed into the Cold War.
The dropping of the Iron Curtain sealed away many of the facts from
the first generation of Holocaust scholars.
</P>
<P>
   But a great rush of information has come in the last few decades
with the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, site of some of
the worst Nazi atrocities, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the newly opened archives has shed any light on the
topic of making soap from Jews, historians say. ``We haven't found
anything yet that would give us something to grasp onto, that we
didn't have in 1945,'' said Peter Black, the Holocaust museum
historian.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington museum now has a standardized summary that is
faxed to those who inquire about Nazi soap-making. Included on the
fact sheet:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The soap rumor seems to have been first mentioned in the
United States media in 1942.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A recipe for soap in German, dated February 1944, was found
tacked to a piece of plywood at the Danzig Anatomical Institute in
Poland. The recipe calls for fat, but does not refer to human fat,
the museum says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Raul Hilberg, the dean of Holocaust historians, has cited the
testimony of the postwar mayor of Danzig, who said 350 bodies were
found at the plant, along with a cauldron containing the remains of
boiled human flesh. But Hilberg failed to verify the authenticity
of the testimony, the museum statement says.
</P>
<P>
   _ The testimony of two British POWs who labored at the same
plant ``is contradictory and inconclusive,'' the museum says.
</P>
<P>
   What historians say they lack are bills of laden, evidence of a
manufacturing plant or receipts of purchase or exchange _
documentation the Nazis carefully maintained for other noxious
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at all the evidence available about Nazis
experimenting with human beings . . . the composite of all that
evidence cannot permit you to conclude that this happened,'' said
Black. He compares the soap-making stories with the myth of
Hitler's Jewish ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   But survivors think historians may be too strict in their
criteria, citing the museum's statement that ``There is absolutely
no evidence to indicate this was ever done on an industrial basis
or in a centrally directed fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there was no mass production,'' agreed Morris Spitzer,
77. ``But yes, there was production in smaller quantities at many
of the (extermination) camps.'' Spitzer, a camp survivor and
resident of the Bronx, N.Y., is trying to obtain recognition for a
photograph of a 1946 funeral procession in Sighet, Romania,
involving bars of soap collected by the village. Holocaust history
is constantly being adjusted as new evidence and research surface.
</P>
<P>
   Hilberg, the eminent historian, has recommended that the number
of European Jews killed by the Nazi machine be revised downward,
from 6 million to 5.1 million. And even that number now may be
nudged slightly up _ based on even fresher information coming out
of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Such revisions, while common enough in other historical fields,
are handled with extreme care, with the expectation that Holocaust
deniers will twist any change in the record into a retreat from the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   But Lipstadt, the Emory professor and author, said deniers
aren't driving the standards of historians. ``If deniers are a
concern, they are down at the bottom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the top is a desire for rock-solid historical accuracy.
``It's important because you don't want people to say it's
demi-fiction,'' Lipstadt said.
</P>
<P>
   Soap-making has been a handy metaphor for Nazi cruelty, she
said, but its disappearance from the resume of Nazis atrocities
shouldn't make much difference. ``The truth that we know is bad
enough. We don't need the soap,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If Lipstadt has a regret, it might be that the matter might have
been handled more diplomatically. Early in her career, she stated
categorically that soap-making by the Nazis never happened. If she
had it to do again, Lipstadt said, ``I wouldn't say (the Nazis)
never did it. I would say we have no evidence.'' She would leave
the door slightly cracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they dug up those bars of soap and DNA tests showed they
were made from human beings, I would say, Oh, my God, we need to
take another look at this,'' Lipstadt said.
</P>
<P>
   But science is an unlikely arbiter when it comes to what is
buried in Atlanta's Greenwood Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust museum says it has tested some bars of soap for
human DNA and found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But even if human DNA were found in the suspect soap, it
probably wouldn't prove anything, according to Connie Kolman of the
C.A. Pound Human Identification Laboratory in Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A specialist in tracing ancient DNA, Kolman said the bars of
soap in Greenwood Cemetery probably do contain some human genetic
material. The problem is one of contamination. Regardless of
whether they were made from humans, human beings were involved in
the production.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has touched the cakes has left minute DNA material on
them, including the housewife, the scientist said.
</P>
<P>
   A DNA test could not distinguish between the genetic material
left by the casual handler, Kolman said, and material left by a
human ingredient. ``It'd be nice if science could provide an answer
for this, but right now there's no way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That limitation doesn't upset everyone. Rabbi Feldman, who
conducted the Atlanta burial service for the bars of soap in 1970,
was recently contacted in Israel via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he favored exhuming the small soap casket, the rabbi
replied, ``Maybe it would be best for it to remain a mystery.''

COMMENTARY: MAKING OF A MARTYR 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking their cue from the president's surprise
attack on his own attorney general and energy secretary, apologists
for Clinton's China policy are trying to turn the lawbreaking
scientist Wen Ho Lee into a hero.
</P>
<P>
   The new line bemoans ``the railroading of a basically innocent
man because of his race.'' It suggests that his motive in
downloading 400,000 pages of data from the Los Alamos lab,
transferring it to his insecure computer and then supposedly
destroying copies he made was ``that he was looking for a job and
wanted to enhance his resume.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to introduce a new anti-McCarthyism. In a Parthian
shot, the departing president is wrapping himself in a spurious
mantle of civil liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Making a martyr out of Lee required making a villain out of
Notra Trulock, the whistleblower who called attention to the
abysmal security at our secret labs. Step two was to portray as
dupes, racists and hysterics the members of Congress and
journalists who forced a careless administration to get serious
about security.
</P>
<P>
   But the revisionist campaign is more ambitious. It wants to use
sympathy for Lee, who was harshly treated in jail while awaiting
trial, to discredit all evidence of the interrelated Clinton
``Asian connections.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the millions in funds raised by and through the Riady
family of Indonesia, undiscovered by an inept Justice department
investigation despite FBI protests? Forget it, along with Clinton's
flip-flop of China policy _ from ``butchers of Beijing'' to
``strategic partners'' _ that followed all the
influence-purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying and fund-raising of Johnny Chung, 50 times waved
into the White House through Hillary Clinton's office, often with
arms-dealing Chinese officials in tow? Forget that, too, along with
the revelations of Senate committees about new permissiveness on
arms sales by big Democratic contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Political canonizers also cast aspersions on last year's
bipartisan Cox report, which found serious penetrations of
America's most closely held atomic secrets. We learned that over a
decade ago China stole the secret of our most advanced W-88
thermonuclear warhead; that breach of security is on a par with the
theft of atomic secrets for which Vladimir Putin recently thanked
``Western scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, in his report on Chinese espionage, Chairman Chris
Cox warned against the demonization of individual suspects. Reno
Justice had long before refused an FBI request to wiretap Wen Ho
Lee (one of the few refusals of that year's 700 requests), but with
the heat on, Clinton's new energy secretary, Bill Richardson, fired
Lee. Only then was the scientist's house searched and much of his
cache of top-secret ``legacy codes'' found.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's college classmate and crony was the local U.S.
attorney and threw the book at Lee. The scientist became the
scapegoat for the administration's laxity because Clinton needed to
show he was tough on China's espionage.
</P>
<P>
   A year later the case against Lee ended in a plea bargain: he
confessed not to spying but to mishandling secrets. The judge,
though finding that Lee had committed ``a serious crime,''
excoriated the prosecution and released the criminal. Clinton,
never to be out-apologized, reversed field, claimed to have been
``troubled'' all along, and in effect dumped scorn on the
ultra-loyal Reno and the expendable Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the government let Lee cop a plea? In a detailed story
in Sunday's Washington Post, reporters Walter Pincus and David Vise
laid it out: ``graymail.'' His lawyers threatened to force
prosecutors to reveal nuclear secrets in court. (If Jonathan
Pollard had graymailed his prosecutors, he'd be a free man today.)
</P>
<P>
   Is the Chinese agent who stole the W-88 secret, thereby
endangering American cities, at large? Yes. Is Lee a spy? We won't
know. Is he an innocent? Not by 10 megabytes of copied codes that
we cannot be sure are still secret.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's crocodile tears for the treatment of this
Asian-American are intended to wash away three sins: allowing
China's agents easy White House access, successful
influence-by-contribution and repeated exploitation of lax nuclear
lab security.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-McCarthyism suppressed anti-Communism once before. Clinton
is giving those grapes of wrath a second squeezing.

COMMENTARY: FEARFUL IN FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Sabato was asked back in January, before the primaries, to
make a prediction about the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I responded with the obvious,'' said Sabato, a political
science professor at the University of Virginia. ``I said that on
Labor Day, if the Democratic candidate had scheduled a lot of
visits to California, the Republican would win the election. But if
the Republican was scheduling a lot of visits to Florida, the
Democrat would win.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly Labor Day, but close enough. Florida is in
play, big time, and George W. Bush and his closest allies,
including his brother Jeb, the governor, have been zipping all over
the state, trying to head off a potentially catastrophic upset by
Al Gore and Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the campaign, most observers were awarding
the big states of California and New York to Gore, and Texas and
Florida to Bush. But now the polls are showing Florida, with its 25
electoral votes, to be a tossup.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to imagine the Dodgers moving back to Brooklyn than
to come up with a scenario in which Bush wins the presidency
without carrying Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win Florida,'' crowed Lieberman at a rally in Fort
Lauderdale last week, ``there ain't no way we're going to lose this
election.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Friday there was Bush in Sun City, a senior citizens
community on Florida's west coast, offering up a $91 billion plan
to find cures for diseases. In keeping with his claim that he is a
``different kind of Republican,'' he likened his proposal to John
F. Kennedy's promise to land a man on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will fund and lead a medical moonshot to reach far beyond
what seems possible today and discover new cures for age-old
afflictions,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance in Sarasota, the Texas governor scoffed at the
idea that he might lose Florida. He said the Democrats ``don't know
what's about to hit them in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be. But why is Bush, at least so far, having such a
tough time in a state he was supposed to win easily?
</P>
<P>
   Two reasons. First, the issues. Second, Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The base was always there to begin with for the Democrats; it
just had to be energized,'' said Susan MacManus, a political
science professor and expert on Florida voting patterns at the
University of South Florida in Tampa. ``Gore and Lieberman have
greatly energized Democrats in Florida because of their constant
presence in the state, and because they are talking issues that are
extremely important to their base, especially senior citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Florida, as elsewhere, have tended to tilt toward the
Democrats on such issues as Social Security, Medicare, a
prescription drug benefit, protection against abuses by health
maintenance organizations, and education.
</P>
<P>
   By adding Lieberman to the ticket, Gore not only strengthened
his advantage with Jewish voters, particularly in South Florida, he
appears also to have gotten a big boost with senior citizens in
general.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of many older voters, he has given the ticket ``a
moral compass,'' said MacManus. She added, ``The older woman
especially, who might have been tempted to vote for George W.
because of his nice family and his parents and the moral direction
issue, can now vote for the Democratic ticket for issue reasons
because they have been satisfied that it's a ticket with a strong
tinge of morality to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Bush would win Florida without a fight was never
realistic. Democrats actually have a slight edge in voter
registration in the state. And while Florida has a Republican
governor in Jeb Bush, one of its two U.S. senators is a Democrat,
and three of six elected statewide cabinet positions are held by
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from a solidly Republican state.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Bill Clinton and Al Gore invested very little in
Florida and came within a hair of carrying the state. Four years
ago, they campaigned seriously in Florida and won by a healthy
margin.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush may yet prevail in Florida, but only with an
investment of precious time and campaign money that Republicans
would much rather see expended elsewhere.

BOTH SIDES CLAIM VICTORY IN YUGOSLAV VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Monday in lede cq.) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ An enthusiastic opposition to President
Slobodan Milosevic said early Monday that its candidate, Vojislav
Kostunica, was leading by wide margins in watershed elections for
president held on Sunday, but government spokesmen insisted that
their sampling indicated that Milosevic was ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who has ruled this country for the last 13 years,
called the election nine months early _ after changing the
constitution in a day _ in an effort to prolong and legitimize his
hold on power. While no official figures had been released six
hours after the polls closed, opposition leaders said they believed
that Milosevic had badly miscalculated in his first attempt at
direct election since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, government officials who had predicted an early
evening declaration of victory for Milosevic in the first round,
with the incumbent taking more than 50 percent of the vote, were
mistaken. Some officials in Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party said
privately that the mood was grim, and that there was some confusion
about how to respond to the vote.
</P>
<P>
   There were indications early Monday that the Socialists might
choose to allow a second-round runoff between Milosevic and
Kostunica rather than simply declare victory by means of a voting
fraud that could require Milosevic to claim a million phantom
votes. A runoff on Oct. 8 would in effect challenge the opposition
to respond in the streets if it felt cheated of a victory then.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other Western powers have invested much
effort and money in trying to unite Serbia's opposition, promote
independent media and oust Milosevic, against whom NATO fought a
three-month bombing war last year for control of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition spokesman Cedomir Jovanovic said the results he had
received so far made it clear that a second-round runoff between
Milosevic and Kostunica, his main opponent, a 56-year-old lawyer
backed by 18 opposition parties, would be required if Kostunica did
not win outright. Figures released by the opposition said that
turnout was nearly 78 percent in Serbia and about 25 percent in the
tiny sister republic of Montenegro, whose pro-Western president had
urged his citizens to boycott the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``These elections are just a show,'' said President Milo
Djukanovic of Montenegro. ``Milosevic intends to continue his
dictatorship in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikola Sainovic, Yugoslav deputy prime minister and a spokesman
for the ruling Socialist Party, said that turnout was ``more than
55 percent,'' and that a party tally of 299 of the 10,000 polling
stations in Serbia and Kosovo showed Milosevic winning 50.28
percent of the vote, and Kostunica 30.76 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Polling experts noted that a lower turnout would require
Milosevic to win or manufacture fewer votes in order to claim a
first-round victory. They suggested that Sainovic's figures might
represent a pattern for the government, which could try to find
grounds to invalidate thousands of individual ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The Radical Party of Vojislav Seselj, which is an increasingly
disaffected partner of Milosevic in government and is considered a
watchful counter of votes in this election, offered a larger sample
of 600,000 votes. That sample showed Kostunica with 49 percent to
Milosevic's 41 percent. But again, it was impossible to judge how
representative the sample was.
</P>
<P>
   Some Socialist Party officials were said to be arguing for a
second round, hoping to keep the turnout down, but opposition
leaders, pollsters and analysts believe that a second round would
produce a definitive victory for Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   People also voted for both houses of the Yugoslav parliament and
for local governments, but the counting of those votes is slower.
However, the opposition claimed big victories in Belgrade, which it
already controls, and said it had lost no towns.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday evening, Vladimir Stambuk, vice president of the
Serbian parliament and a senior member of the party of Milosevic's
wife, Mirjana Markovic, said: ``The turnout is very large, and it's
clearly a kind of referendum.'' But Stambuk said: ``I don't think
we'll have a second round.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Serbian Renewal Movement, an opposition party
which failed to back Kostunica, said that he was winning by wide
margins over Milosevic in central Serbia and large cities, while
Milosevic was running ahead, though less dramatically, in more
rural eastern and southern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets of Belgrade, there were rival rallies and
concerts. The opposition had planned to rally in the Square of the
Republic, but the government set up a loud concert instead,
featuring famous singers of folk and its popular derivative, known
here as ``turbofolk.''Some surprised opposition supporters yelled
``red thieves'' at the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition moved down the street to a smaller square, and
some 5,000 people gathered to hear scattered results, chant slogans
and cheer for Kostunica. They chanted: ``Kostunica, save Serbia
from this madhouse'' and ``Slobo, save Serbia and kill yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Police separated the crowds but there was no violence.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Milan Spasic, a lawyer of 52, said: ``We want
change, but with this guy we'll never have them. We'll have only
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who was indicated last year by the United Nations war
crimes tribunal in The Hague, is widely blamed for igniting the
wars that brought the breakup of the old Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Milos Cervenic, 26, a metalworker, spoke hopefully of an
opposition victory. ``I'm expecting to live like a man at last, to
not be ashamed of being a Serb anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the original constitution, Milosevic could serve only a
single term as Yugoslav president, which would end in July of next
year. His ally, Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic, says
Milosevic will run out his term no matter what the results of these
elections may be.
</P>
<P>
   In Montenegro itself, the elections caused little stir, with a
large majority not voting. Special police units loyal to Djukanovic
were on guard at state buildings in full combat gear but Yugoslav
army units, whose commanders have openly supported Milosevic, kept
to their barracks.
</P>
<P>
   In both Serbia and Montenegro, there were complaints of
electoral abuses, including inflated voter tallies, missing
curtains and opposition monitors being banned from a few polling
places. Police and soldiers voted in their barracks, away from the
scrutiny of party representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, which is run by the United Nations, Western troops
and officials tried to keep a count of those who voted, to try to
defeat any effort by Belgrade to inflate the numbers. Western
officials said that fewer than 40,000 inhabitants appeared to vote.
State media said Milosevic had done very well in Kosovo.

NONCANDIDATE CLINTON'S STEADY REFRAIN: I BELIEVE IN FUND-RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton's 139th fund-raiser of the year
came and went Sunday afternoon just as all the ones before it.
There was socializing in the backyard of a fancy house. There was a
mouthwatering menu served to elegantly dressed guests. Then there
was the presidential pitch.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Clinton's 20-vehicle motorcade pulled down the long
spiral driveway en route to political fund-raiser No. 140, Rep.
Lois Capps (D-Calif.) had netted $200,000 for her re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my lifetime, we have never had a chance like this to build
the future of our dreams for our children,'' Clinton said, rattling
off one of the numerous lines that are now indelibly etched in his
head.
</P>
<P>
   He had delivered much the same remarks the day before at a
luncheon in Fremont, Calif., for the Democratic National Committee;
at a barbecue in San Jose for the Congressional candidate Mike
Honda; and at an evening gala in Brentwood for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, the group trying to take back the
House for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   His words strayed only slightly from the ones he made later in
the day at a fund-raiser for the California League of Conservation
Voters. And the president will undoubtedly offer the same message
at a fund-raiser for the New Mexico Democratic Party in Santa Fe on
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton frequently says that this election will be the first one
in more than two decades in which his name is not on the ballot.
But that in no way means the president is sitting it out.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be attending campaign rallies or dropping by diners
or union halls, but he is engaged in an unabashed fund-raising
frenzy, one with all the intensity of the money-raising efforts of
Candidate Clinton in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in raising money,'' the president told several
hundred people at a reception in Livonia, Mich., on Wednesday
night. ``I believe people ought to contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   This year alone, Clinton has raised somewhere around $90 million
for the Democratic cause, money that has been routed to the
national party, to individual senators and representatives, to
governors and state legislators. By Election Day, his take will
probably have shot well past $100 million; there are many more
presidential fund-raising events in the works.
</P>
<P>
   As he does with many fund-raising trips, Clinton mixed a modest
amount of presidential business with his campaign duties, a tactic
that allows the White House to bill some of the trip to the
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House does not keep a tally of the number of
fund-raisers Clinton attends, but Mark Knoller, a reporter for CBS
Radio, has logged them one by one since January, and Clinton
acknowledged Knoller's count several times this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might ask yourself why, in the last year of my presidency,
when things are going so well, I would do what is now 138 events,''
Clinton said Saturday night in Brentwood at a musical tribute to
House Democrats. ``You might say, well, maybe he did a few for
Hillary, he had to do that, but why did he do the others?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then answered his own question.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strange time in my life,'' he said. ``It's the first
time in 26 years I haven't been on the ballot. My party has a new
leader. My family has a new candidate. I'm kind of trading in the
title of commander in chief for cheerleader in chief. But I like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledges, however, that the heavy fund-raising
schedule takes its toll on him personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cumulative impact of it _ it's hard,'' he said aboard Air
Force One last week, looking exhausted on the flight home from a
long day of fund-raisers in Michigan. ``It's a lot of wear and
tear, but I like seeing all these people.''
</P>
<P>
   And they like seeing him. The crowds are always enthusiastic,
and the candidates he helps are effusive in their praise.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Clinton has his sights set no farther than Nov. 7,
the day voters will decide on the fate of his wife and vice
president _ to mention just two elections the president cares
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked harder in this election, I think, than in any
election I've been in,'' Clinton said.  &QL;

MOLE? WHAT MOLE? I DON'T KNOW ANY MOLE. DO YOU? 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore said Sunday that he did not
have any knowledge of a ``mole'' providing his campaign with
secrets about his opponent's activities, and instead seemed to
direct suspicion elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody in the Bush campaign keeps sending confidential
internal data to us,'' Gore said in response to questions from
reporters in a conference call Sunday, ``we'll keep turning it over
to the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president made reference to news reports this weekend
that quoted unnamed law enforcement officials as saying that they
had identified someone in the Bush campaign as a possible source of
confidential debate-preparation materials that were sent nearly two
weeks ago to a supporter of Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   But federal law enforcement officials and aides to Bush said
Sunday that no such suspect had been identified.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush's advisers insisted that the Gore campaign's
suspension on Saturday of a junior staff member who had boasted
about a mole in the Bush campaign raised serious questions about
what Gore officials might know about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming increasingly troublesome,'' said Ari Fleischer,
a spokesman for the Bush campaign, in his own conference call with
reporters. ``It does seem that the more the FBI inquires, the more
nervous they're getting in Nashville.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw this week that the vice president will say anything to
get elected,'' Fleischer added, referring to several misstatements
that the Bush campaign attributed to Gore. ``There's now a question
of whether the vice president's campaign will do anything to get
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   The contest of words reflected the degree to which both the Gore
and Bush campaigns are struggling to make sure that the matter that
began with some errant debate-preparation materials does not wind
up reflecting ill on their candidates. And it spoke to a mystery
that yielded several unusual and ambiguous developments last week.
</P>
<P>
   The matter began on Sept. 13, when a former Democratic
congressman, Thomas Downey, who had been assigned the part of Bush
in the Gore campaign's debate rehearsals, received in the mail a
videotape of one of Bush's debate practice sessions and a stack of
confidential briefing papers.
</P>
<P>
   Downey turned the information over to the FBI, which began what
it is still calling a preliminary inquiry to determine whether any
federal laws were broken.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said that only the campaign's senior officials had
authorized access to _ and copies of _ the materials.
</P>
<P>
   Several Bush advisers said Sunday that many campaign officials
believed that the materials were somehow stolen, copied and then
replaced by an outsider, and one adviser said that the campaign
manager, Joe Allbaugh, had been pressing FBI investigators to
consider that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   One of the advisers noted that the Austin, Texas, offices of
Mark McKinnon, who is the Bush campaign's chief media adviser and
had copies of the material, are not as secure as the campaign
headquarters and are adjacent to a film-editing business used by
both Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers said that FBI investigators in Austin had visited
McKinnon's offices and had interviewed some of the people who work
there. as well as many, but not all, of the senior officials in the
Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the FBI's inquiry was too incomplete for there to
be any suspects, that the agency had not informed the Bush campaign
of any such conclusions and that Allbaugh had placed a call on
Saturday to Louis J. Freeh, the director of the FBI, to complain
about a news account to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Saturday, officials with the Gore campaign
announced that they had reprimanded Michael Doyne, 28, and put him
on paid administrative leave while they investigated his actions
and statements over the previous days. Doyne is the administrative
assistant to the field director for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Doyne initially told ABC News, which had heard
that he was boasting about a mole in the Bush camp, that he had not
made such statements. He even provided ABC News with an affidavit
to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   But when the network later produced an e-mail message that Doyne
had sent to a longtime friend and that made reference to such a
mole, Doyne amended his account.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Gore campaign said Doyne's boast was an idle
joke and that the campaign, after an internal review, had concluded
that it was not receiving or using any confidential information
from the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials said they were proceeding
cautiously with their inquiry, which they acknowledged was a
political hot potato, given the possibility that their suspicions
or conclusions might be seen as harmful to one campaign or the
other.

PRIVATE FIRM TO HANDLE HEALTH CARE IN NEW YORK JAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Maine, Pa., Ga., Fla., Ind., Kan.)   By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was founded 22 years ago by a registered nurse who
was disturbed by the slipshod medical care he witnessed at a county
jail outside Philadelphia, and who was intrigued by the possibility
of making a dollar if he set up his own business to improve it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Prison Health Services is the central component of a
$400-million-a-year corporation, one that delivers everything from
dental work to cardiac care to 175,000 inmates in 27 states and
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company that one executive calls the ``HMO Behind Bars''
is moving to take on the greatest challenge in its history: a
contract of nearly $100 million to care for 13,000 prisoners on
Rikers Island and in other New York City jails. But as it does so,
some government officials and others who have monitored the
company's performance say it has occasionally failed to deliver
quality care.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee-based company has grown enormously in recent years
as it aggressively pursued a share of the nation's estimated $4.5
billion-a-year inmate health-care market. And it has largely
succeeded in cutting prison health costs for the governments it
serves.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, Maine and
Washington, D.C., among others, it has been dogged at times by
allegations of severe staffing problems, poor or unstable
management and substandard care.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in recent months in Cumberland County, Maine, where
the company is being replaced by local authorities, Prison Health
Services routinely failed to provide inmates with prescribed
medications or dental care, and nurses were sometimes asked to work
24-hour shifts, according to a Sheriff's Office report issued this
month.
</P>
<P>
   And in Philadelphia, prisoners with serious injuries or
life-threatening conditions sometimes waited months for care or
were denied it entirely, according to a physician who inspected
Prison Health's clinics from 1993 to 1998 as part of a longstanding
lawsuit against the city jails.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult to go back, time after time, and find
that the physicians were still not doing the work they were
supposed to do,'' said Dr. Robert L. Cohen, a former medical
director at Rikers Island who led the Philadelphia inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The company's executives do not dispute that they have, at
times, failed to live up to expectations. But they said that those
troubled sites represented only a tiny share of the company's
roughly 125 contracts, and they noted that there was no shortage of
state and local governments who were pleased with their
performance, including Kansas, Indiana, and Alameda County in the
Oakland, Calif., region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be complications, there will be bumps in the
road,'' said Lawrence H. Pomeroy, a senior vice president at Prison
Health. The company and its corporate parent, America Service
Group, which is traded on Nasdaq, are based in Brentwood, Tenn.
``The objective is to prevent as many as possible when they occur,
and to respond and correct them quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, PHS' performance in New York _ it is scheduled to
start work Jan. 1, assuming that final negotiations are successful
_ will receive extraordinary scrutiny here as it tries to improve
what some already consider a seriously troubled system of inmate
medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, in an effort to cut costs, the city hired St.
Barnabas Medical Center in the Bronx to handle all but the most
severe inmate medical cases, paying the hospital a set fee per
prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   While the city saved money, inmate complaints increased
threefold after St. Barnabas took over, and the Manhattan district
attorney opened a criminal investigation into problems with the
care given to more than a dozen prisoners, including four who died.
St. Barnabas has defended its performance, criticizing the city's
oversight and the poor condition of the medical system it
inherited.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges in delivering prison care in New York are
enormous: The city has the second-largest urban jail system (after
Los Angeles) in the United States, with an inmate population that
turns over quickly and that has a complex range of ailments in much
higher numbers than the population at large.
</P>
<P>
   The company's duties will include hiring the doctors, nurses and
other staff who will assess the health of inmates as they arrive
and will treat all but the most acute medical or mental-health
problems that arise.
</P>
<P>
   City officials acknowledged Prison Health's mixed reviews but
said they were confident that the company could live up to their
high expectations for the care to be provided at the Manhattan
Detention Center and at clinics on Rikers Island and the Vernon C.
Bain barge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a corporation that is willing to put its money where its
mouth is,'' said Ernesto Marrero, executive director of
Correctional Health Services, the city unit that oversees care in
jails. He said the company had proved as much with the recent
efforts to better its performance at Philadelphia's jails. ``What
we want here is a way to more effectively provide and improve the
quality of care.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the city's prison inmates promise that they will
monitor Prison Health's performance in New York intensely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been very serious failures in care in New York City
over the last two and a half years,'' said John Boston, director of
the Prisoners' Rights Project for the Legal Aid Society of New York
City. ``Let's hope they will correct these problems and not repeat
them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Prison Health's struggle to deliver first-rate care dates back
to the first years after it was set up by Doyle H. Moore, the
one-time nurse who had worked at the Delaware County, Pa., jail,
and a partner. Indeed, one of the early complaints about the care
that the company provided _ an inmate with leukemia in Broward
County, Fla., was given little more than Tylenol _ resulted in a
lawsuit that is still cited by lawyers for prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling on that 1982 incident, the U.S. Court of Appeals held
that Prison Health's ``intentional failure to provide service''
violated the Constitution's protections against cruel and unusual
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But if that case was an extreme example of medical neglect,
there has been a regular string of problems at prisons large and
small. The company has been the subject of criticism in
Philadelphia, in Georgia and in Pinellas County, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the company was fined about $250,000 shortly after
it took over the 30,000-inmate state prison system in 1995 because
of difficulties it had in hiring personnel, said William P. Kissel,
director of health services for Georgia's Department of
Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Kissel said he believed that the company submitted a bid price
that was too low, making it difficult for the state's expectations
to be met. Ultimately, it was felt that the company moved to
address the problems. But in 1997, the state nonetheless decided to
resume control of medical care for its inmates, and terminated its
contract with Prison Health.
</P>
<P>
   Prison Health also failed to win a new contract in Pinellas
County _ where it cared for 2,600 inmates from the St. Petersburg
and Clearwater areas between 1992 and 1995 _ after local officials
concluded that its management was inadequate and that it had failed
to maintain medical records properly and to conduct timely
evaluations of inmates, said Marianne Pasha, a spokeswoman for the
Pinellas County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The company also was said to be partly responsible for the death
in 1994 of a 46-year-old female inmate who had pleaded for but not
received one of her heart medications, county officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be one fix put in, but then something else would
require fixing,'' Pasha said. ``Things required constant attention
and monitoring by us. It was less than satisfactory.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, where PHS has worked since 1993 and now cares
for about 7,000 inmates in five jails, it has come closest to
running a jail system like the one in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   When the company began operating in Philadelphia, there were
signs that it had succeeded in improving care, said Cohen, who
handled the monitoring. But during return visits over the next
several years, he documented dozens of cases of inmates who he said
had received improper or deficient care by PHS staff, largely
because of insufficient access to specialty care.
</P>
<P>
   In one example, according to a 1998 inspection report, it took
five months after the diagnosis of an aneurysm in a 36-year-old
inmate for a decision to be made about treatment. At that point a
doctor called the condition ``a time bomb,'' but even then approval
for needed surgery was denied, because the Prison Health medical
director for Philadelphia said the inmate's release was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the problems in Philadelphia, Cohen reported, had to do
with the Prison Health medical staff. He noted that there was
frequent turnover of doctors and administrators and a
``simultaneous tendency to maintain nonperforming or malperforming
physicians on staff for extended periods of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia officials disputed many of Cohen's findings, saying
that Prison Health had established a ``stable and viable'' inmate
health-care system and that Cohen frequently misread inmate medical
records. But the company's executives agreed that there were
problems, and ultimately administrators assigned to the
Philadelphia project were replaced and a new team of executives
took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always things to improve in any contract, and
Philadelphia certainly had its share or more,'' said Pomeroy,
Prison Health's senior vice president. ``It was a troubled contract
that needed more resources, more attention and more
accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 inspection report suggests that Prison Health was
successful in improving the quality of care in the Philadelphia
prison system as it found more qualified medical personnel and
better treatment of chronic diseases and other conditions. Press M.
Grooms, deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia prison system,
noted that the city recently expanded and extended Prison Health's
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Prison Health has encountered difficulties even
with one of its smallest contracts, the 370-inmate jail in
Cumberland County, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At times in the last year, there have been so many vacancies in
the Prison Health staff that no nurse has been available to
distribute medications, or a nurse has been asked to work a 24-hour
shift, said Sheriff Mark N. Dion. Supervision in the jail pharmacy
was so lax, Dion said, that he called in the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration to do an audit. The company shifted
administrators four times, he said, but was never able to correct
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the corporate level, they just could not get the chain of
command in place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pomeroy agreed that Prison Health had had difficulty recruiting
and retaining staff for the Cumberland contract, from which the
company is now withdrawing. But he said part of the problem was
that the jail population was about 40 percent higher than the
number Prison Health had been told it would have to handle.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are any number of satisfied Prison Health
customers, at sites large and small around the United States. In
Indiana, all of the state's prisons won accreditation from a
national correctional health group three years after Prison Health
arrived, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   During that same time, the state and the company claim, Prison
Health helped avoid about $25 million in projected inmate medical
costs, in large part by reducing treatment outside the
20,000-inmate prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have helped us to improve quality and to take a more
businesslike approach to the delivery of medical services,'' said
Robert J. Ohlemiller, a deputy commissioner at the Indiana
Department of Correction.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, where the company has worked since 1991, handling
about 8,300 inmates, a court order mandating improvements has been
lifted and the state's prisons also have won accreditation,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Several government officials, doctors and other inmate health
experts who have observed Prison Health operations said that the
key to the company's success in New York will be aggressive
oversight by city officials and others.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the company's critics, like David Rudovksy, a
professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and an
inmate rights lawyer, said they believed Prison Health Services was
more than capable of providing quality care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a company I would say `If you go with Prison Health
Services, forget it, it is not going to happen,''' Rudovksy said.
``They are established, credible, and I think they want to provide
adequate care. But you can see around the country, if nobody is
watching from the outside it is easy to let things slip, as of
course it costs less money that way.''

   LOS ANGELES _ What goes up must come down, and in UCLA's case
the 29-10 loss to Oregon on Saturday was a definite downer after
such heady wins against Alabama and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, after rising from unranked to No. 6 in the nation in
just three weeks, are back to No. 15 in the Associated Press poll.
There is no more talk of national championships and even a trip to
the Rose Bowl will probably require the Bruins to sweep their final
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Bruins weren't so much exposed against Oregon as they
were exploited.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo noted last week that the Bruins hadn't put
together a complete game. As of today, they still haven't. The
difference was that they overcame mistakes against Alabama, Fresno
State and Michigan. Against Oregon, they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Rose (Bowl) colored glasses have been removed, it's
clear to see who the Bruins are.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan McCann is a capable quarterback, but he isn't consistent.
The receivers can make spectacular plays, but they can't always
make routine ones. The offensive line is much better, but it isn't
dominant. The defense is the best it has been in Toledo's five
years as head coach, a distinction that ranks with being the
tallest midget in the circus.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the Bruins would have been giddy to have started
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, what is most troubling for the Bruins is they don't seem to
be getting better _ particularly on offense. They've scored fewer
points every game, starting with 35 against Alabama, then 24
against Fresno State, 23 against Michigan and then 10 against
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   It's also no coincidence that DeShaun Foster's rushing totals
have shrunk each week, too. He went for 187 yards against Alabama,
140 against Fresno State, 95 against Michigan and 49 against
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, teams commit more and more resources to taking Foster
away. Oregon did little on Saturday that Michigan and Fresno State
hadn't also showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defensive game plan was to make me beat them,'' said
McCann, who was 13 for 33 for 152 yards but had one potential
touchdown pass dropped by Jon Dubravac and another to Freddie
Mitchell lost to a poor call. ``I didn't play well and they won.''
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting that while McCann's confidence in himself
hasn't wavered throughout his self-described ``roller coaster'' of
a season, the same can't be said for offensive coordinator Al
Borges. He acknowledged that a lack of confidence in McCann might
have influenced his play-calling Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins so desperately tried to establish Foster, they ran
him on 15 of their first 23 first downs in the game for a total of
28 yards. This constantly put McCann in situations in which Oregon
knew he would throw, allowing the Ducks to be the aggressors
without paying for it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, McCann only threw eight of his 33 passes on
so-called running downs (first-and-10, second-and-6 or less,
third-and-3 or less), when a play-action fake would fool the
linebackers and safeties. He completed four of them, for 12, 17, 34
and 35 yards _ his longest completions of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the 30-yard pass that Mitchell appeared to have caught in
the end zone came on a first-and-10 call. Then there was the most
effective play-action fake, executed by Drew Bennett, who on
third-and-2 faked an option run, pulled back and hit a wide-open
Mitchell for a 54-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Borges didn't think his play-calling was conservative. He wrote
the offense's performance off to poor execution _ of which there
was certainly plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be conservative when they have nine guys in the
box,'' Borges said. ``There is no way. You can't block nine guys.
There is a point where the ball gets put right back in (McCann's)
court.''
</P>
<P>
   So, how do the coaches fix this problem of diminishing returns?
Wait for McCann to get better? Wait for Cory Paus to get healthy?
Wait for a better game plan?
</P>
<P>
   This might be the point where the ball is back in their court. &QL;

REPORT CARD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback &QL; 
D+ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ryan McCann said his hamstring, which he clutched after slipping
in the second quarter, was fine. However, until the twinge, he was
6 for 11 for 38 yards, including one drop and another off Freddie
Mitchell's hand that was intercepted. Afterward, he was 7 for 22
for 114 yards.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Running backs &QL; 
C &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DeShaun Foster was limited to 49 yards on 19 carries _ a 2.6
average _ and 18 of those yards came on one carry. But there were
no holes and no alternatives, as neither backup Jermaine Lewis nor
fullback Ed Ieremia-Stansbury carried the ball.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Offensive line &QL; 
C- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Provided adequate protection and was asked to run block too many
defenders but needed better execution. Five procedure penalties,
including three in a row at one point, didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Receivers: &QL; 
C+ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Mitchell had six catches for 158 yards, one touchdown
and another that should have counted. However, he dropped one ball
and another went off his hands for an interception. Jon Dubravac
dropped what would have been a long touchdown in the end zone. For
the second week in a row, too many drops.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Defensive line &QL; 
C- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No question, this unit is improved, but it's not ready for
Canton just yet. Maurice Morris was the second consecutive back to
run for more than 135 yards, and these guys are waiting for their
first sack of the season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Linebackers &QL; 
C+ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony White was the best player on the field for the Bruins,
making 13 tackles, including several big ones. Ryan Nece and Robert
Thomas played adequately.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Secondary &QL; 
C &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cornerbacks Jason Bell and Ricky Manning were outstanding
against the pass and run, combining for 11 solo tackles and five
breakups. Tackling by safeties Marques Anderson and Jason Zdenek
had to cause Edgerrin James flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Special teams &QL; 
C- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bruins have allowed punt return of more than 25 yards in every
game. Chris Griffith made a 46-yard field goal, but the Bruins
aren't getting enough from special teams.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Coaching &QL; 
D+ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Al Borges showed more confidence in McCann
the previous week even though he played a worse first half against
a better team. Strength of this offense is versatility, yet tight
ends and fullback are MIA. Punt-coverage problems remain and a
penalty for two players wearing the same number turned into a
17-yard play on the re-kick, starting the game-winning drive.

EX-CHAIRMAN OF SOTHEBY'S AGREES TO PAY $156 MILLION IN PRICE-FIXING
CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  By CAROL VOGEL and RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Moving quickly to settle civil claims that it had
cheated auction buyers and sellers for years, the board of
Sotheby's on Sunday night approved payment of its half of a $512
million settlement, the auction house announced. The bulk of
Sotheby's payment will come from its majority shareholder and
former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman agreed to pay $156 million of the auction house's $256
million portion during an emergency telephone meeting of Sotheby's
directors from around the world late Sunday. In exchange, the
company settled all potential claims against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I endorse and am contributing to these settlements to
facilitate the resolution of all matters and to minimize the impact
on Sotheby's, a company I care about deeply,'' Taubman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate settlement reached unexpectedly Sunday, the
company said it agreed to pay $30 million to resolve a long-pending
lawsuit by shareholders who claimed that the company's dealings
with its arch-rival, Christie's, depressed Sotheby's stock and
clouded its prospects. This money would also be paid by Taubman,
the company said. In addition, the auction house agreed to issue
$40 million in class-A stock to plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts said all these measures were intended to
assure shareholders that the company's problems were over, making
the auction house more attractive for a potential takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Both auction giants remain targets of a federal criminal
antitrust investigation, but Sotheby's said Sunday night that it
was ``in serious negotiations with the United States Department of
Justice, and is optimistic that a mutually acceptable resolution
will be reached in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's, which unlike Sotheby's is privately held, said
Sunday that it ``has taken all appropriate measures,'' but would
not comment on any settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The formula by which the money will be divided among plaintiffs
has not yet been determined, an official at one of the auction
houses said.
</P>
<P>
   The $512 million settlement, to be shared by Sotheby's and
Christie's, was reached Thursday night by lawyers from Weil Gotshal
&AMP; Manges, which represents Sotheby's; Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &AMP;
Flom, representing Christie's; and Boies Schiller &AMP; Flexner, the
lead counsel representing about 120,000 buyers and sellers who
filed suit in March. The suit contended that executives of the two
houses had cooperated to fix fees as far back as 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's and Christie's were to vote on the agreement by next
Saturday, but after word of the agreement leaked out, Sotheby's
called Sunday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Sunday, Christie's said the company ``has no
comment at this time of the reports that have appeared in the press
regarding the civil anti-trust class actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the $100 million obligation that would remain after Taubman's
contribution, Sotheby's, like Christie's, would be allowed to pay
$50 million in the form of certificates to sellers. These
certificates would be transferable, and could be used to reduce
commission costs of future consignments.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Sotheby's would only need to come up with another
$50 million to satisfy its part of the settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The former chief executive of Sotheby's, Diana D. Brooks, who
along with Taubman resigned under fire in February, will not
contribute to the settlement at this point, lawyers familiar with
the agreement said. But they added that the company, in fulfilling
its responsibility to shareholders, may yet take financial action
against her.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, in addition to the $256
million that each house must pay, the two houses must split the
costs of notifying buyers and sellers. They must also split
administrative expenses. Sotheby's has been preparing for a big
payment for months. In February, the company announced that it had
arranged for up to $300 million in financing.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action suit was filed in March by buyers and sellers
who charged that the two auction houses had deprived customers of
the ability to win better terms. They also charged that the
companies swapped lists of their richest customers, who would be
spared any sellers' fees at all.

IN UNDERWHELMING TURNOUT, FRENCH VOTERS CUT PRESIDENTIAL TERM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A referendum to cut the French president's term of
office from seven to five years was overwhelmingly approved Sunday
though a record number of voters did not bother to cast a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The shortened term, the most radical change to France's
constitution in 40 years, was approved by 73.2 percent of those who
cast a ballot for or against, according to provisional results. But
only 30 percent of those eligible voted, the lowest turnout ever.
</P>
<P>
   A low turnout had been expected as surveys in recent weeks
showed that the issue had failed to capture the interest of many
voters. Some said the issue was too complex. But others said they
were being asked to vote on an issue that was of interest only to
politicians, far afield from pressing concerns like high taxes and
the cost of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even some who voted went out of their way to express
disdain for the referendum. Eighteen percent of those who showed
up, more than 1.8 million voters, did not vote but instead returned
empty envelopes or envelopes stuffed with a ripped-up ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the polling places closed, President Jacques Chirac _
who before making an about-face this June had always vehemently
opposed the five-year term _ went on television to say he wanted
France to hold more referendums in the future, despite the poor
turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abstention does not mean that there are too many referendums
or too much democracy, but on the contrary that there are not
enough,'' he said. He admitted, however, that many voters were more
interested in job creation and tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, a Socialist who is expected to run
against Chirac in the 2002 presidential race, said he wished more
people had voted but that he was still happy with the result.
Jospin has always supported the reform, which will bring the French
presidency more in line with the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year term will not affect Chirac, who will finish out
his seven-year term, but will begin with the 2002 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter term _ which will put parliamentary and presidential
elections on the same five-year schedule _ has been debated in
France for nearly 30 years. Supporters have argued that the
seven-year term is too long in a fast-changing world. Some also say
it will cut down or eliminate awkward periods of ``co-habitation''
like the one France is experiencing now, with a president and prime
minister from different parties, often working at cross-purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts point out that the reason Chirac may have
reversed course on the measure is because he wants to run again in
2002, when he would turn 70, and his age would be less of an issue
with a shorter term.
</P>
<P>
   Unsure who would get the credit for the vote, neither Chirac or
Jospin put much effort into campaigning. In recent days, the issue
has been somewhat obscured as Chirac has been forced to respond to
charges of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who showed up to vote Sunday said they felt used
by politicians, who were asking them about something that seemed
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Sternhac, an editor who lives in Paris, said he returned a
blank envelope. ``There are so many questions that are more
important to us _ taxes, the state of education, how much we spend
on the justice ministry,'' he said. ``Why are they asking us to
vote on this?''

FROM THE BAYOU TO THE BELTWAY, WITH SLYLY CIVIL FEROCITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the back country of Louisiana's bayous, Billy
Tauzin was brought up to help the neighbors through hard times, eat
``anything that doesn't eat us first'' and steer clear of the dirty
business of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Several decades later, Representative Tauzin, 57, moves with
ease through the ornate halls and bistros of Capitol Hill, though
he insists a simple pledge not to embarrass his father, a poor
electrical worker now dead, still echoes in his ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``He begged me not to run the first time I decided to run,''
Tauzin, a 10-term congressman, said in a recent interview. ``He
didn't want his son living in what he thought was a corrupting
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin, who stands to inherit control of the influential
Commerce Committee if Republicans retain control of the House,
navigates the murky waters where Washington meets corporate America
with a shrewdness that has earned him the nickname Swamp Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker, who recently seized the national spotlight by
holding hearings on Firestone tires, acknowledges that he is a mix
of contradictions. He leads a panel on consumer advocacy, yet he is
passionate about deregulation. He built a career as a Democrat,
then defected to the Republican Party in time to sign the
``Contract With America'' in 1995. He is a populist who holds
lavish fund-raisers, a partisan who covets civility, an outdoors
enthusiast who gives conservationists heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   In the Firestone case, Tauzin, who typically spools out Cajun
humor in policy debates, turned ferocious. He summoned the tire and
auto company executives before his subcommittee on consumer
protection and, cameras rolling, slammed them for ignoring a
mounting death toll from accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great case where we had a big responsibility to leap
in with both feet and to strike out against what we have now
discovered were some great failings on the part of Firestone and
perhaps even Ford in protecting American lives on the highway,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts attributed Tauzin's zeal to election-year
politics; polls show Americans are outraged over the tire affair.
There is no question that Tauzin is focused on November. He is a
top fund-raiser for Republicans, helping to pull in, by his count,
``well more than $8 million'' for candidates in tight races across
the country. His Mardi Gras gala at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia was a hot ticket; cameras caught Tauzin
chomping a cigar and embracing a contributor while a pig roasted on
a spit nearby.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are on track to keep their slim majority,
Tauzin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's close now,'' he said. But, he added, ``if the
election were tonight, I think we'd gain seats _ two to four
seats.''
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans prevail, Tauzin is prepared to use the Commerce
Committee as a soapbox to focus attention on American energy policy
and what he sees as a troubling lack of domestic fuel production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy is about to blow into a higher profile position again
before the Congress, and Commerce is going to be in the thick of
it,'' Tauzin said. ``We have a growing demand for energy in this
country and a policy against producing and refining in this
country. Those things are going to collide.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States needs to open up more land to oil extraction
and upgrade its refining and distribution networks, he said.
Otherwise, the protests over surging gas prices that recently
paralyzed Europe will spill over here, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin is amused by concerns from environmental groups that he
would spoil America to keep its engines humming. He considers
himself a friend of nature and the product of an outdoor life,
including years as a field hand digging shallots and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   He leans into a stage whisper: ``On the other hand, I fight
stupid government environmental regulations every chance I get.''
</P>
<P>
   So runs Tauzin's sense of theater. When he decided to switch
parties _ after fellow Democrats refused to yield him time to speak
on the House floor _ he invited his constituents to a town meeting,
broadcast by C-Span. Their verdict, he recalled: ``We don't care
where you sit; we like where you stand.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Tauzin presented the chairman of Microsoft, Bill Gates,
with a lemon meringue pie, a reminder of a pie that had been thrown
in Gates' face by a Microsoft critic. For many, Tauzin's message
was plain: the prickly Gates needed to open up his heart _ and
wallet _ to lawmakers in Washington. Gates obliged.
</P>
<P>
   Such stunts are favored by a man who performed Shakespeare in
college (``Imagine a Cajun Hamlet,'' he said) and appeared on
television with Martha Stewart to promote his book of down-home
recipes, ``Cook and Tell.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret to a great gumbo is a good roux, the butter and flour
base for the sauce, he said. The secret for surviving in a
``corrupting world'' is not much different, he said: ``Always
remember where you come from and how you got there, and who you
really answer to.'' &QL;

   HOOKSETT, N.H. _ The first twinges of orange and red had already
appeared in the woods when Arleigh Greene and John Noone gathered
with their wives, children and some friends on Sunday for what they
called a wood party.
</P>
<P>
   The men traded off a chain saw and an ax while the women and
children tossed split logs into the bucket of a bulldozer, ready to
dump the load into a truck. Concerned about the rising cost and
limited supply of heating oil, they were hoping to store a larger
supply of firewood this year than last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared of not getting deliveries,'' said Greene, a
used-truck dealer from Hampton Falls, who heats his house with oil
and wood, about eight cords a winter. ``I want to keep the house
warm so the pipes don't freeze.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has heard that some local fuel suppliers are
already running low on oil, Greene scoffed at President Clinton's
decision to release 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, which was established in 1975 after the Arab oil
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally against it,'' he said, adding that he supported
Gov. George W. Bush for president. ``I think it's terrible and 100
percent political. There's no doubt in my mind. I'm for everything
that makes it easier for the poor, and especially the elderly. But
they had a chance to do this a year ago and they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to quarter a section of oak with three well-placed
chops.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where the presidential race is too close to call and
where most residents heat their homes with oil, strong opinions
like Greene's are not difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   Of more than two dozen people interviewed Sunday about Clinton's
move, nearly all had a firm opinion. But few said the decision
would sway their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Like Greene, many voters here called it pure politics when, so
close to Election Day, Vice President Al Gore said last week that
oil from the reserve should be used to increase supply and reduce
prices, and Clinton followed through, ordering the release of 30
million barrels of the 570 million barrels of crude oil in the
national reserve. But many considered the use of the reserves as a
necessary and practical measure.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Blake, an air traffic controller from Amherst, said he
expected to pay $500 more this year for heating oil but was more
worried about his mother-in-law, who was on a fixed income. He
welcomed the release of the oil but complained that it had taken
too long for the government to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a ready resource,'' Blake said of the oil reserve. ``They
don't think there's a big enough threat out there that they need to
retain that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move was not politically motivated,'' he added as he sat
in the Mall of New Hampshire in Manchester. ``I think a lot of
people in the Northeast and Midwest suffered, and the new oil is a
good thing. Being good for voters, you call that political? I don't
think it's totally political.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration insisted that despite the political
windfall that Gore might receive from the decision, the move was
triggered by growing concern about the high prices of crude oil and
heating oil and the exceedingly low supplies of heating fuel in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main objective was to ensure that we had adequate stocks
for this winter _ especially in New England,'' Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson said Sunday on the NBC News program ``Meet the
Press.'' ``This is about disruption of supply, this is to increase
supply. We are not trying to manipulate prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, the White House had staked great
credibility on reining in the price of crude and, with it, products
such as gasoline, diesel and heating oil. Although it convinced the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries this year to increase
crude supplies, the price of oil remained high. By tapping the
reserve, the administration was able to deliver on its lingering
promise of cheaper oil, at least in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   Crude prices plummeted on news of the promised increase in
supply. The price of heating oil declined on Friday as well, to
95.48 cents a gallon. Last year at this time, heating oil was about
60 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire consumers have reason to be concerned about a
possible oil shortage. In New England, there are only 6 million
barrels of heating oil in commercial inventories, compared with
16.3 million barrels last year, according to the American Petroleum
Institute. The 6 million barrels are less than a 10-day supply
under normal usage.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters, there are no refineries in the
Northeast or pipelines in the area, which means deliveries of
heating oil by barge and truck can be disrupted when they are
needed most, such as during winter storms.
</P>
<P>
   If the weather turns cold suddenly, the release from the
reserves, which should be available to consumers, after refining,
by early December, will not be able to shield the Northeast from
price spikes or possibly crippling shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there were political motives behind opening the
reserves, as Republicans contend, it did nothing to budge undecided
voters off their fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with Clinton, because now we have a tighter
noose around our neck,'' said Walter Fleming, a retired auditor
from Merrimack, who was sitting on a bench in the Mall of New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said he did not believe that using the reserves was
politically motivated, or effective in lowering prices in the long
run. He would much rather see conservation efforts in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these big vehicles and SUVs, no one seems to care,'' he
said. ``No one seems to care until they have a crisis. It could
really help this country if people used small cars.''

</P>
<P>
   Sam King, a wrecker operator from Goffstown, said he feared that
opening the reserves would endanger national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a bad idea,'' King said. ``What if you ever need
that and it's not in there? I think Clinton should sit with OPEC
and see what they could do, before his term is up.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other New Hampshire residents, Sue Gray of West
Lebanon was able to lock in a fixed price for heating oil by paying
for most of the winter's supply in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said she thought that opening the reserves was a good idea,
but would prefer to see the resulting benefits spread directly to
the people who need it most, like those who make under $50,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may lower prices by a nickel or dime, where if it could
be targeted, it could go to the people who really need it,'' she
said, sitting in the mall's food court. She added that as a Gore
supporter, she did not care if Clinton's decision had been
politically motivated. And she did not think it was.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Puritan Back Room, a crowded family restaurant in
Manchester, Tammie Lambert of Merrimack, said she was dreading her
next oil delivery, which she expected to cost over $400, when she
is used to paying $175. The last price she heard for oil was $1.41
a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to croak,'' said Lambert, who works in the
accounting department of Associated Grocers, as her daughter and
her husband waited for her near their van. ``It used to be if you
paid in 10 days, you'd get 10 cents off, and it would be like 69
cents a gallon. We could pay in 10 days. Now it's going to take us
the whole 30 days. We're trying to put money away for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby in the restaurant's parking lot, Kris Payton, a medical
technician from Hooksett, said her family had just bought a more
fuel-efficient furnace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to squeeze everything,'' Payton said. ``We've
heard oil is supposed to be real high this year.'' She planned to
keep the house at 68 degrees. Clinton's decision swayed her
slightly towards the Democrats, she said, but she wondered why he
waited so long to free the reserve supply.
</P>
<P>
   George Blushiy of Manchester, was sweeping in front of a car
wash on Daniel Webster Highway. A Bush supporter, Blushiy called
the decision to open the reserves an election-year ploy, but seemed
to put more faith in the law of supply and demand than in any
political tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is going to go up,'' he said. ``When it's time for
the leaf-peepers to come up here, you watch, gas is going to go up
15 cents a gallon.''

FALTERING EURO TO FACE TEST IN MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Having won pledges from the world's
major central banks to support the euro, Europe's downtrodden
single currency, the European Central Bank will have its toughness
and its credibility tested on Monday by foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the European bank bought up billions of dollars worth
of euros and was joined by the U.S. Federal Reserve as well as the
central banks of Japan, Britain and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Catching the markets by surprise, the central banks announced
their ``shared concern'' about the euro's precipitous decline and
suggested that they would intervene again if the euro's value
against the dollar did not increase.
</P>
<P>
   For the European Central Bank, which assumed power when the euro
was born on Jan. 1, 1999, a successful intervention is crucial for
its credibility and that of the currency itself.
</P>
<P>
   Financial officials from Europe, the United States and Japan,
who were here in Prague this past weekend for meetings of the
International Monetary Fund, spent much of the weekend talking up
their commitment in the hope of jolting currency markets when they
open for business on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets understand that there is a clear will not to accept an
undervalued euro,'' said Horst Koehler, managing director of the
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst Welteke, president of Germany's central bank, the
Bundesbank, said he was pleased at how well the intervention has
gone so far.
</P>
<P>
   But experts and currency traders are uncertain. The intervention
on Friday appears to have involved only a few billion dollars and
may have little long-term impact if it is not followed up by more
waves of euro-buying and dollar-selling.
</P>
<P>
   If Friday's intervention has little effect and if central
bankers do not intervene again, experts say, the damage to the
currency will be much worse than if they had not decided to
intervene at all.
</P>
<P>
   Few people are more aware of the risks than the president of the
European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg of the Netherlands. Like many
other central bankers, he is skeptical about the value of
intervention. In December, when the euro sank below parity against
the dollar for the first time, he was determined to wait for the
markets to correct themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When the euro's value fell to 88.4 cents in early May,
Duisenberg came under increasing pressure from political leaders to
intervene. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France called for
``joint action'' to shore up the euro and even proposed
strengthening the role of finance ministers of countries using the
euro in monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg did not budge, though he did issue a formal statement
expressing sympathy with those who were alarmed by the euro's
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg has been careful not to spell out his goals or to
suggest how much money the central banks are willing to commit to
rescuing the euro. But he seems determined to push its value up
rather than simply to stabilize it, and anything short of an
increase will be taken by markets as an even greater proof of the
euro's dim prospects.

   G'day from Australia, &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This country has all manner of poisonous creatures. But as far
as I can tell, the biggest menace to unsuspecting visitors is the
magpie.
</P>
<P>
   This bird of the bushland is a mild-mannered neighbor most of
the year. But right now it's nesting season, which explains why the
birds are as territorial as any world-class sprinter. After I drew
close to one in a feeble effort to identify what it was, a local
volunteer warned me to give magpies a wide berth
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, I heard the other day that screeching, dive-bombing
magpies are attacking Olympic cyclists practicing on the mountain
biking course, which is in an expanse of bushland.
</P>
<P>
   The best defense against the swooping birds? I'm told it's a
hat. The helmeted cyclists, then, should have no worries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Catch ya' later, &QL;

Many New Hampshire called it pure politics when, so close to
Election Day, Vice President Al Gore said last week that oil from
the reserve should be used to increase supply and reduce prices,
and President Clinton followed through, ordering the release of 30
million barrels of the 570 million barrels of crude oil in the
national reserve. Tammie Lambert of Merrimack, N.H., said Sunday
that she was dreading the next delivery of heating oil, which she
expected to cost more than $400 rather than the $175 it had cost in
the past. (Michael Quan/The New York Times)

WILKINSON WRESTS PLATFORM GOLD FROM CHINA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ If the Netherlands can upset Cuba in
baseball and Misty Hyman can upset Susie O'Neill in the 200-meter
butterfly, why couldn't Laura Wilkinson win the gold medal in the
women's Olympic 10-meter platform diving final?
</P>
<P>
   There were three good reasons why: a broken foot she suffered
earlier in the year, Li Na and Sang Xue.
</P>
<P>
   But the ex-gymnast overcome those things Sunday and won the gold
medal at the Sydney International Aquatic Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Li and Sang are the latest sleek models in China's diving
assembly line. Despite their shallow depth of experience _ neither
woman was diving the last time the Summer Games were held _ China
coach Wong Ming was confident they could both win medals.
</P>
<P>
   He had reason to be optimistic because China had produced the
past four Olympic platform champions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. hadn't won a gold medal in the event in 36 years, not
since Lesley Bush's triumph in 1964. Wilkinson, though, didn't let
history deter her anymore than she did her repaired foot.
</P>
<P>
   Though she would later say she was worried before the event
``that my body wouldn't quite do what I wanted it to do,''
Wilkinson showed none of the nervousness she claimed to be feeling.
</P>
<P>
   She scored 9.0s and 9.5s on her third dive, a reverse 2
somersault tuck, to wrest the lead from Li by a single point.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson, 22, coolly nailed her final dive, a back 2 somersault
with a half-twist, to cinch the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Li summoned a solid final dive despite pressure so fierce it
pinched tears out of her eyes, but she came up 1.74 points short of
the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson finished with 543.75 points to Li's 542.01. Anne
Montminy displaced Sang for the bronze, beating her by 27.12 points
to become Canada's first Olympic medalist in the platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put it all on the line and it worked out really well,'' said
Wilkinson, whose most prestigious win before Sunday was her
platform title at the 1998 Goodwill Games in New York. ``I knew I
had it in me somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson, who lives outside Houston, was a gymnast for seven
years. Her mother was the one who suggested she give diving a try.
Six years later, Wilkinson is awfully glad she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day I broke my foot, I thought my dream was over,'' she
said. ``But God works in mysterious ways. This whole Olympic
experience was a culmination of all my efforts.''

METS, THEIR CONFIDENCE BACK, BEAT PHILS, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Last September, with a week to go in their
season, the Mets played a 3-2 game at Veterans Stadium and lost for
the sixth day in a row. They took a bus back to Shea Stadium, lost
two of three to the Atlanta Braves and needed help to make the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Phillies played to a 3-2 finish again Sunday, but
this time the Mets won. This time, they are playing well when it
matters most, and their playoff fate is all but secured. With two
home runs _ one inside the park, one out _ and eight sparkling
innings from Glendon Rusch, the Mets clinched a tie for the
National League wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lead Los Angeles by six games and Arizona by six and a
half for the wild card. The Diamondbacks will be eliminated if they
lose at Colorado on Monday, the Dodgers if they lose at home to San
Francisco on Tuesday. Then again, one more Mets victory will put
them into the playoffs for the second year in a row, something they
have never done.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets took the last three games from the Phillies in this
series and the final game in Atlanta the series before. They went
6-5 on a road trip that followed a horrible beginning of September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are today is 89 wins under our belt, a
four-out-of-five win streak, feeling good about ourselves,''
manager Bobby Valentine said. ``I thought that before the month
ended we'd feel good, and we're feeling good. Whatever doesn't kill
you makes you stronger, and I think we're a pretty strong group
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That strength is reflected in their confidence, catcher Mike
Piazza said. A few days ago, he said, the Mets got fed up, and
their attitude changed. ``We've got a little bit of swagger back,''
Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, the Met with the least swagger is Glendon Rusch,
the 25-year-old left-hander with the chipper disposition of the
hero in a children's sports novel. He is earnest and unfailingly
polite, and, Valentine said, he may not have been shaving when he
got to the Mets last September.
</P>
<P>
   When Rusch (11-11) was competing for the fifth starter's job in
spring training, the veteran Al Leiter pulled him aside. Leiter
told Rusch he liked what he saw, but Rusch needed to be meaner, to
project an attitude that says, ``I'm going to get you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot can be said for a pitcher's demeanor, how he looks on
the mound during his delivery and between pitches,'' Leiter said.
``He's got it. He's getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter sees that in the way Rusch tugs on his cap and stalks
around the mound, how he quickly sweeps the dirt off the pitcher's
rubber with his cleats and takes ownership of the game, especially
when things go wrong. He stays confident, Leiter said, and Rusch
needed that after his last start.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch was blown out last Tuesday in Atlanta, and he
acknowledged, ``It's such a mental struggle when things like that
happen.'' But, Valentine said, Rusch showed his toughness again
with what might have been his best game this year.
</P>
<P>
   For the 10th time in 29 starts, Rusch issued no walks. He
allowed five hits, striking out seven in eight innings. The
Phillies' only run came on a groundout after Pat Burrell doubled on
a ball that Timo Perez misjudged. Rusch had command of all his
pitches, and Valentine thought his curveball was the best it had
been all year.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets got their first run in the third inning, when Perez
lashed a ball to center. Doug Glanville charged in but slipped, the
ball bouncing high off the artificial turf and rolling to the
fence. Perez circled the bases, sliding into home well ahead of the
throw for his first career home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies' starter, Bruce Chen (7-3), gave up only two more
hits in eight innings, but one of them was a two-run homer to Todd
Zeile in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   It was Zeile's fourth homer on the trip, and after starting
slowly in September, he feels good again because of his patience.
The homer traveled to right-center, the opposite way, a sign to
Zeile that he is not overeager. Zeile drew eight walks in four
games in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go through a cold stretch, you have a tendency to try
to get out of it now, now, now,'' he said. ``So I was hitting the
first thing that came over the plate, putting bad swings on the
ball and getting myself out. I've always been a guy that takes the
count deep, with two strikes. I had to get back to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile's home run was the difference, because the Phillies used
an infield single, a walk and a bloop single to center to score a
run off Armando Benitez in the ninth, cutting the Mets' lead to
3-2. But Benitez struck out Marlon Anderson with runners on second
and third to end the game and earn his 40th save, thumping his
chest with his fist after the 98-mph third strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are confident again, just in time for another series
with Atlanta this week at Shea. The Braves will hold a three- or
four-game lead on the Mets in the National League East, depending
on their game with Montreal on Monday night. Time has probably run
out on the Mets' division title hopes, but one week before the
postseason, they are building momentum at last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not backing into anything,'' Valentine said.

   TRACKING WEB TRAFFIC &HT;      By VERNE KOPYTOFF
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   Executives for Britannica.com were pleased when they tallied 4
million visitors to their online encyclopedia in July. In their
minds, it underscored the Web site's growing popularity and
potential to attract big national advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   But the ebullience at Britannica.com was cut short when the
independent online ratings firms issued their monthly reports about
Web site audiences. One determined that the Web site had only 1.5
million visitors in July, while another said the total was about
2.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of online ratings, where contradictory
statistics are common. Web site traffic measurements diverge
widely, depending on who is counting and how.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is a sore spot among many Internet executives, who
complain that some of the reports are unreliable. The stakes for
them are enormous given the role the measurement plays in
advertising, investment and egos.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few weeks, Internet firms are expected to get a
new platform to publish visitor tallies, called Audit Central. A
Web site is being developed where companies can post their own
audited traffic figures, typically higher than independent
estimates, as a convenience to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing about running a Web site is that you have to
know how many people are using it,'' said Mitchell Davis, who
oversees marketing for Britannica.com, the online encyclopedia in
Chicago. ``Quite frankly, it's a problem if the ratings firms are
reporting us at one level and our true level is somewhere else.
When they under count your traffic by a factor of two or three,
that's big.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is focused on measurement firms like Media Metrix,
NetRatings and PC Data and their use of sampling to estimate Web
site traffic. They recruit and track thousands of Internet users,
betting that their online habits reflect the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The technique is similar to how television ratings are gauged, a
source of complaints by broadcasters over the years. But many
Internet executives say Internet ratings are less accurate because
of bad methodology.
</P>
<P>
   Online measurement firms counter that their reports provide a
true picture of Web site audiences and that the information cannot
be gathered any other way. They advise people who use their
statistics to take into account the gaps and realize that the sheer
number of visitors to a Web site does not tell the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the stakes are so high in buying and selling
advertising, the data has to be right,'' said Tim Meadows, an
executive vice president for NetRatings, a measurement agency in
Milpitas that is owned by Nielsen, the television rating company.
``We think we've taken this to a really high level.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaints are generally directed at reports of unique
visitors, an estimate of how many people log on to a Web site in a
given month. The measurement is used widely by investors and the
media as a sign of a Web organization's health.
</P>
<P>
   NetRatings recruits panelists by making random telephone calls
and sending mailings. People who agree to participate install
software on their computers that records where they go on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   From that, NetRatings extrapolates an array of information about
Web site traffic, from the number of visitors to demographics.
Because the firm uses 65,000 people to represent 146 million, one
visit by a panelist is counted on average as 2,246.
</P>
<P>
   Who those panelists are and where they are using the Web is a
key concern for many Internet executives. They wonder whether the
panels include too many experienced Internet users (a potential
liability for mass-market Web sites) or are too few participants in
offices (harming daytime-intensive Web sites like CNN.com and CBS
MarketWatch.com).
</P>
<P>
   The measurement firms respond that they diligently recruit a
broad range of panelists. The firms that track Internet use at work
say they have enough of an office sample to make those numbers
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly thorny issue is that ratings firms do not
include international Internet traffic in their measurements. That
can significantly affect the visitor counts for Web sites like
Google, the Internet search engine in Menlo Park, which estimates
that nearly half its users are overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Internet traffic from school computer laboratories is also left
out of the measurements. As a consequence, Web sites that are
popular with students, such as Britannica.com and Snowball.com, an
entertainment site created by a San Francisco firm of the same
name, may be ranked lower than they should be.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Grossman, a senior vice president for HookMedia, a Boston
firm that manages online advertising for other companies, said Web
audience measurements are only partly useful. They reflect a Web
site's audience and growth only in general terms, not in detail as
the measurement firms would have people believe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've always felt about the ratings firms is that they are
wrong, but that they are directionally useful.'' Grossman said.
``Are they good at measuring whether Yahoo is bigger than
Saltshaker.com? Absolutely. Do I really use them to see the
difference between Yahoo and MSN? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Measurement firms say they sometimes get telephone calls from
Internet executives who are irate after seeing their monthly
ratings. The consequences of low audience numbers can be
significant because a smaller Web site may be overlooked by
national advertisers, and Wall Street favors larger companies.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Fessel, a senior vice president for Media Metrix in New
York, said much of the problem is due to the different ways that
Web sites and ratings firms measure visitors. For example, Web site
servers typically count people twice who log on from home and work,
he said, while his firm counts them as a single visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Fessel says his company never claims to tally
Internet use from everywhere. But many clients, especially those
with big international and school audiences, may not initially
realize that when they compare their internal numbers to his
company's measurement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous confusion when our clients look at their
server numbers and then see our numbers,'' said Fessel, who says
his firm spends a lot of time educating companies about its
measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Measurement companies add that they have improved their
techniques in recent years by adding more panelists. Media Metrix
is considering measuring Internet use from cellular telephones and
personal electronic organizers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the measurement firms review their statistics for
anomalies like unexplainable jumps in Web site traffic. They
decline to report on lightly visited Web sites because the data for
them is more easily skewed.
</P>
<P>
   Audit Central, the new service intended to complement the online
ratings numbers, is aimed at eliminating the need for potential
advertisers to call Web sites individually for the information.
Only Web sites that have had their server logs reviewed for
accuracy by the three major online auditing firms will be able to
publish those traffic figures.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers are usually higher than the ones published by the
independent online measurement firms. But the general consensus is
that advertising buyers are sophisticated enough to know why the
numbers are different. It is unclear how much these numbers will be
followed by a broader public who may not understand what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a replacement for panel measurement,'' said Gerard
Broussard, a director at Ogilvy One, an advertising agency in New
York and a major proponent of Audit Central. ``An audit will never
tell you the demographics of a Web site like the concentration of
30 to 45 year olds.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many executives dispute online audience figures, they
issue press releases about them when the numbers are favorable.
They also generally agree that rating firms provide valuable
demographic information about the gender, age and income of their
Web site's visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's eager anticipation here around the 22nd of every
month,'' said Rick Boyce, president of Snowball Networks, the
online entertainment company in San Francisco, referring to the
approximate date when Media Metrix's monthly reports are released.
``It measures our growth, but almost more importantly, it tells us
how we are doing against our competition.''

NBC WEB OPERATION BORN AGAIN &HT;    By VERNE KOPYTOFF
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spiral for NBC Internet began in June when the company said
its stable of Web sites were earning less than expected. The slide
got steeper two months later when the firm cut 170 jobs. Then,
perhaps the most worrisome development, NBC Internet went mostly
silent.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is staging what it hopes will be a smooth
landing. It is launching a new Internet portal today, NBCi.com,
that combines a broad array of Web sites into a big one with a big
name.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, NBC Internet, based in San Francisco, will be a
rare example of an old media firm building a strong outpost on the
Web. Its struggle reflects the difficulties broadcasters have
encountered as the battleground for media supremacy has spread to
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our training wheels on,'' said William Lansing, chief
executive for NBC Internet. ``We've lived through the pain of
becoming a single integrated product and now we will see the
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the new NBCi portal is a lot like Yahoo. There are
the usual maps, e-mail, search engine, online communities and
personal Web-page building tools.
</P>
<P>
   But that in itself is a significant step for NBC Internet.
Previously, those functions were spread across two of the firm's
now-discontinued Web sites, Snap.com and Xoom.com, creating an
identity crisis. Users had to sign in separately for each Web site
to get personalized information. To get full access to
entertainment features like soap opera news, visitors had to go to
yet another Web site, NBC.com.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the NBCi portal different from others is a
downloadable search engine that allows users to click on any word
on any Web page and look up information about it on the Internet.
The portal also features technology that gives users more video
clips depending on the speed of their Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some analysts and industry competitors are
skeptical about whether NBC Internet is compelling enough to lure
visitors and advertisers. For now, NBC Internet is the No. 12 Web
property in terms of traffic, as ranked by Media Metrix, an online
ratings firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear what these guys are doing other than a
face-lift,'' said Ron Sege, executive vice president for the Web
portal Lycos, one of NBC Internet's bigger competitors. ``It just
looks like a redesign.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC Internet is counting on attracting visitors from NBC
television with content based on programs like ``Saturday Night
Live'' and ``West Wing.'' Television viewers will be referred to
the portal during programs to get more in-depth information, and
the company is starting a $50 million advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lansing, NBC Internet is abandoning the goal of
being a portal for the masses and will instead focus on 18-to-54
year olds, NBC television's core audience. Lansing added that his
company's priority is profitability, not gaining visitors at all
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The portal is clearly aimed at promoting NBC and its parent,
General Electric. News from the various NBC television channels are
featured prominently, as are advertisements for products like
General Electric appliances.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Internet was created in 1999 by NBC television to oversee
some of its online properties, including NBC.com and
AccessHollywood.com. It merged with Xoom.com, a community and
e-commerce Web site, and Snap.com, a search engine, in the hope of
competing with Yahoo, Microsoft and Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Internet, 39 percent owned by General Electric's NBC
television, has so far been a big money loser. The Web site could
not catch up to its rivals and some of its acquisitions, like
AllBusiness.com, a small-business portal, have underperformed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, NBC Internet's stock has been punished severely,
even by Internet standards. Shares have declined nearly 95 percent
from their high of nearly $106 in January to just over $6 on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   To augment its audience and revenue, NBC Internet says it will
expand its efforts to be the homepage for other companies that
offer free Web access. It is also deemphasizing its modest
international efforts and its small-business portal.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Andrews, an Internet industry analyst with Gartner Group
Inc., a market research firm in Stamford, Conn., said that NBC
Internet's troubles are a case of too little, too late. He said the
firm was launched after much of the Internet territory was already
conquered and that its executives, in the early stages, seemed to
be without a clear plan.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews added that NBC Internet will face a big challenge in its
bid for a successful rebirth. The company must overcome the media
mentality of appealing to a broad public _ targeting 18-to-54 year
olds is still quite broad, he said _ for one more appropriate for
the Internet: lots of small audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC has built its current identity around the notion of
must-see TV,'' Andrews said. ``That is not what the Internet is
about. It's about participation and collaboration with small
audiences.''

MUSIC SITES DISPENSE SOUND ADVICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   By BENNY EVANGELISTA
</P>
<P>
   &LR; c &LR; .2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of Internet technologies like MP3 and Napster
have given consumers more musical choices than ever. Yet sorting
through the plethora of music from known and unknown artists can be
as daunting as surfing the Web without a browser.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a new breed of online music companies has appeared,
offering technology designed to fill the role of a virtual record
store clerk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet sucks when it comes to music because it's content
overload,'' said John Adams, founder of San Francisco's Music
Buddha Inc., which uses short audio clips and a database to give
consumers a personalized song list.
</P>
<P>
   MuBu, for example, lets country music fans who are in the mood
for the Dixie Chicks' song ``Ready to Run'' also know about
12-year-old Billy Gilman's ``Little Things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is an emotional, visceral thing,'' Adams said. ``You
hear a great song and you want it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   MuBu is one of a number of Bay Area firms like MoodLogic Inc. of
San Francisco and Gigabeat Inc. of Redwood City that have developed
computerized music recommendation programs that analysts say could
carve out a hot niche within the growing online music industry.
</P>
<P>
   A recent deal by Microsoft may have validated that projection.
</P>
<P>
   The Redmond, Wash., software giant bought MongoMusic Inc. of
Redwood City earlier this month for a reported $65 million.
Microsoft plans to incorporate MongoMusic's music recommendation
engine and other search functions into its own WindowsMedia
technology and MSN Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers have access to more music than they know what to do
with,'' said analyst Aram Sinnreich of Jupiter Communications Inc.,
which projects the U.S. market for Internet music will grow to $5.4
billion by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is aiming toward providing the back end for music
subscription and Internet radio services,'' Sinnreich said.
</P>
<P>
   MuBu's Adams, one of the founders of early Internet radio
pioneer Imagine Radio, called the Microsoft-MongoMusic deal
``fantastic.'' He said it ``validates that intelligent music
recommendation'' is a valuable new tool to companies such as music
Web sites and record stores.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, music recommendation services allow music fans to
narrow down their choices of music with programs that filter music
through a database that includes information like genre, tempo,
personal taste, discographies and third-party reviews.
</P>
<P>
   MuBu, which launched in June, is a Web-based system that allows
users to select from genres ranging from ``hip-hop'' and
``electronic'' to ``soul food'' and ``spirit of women.'' The
technology sifts through various music characteristics and the
input of about two dozen music experts.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of reading music critiques or song lists compiled by
another person, Adams said the MuBu user just reacts to the music
by listening to short sound clips.
</P>
<P>
   From the reactions, MuBu produces a list of potential recordings
albums  &LR; and artists that might fit the user's particular mood and
suggests songs the user might not be familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a search for R&AMP;B vocals with a mix of flamenco and
``sexy sax'' turned up a recommendation for George Benson's ``El
Barrio'' along with pop-flamenco artist Ottmar Leibert's ``Heart
Still Beating.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the company said it had made the application
available for Palm VII and Palm V handheld computer owners. That
gives consumers the ability to go into a record store and check
their recommendation lists for specific songs instead of randomly
looking through ailes of CDs, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter Madsen, vice president of marketing for San Francisco's
MoodLogic, pointed to studies that show 60 percent of people who
walk into a record store leave empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   That shows ``they were hungry to buy something, to find
something new, but weren't able to find what they were in the mood
for,'' Madsen said. With music searching services helping out,
Madsen said, ``Our sense is that the $40 billion (worldwide) music
industry could be as much as twice that in revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   MoodLogic, which also went online in June and moved from its
original headquarters in a Hillsborough mansion last month, created
a ``MoodLogic Browser'' that can search a database of about 500,000
songs, including every Billboard Top 40 song since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people know what kind of music they feel like
listening to,'' Madsen said. ``It's a service that makes it easier
to find music they would like without having to know in advance
what that music is.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say it's too early to tell who might come up with the
big hits in the music recommendation niche.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter's Sinnreich said he has found some of the programs
flawed because they lack some of the ``human touch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I might like Joni Mitchell, but (the programs) might also tell
me I like Sarah McLachlan, and it would be dead wrong,'' Sinnreich
said.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Maclachlan, a media analyst for International Data
Corp., said some sites have different strengths that will appeal to
different people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think MuBu is actually one of the best, in that they work
off people's taste in specific songs,'' Maclachlan said. ``They
seem to do more work in stuff I like, especially electronica,
whereas Gigabeat's strength is more in pop rock.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``winners are going to be the companies who do the best job
of selling their info to record companies, who desperately want
more insight into consumer tastes,'' he said. ``That will probably
be a more reliable source of income than advertising or e-commerce
affiliate fees.''
</P>
<P>
   But Adams said developing the trust of consumers is ``our No. 1
priority,'' and selling information about customers is ``not part
of our revenue model.''

WIRELESS NET ACCESS SPEEDS UP (COLUMN) &HT;    By HENRY NORR
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   An announcement last week from Metricom Inc. marked a milestone
in the history of data communications in the Bay Area and beyond:
For the first time, wireless Internet access is available at high
speeds here.
</P>
<P>
   At 128 kilobits per second, the Los Gatos company's newly
enhanced Ricochet service is more than twice as fast as a
conventional modem _ and more than 10 times the speed of other
wide-area wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   The company also rolled out the high-speed service in Baltimore,
Dallas, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix and, on a limited basis,
Manhattan. Atlanta and San Diego have had it since June. Seattle
and Washington, D.C., as well as 15 airports and various university
campuses across the country also have Ricochet service, although
for now those areas are still limited to a nominal 28 Kbps.
</P>
<P>
   Metricom's plan goes a long way toward solving the two big
problems with the old Ricochet service. With coverage in only three
metropolitan areas, it wasn't something most mobile professionals
could count on as an overall solution for Internet access on the
road. And with actual throughput of no more than 22 or 23 Kbps _ at
least in my experience as a Ricochet subscriber of more than two
years' standing _ it was adequate for e-mail but barely tolerable
for surfing a Web that's increasingly laden with ads, graphics,
animation and other bandwidth-devouring doodads.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the new service brings a new problem: price. The
old Ricochet was $29.95 a month, a rate that struck me as fairly
reasonable, even though I didn't use the service most days. But the
new plan, offered through several service providers, will be priced
about $70 per month.
</P>
<P>
   That rate, obviously, will limit the market severely _ aside
from Internet millionaires with nothing else to do with their
money, I think only salespeople and others who really need constant
access to online data will be able to justify the price.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's the opening of a new era, and it puts Metricom at
least 18 to 24 months ahead of the big boys in telecommunications.
It'll be interesting to see whether they &LR;   &LR; can capitalize on the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   BRAVE NEW WORLD: Meanwhile, eager entrepreneurs keep thinking of
clever new things to do with mobile phones. Consider this sampling
of initiatives just from the last few weeks:
</P>
<P>
   Handspring, as you probably saw last week, finally announced the
long-awaited phone module for its Visor line of Palm OS-based
personal digital assistants. Considering its $299 price _ not
counting the cost of Visor itself _ and its dependence on a network
(GSM, or Global System for Mobile communications) that's relatively
undeveloped in the United States, I'm not sure how successful the
VisorPhone will be. But even if unit volumes are limited, the
device could go a long way toward popularizing phone-based text
messaging in the United States. (It's already one of the hottest
technology trends in Europe and Japan.)
</P>
<P>
   And if it succeeds, it's bound to inspire a new wave of
competing phone-PDA hybrids. Early efforts in this direction _
IBM's Simon, the Nokia 9000 Communicator and Qualcomm's pdQ _ were
so clunky and overpriced, they gave the idea a bad name.
</P>
<P>
   But once users see how much easier it is to do messaging on a
device like the Visor _ with a relatively large screen, handwriting
recognition and onscreen soft keyboards _ than on a conventional
phone with just a 12-key dial pad, I bet both users and vendors
will be willing to take a second look. I'll bet Motorola's
disclosure today of a deal with Palm won't be the last such
alliance this year.
</P>
<P>
   LightSurf Technologies of Santa Cruz, the latest venture of
longtime tech heavyweight Philippe Kahn, showed off its first
product at this month's DemoMobile 2000 conference in Pasadena: a
thumb-sized digital camera that clipped on to a next-generation
phone from Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Using a patent-pending wireless acceleration technology and
back-end image-management system, the phone quickly transmitted
images from the camera and automatically posted them on a special
Web site where they could be viewed and downloaded by anyone with a
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Here again, the United States is merely beginning to catch up
with Japan, where similar devices are apparently already a
sensation. My own  &LR; guess is that the idea won't take off here until
the wireless phone networks offer significantly greater bandwidth,
but with luck that should happen in a couple of years _ especially
if Metricom starts to put some real competitive pressure on the
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   FunMail, a startup in Pleasanton, Calif., is developing an
``animated instant messaging'' service for I-Mode. Users send a
short text message to the FunMail Web site ( &LR; www.funmail.com &LR; ),
where a ``text-to-animation engine'' automatically generates a
cartoon-like sequence based on key words in the text; once the
sender approves, the text and animation are sent together to the
intended recipient, either on another I-Mode phone or on any
browser-equipped computer.
</P>
<P>
   The service is already available (and about to enjoy a major
upgrade) for desktop computer users, and company officials say
they'll have it running before long on additional phone formats.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia, the Finnish phone giant, introduced a new GSM phone
called the 3310, which features extended support for online chat
(including built-in libraries of pictures and smiley icons),
graphical ``screen savers,'' four built-in games and a new feature
that makes the phone vibrate at critical moments in game play.
</P>
<P>
   RealTimeTouch, a division of Design Systems Research and
Development in Alpine (San Diego County), went Nokia one better _
conceptually, at least _ with word of technology it says will
enable wireless devices to ``send and receive instantaneous,
person-to-person touch transmissions.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, according to the news release, ``a husband and wife
who have been notified of a crisis (might) speak to each other via
cellular telephone. In order to reassure his wife, the husband
squeezes his phone. His wife immediately feels her husband's touch
as the phone expands in her hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's Web site ( &LR; www.realtimetouch.com &LR; ) takes this idea
_ for which RealTimeTouch says it has patents pending in more than
100 countries _ considerably further. Among other descriptions of
possible applications of the technology, it says business owners
could seal deals by shaking each other's cell phones; teen idols
could virtually ``hold the eager, outstretched hands of their
excited fans''; and politicians and religious leaders could
``convey trust and sincerity (by) touching millions of viewers
during interactive television, Web-based, and live performances.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology, according to the company, could even
``revolutionize current military strategies'' and health care,
possibly making ``the difference between life and death for an
infant'' starved for physical attention.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke to Craig Linden, CEO of RealTimeTouch, who explained
that all this would begin with phones that, like the Nokia 3310,
simply have programmable vibrators. The next step, he said, will be
adding special transducers that expand or contract parts of the
phone on receipt of a coded ``touch transmission.'' Then would come
new devices capable of much more varied and extensive movements _
for example, remote-controlled teddy bears, physical-therapy
devices and military machines. In effect, they'd be
phone-controlled robots.
</P>
<P>
   Linden even has a trademark on the term ``CyberHugs.'' The
imagination runs wild ...
</P>
<P>
   TIME TRAVEL: Yesterday marked an important date for commuters to
or from the Peninsula and the South Bay, not to mention Giants fans
from those areas: Caltrain made major changes to its schedule,
adding 10 new trains on weekdays and four on Saturdays. To
``improve reliability'' _ that is, to give you a slightly more
realistic idea of how long your trip will really take _ the agency
is also adding four to eight minutes to the weekday San Jose-to-San
Francisco timetable and a whopping 25 minutes on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, even if you're a regular rider (as I used to
be), the schedule information you carry in your head probably isn't
much good anymore, and at least for a while most users will be
checking the new timetable frequently. Caltrain will be happy to
give it to you on paper, but if you don't have it yet or don't want
to carry one more document, technology can help.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true for owners of Palm handhelds, thanks to a
local programmer named Rob Barnes: He has ust updated his nifty
little Caltrain Schedule app, which will show you arrival and
departure times for any two stops you select.
</P>
<P>
   The program is free, and the new version takes up just 23
kilobytes of memory, only a third as much as the old one. You can
download it from Baynes' personal site
( &LR; www.members.home.net/rbaynes/palm/ &LR; ) or from Palm Gear H.Q., the
leading online library for Palm OS software ( &LR; www.palmgear.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   If you're into this sort of thing, check back regularly for
updates _ Baynes has plans to add lots of new features.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Gear also has a Caltrain map in a format you can display on
your Palm, provided you've installed FireViewer (formerly Image
Viewer) _ just search for ``caltrain map.'' Be careful, though,
about another schedule app called CalTrain 1.2: Its database is now
out-of-date, and author Anand Rajaraman says he can't spare the
time to update it (though he'll make his source code available if
someone else wants to).
</P>
<P>
   BART riders, by the way, can also keep that system's timetable
in hand with BART Scheduler, a Palm OS program by Mike Wittman. It
has some nice extras, such as an option to show only trains that
allow bikes. It's at Palm Gear, too, or at Wittman's site
( &LR; www.cs.berkeley.edu/wittman/bart-scheduler/ &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   An aside: The availability of so much specialized software like
this is one of the best arguments for the Palm platform _ the
Pocket PC camp is going to have a hard time catching up even if its
hardware is superior. Just this month Palm said its count of
registered developers has topped 100,000. Microsoft won't say how
many developers have committed to Windows CE, but it's clear that
the number is only a small fraction of Palm's total.
</P>
<P>
   On the transportation front, though, you're not out of luck even
if you don't have a Palm or compatible device _ with a PC, a Mac, a
Pocket PC or (presumably) anything else with a Web browser, you can
find the new Caltrain timetable, plus schedules for dozens of other
Bay Area transportation services, at  &LR; www.transitinfo.org &LR; , a
convenient central site supported by the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission. For hard-core schedule junkies, the site
even lets you sign up for e-mail alerts about future timetable
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The slickest high-tech schedule service is reserved for riders
of the Muni's five Metro lines and the 22-Fillmore trolley bus, as
well as Emeryville's Emery-go-Round shuttle service. An Emeryville
company called NextBus Information Systems runs a site
( &LR; www.nextbus.com &LR; ) that estimates when the next bus will arrive at
the stop you select, based on actual, real-time location
information transmitted from GPS devices installed on the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   As The Chronicle's Ed Epstein reported last month, the free
service is now available not only on conventional Web browsers, but
also on mobile phones with Internet and text-messaging
capabilities, on the Palm VII and Palm V devices with OmniSky
wireless modems and on selected two-way pagers, including Research
in Motion's Blackberry line.

BAR CODE SCANNER FOR WEB ADDRESSES UNDER SCRUTINY BY PRIVACY GROUPS
<TEXT>
<P>
   By TODD WALLACK
</P>
<P>
   &LR; c &LR; .2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
</P>
<P>
   Privacy watchdogs are raising alarms about a new bar code
reader, called the CueCat, that is designed to make it easy for
readers to scan in Web addresses printed in magazines and
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said that they are concerned the device could
potentially be used to track every Web site that people visit. Each
CueCat contains a unique serial number that is transmitted to the
device's maker, DigitalConvergence, whenever the user swipes a bar
code to access a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers plan to include the codes in ads and articles in
Forbes, the Dallas Morning News, Wired and other publications.
DigitalConvergence has disclosed plans to distribute 10 million of
the readers by year-end and says 400,000 are already being used.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking the company to fix the service now, before it is
in widespread use,'' said Richard Smith, chief technology officer
of the Privacy Foundation, in an advisory.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates are especially worried about the devices
because DigitalConvergence usually has the names and e-mail
addresses of all the people who receive the devices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, when users fill out the registration form, users
are also asked to give out their age, gender and ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   But DigitalConvergence Chief Executive Officer Michael Garin
said the privacy concerns are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   First, Garin said, the company destroys any record of the users'
names and e-mail addresses when they register their devices. (The
company does keep users' ZIP code, gender and age, however, to help
direct users to more specific Web pages.)
</P>
<P>
   Second, Garin insisted that DigitalConvergence doesn't record
which Web sites users visit. Unlike Internet advertising agencies
such as DoubleClick, Garin said, DigitalConvergence isn't trying to
build profiles of individual users.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Garin called the company a ``look-up service.''
</P>
<P>
   When customers scan in a bar code, DigitalConvergence
automatically plugs the right address into their Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Yet instead of sending everyone to the same Web page, the
company uses its information about each customer to direct them to
more specific sites.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, men who scan in a bar code for a Macy's ad might
be whisked off to a page on ties, while women are sent to one on
bras. Or people looking for election information might be sent to a
page customized for their town or county.
</P>
<P>
   Garin said the company wanted to use unique serial numbers to
have a precise count of how many people were using the devices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Privacy Foundation recommended the company stop using
the unique serial numbers to ease worries that the firm could track
users' movements. In addition, the Denver nonprofit urged
DigitalConvergence to give more information to users about how it
plans to use the data it collects.

MOTOROLA, PALM PLAN SMART PHONES
<TEXT>
<P>
   By HENRY NORR
</P>
<P>
   &LR; c &LR; .2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, the largest U.S. cellular phone manufacturer, and
Palm, pioneer developer of handheld electronic organizers, are
pooling their talents to develop ``smart'' mobile phones with Palm
software built in.
</P>
<P>
   The first fruit of their collaboration will be a co-branded
phone expected to reach the market in early 2002, at a price as yet
undetermined. Its shape will be more like a phone than like current
Palm devices, officials of the two companies said. It will have a
color screen that's larger than the displays on most phones today,
but smaller than those on handheld organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Built-in software will include Palm's Graffiti
handwriting-recognition system and its suite of
personal-information-management applications, such as its
electronic address book and calendar, plus new programs designed to
integrate voice communication into the Palm environment. In
addition to Palm's HotSync system for sharing data with desktop
computers, it will use TrueSync technology developed by Motorola's
Starfish subsidiary for over-the-air synchronization.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of look and feel, both Palm users and users of
Motorola phones will feel right at home,'' said Leif Soderberg,
senior vice president and head of strategy for Motorola's personal
communications sector.
</P>
<P>
   The initial phone will be a ``tri-band GSM'' device that will
work with both the U.S. and international variants of the digital
Global System for Mobile communications as well as older analog
networks. It will support General Packet Radio Service, a
higher-speed, packet-based extension to GSM, designed to facilitate
Internet access, that is being rolled out in Europe this year.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola won't be the first or the last company to offer a
hybrid phone incorporating Palm's software. Qualcomm introduced one
called the pdQ last year, but it has reportedly sold slowly,
apparently because of its high price ($799), large size and heavy
weight (9.8 ounces). In today's statement, Palm and Motorola said
their new phone will preserve the ``compact form factor of today's
mobile phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Finnish phone giant Nokia has also licensed the Palm OS for use
in future phones. Meanwhile, both Motorola and Nokia continue to
support the development of Symbian, a new operating system for
smart phones.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Palm announced plans with Hong Kong's RealVision on
Friday for a snap-on ``sled'' that will add GSM phone capabilities
to the popular Palm V and Vx handhelds. The product is expected to
be available early next year for less than $299 when purchased with
a one-year service contract.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Palm licensee Handspring unveiled a GSM phone module
for its Visor organizers.

NEWS STORIES ABOUT TINKERING WITH DNA MISS THE BIG PICTURE (COLUMN) &HT;    By TOM ABATE
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biotechnology has been erupting onto the news pages lately, but
somehow the headlines seem to highlight the trivial while missing
the profound ways in which we've taken it upon ourselves to reshape
life.
</P>
<P>
   A quick survey of last week's headlines includes:
</P>
<P>
   -- Kraft Foods' recall of taco shells that contain traces of a
bioengineered corn. The feed was approved for consumption by
cattle, not for humans, and the misdirected corn prompted a public
outcry.
</P>
<P>
   -- Then there was the story about the artist who persuaded a
French laboratory to splice fluorescent genes from a jellyfish into
a rabbit embryo. The altered embryo was planted in a female rabbit,
which gave birth to a bunny that glows in the dark, just like a
jellyfish.
</P>
<P>
   -- Finally, there came the advisory report, two years in the
making, that urged scientists not to do gene-splicing experiments
on human sperm or egg cells. The thrust of the recommendation was
to forgo any attempt to ``improve'' human inheritance, at least for
now.
</P>
<P>
   The common thread in all three stories is the almost magical
fact that DNA is a universal software code. From bacteria to
humans, the basic instructions for life are written with the same
language.
</P>
<P>
   This fact has become evident in recent years as scientists have
unravelled and compared the DNA of various creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when researchers decoded the DNA of the fruit
fly, they noted enormous similarities between fly and human genes.
We're even more closely related to the mouse _ scientists think
about 90 percent of our genes are similar. It is that extra 10
percent that allows  &LR; us &LR;  to keep  &LR; them &LR;  in cages.
</P>
<P>
   Even more amazing is the fact that DNA is interchangeable
between species. A piece of DNA extracted from a human can be made
to perform its function inside a bacterium, &LR;  and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA record suggests that this interchangeability has been a
driving force in evolution. Once DNA has found the code to create
blood or brain cells, for instance, all future organisms adapted
and embellished on this code rather than having to rewrite it. DNA
is the swiss army knife that's always on the lookout to add a nifty
new attachment.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to cut DNA from one organism and splice it into
another is the foundation of biotechnology. It is the process that
allowed the French scientists to create a glowing bunny. In theory,
they could have used the same technique to create a glowing human
baby.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to cut and paste DNA between different organisms is
called recombinant DNA technology. When Bay Area biologists Herbert
Boyer and Stanley Cohen first performed this trick in the early
1970s, scientists were so awed by the power that they declared a
moratorium on such experiments until they'd had a chance to think
through the ramifications of recombinant DNA techniques.
</P>
<P>
   In time, however, the awe wore off, the moratorium ended and
scientists started looking for ways to cut and paste DNA in useful
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics should celebrate the fact that they went ahead.
Recombinant DNA techniques made it possible to splice the gene for
human insulin into bacteria. When the bacteria grew, they produced
human insulin, becoming factories to make a drug safe for human
use. Previously, human diabetics had to inject themselves with
insulin derived from the pancreatic tissue of pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward a couple of decades. Our power to hack into life's
software code has advanced dramatically. Today, high schoolers can
perform the experiments that earned Boyer and Cohen great fame.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid acceleration in biotech is due in no small part to the
fact that we've harnessed bioscience to profits. In the early days
of recombinant DNA technology, scientists generally stood at arm's
length from industry. Nowadays, we encourage scientists to
commercialize their work (see Aug. 21 BioScope).
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the market is the main arbiter for deciding which
biotechnologies gain wide use. It should make us uncomfortable to
think that our course is being set by the invisible hand.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of profit-driven biotechnology has manifested itself first
and foremost in the furor over genetically altered foods. It's one
thing to take a bioengineered drug. You know what you're getting
and why.
</P>
<P>
   Neither condition is true with the present generation of
bioengineered foods. They're not labeled, so a person hasn't got a
choice of whether or not to eat them. And for the most part, the
current modifications were made to benefit farmers, not consumers.
When biotechnologists spliced in genes for pest resistance, it may
have boosted crop yields but it did nothing for me.
</P>
<P>
   I do find it odd, however, that opposition to biotechnology has
fixated almost exclusively on grains when bioscientists make a
daily practice of redesigning animals. I'm not just talking about
the glowing bunny, a public stunt that at least makes us think.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, every day, in thousands of laboratories, scientists
remove genes from experimental mice and rats to see what happens.
Or they add genes to these same rodents and observe the results.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, a scientist at Princeton University said he had
inserted an extra copy of the gene for a certain brain receptor
into a mouse nick-named Doogie. As a result, Doogie seemed to be
better at remembering its way through mazes. Articles hailed this
as a step toward creating drugs or genetic alterations to improve
memory in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Step by step, we have developed a godlike power to redesign
life, without slowing down to attain the godlike wisdom to use it.
In the same way that we first orbited the Earth before setting off
for the moon, we are building the confidence and boldness to
redesign our own software.
</P>
<P>
   No responsible scientist would advocate this today. In fact, a
report issued last week by a panel sponsored by the American
Association for the Advancement of Science said we should in no way
try to affect human inheritance ``without proper oversight and
until questions of ethics, efficacy, and safety have been
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   And so we race ahead, almost blind. We have a map of the human
genome, but we have no map that tells us where all this knowledge
is taking us.

USC NOT HAPPY DESPITE GAINING IN POLLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC moved up a notch in the Top 25 polls Sunday,
but the Trojans gained little else over the weekend. Their 34-24
victory over San Jose State was more about what they didn't lose
rather than what they gained.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't lose face. Or their dignity. Well, not all of it
anyway. And not enough to drop in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, USC realized how close it came to having its
entire season self-destruct in a game that was circled on the
schedule as being its easiest victory. So much for that theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to take it upon ourselves as seniors to get it
together this week,'' said senior linebacker Zeke Moreno. ``We need
a gut-check.''
</P>
<P>
   That figures to come Saturday when eighth-ranked USC travels to
Corvallis, Ore., to play Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   USC (3-0) has beaten three teams with a combined record of 3-9.
Now comes the first true road game against the undefeated Beavers
(3-0). Do you think Dennis Erickson will have his team ready?
</P>
<P>
   For the Trojans, some massive self-examination should be in
order, especially considering they were losing by 12 points to San
Jose State in the fourth quarter. The Spartans didn't even have
their best player, tailback Deonce Whitaker, who was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to give us a grade, we played on a 'C' level,'' USC
wide receiver Kareem Kelly said. ``We were out of sync. We didn't
come with our 'A' game. We were fortunate to pull out a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems almost laughable that USC players were talking about
winning the national championship two or three weeks ago, based on
the way the Trojans performed against the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played terrible on both sides of the ball,'' defensive
tackle Ennis Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, USC won. Credit quarterback Carson Palmer for that. He
might not be sharp every snap, but he's got a tremendous capacity
for pulling out a late victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got more heart and we're in better shape than last
year,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   They also have Palmer this year, something they didn't have at
this stage a year ago. His presence alone won't be enough to thrive
in the Pac-10, though. Thanks to his heroics, the lofty season
goals remain in place today, but for how much longer?
</P>
<P>
   __ The kicking game needs to be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   __ The punt team was in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   __ The defensive line was almost nonexistent at times.
</P>
<P>
   __ The secondary was shaky.
</P>
<P>
   __ Four different players fumbled against San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Clock-management problems apparent against Colorado
continued.
</P>
<P>
   Can all this be fixed in time for Saturday's game?
</P>
<P>
   It better be or the Rose Bowl hopes will take a major hit.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, USC had less penalty yards (79) than the
Spartans (72).
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm concerned. But most importantly, the guys in that
room are concerned,'' said USC coach Paul Hackett, referring to the
locker room full of players. ``I think we were all embarrassed in
the first half. We just were not sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   One popular theory for the sluggish effort was having two byes
in the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's the bye week. It puts you on your
heels,'' Moreno said. ``It just goes to show you can't take anybody
lightly. Guys weren't ready to play in all points of the game.'' &QL;

There were a couple of dropped passes and a costly fumble, but they

Here's a key stat: San Jose State attempted 41 passes, but

SPECIAL TEAMS &QL;

   &QL; 
OK, a bye can pose a problem. But the Trojans sure didn't seem

close to imploding in what was supposed to be the easiest game on
the schedule. Someone has to take the blame. &QL;

EDITORIAL: BETTER NURUHED 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 25:
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton walked into a room filled with the old
people who live at the Washington Home, in the District of
Columbia, on a recent Saturday, Alice Gavin, who is 105, stood up.
It was, she thought, the respectful thing to do, and Clinton was
about to deliver his weekly radio address, proposing a package of
federal grants, punishments and rewards to try to improve the
quality of care in the nation's nursing homes. He called for a
billion dollars in new federal grants to hire more health care
workers and better train them so each resident would have at least
two hours of individual care each day.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement came as a surprise. The Clinton administration
has a record of toughening the standards and inspections of nursing
homes, and it recently issued a report that showed what anyone in
health care has long known good care is a function of the number of
people available and trained to give it. The fewer nurses and
nurses' aides on staff, the less individual attention the 1.6
million frail elderly residents get, the more bedsores,
malnutrition, abnormal weight loss and depression they suffer, and,
in all probability, the faster they die. There are no federal
requirements for staff-patient ratios, but 54 percent of homes, the
report found, are understaffed to the point that residents do not
get the minimal two hours of care by nurses' aides per day
necessary to keep them from being endangered.
</P>
<P>
   The president could have let that study by the Health Care
Financing Administration simply feed the bipartisan interest in
passing some kind of nursing home support bill in the few weeks
before this session of Congress ends. He has chosen instead to try
to shape that debate, and he has focused on the single most
important element for the welfare of the vulnerable, often indigent
older women who make up most of the nursing home population. He is
right to do so. Congress, which spends $39 billion a year on
nursing home care, seems inclined to restore some of the Medicare
funds it cut three years ago, in part because six of the nation's
largest for-profit nursing home chains have gone bankrupt as those
cuts have taken effect in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring the Medicare money might improve the financial health
of those chains, and if Congress also restored the Medicare funds
cut from home health care, more older Americans might be able to
remain in their own homes. That is desirable. Most people do not
need or want to be in nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that touches the issue of inadequate staff. The
study reported that good care requires 4.5 hours per resident per
day. Congress needs to mandate staff ratios and be willing to help
pay for them. Enough staff to meet the standard of two hours of
care a day is a worthwhile start. Congress should also instruct the
Health Care Financing Administration to arrive at meaningful
long-term staff ratios within two years to ensure quality care for
all the residents of nursing homes. Gavin still bathes and dresses
and feeds herself, but most residents of nursing homes need a lot
more help than she does.

TV INTRODUCES ITS NEW FALL SEASON OF WEB SITES  
 SURPRISING GEOGRAPHY OF AMERICA'S DIGITAL DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it is because they are used to a new season in the fall.
But the Internet services that are tied to big television networks
seem to be picking this month to showcase new versions of their
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Walt Disney's Go.com, which incorporates sites
related to its ABC and ESPN networks, introduced a complete
redesign. And on Monday, NBC Internet, a company partly owned by
General Electric's NBC network, will introduce its new flagship
NBCi.com. The site brings together under one name the features from
a jumble of brands that the company built and bought, including
Snap, Xoom and NBC.com. (The MSNBC news site and the CNBC financial
news site are separate.)
</P>
<P>
   While neither Go.com nor the NBCi sites have been able to keep
pace with the growth of the very largest Internet portals _ America
Online, Yahoo and Microsoft's MSN _ they are coping in very
different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Go is trying to squeeze more from less. It has stripped down the
site to little more than a search engine while increasing the size
and number of advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   NBCi, by contrast, continues to add features and technology in
order to try to beat the bigger portals at their own game.
</P>
<P>
   ``People spend a lot of time on Yahoo,'' said Edmond Sanctis,
NBCi's president, noting that the greater the number of pages seen,
the more ads are sold. ``We got a lot of people to try us as a
search engine, but we never got people to stay. We want to go from
an average of three or four pages per visit to eight pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most of the site's new initiatives appear to be copied
from Yahoo.com. Its advertising urges users to customize NBCi to
their personal taste, much as the popular My Yahoo feature does.
</P>
<P>
   And just as Yahoo offers free Internet access through Kmart,
NBCi is making a similar offer through Montgomery Ward. NBCi has
also introduced a free software program that lets users search the
Web even when they are not on its site. And yes, Yahoo also has its
own search software.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, NBCi says its products will be different from and
better than the competition. Its personalization software, for
example, will aim to learn as much about each user as possible so
that searches are more fruitful. A user in Britain, say, would get
a different result of a search on ``football'' from someone in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   _ SAUL HANSELL
</P>
<P>
   Surprising Geography of America's Digital Divide
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the digital divide is still more like a gaping hole, with
nearly half of the U.S. population lacking access to the Internet.
But a surprising new study says that families with lower incomes
and less education, once they log on to their home computers, on
average spend a lot more time there than do others.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nielsen/NetRatings, people earning $21,000 to
$33,000, typically in blue-collar, farming or service fields, with
a high school education at most, spent the most time online in June
_ 11 to 12 hours, compared with the national average of nine hours.
The people who spent the least amount of time online in June were
those with an income range of $53,000 to $136,000.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy O'Neill, group manager and senior analyst at NetRatings,
said much of the disparity can be attributed to the fact that
blue-collar workers, in factories and service jobs, for example, do
not have access to the Internet at work. Higher-income office
workers can log onto the Web during the day, reducing the need to
go online once they are home.
</P>
<P>
   The study uses a target marketing system known as Prizm, which
classifies U.S. households into 62 neighborhood clusters, composed
of racial and socioeconomic types, and applies a label to each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there is still a digital divide; minorities are still
underrepresented on the Internet,'' O'Neill said. ``But when lower
socioeconomic groups get online, they do find sites relevant to
them and spend a disproportionate amount of time there.'' She said
this indicated that the Web offered a more diverse set of services
than some people might think.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed that a lower-income cluster centered in the
South spent an average of 12.6 hours online in June. That cluster
is characterized as predominantly black, blue-collar laborers with
a median income of $20,500. A cluster made up of Hispanic Americans
with a median income of $32,600 spent an average of 11.4 hours
online.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed differences in the kinds of sites people
visited from home.
</P>
<P>
   Those people who spend the most time online use entertainment
and shopping sites like Walmart.com and Emazing.com, while more
affluent users spend more of their online time visiting finance
sites like Schwab.com and TheStreet.com.

YANKS BEAT TIGERS, 6-3, FOR PETTITTE'S 100TH 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two New York Yankees did the tango in the spotlight
all afternoon Sunday against the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Andy Pettitte percolated with emotion as he sought his
19th victory and 100th career victory, forgetting the struggles of
last season when he was nearly traded before the trading deadline.
Tino Martinez, a slugger who has struggled this year, was merely
looking for a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre had faith in both, and they rewarded him.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez blasted out of a 1-for-33 slump with two two-run home
runs that lifted the Yankees to a 6-3 triumph over Detroit, helping
Pettitte reach the century mark in his six-year career with the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte struck out five batters through seven and a third
innings, and he picked off a runner in the fifth. In the seventh,
he speared a speeding-bullet line drive and then spun around on his
knees, whipping the ball across his body to Martinez. He slammed
his glove on his leg when the first-base umpire, Jerry Meals, ruled
Martinez was off the bag to prevent a double play, showing how
important this victory was to Pettitte, if not the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little more emotional for this one,'' said Pettitte
(19-8), who has one start left in the regular season. ``You try to
get keyed up for certain things, try to turn it up a little bit.
There was more emphasis going for the 100th.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in nearly two weeks, the Yankees have won two
in a row, distancing themselves from their six-game losing streak
and shaving their number to clinch the American League East to
three after Toronto lost Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy was terrific today,'' Torre said. ``I don't think the
priority for him was win the 100th win, he wanted to help us win a
pennant. It was a good game for him, for us, because we put two
wins back to back.''
</P>
<P>
   The 41,415 fans watching the final regular-season day game at
Yankee Stadium gave two standing ovations: when Pettitte came out
of the game for reliever Jeff Nelson with a 4-3 lead and one out in
the eighth inning, and when Martinez ran out to the field in the
top of the ninth after his eighth-inning heroics.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs and a full count, and with Jorge Posada on first,
Martinez crushed a two-run home run to the upper deck off reliever
C.J. Nitkowski that gave the Yankees a three-run cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Three outs later, Martinez caught a soft liner to end the game
and conveyed the souvenir to Pettitte through the closer Mariano
Rivera, who came in for the ninth to earn his 36th save. In his
third start since Sept. 9, Pettitte finally secured No. 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm a pretty good pitcher, and I feel like I play
for a really good team with a really good bullpen and it makes me
look a little bit better,'' Pettitte said. ``I may not dominate
like some pitchers do.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but Pettitte's 88 victories from 1996, when he went
21-8, to this year are the third most in the major leagues during
the five-year span.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get a whole lot of attention paid to him, but he
certainly has been consistent,'' Torre said. ``For a year, he was
spotty, and you look up and he still wins ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   After starting the season 7-8 last year (he finished 14-11),
Pettitte knew Torre had to persuade management to keep him. ``I
wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him,'' Pettitte said. ``They were
set on getting rid of me. I wouldn't have been able to have done
what I've done if not for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre has supported Martinez, too, dropping him to seventh in
the batting order, but keeping him in the lineup through his
0-for-28 streak without a hit. In the four years Martinez has been
with the Yankees, he has had no fewer than 25 home runs a season,
with 44 in 1997 and 28 each of the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't forget what he's done in the past,'' Torre said. ``I
told him, `You're going to play every day. When we clinch this
thing, then we'll rest.' He has been a big part of what we've done
here since I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez got his 15th home run of the season in the second
inning. Bernie Williams had already led off with a solo shot that
marked a career-best 30 home runs. After Posada singled to right,
Martinez delivered his home run a few rows back of the right-field
wall for a 3-0 Yankees lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the season, I think I was trying too hard to hit home
runs and I was overswinging for a while there,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte was also trying too hard at times Sunday. Perfect
through two and two-thirds innings, he gave up a walk to Shane
Halter, who scored, despite stumbling, on Jose Macias' triple. The
Yankees got another run in the sixth when Derek Jeter singled to
lead off the inning and scored on a wild pitch. But with a 4-1
lead, Pettitte fell into trouble in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Pettitte snared a liner from Brad Ausmus. On the
double-play attempt, Martinez said his foot was on the bag at
first, but the umpire did not see it. Pettitte gave up a single and
then a triple to Halter that made the score 4-3. But Martinez
ensured Pettitte's 100th victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we righted the ship, and we're playing with a lot
more confidence right now,'' Torre said.

JOHNSON TAUNTS, BUT CHREBET HAS FINAL SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ One hour before Sunday's game, Keyshawn Johnson
and Wayne Chrebet stood little more than 10 yards apart, warming up
side by side in silence, refusing even to meet each other's gaze.
Chrebet wore headphones as he caught passes, the better to insulate
himself from the final moments of a week of noise and needling he
had taken from Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But with 52 seconds remaining in Sunday's game between the Jets
and Tampa Bay, Johnson could only gawk at Chrebet. His sworn
nemesis, the flashlight to his star, had just leaped in the back of
the end zone to catch a wobbly 18-yard halfback option pass from
Curtis Martin that gave the Jets their second touchdown in the
final 2 minutes, completing the Jets' third comeback in the fourth
quarter in four games and pushing them to a stunning 21-17 upset of
the Buccaneers. The Jets are now 4-0 going into their bye week and,
with this shocker over a team considered a Super Bowl favorite,
they have established themselves _ one-quarter of the way through
the season _ as contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of 46 flashlights can be pretty bright sometimes,''
Coach Al Groh said, referring to the number of players on his
gritty team while taking a none-too-subtle dig at Johnson. ``We've
been through these before. We say, `The hotter the fire, the harder
the steel.'''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who caught just one pass for 1 yard, shook his head and
his face was fixed with disgust as the Jets bench erupted and
Chrebet ran off the field. The Jets defense, which gave the offense
the chance for the comeback when Marvin Jones stripped running back
Mike Alstott as he rumbled into a pile with 1 minute 48 seconds
left and the Bucs leading by 3 points, sealed the victory when the
rookie defensive end John Abraham sacked Bucs quarterback Shaun
King and caused the fumble that Bryan Cox recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good,'' Johnson said at the end. ``There's more drama
for your papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare would have trouble crafting this much drama in a
four-week span. The chance of such an emotional comeback seemed
remote with 10 minutes remaining. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who
was enduring a painful return to Tampa, had just thrown his third
interception of the day. The second, late in the third quarter, had
been returned 37 yards by Ronde Barber for a touchdown that gave
the Bucs a 17-6 lead. With one of the most fearsome defenses in the
league, one that had held the Jets to just 191 yards in total
offense in the first three quarters, the lead seemed
insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   And so, after the defense forced the Bucs to punt after just
three plays, Groh put Ray Lucas, the backup quarterback, into the
game, much to the surprise of Testaverde. Groh merely wanted to
give Testaverde a breather and said he never had any intention of
benching him for the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vinny is our guy,'' Groh said. ``When you're in big-time
competition, you put the ball in the hands of your big-time
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde was suffering through another subpar performance. He
admitted this week that rust from his year-long layoff has caused
his slow starts and that he was having trouble reading some
defenses. Sunday, Testaverde looked no better. Near the end of the
first half, the Jets blew two touchdown opportunities, when
Testaverde put no zip on a pass to Fred Baxter, who sloppily
stepped out of bounds for an incompletion that, had the ball been
caught in bounds, would have been an easy touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   John Hall kicked his second field goal to pull the Jets to 10-6,
and when Victor Green intercepted a King pass, the Jets had the
ball on the Bucs' 20-yard line with 42 seconds remaining in the
half. But on second and eight, Testaverde lofted a pass intended
for Martin, never looking anywhere else. Safety Damien Robinson
read the play and stepped in front of Martin for the drive-killing
interception, Testaverde's first.
</P>
<P>
   But Testaverde has been extraordinary in the fourth quarter this
season. He engineered two scoring drives in the fourth quarter
against Green Bay, and threw two touchdown passes to Chrebet in the
final 6:30 against New England. So after the defense, which held
the Bucs to 239 yards in offense and its vaunted running game to
just 119 yards, forced the Bucs to punt again, Testaverde came
loping back out with 5:01 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the fourth quarter belongs to me,'' he said. ``What the
team went through a year ago, the mental toughness we gained last
year, has paid off in the fourth quarter this year.''
</P>
<P>
   He drove the Jets from their 36-yard line. On second and goal
from the 6-yard line, on the first play after the two-minute
warning, he sent a screen pass to Martin on the left side, who then
broke two tackles to scoot into the end zone. The Jets went for a
two-point conversion and, after rookie receiver Laveranues Coles _
who had earlier caught the first ball of his pro career _ caught a
tipped pass in the back of the end zone for the completion, the
Jets trailed 17-14 with 1:54 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs, not surprisingly, put the ball in the hands of the
locomotive of a fullback, the 248-pound Alstott. He ran the ball
for three yards and the Jets used a timeout to stop the clock. On
second down, Alstott tumbled into a pile. Jones went for the ball
and Green came out with it. On came Testaverde again from the
24-yard line. He handed off to Martin once for six yards. The Jets
had practiced this play and Martin had, in Chrebet's description,
thrown the ball terribly. But offensive coordinator Dan Henning
wanted to run the play and Groh told him to go for it. Martin took
the handoff on the right side and Chrebet got behind Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was walloped as he released the ball, but it floated high
enough to get over Robinson and into Chrebet's outstretched hands.
It was, Chrebet said, the biggest catch he has ever made, bigger
even than the previous biggies against New England. Johnson had
games as good as this as a Jet, but never a catch as good.
</P>
<P>
   When the game was over, Chrebet maintained his silence on
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no special meaning to it but that we're 4-0,'' he
said. ``It's not about that. I could say things. I could point
fingers. But I'm never ever going to answer questions about that
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he doesn't have to. Johnson will fade from the Jets
consciousness this week and they will be grilled with a much kinder
brand of question: Is a return trip to Tampa, in January, for an
even more heavily hyped game, in the offing?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's too big a thing to aim at right now,'' Groh said of the
Super Bowl, which will be played in Tampa this season. ``We're only
at the quarter pole now. A lot of teams that look at too big a
target miss it altogether.''

MORE OLYMPIANS MIX MOTHERHOOD AND COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ It was not so long ago that the women who
became Olympians were either young pixies bounding on a floor mat,
teenagers churning through the water or collegians sprinting around
a track. For these young athletes, the Olympics were part
competition, part kids club, part teen-age center.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 Sydney Olympics, at the medal ceremony for the
women's triathlon, the gold medalist Brigitte McMahon, 33, of
Switzerland, stood on the podium with her 3-year-old son, Dominic.
</P>
<P>
   At the women's water polo games, one of the best American
players, 39-year-old Maureen O'Toole, was cheered on by her
8-year-old daughter, Kelly. The United States team won the silver
medal on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   At the women's 20-kilometer race walk to be held Wednesday, the
American Michelle Rohl, 34, will be competing in her third Summer
Games, one for each of her children.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the kids club, forget the teenage center, the Olympics
need day care.
</P>
<P>
   There have been Olympic moms before _ Valerie Brisco-Hooks had a
son when she swept the 200- and 400-meter races 16 years ago _ but
parts of these Games have seemed cozily maternal.
</P>
<P>
   Here, female competitors with children in the grandstand have
been a familiar site, and that includes track, swimming and
volleyball, where women once scarcely competed past age 25.
</P>
<P>
   As the American weight lifter Robin Goad, who has a 1-year-old
daughter, put it last week: pursuing an elite athletic career
requires an almost manic selfishness, while raising a family
demands selflessness.
</P>
<P>
   How does Goad do both?
</P>
<P>
   First, step back to 1998, when Goad was pregnant and retired
from weight lifting. The sport was surprisingly and suddenly added
to the 2000 Olympics. When her daughter was born, Goad named her
Sydney, then resumed her training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means bringing her to the gym, and that makes me feel
guilty,'' Goad, 30, said. ``You know, as the athlete, you're
selfishly asking yourself: `Do I eat right? Did I get enough sleep?
Did I do enough reps of this or that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then as a mom, you say: `Oh, did my little girl get enough
milk? Sleep? Fresh air? Play time?' But those are normal feelings
all parents feel. I'm not different than a regular mom who comes
home tired and grumpy. A lot of moms like me ask themselves if
they're doing everything they should for their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rohl, a race walker, has also had to deal with what she refers
to as post-Olympic debt.
</P>
<P>
   Rohl is not subsidized by large athletic companies, but like her
competitors in the more high-profile events, she needs as much as
six to seven hours a day to train. And that means child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``My training can cost me $10 an hour,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, Rohl's husband, Michael, is also an elite
race walker who just missed making the 2000 Olympic team.
Sometimes, on the morning of school days, the Rohls will have their
two older children, Molly, 10, and Sebastian, 7, wait for the
school bus with neighbors so they can head to the track with their
youngest, Ayla, 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of us works out, one of us plays with Ayla,'' Rohl said.
``Then we switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is also the expense for physical therapy and
for travel to competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season after the Olympics is always my getting-out-of-debt
season,'' said Rohl, who did not win a medal in either 1992 or
1996.
</P>
<P>
   She teaches in a preschool to reduce the debt and her husband
works as a personal trainer.
</P>
<P>
   In the more high-profile Olympic sports, most coaches and
trainers believe women have continued to compete after they have
started families because sponsorships have made it possible to
train full time and be paid for it. Also, Title IX legislation,
enacted in 1972, has made more college scholarships available to
women, allowing careers, and Olympic dreams, to be kept alive past
the teen-age years.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe most significant, society is more accepting of mothers
who continue to compete in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly,'' Rohl said, ``twenty-five years ago, people
probably believed you shouldn't compete like we do after having a
baby.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt that things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   When Rohl got together recently with the marathon runner
Christine Clark (who ran a personal best on Sunday and finished
19th), they talked about _ what else _ their children. They chatted
about school, day care and how to manage their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice talk; we discussed shared experiences,'' Rohl
said. ``Christine has two kids.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one unusual thing about this everyday conversation.
Clark and Rohl were having it before 110,000 people and a worldwide
television audience as they walked side by side during the opening
ceremony. &QL;

SCHUMACHER WINS FIRST FORMULA ONE RACE AT INDY
</HEADLINE>
  By BRAD SPURGEON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Michael Schumacher won the U.S. Grand Prix on
Sunday, making racing history as the winner of the inaugural
Formula One race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and as the
second most successful driver in Formula One history, with 42
career victories.
</P>
<P>
   The victory lifts him and his Ferrari team back into the lead in
the drivers' and constructors' championship standings with only two
races left in the season. Schumacher is trying to become the first
Ferrari driver to win the world title since Jody Scheckter did it
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something really, really nice,'' Schumacher said. ``It's
the first time we've been here, and I guess none of us expected to
have such a great welcome from the American fans.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first Formula One race in the United States since
1991. Before more than 200,000 fans _ a Formula One attendance
record _ the race started on a damp track with most cars running on
rain tires.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher, 31, started from the pole position, with David
Coulthard, in a McLaren, starting in second place, and Mika
Hakkinen, in the other McLaren, in third.
</P>
<P>
   Coulthard charged off the line before the other cars moved and
he took the lead from Schumacher by the first corner. Hakkinen and
Rubens Barrichello, who started fourth, maintained their positions.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher pushed Coulthard to the limit, and while the race
stewards investigated whether or not the Scot had jumped the green
light to start the race, Schumacher managed to pass him at the end
of the long straightaway at the beginning of Lap 7 to gain the
lead. The cars touched lightly going into the corner, angering
Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I passed him on the outside in Turn 1 and basically was by and
went really wide to make sure that he cannot touch me at all,''
Schumacher said, ``and I would say he didn't take the tightest line
to avoid me.''
</P>
<P>
   Coulthard was then ordered to serve a 10-second penalty in the
pits for having jump-started the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I jumped the start,'' Coulthard said. ``You set a
rhythm of when you expect the lights to change. Obviously, you're
trying to anticipate. It seemed to me that they were a bit longer
than normal, but rules are rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Between Laps 6 and 9, most of the drivers switched to
dry-weather tires, but not Schumacher. The German stayed out on
wet-weather tires and built his lead. After establishing a
43.5-second edge on Hakkinen through 15 laps, Schumacher finally
made the switch to dry-weather tires. He returned to the track 10
seconds ahead of the Finn.
</P>
<P>
   Hakkinen started to increase his speed, gaining time on the
Ferrari. By Lap 26, Hakkinen was only four seconds behind
Schumacher and it looked as if the race was anything but decided.
But flames suddenly began to shoot from the back of the McLaren,
ending Hakkinen's day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the engine just failed,'' Hakkinen said. ``I
think I could have won it. I was gaining in every segment. I was
really good. We have two races to go and it's going to be a fight
to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher proceeded to have a rather routine race until he spun
out with five laps left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a bit too far inside and I touched the grass,'' he said.
``I wasn't going really flat out, just cruising and making sure
nothing goes wrong. You lose a bit of concentration. You just drive
around like you do in a road car.''
</P>
<P>
   He spun the car back on the track to maintain a 14.2-second lead
on Barrichello.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher covered the 73 laps of the 2.6-mile track in 1 hour
36 minutes 30.883 seconds for an average speed of 118.203 miles an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   It was his seventh victory this season and Ferrari's seventh at
a U.S. Grand Prix. Ferrari regained the lead in the constructors'
championship over McLaren, 143-133. McLaren started the race
leading the series by 4 points. Schumacher leads Hakkinen, 88-80,
in the drivers' championship after starting the day 2 points
behind. Schumacher's 42 career victories put him one in front of
the late Ayrton Senna and nine behind the career leader Alain
Prost.
</P>
<P>
   Barrichello, in the other Ferrari, finished second, 12.1 seconds
behind Schumacher, while Heinz-Harald Frentzen was third. Jacques
Villeneuve was fourth and Coulthard fifth. Ricardo Zonta,
Villeneuve's teammate, finished sixth.

   Villeneuve was the only driver in the series to have raced in
the Indianapolis 500, which the Canadian driver won in 1995. He
finished fourth after a tough battle with Frentzen. With only seven
laps left, Villeneuve spun off the track while trying to overtake
Frentzen, but he recovered to maintain his position.

<P>
   ``I was really wanting to get him,'' Villeneuve said. ``The
problem is when I went next to him, I lost track of where I was. I
just braked whenever, and it was way too late.'' &QL;

HIDEO SASAKI, 80, INFLUENTIAL LANDSCAPE ARCHTECT, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNE RAVER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hideo Sasaki, an internationally renowned landscape architect
who was as admired for his teaching and critical abilities as for
his multidisciplinary approach to design, died on Aug. 30 at a
hospital in Walnut Creek, Calif. He was 80 and lived in nearby
Lafayette, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki founded Sasaki Associates, in the Boston suburb of
Watertown, in 1953 while teaching at Harvard University's Graduate
School of Design, where he was chairman of the landscape
architecture department from 1958 to 1968. He believed in throwing
his students right into the design problems of the real world,
where they worked alongside civil engineers, urban planners and
contemporary giants like the architect Eero Saarinen and the
sculptor and landscape designer Isamu Noguchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us were working as many hours in his office as
school,'' said Peter Walker, who joined the firm right after
earning his degree in landscape architecture from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed this field, he reinvented it,'' added Walker, who
now practices in San Francisco. ``It wasn't just loosey-goosey. He
believed in theory, and you had to defend your position.''
</P>
<P>
   In the boom years after World War II, Sasaki's team built some
of America's first corporate parks, as companies like Upjohn and
John Deere moved their headquarters from city to country. As whole
neighborhoods were demolished in the urban renewal fever of the
1960s _ a movement much criticized now for erasing cultural history
_ Sasaki's designers produced Copley Square in Boston, Constitution
Plaza in Hartford, Conn., and Washington Square Village in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The designs played with earth shapes, using hard materials, and
juxtaposed what Sasaki called biomorphic shapes against geometric
ones, celebrating yet set apart from the modern buildings they
framed.
</P>
<P>
   The firm also designed college campuses that fit the geology of
their sites, mounding the land around Foothill College in Los
Altos, Calif., to echo the foothills for which it is named and
expanding the campus of the University of Colorado with bold modern
architecture that blended with the smaller Italianate buildings of
the school's early days. And the firm designed the master plan for
a brand new campus for the State University of New York at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a planner he understood demographics; he knew colleges were
going to grow and that people would be moving out of the city,''
said Gary Hildebrand, an associate professor of landscape
architecture at Harvard. ``And he organized his firm to match the
corporate culture. They had the ability to organize, to develop
ideas as research, to implement efficiently with accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Such versatility came not from one man, but from the many minds
Sasaki nurtured and encouraged to design collaboratively, building
models in the parking lot, going back to the drawing board as the
master critic made some gentle but astute suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hideo almost never did any of the design work himself,'' said
Prof. Charles Harris, who has taught at Harvard for 42 years. ``He
was a master teacher and design critic. He was able to inspire
people to pursue ideas and explore things without drawing a line.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris first studied with Sasaki as an undergraduate at the
University of Illinois, where he and other students fell in love
with his international perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was calling for the need for more contemporary design and
collaboration at a time when landscape architecture was still
caught up in the Beaux-Arts,'' Harris said. ``He didn't subscribe
to any particular design aesthetic. He wanted people to understand
the human needs and natural forces that were working on the
landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s Walker was just a greenhorn when Sasaki named him
principal landscape architect for the 100-acre Upjohn headquarters
just outside Kalamazoo, Mich., when the company moved from town to
a farmer's field. The design, with its courtyards and terraces,
groves of trees and artificial lakes _which provided water to cool
the buildings _ was built in collaboration with the architects
Bruce Graham, Noguchi and Gordon Bunshaft. While other factories in
the country were surrounded by parking lots, this one stood in a
giant garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they were called villas,'' Walker said of these new
corporate Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   When Stuart Dawson was still a student at Harvard in the 1950s,
he was meeting with Eero Saarinen, the architect for the John Deere
headquarters, which was moving from downtown Moline, Ill., to a
ravine on the edge of town overlooking miles of cropland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hid was back teaching at Harvard,'' Dawson recalled. ``You'd
come back and go over everything with him, and he'd say, `That's
good, maybe you should try that.' Basically, he let us hang
ourselves, but I guess he figured we wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki was honored by Harvard last year at the department of
landscape architecture's 100th anniversary celebration, which
featured a symposium on his work. The university awarded him the
Centennial Medal, honoring extraordinary achievement in landscape
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Though a longtime resident of Massachusetts, he was born on Nov.
25, 1919, in the San Joaquin Valley town of Reedley, Calif. He grew
up on his parents' truck farm and worked in the beet fields in
Arizona when he was relocated to a World War II internment camp
there for Japanese-Americans. He eventually made his way to
Chicago, where he discovered landscape architecture at the
University of Illinois, and later earned his master's degree in
landscape architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed to the United States Commission of Fine Arts by
President John F. Kennedy in 1961 and again by President Lyndon B.
Johnson in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first recipient of the American Society of Landscape
Architects' medal in 1971, and in 1973 he received the Allied
Professions Medal from the American Institute of Architects.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki is survived by his wife, Kisa, and two daughters, Rin and
Ann, all of Northern California.

COSTLY DELAY BY FIRST LADY ON THE USE OF SOFT MONEY
</HEADLINE>
  (With LAZIO-CAMPAIGN, NY-CLINTON-HOME) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is one thing Hillary Rodham Clinton has always been
adamant about in her years in public life, it is that it takes
money _ lots of it _ to win a campaign. The aggressive
interpretation of the nation's campaign finance laws has been a
hallmark of the Clinton years in Washington; one of her closest
advisers, Harold P. Ickes, a lawyer, is renowned in national
political circles for his mastery of the use of so-called soft
money.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that, her public posturing notwithstanding, Clinton
did not come easily to the tentative deal she and Rep. Rick Lazio
struck on Saturday night to eliminate the use of the largely
unregulated kind of campaign funds known as soft money in the
Senate race. Lazio had left her no choice but to agree to it, and
she supported it only after a delay that distressed some Democrats
who thought that she was reminding voters what it was that many of
them found unsettling about this first family. In the process, she
handed Lazio a soapbox that he has gladly mounted.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, as Clinton's advisers hastened to argue Sunday,
the first lady may be able to put an issue that has never played to
her benefit behind her. Although it is questionable whether the
nation's porous campaign finance laws matter much to people outside
Washington _ and Lazio certainly is not clean on this issue, having
raised much soft money during his own career _ his advisers assert
that the issue can be used as a hammer to chip away at Clinton's
character and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``They challenged her on trust, and she met the challenge,'' a
senior adviser to Clinton said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would seem that Clinton has suffered some
self-inflicted and perhaps unnecessary damage in trying to clear
this particular table.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign's protracted negotiating strategy raised questions
about whether she really wanted a deal. By Friday, Clinton was
facing questions about fund-raising on two fronts: the accounts of
her resisting a deal on soft money and the disclosures that the
Clintons had invited contributors to her campaign to stay at Camp
David and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Clinton was coming under attack by editorial boards, at
a time of year when they are considering their endorsements. And it
was a situation that one of Clinton's associates said could likely
have been avoided had she compromised on Thursday instead of
waiting until Saturday night to agree to a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio and Clinton hastened to claim credit for the agreement
this weekend, proclaiming it a watershed in American politics. But
it was Lazio who viewed the agreement as a much-needed tonic for
his campaign, showing up on national television Sunday morning to
boast of it. Clinton had no public appearances scheduled Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fast-moving campaign, and neither side was claiming
Sunday that the events of the last few days would necessarily
reshape the contours of the contest. Still, one Democrat said
Sunday that Clinton lost an opportunity here by not seizing the
offensive on an issue that Lazio has viewed as one of her greater
vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The hesitancy displayed by Clinton's campaign is a reflection
both of her strong feelings about the need for money in a campaign,
and of the debate among her advisers about the potency of campaign
finance laws as an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has a clear advantage in raising soft money, the largely
unregulated contributions that go to political parties and
committees. The funds are to be used for party-building, but
politicians, following the trail blazed by President Clinton, have
found legitimate ways to use it to promote their candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio has the advantage in so-called hard dollars, the
limited contributions made to the official campaign committees
that, under the tentative deal, are supposed to be the only source
for financing campaign advertisements. As of Aug. 23, the last
reporting date, Lazio had $10.2 million in hard dollars on hand,
compared with Clinton's $7.1 million. Her problem is that because
there are limits on hard-dollar contributions, she cannot go back
to supporters who have reached their limit and ask them to give
again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, argued that it was Clinton
who had first proposed the soft-money ban, last December, while
campaigning in Syracuse. She reiterated her proposal when Lazio
stepped into the race.
</P>
<P>
   But a review of the way Clinton and her advisers has handled
this issue suggests she was never eager to reach a deal. When she
first made her proposal for a soft-money ban, she made it
contingent on her opponent Mayor Rudolph Giuliani winning
agreements from all outside groups that they stay out of New York,
a condition that even Democrats suggested was prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   When Lazio raised the idea of a ban again, she responded by
saying that Lazio had to obtain  &UR; signed  &LR; agreements from the
independent committees. Her campaign seemed more than a little bit
surprised when Lazio actually complied.
</P>
<P>
   After a flurry of e-mail messages and news conferences, Clinton
then put forth, on Friday, a revised call for a soft-money ban. But
this time, it was laced with what Lazio's advisers saw as a poison
pill: It prohibited spending by independent groups on Lazio's
behalf, but included no such restriction on groups supporting
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even the first lady's advisers had difficulty arguing the merits
of that position. By Saturday, the first lady said that she would
accept a ban on spending soft money for commercials and would urge
independent groups to stop their spending as well, though she said
she wanted Lazio to obtain agreements from political committees
supporting him that they would stay out of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio turned up at his campaign headquarters at 5:30 p.m. to
announce, for a second time, that there was a deal. He did not
propose any new conditions. Two hours later, Clinton's campaign,
realizing, it seems, that she had run out of cards, said that an
agreement was at hand.

HOLTZ GOES FROM 0-11 TO OH, BOY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Ind.)   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he left Notre Dame four years ago, he was painted as a
cranky tyrant whose X's were so jumbled with his O's that they were
pumping up an already colossal ego. When he showed up to coach
South Carolina two years ago, it was perceived as a ticket-selling
stunt by a football program that had been more P.T. Barnum than
Bear Bryant and as a desperate encore for a once golden talent lost
without the applause.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, when South Carolina went 0-11 to establish a
nation-leading 21-game losing streak, the Lou Holtz-haters, and
there are plenty, smiled smugly and perhaps thought about Frank
Sinatra forgetting the words to his signature standards on those
final tours he might have been better off canceling.
</P>
<P>
   For the Holtz-admirers, an ample constituency of their own,
there were explanations. His wife, Beth, was fighting cancer for
the second time and he was distracted. The old coach was taking
care of his family by keeping the top spot warm until his son Skip
could take over the team.
</P>
<P>
   So where is that crazy, old and addled Lou now? Back in the
polls at No. 23 with an undefeated South Carolina (4-0) team that
demonstrates how Holtz, 63, has always had a plan and is about to
make it work again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have as good a chance of making a bowl game as Ralph Nader
does winning the presidency,'' Holtz declared before the season
began.
</P>
<P>
   The coach's wit is one of the reasons he is one of the most
coveted speakers on the high-dollar rubber-chicken motivational
speech circuit. The more important one is his record.
</P>
<P>
   Over 29 years in five previous coaching stops, Holtz has taken
broken programs and by his second year put them back together in
time for a bowl appearance. He did it at William &AMP; Mary, North
Carolina State, Arkansas, Minnesota and Notre Dame. He is the 11th
winningest coach in the history of college football with a record
of 220-106-7, has seven seasons with 10 victories or more and won
the national title at Notre Dame in 1988 with a 12-0 team.
</P>
<P>
   How has he done it?
</P>
<P>
   With a three-pronged system that could fit in one of those
palm-size books that are displayed near the cash registers of any
Barnes &AMP; Noble. 1: attract players who want to be good and will
work hard. 2: make them work hard and produce. 3: teach them to be
unselfish. Then, according to Holtz, he can teach the game of
football and the team's goal finally comes in sight: perfection. He
confesses no team can reach it, but the point is to strive for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe if you create the right attitude, you can win
anywhere,'' he said Saturday after the Gamecocks defeated then No.
25 Mississippi State, 23-19. ``We've still got to recruit well. I
thought we were able to attract good assistant coaches. We're not
winning because of me. Trust me. We have a plan, we try to follow
the plan. You can win at most places if you are together. We have a
family atmosphere. Not just the team. It's the whole athletic
department, the student body, everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It took all of an 0-for-1999 season for the Gamecocks to
understand the first two parts of the plan, and indeed, Holtz was
distracted throughout it. Besides his wife's battle with throat
cancer, which she again overcame, his mother, Anne Marie, died and
Skip, his son and assistant head coach, was hospitalized with a
severe gastric infection.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody likes being blanked for a full season, and the returning
Gamecocks showed up en masse in the off-season for voluntary dawn
weight-lifting sessions. They also surrendered to Holtz's
motivational tricks. They moved into dorms at the coaching staff's
urging. They rode to two-a-day practices in team buses. Some took
their turn at a preseason team meeting and shared details of hard
lives that choked many with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz the coach did his part, too. He scrapped South Carolina's
offense and defense and pushed Skip and the staff to come up with
schemes that took best advantage of the Gamecocks' admittedly
limited talent. The power-rushing game was out; a more diverse,
four-wide-receiver and shotgun formation was in.
</P>
<P>
   Against Mississippi State, South Carolina quarterback Phil Petty
had a career-high 305 passing yards, completing 19 of 40 passes.
And his backup, Erik Kimrey, threw a 25-yard go-ahead touchdown
pass with five minutes left in the game after Petty twisted his
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, the Gamecocks switched to a more nimble 3-3-5
formation that allows secondary blitzes and linemen and linebackers
to drop back into pass coverage. They are currently ranked No. 6 in
the nation in total defense.
</P>
<P>
   When South Carolina won its first two games of the season,
against New Mexico State and Georgia, fans stormed the field and
felled the goal posts. No more. The Gamecock faithful believe _
especially the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``People took us lightly going into this season,'' defensive
back Rashad Faison said after Saturday's victory. ``But we knew we
could do it. We are going to be a force in the SEC this year and
for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Gamecocks are off to their best start since 1988
and three more victories will ensure a bowl appearance, Holtz is
looking for something more _ the school's first winning record in
Southeastern Conference play. So far, his golden talent remains
intact. And if you still think the old coach has forgotten his
lines, listen to this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team we could play with anybody in the country,''
he said. ``Shortly, I will tell them which country.''

JAMES ELLIOTT, 76, A CURATOR WHO DABBLED IN FILMMAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERTA SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Elliott, an innovative museum director and curator and an
amateur filmmaker, died Thursday at his home, a houseboat, in
Sausalito, Calif. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott was known for a string of impressive proteges in the
museum field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim was a consummate museum person _ a diplomat, guardian and
scholar,'' said Alanna Heiss, director of the P.S. 1 Contemporary
Art Center in Long Island City, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``He generously shared his expertise with those of us whose
training was less academic than his, and he also sought ways to
integrate new art into the classic, formidable museum structure.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a penchant for unusual living quarters. While
working as curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, he
lived in an apartment above the carousel on the Santa Monica Pier.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of nearly 40 years, Elliott, who was born and
reared in Medford, Ore., worked at or ran four prominent American
museums, beginning with the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in
1953. Before embarking on that path, he had earned a degree in
biology from Willamette University in 1947, changed his mind about
becoming a doctor and spent a year in Paris, where he studied at
the Sorbonne and the Ecole du Louvre. In addition, he had earned a
master's degree in art history at Harvard (his thesis was on
Bonnard), taken the Fogg Art Museum's legendary museum training
course and, back in Paris on a Fulbright in 1952-53, written art
reviews for the International Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   He left the Walker in 1956 for the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art, where he served as assistant chief curator, curator of modern
art and chief curator during a period of expansion. In 1965 he
mounted the inaugural exhibiton for the museum's new building, a
large Bonnard retrospective organized with the Museum of Modern
Art. From 1966 to 1976 he was director of the Wadsworth Atheneum in
Hartford, where he oversaw a $4.5 million expansion and founded the
museum's well-known Matrix series for the purpose of showcasing
work by living artists on a continuing basis. Assigned its own
galleries within the museum, it was the first such program in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Elliott was named director of the Berkeley Art Museum
and Pacific Film Archive, where he established a second Matrix
series in 1978, expanded the collection and oversaw an ambitious
exhibition program that included large shows of Franz Marc, Richard
Avedon, Juan Gris and Jonathan Borofsky. Curators he hired while at
Berkeley included David A. Ross, director of the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art; Michael Auping, now chief curator at the
Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth; Mark Rosenthal, now international
director of 19th- and 20th-century art at Christie's; Lawrence
Rinder, now curator of contemporary art at the Whitney Museum of
American Art; and Constance Lewallen, senior curator at Berkeley.
He retired in 1988 and was named director emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced to filmmaking by the artist Bruce Conner and the
designers Charles and Ray Eames, Elliott began making short, silent
super-8 movies of social gatherings, starting in 1972 with a small
cocktail party at the Manhattan apartment of Alexander Liberman,
artistic director of Conde Nast. Thereafter he concentrated on the
midday meal, because of available light, and the series became
known as the ``Lunch Movies.'' He once said that he was trying to
produce an ``interior view of a social event that normally isn't
photographed,'' and frequently handed the camera to other guests so
that people would feel at ease.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the participants in the ``Lunch Movies'' were the
artists Andy Warhol, Donald Judd and Philip Guston, the designer
Mary McFadden and the Warhol superstar Candy Darling. Elliott
stopped making the films in 1983 when several were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott married Judith Algar in 1966, an event distinguished by
a plaster wedding cake made by Claes Oldenburg. They were divorced
in 1976. He is survived by a daughter, Arabel Elliott of Chapel
Hill, N.C.; a son, Jakob, of San Francisco; two sisters, Joan Ellis
and Amy Barnum, both of Medford; and a grandson.

SEAGRAM GROUP SAID TO DROP PLAN TO BID FOR LIQUOR UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A consortium led by the management team of Seagram
Co.'s spirits and wine unit has decided not to bid for the
business, which is being put up for sale by Vivendi SA, executives
close to the group said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi, the French telecommunications and utility conglomerate
that is trying to transform itself into an entertainment giant,
said in June that it would acquire Seagram. At the time, it said it
would sell the spirits and wine division because it did not fit
Vivendi's core strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several weeks, a handful of companies interested
in acquiring the Seagram unit, which includes well-known brands
like Chivas Regal Scotch and Captain Morgan's rum, have begun
reviewing the books of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Formal bids are expected to be made this week by Allied Domecq
PLC and, in a joint bid, Diageo PLC and Pernod Ricard SA of France.
Vin and Spirits, the Swedish company that owns Absolut vodka, may
also bid in conjunction with a partner. Other bidders could include
Bacardi, the rum maker, and Brown-Forman, which owns Jack Daniel's.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the consortium led by the management team of
the Seagram's division said the consortium decided to abandon its
plan despite lining up significant financial commitments from
investors in Europe. The group felt pressure to remove itself from
the auction, one executive said, because Charles R. Bronfman,
Seagram's co-chairman, no longer supported a management-backed
buyout and because a bid could jeopardize the managers'
compensation package.
</P>
<P>
   While the executives insist that the consortium had enough
financial backing, it remains unclear whether the group could have
competed with the deep pockets of rival bidders like Allied Domecq
and Diageo, both of which could justify paying a premium for the
business because of the possible cost savings.

CLINTONS DENY REPORT OF MANHATTAN APARTMENT HUNT  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who moved into
their Dutch colonial in Chappaqua, N.Y., in January, have not been
shopping for an apartment in Manhattan, a spokesman for Clinton
said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Mrs. Clinton said it was not inconceivable that the
couple might decide to look for a Manhattan apartment at some
point. But Howard Wolfson, the communications director for Mrs.
Clinton's senate campaign, said there was no truth to a report in
The New York Post on Sunday that the Clintons had enlisted
colleagues to look at condominiums in two luxury buildings, one on
Central Park West and one on Park Avenue. An apartment would
complement their Chappaqua home, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of it is true,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for The New York Post, said
the newspaper stood by its story.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, who has criticized Mrs.
Clinton for her relatively recent arrival in New York, could not
resist a dig when asked about the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were going to put their house up for sale in
Chappaqua after the election,'' he said, ``but I didn't think it
would be this quick.''

LAZIO PRAISES AGREEMENT TO BAN USE OF SOFT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Rick Lazio, buoyed by an agreement with Hillary
Rodham Clinton aimed at curbing campaign fund raising by outside
organizations, pressed his case Sunday on television and on the
stump that he should be credited with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But even he acknowledged that the agreement was fragile and
depended on the good will and influence of the candidates and their
supporters. At least one group has already expressed concerns about
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, appeared on the ABC-TV
Sunday news program ``This Week,'' with Sam Donaldson and Cokie
Roberts, and played up the agreement at two campaign stops. He is
expected to campaign Monday with Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who
is one of the leading proponents of campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement between the two Senate candidates
prohibits political parties from using unregulated, unlimited
contributions known as soft money for advertising. Soft money,
critics contend, enables candidates to skirt legal limits on fund
raising. The agreement also requires each candidate to ask
independent groups to refrain from broadcasting issue ads, and both
Lazio and Clinton said they had done so.
</P>
<P>
   But there were indications Sunday that outside groups not
connected to political parties had their own reservations, which
could jeopardize the deal. Although the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League agreed to pull a planned
television commercial, its director said that the group, which
endorsed Clinton months ago, would await a decision of its board
later this week before deciding whether to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Conlin, the executive director of the New York affiliate
of the group, said that although Clinton had asked the group to
refrain, the decision would be up to the organization's national
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're forced to do advertising, and without advertising, our
message becomes very small and muted,'' Conlin said. ``We're
hesitating to go along with this. We feel we have a responsibility
to pro-choice people to inform them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Lazio, said he doubted that Clinton
was forceful enough with the group, though the deal still stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't pass the political sniff test to say that Hillary
Clinton couldn't stop NARAL from spending soft money on her behalf
if she wanted to,'' McLagan said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, when Clinton offered a compromise on a broader ban
that Lazio had sought, she promised to urge all these outside
groups to stay out of the race. But she drew a distinction between
these independent groups and organizations established by Lazio
supporters to defeat her.
</P>
<P>
   And she suggested on Saturday that if a group on one side
violated the agreement, then the other side could do so
proportionately.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that possibility on Sunday, Lazio noted that there
was no written agreement between the two candidates, something that
he wanted earlier last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the television interview with Donaldson, Lazio said the
agreement would not have been reached ``unless my campaign showed
leadership in not raising soft money, not spending soft money, and
frankly, holding the Clinton campaign's feet to the fire on this.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Clinton, who had no public events Sunday, said
it was she who initiated the proposal and criticized Lazio for
helping his party raise soft money for congressional candidates.
(Lazio said last week that his role in such fund-raisers had no
bearing on this race, because he had not raised any soft money for
his Senate campaign.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first offered a ban on soft money to Lazio in May, but
Lazio rejected it as a ``gimmick'' until last month, when he
pledged to abide by such an agreement only if Clinton first pledged
the same. He pressed the issue at their first debate, held on Sept.
13, and again last week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the campaign trail Sunday afternoon, about seven abortion
rights advocates, holding signs questioning his commitment to
abortion rights, followed Lazio at his appearance at a Korean
cultural festival in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has said he would uphold the Supreme Court's landmark Roe
v. Wade decision legalizing abortion, but Clinton and NARAL have
pressed him about whether he would reject a Supreme Court nominee
who opposed abortion. Lazio, on ``This Week,'' appeared to answer
that he would not, but then reiterated his position that he would
not rely on a nominee's abortion views as the sole criterion for
the high court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you vote against a nominee who clearly was going to try
to overturn Roe-Wade?'' Lazio was asked.
</P>
<P>
   He replied: ``No, I wouldn't. Let me say, first of all, I _''
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to question that nominee very closely,'' Lazio
said. ``What I am going to do is I'm going to say: `Who is the most
experienced jurist? Who's got the right temperament? Who's got a
respect for precedent? I'm not going to establish a litmus test
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Lazio also sought to put some distance between
himself and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican
presidential nominee, who according to most polls is behind Vice
President Al Gore in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he disagreed with Bush's suggestion that the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska be open to oil drilling as a way
to ease an expected increase in home heating oil prices this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio and Bush have campaigned together only once, at a
Conservative Party luncheon on July 14 in Manhattan. Lazio
campaigned upstate when Bush last visited the state, on Thursday,
for a talk-show appearance in New York City.

PERU SPY CHIEF FLIES TO PANAMA LOOKING FOR ASYLUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change Pickering's title from Deputy Secretary to
Undersecretary.)   
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ The disgraced spy chief who until recently was
Peru's second-most powerful figure left the country Sunday, flying
to Panama to request asylum in the wake of a bribery scandal that
threatened to topple the government of his boss, President Alberto
K. Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   The ousted intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, boarded a
private jet accompanied by bodyguards and took off from a military
air base here just after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, unthinkable until a bribery scandal involving
Montesinos broke 10 days ago, appeared to be the result of
diplomatic intervention by the United States, other Latin American
countries and the Organization of American States. All have put
pressure on Fujimori to introduce more democracy and have urged all
sides in Peru to avoid violence after Fujimori's stunning
announcement last week that he would hold new elections, in which
he would not run, and would ``deactivate'' Montesinos' widely
feared National Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian officials refused to discuss the circumstances of
Montesinos' departure and left it to the Panamanian government to
explain the maneuvering that made it possible.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, 55, a cashiered former army captain, has been
Fujimori's most trusted aide, so powerful that the two men are
known here as ``the Siamese twins.''
</P>
<P>
   But that relationship and Fujimori's hold on power were
jeopardized on Sept. 14 with the broadcast of a videotape that
showed Montesinos paying $15,000 to an opposition member of
Congress, apparently to get him to go over to the government side.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Fujimori, after a decade of increasingly
authoritarian rule that culminated in May with what many outsiders
and Peruvians considered fraudulent re-election to a third term,
announced a new vote, but without specifying a date.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos immediately dropped out of sight, and for a week it
was unclear whether he was defying the president with the backing
of the military or relying on Fujimori to protect him from
opposition demands that he be arrested and tried on corruption
charges.
</P>
<P>
   At first Panama and Brazil were reported to have received and
rejected Peruvian requests that they grant asylum to Montesinos.
For decades Panama has been a favorite place of exile for deposed
leaders from all over the world, ranging from the shah of Iran to,
more recently, Gen. Raoul Cedras of Haiti and former President
Abdala Bucaram of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials said the first solicitation on behalf of
Montesinos came Friday from Peru's prime minister, Federico Salas.
After an emergency session of the Panamanian Cabinet on Saturday,
though, Alfredo Castillero, a Panamanian Foreign Ministry official,
said his government had rejected the asylum request to show that it
was ``against authoritarianism, fraud, irregularity and corruption,
not just at the national level but internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   But after considerable pressure from abroad, Panama reversed
course. Harmodio Arias, the country's deputy foreign minister, said
at a news conference Sunday that the presidents of five South
American countries, the OAS and ``high-level functionaries of the
United States,'' among them Undersecretary of State Thomas
Pickering, had all urged Panama to take Montesinos, to ``facilitate
the democratic process in Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias took pains to make it clear that while Panama had agreed
to allow Montesinos to land there, it had not yet granted him
political asylum. A formal request is under study, the Panamanian
official said, but he added that he could not predict ``the moment
or date'' of a decision.
</P>
<P>
   At observances here Sunday to commemorate Armed Forces Day,
Fujimori made no explicit reference to Montesinos, referring merely
to what he called ``a week of political decisions of the greatest
importance for our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But he twice singled out the National Intelligence Service,
which Montesinos controlled for the last decade, praising the
agency for its role in helping to liquidate two left-wing guerrilla
movements.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never navigated in calm waters, and that is a story
known to all my countrymen,'' Fujimori said in an effort to play
down the importance of the crisis. But, he added, ``it can never be
said of me that I am a man or a president whom circumstance has
paralyzed or forced to buckle.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's speech followed ceremonies in which the commanders of
all three branches of the military and the head of the national
police made their first public demonstration of support for the
president since the crisis erupted.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Gen. Jose Villanueva Ruesta, the armed forces
chief, pledged that the military would fulfill ``our constitutional
responsibility to guarantee the independence, sovereignty and
integrity of the fatherland.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Fujimori's public thanks to the armed forces for their
display of ``professionalism and unshakable loyalty,'' doubts
remain here about the ultimate allegiances of the military high
command. The majority of the top brass graduated in the same class
as Montesinos, two more are related to him by marriage and most of
them are said to owe their appointments to him.
</P>
<P>
   By law, all members of Montesinos' class are to retire at the
end of the year, including Villanueva. The officer who would
normally succeed him based on seniority, Gen. Carlos Tafur, was
forced to step down last week, an action that military analysts
here said could pave the way for the appointment of one of a pair
of Montesinos loyalists as military commander.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Fujimori sent a bill to Congress that would formally
abolish the SIN, as the spy agency is known here, within 15 days of
being signed into law. He met another key opposition demand later
that day, promising to announce the formal dismissal of Montesinos
no later than Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Montesinos' departure was greeted with mixed
feelings by the political opposition. A group of members of Peru's
Congress released a letter Sunday condemning the arrangement to let
him leave the country, saying he had no legal ground to seek asylum
abroad, since he was facing well-founded criminal charges and not
political persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire opposition and the nation have demanded and
continue to demand a fair trial'' for Montesinos, Congressman Henry
Pease said. ``They cannot give him impunity to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Montesinos out of the picture, it now becomes easier
for the Fujimori government to negotiate an accord with the
opposition for new elections. Opposition parties vowed to boycott a
``national dialogue'' sponsored by the OAS until Montesinos was
fired, arguing that his control of the electoral commission made a
clean and fair vote impossible.

PARK WALKS OFF WITH WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chad Kreuter wonders what kind of numbers Chan Ho
Park could compile without the walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers right-hander brought his
major-league-leading walks total to 123 Sunday afternoon. But he
also got away with four walks and a hit batter to throw eight
shutout innings and beat the San Diego Padres 1-0 before an
announced Dodger Stadium Fan Appreciation Day crowd of 46,393.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his walks total, Park (17-10) has established
career highs in wins and strikeouts (204 of the latter after 13
Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cut those walks down in half, his strikeouts would
probably raise by a third,'' said Kreuter, Park's personal catcher
and motivator throughout the year. ``And we might get a couple more
wins out of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've tried to do is be real positive with Chan Ho, try to
get him to understand he has great stuff. . . . He's got stuff like
Kevin Brown, stuff like Darren Dreifort and Randy Johnson-type
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, as is common for a pitcher with control problems, lived on
the edge Sunday. He walked the Padres' leadoff batter in three of
the first four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Rivera opened the fifth with a triple but was stranded
when Park struck out the side. In the sixth, he fell behind Mike
Darr 3-0 and Ryan Klesko 3-1 but retired both looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a lot of good pitches, though the walks have hurt
him,'' manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just lets up a little bit and then turns it back on. It's
like he needs to be challenged. If every hitter was a great hitter,
he probably wouldn't walk anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   If he lasts 3 innings in his last scheduled start late this
week, Park will reach his career best in innings pitched (220 in
1998). His impressive 217-171 innings-pitched-to-hits ratio is
somewhat tarnished by the abundance of walks.
</P>
<P>
   After 123 pitches, Johnson took Park out, although he admitted
he would have stuck with him in a playoff situation. Park, seeking
the first shutout of his big-league career, wanted to finish it
off. But he realizes the walks have eaten up too many pitch counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walks cause more pitches and sometimes I'm looking for
strikeouts at 1-2 and 3-2. But you have to be aggressive,'' Park
said. ``I believe I'm going to learn in cutting back (on) the pitch
counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Park finds it ``embarrassing'' that he has walked more hitters
than anyone in the game. But his opponent on Sunday, San Diego's
Matt Clement, took the mound just one walk behind Park at 118.
</P>
<P>
   Clement (13-16) walked three in seven innings, one
intentionally. Predictably, the game's only run scored on a
fourth-inning Clement wild pitch in this matchup of the majors'
wildest starters.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shaw came on in the ninth for his 27th save with help from
center fielder Tom Goodwin, who made a sliding catch of Ed
Sprague's looping fly ball with one out.
</P>
<P>
   From his rear end, Goodwin threw to first for a game-ending
double play. Klesko was trying to move up to second on the
assumption that the ball was dropping.

SCULLY AWARD GETS FAN OVATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was Fan Appreciation Day at Dodger Stadium on
Sunday. In case the fans couldn't appreciate the Dodgers' play this
season, the Los Angeles Dodgers gave them something they could.
</P>
<P>
   The team paid tribute to broadcaster Vin Scully in a pregame
ceremony that drew a bigger ovation than that of any player.
Scully, the voice of the Dodgers for 51 years, was honored as the
American Sportscaster Association's Sportscaster of the Century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy, I'm honored and I'm somewhat overwhelmed,'' Scully
told the fans.
</P>
<P>
   He was presented with a silver bat from Louisville Slugger, the
first issued to anyone other than a major-league player.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second significant honor bestowed on Scully this
year. He received an honorary doctorate degree from Fordam
University in June.
</P>
<P>
   Scully, 72, was inducted into the ASA Hall of Fame in 1992, 10
years after he was inducted into the broadcasters wing of the
Baseball Hall of Fame. He has called three perfect games, 18
no-hitters, 12 All-Star games and 25 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   __ Strikeout kings: Chan Ho Park reached the 200- strikeout mark
for the first time in his career when he struck out Mike Darr to
start the sixth inning. Park's previous career high was 191 in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the 207 strikeouts by Kevin Brown, it gives the
Dodgers two pitchers with 200 strikeouts for the first time since
1969, when Don Sutton and Bill Singer accomplished the feat.
</P>
<P>
   Park went on to record 13 strikeouts Sunday, striking out the
side in order in the third and sixth innings.
</P>
<P>
   __ One way to get there: The message written on the clubhouse
board reminded the Dodgers that ``playoff tickets must be ordered
by Tuesday.'' But with the New York Mets winning on Sunday, the
chances of using those tickets to watch the Dodgers in the
postseason grew slimmer. The Dodgers are six games behind the Mets
with six games remaining. Another Mets win or Dodgers loss would
clinch the playoff berth for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Since the Dodgers scored 12 runs on Sept. 17,
their games have featured a combined 14 runs. Sunday's game was the
Dodgers' sixth consecutive one-run contest. . . . The Dodgers are
10 games above .500 for the first time this season and for the
first time since finishing the 1997 season 88-74. . . . Gary
Sheffield's status remains uncertain, as manager Davey Johnson said
the outfielder's return ``is a maybe for Tuesday.'' . . . Mark
Grudzielanek (nine games) and Tom Goodwin (eight games) saw their
hitting streaks end Sunday. . . . Johnson and his wife Susan are to
be honored by the Hathaway Children and Family Services tonight at
the Hollywood Entertainment and Museum.

<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ After almost 14 years in office, more than any
other governor in the state's history, Tommy G. Thompson bestrides
Wisconsin politics like a colossus. He has built a national
reputation as a reformer and innovator, and this summer he headed
the committee that drafted the Republican platform in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But he has never managed to carry his state for his party's
presidential nominee. Not for Bob Dole four years ago, and not for
George Bush in 1988 or 1992. He tried hard. On Halloween Day, 1992,
he whistle-stopped across the state with Bush, from Mukwonago and
Waukesha to Oshkosh and Chippewa Falls, a made-for-the-cameras trip
on a train called the ``Spirit of America.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the governor recently proclaimed, ``I'm not
worried.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, he is the only politician in Wisconsin who is not. The
race between Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al
Gore is breathlessly close here, in the estimation of political
pros in both parties. Like several other Great Lakes states, this
is one of the year's main presidential battlegrounds, although it
is a bit smaller than most, with only 11 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent private polls, like one taken for a big Wisconsin
union, show an inconclusive edge for Gore; others show the race
even.
</P>
<P>
   This is a quirky state, politically speaking, hard to read, full
of ticket-splitters and independents. It produced both the
LaFollettes, the great clan of Progressive reformers, and the
right-wing zealot Joseph R. McCarthy. Both of its senators, Herb
Kohl and Russell D. Feingold, are Democrats, but both take offbeat
positions on some issues and work closely with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot pulled 16 percent of the Wisconsin vote in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 35 percent Republican and 35 percent Democratic and 35
percent independent,'' said Bill Dixon of Madison, a Democrat who
managed Gary Hart's 1988 presidential campaign. ``It doesn't add
up, but then, neither do we.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin is made to order, one might think, for Ralph Nader,
the Green Party candidate, and he campaigned here on Wednesday,
pounding away at ``the concentration of power in the hands of a
few.'' Nader sounded a bit like Fighting Bob LaFollette, and he
drew sizable crowds _ more than 1,000 at a rally in Milwaukee and
about 1,800 in Madison. In a poll taken in June, he had 16 percent
of the vote in traditionally liberal Dane County (Madison), and
some Gore backers have warned that he could hurt Gore in that area.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's daughter Karenna Gore Schiff, who
campaigned here on Tuesday, and other surrogates argue that a Nader
vote is a Bush vote.

   ``I don't think they have much to fear,'' said John Bibby, a
retired political scientist at the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee. ``The closer we get to Election Day, the more
people will worry about throwing their vote away. He'll do well in
Madison, but not so well elsewhere. Obviously, if it turns out to
be really close, even a few percentage points could be decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader is handicapped, of course, by a shortage of money and a
resultant inability to match the major parties' television
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore have been carpet-bombing the state with
commercials for months. According to a continuing national study by
Kenneth Goldstein, a professor of political science at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison, they have spent $2.6 million in
Green Bay and Milwaukee alone since June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Those cities were two of the places where Gore has advertised
most intensively; this summer, only Flint, Mich., Scranton, Pa.,
and Pittsburgh saw more Gore commercials than Green Bay and
Milwaukee. This month, Green Bay has seen more Bush commercials
than any other city except Scranton. This week, the Republicans
were touting the governor's new slogan, ``real plans for real
people,'' and the Democrats were replying with the taunt, ``George
Bush's real plans hurt real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor have the candidates missed opportunities to campaign here.
Bush spoke to the American Legion national convention in Milwaukee;
both nominees spoke to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in August.
Gore's first postconvention event was a riverboat trip down the
Mississippi, complete with a Mark Twain impersonator, starting from
La Crosse in southwest Wisconsin. Perhaps with an eye on possible
defectors to Nader, Gore arranged for his erstwhile rival, former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, to issue a belated endorsement
here in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wisconsin,'' said Goldstein, whose study is underwritten by
the Pew Charitable Trusts, ``is seeing action like it's never had
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Mayers, a political reporter in Madison who runs a Web site
that has been covering the campaign intensively
(http://wispolitics.com), sees the election as a fight, in essence,
between Thompson's organization and the state's most powerful
union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, a teachers'
group with 90,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The union's president, Terry Craney, was one of the few Gore
delegates at the 1988 Democratic convention, and his organization
has helped to set up the vice president's major Wisconsin
appearances in the last eight years. In 1996, it turned out a crowd
of 30,000 for a Gore rally, one of the biggest political gatherings
in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who attributed the elder George Bush's 1988 defeat in
Wisconsin to ``just mistake after mistake'' by Bush and his
strategists, has helped George W. Bush raise money in the state.
Several politicians here said they thought that in the event of a
Republican victory in November, Thompson hoped to be named as U.S.
ambassador to Vatican City.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's top national strategist, said in Wisconsin on
Thursday that Bush would return to the state three or four times
before Election Day. Thompson's support, he asserted, will not
transfer directly to Bush but will ensure that those who like the
governor and his policies ``give us a better hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Bush is ``a couple points up, a couple points
down'' in the state, Rove said.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I've had the same neighbor, John Berman, for more than 20 years.
I had come from the Midwest and an early experience I had with him
changed some preconceptions I had of New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, because of very limited finances, I was unconcerned
that my door had very flimsy locks. When I returned to my apartment
one day I found I had been burglarized. Nothing was taken, but the
miscreant made a large hole through my wall and burglarized my more
affluent neighbor, John.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned that evening, I met him in the hall and
explained what had happened. Nothing in his face, manner or speech
showed any anger or blame toward me. I put up some cardboard to
cover the hole. He never mentioned the event and refused to tell me
what he had lost.
</P>
<P>
   But before the wall was repaired, I heard a tap on it, removed
the cardboard and looked through. My neighbor was smiling and
holding two cocktail glasses and a bottle of good wine. He filled
the glasses, we clicked together and toasted through the hole in
the wall. The cardboard went back (temporarily!) but I still recall
the experience as an exceptional and gracious act of
neighborliness.

   of holidays and festivals that others find a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   But we share one rite in common that transcends potential strife
</P>
<P>
   And brings a welcome comfort to our quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   The rituals are easy; you can lie back and relax,
</P>
<P>
   have an extra cup of coffee or crawl back into the sack.

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   During the U.N. summit conference, my husband and I were looking
for a taxi on Second Avenue and 45th Street for what seemed like an
eternity. While waiting, we chatted with a young police officer on
duty.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that we walk to Third Avenue, even though my
husband has to use a cane. We followed his advice, and halfway down
the long block, I spotted a cab with its lights on and flagged it
down. To our amazement, who should step out but the very same
officer. He had hailed the cab and brought it around for us. Who
says our police are not caring and considerate?

   Irving Shillman was chatting with the manager of his favorite
East Side kosher delicatessen as he awaited his takeout order. He
asked the manager if he knew a neighbor who had just had
double-bypass heart surgery. The manager, after trying to identify
the neighbor and not succeeding, figured out why the man was
unknown to him. ``He couldn't have been a very good customer,'' he
said. ``Most of my people get quadruple and quintuple bypasses.''

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Anton, a friend of mine, leapt onto a crowded subway
train just before the doors slammed shut. As the train sat in the
station, waiting for the congestion ahead to clear, he saw it. One
of his beautiful new lined leather gloves had apparently fallen out
of his pocket and was on the platform.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? There was no one left on the platform to pass it to
him through a window. There was no conductor nearby to open the
doors so he could retrieve it himself, and if he pulled the
emergency cord, he would surely be arrested _ this couldn't be
called an emergency. Sadly, he concluded that there was only one
sensible thing to do. He leaned over to the open window and threw
the other glove on the platform. At least someone would have a
pair.

   One rainy day, vacationing in Vermont, Johanna Hurwitz went into
an antiques/junk shop. There, among the old dishes, books, jewelry
and pictures for sale, was a U.S. mailbox, the type on many street
corners throughout New York City. The blue paint was slightly
chipped and there was a bit of rust on it but it looked no worse
than many still in use.
</P>
<P>
   The sign on the box read: ``$90 _ Makes a great laundry

completely replaces the written letter, greeting card and bill, the

sounding more like 30-ish bankers than 10-year-olds. Finally, the
ubiquitous Hamptons real estate question:

   Dear Diary:

<P>
   I was on a crowded express train one late afternoon, a
white-haired elderly woman holding onto a pole for stability.
Sitting in front of me was a young woman, perhaps 25. She was
looking into my face but was clearly a million miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, she really looked at me and cried out: ``Oh, I'm so
sorry. What could I have been thinking? How thoughtless of me.
Please sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   She began to stand up but I said I was getting off at the next
stop and thanked her for the offer. Before I got off, I bent down
and told her she was an anachronism. She replied that she was proud
to be an anachronism. ``You know what?'' she said, ``I just looked
that word up a few weeks ago.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   As described in October 1994, the dream was a new-style
entertainment company in which three of the most successful people
in the media business would have total freedom to create films, TV
shows and music albums, while also developing new-media
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   So bold and exciting were the plans laid out by Steven
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen that many newspapers
published articles about them on Page 1. The ``dream team,'' as
they called themselves, named their company DreamWorks SKG,
implying that its future was as unlimited as their fertile
imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   But after six years that saw the rise of the World Wide Web, the
proliferation of digital music and the advent of digital
television, the bold DreamWorks trio has found true success only in
Hollywood's oldest and financially riskiest profession _ making
movies. The lesson, if there is one, may be that the multimedia
game is a hard one for even media moguls to master.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, what DreamWorks does well, it does exceedingly well.
Through early September, the 20 films it had released since 1997
had averaged $78.7 million at the box office, a batting average
some 15 percent ahead of any other studio, according to the
research firm ACNielsen EDI. And those hits included two multiple
Academy Award winners: 1998's ``Saving Private Ryan'' and 1999's
``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   This year so far, three of DreamWorks' seven releases have
surpassed the $100 million threshold that separates the superlative
from the so-so. And ``Almost Famous,'' the director Cameron Crowe's
reminiscences of his teen-age years as a rock 'n' roll reporter, is
off to a hot start, grossing an estimated $10.3 million since its
limited-release opening two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Overall this year, DreamWorks ranks a close second behind Walt
Disney's Buena Vista in total box office revenue _ even though
Buena Vista has released nearly twice as many movies. ``It's an
awesome record,'' one rival said. But industry analysts note that
the movie business is the most volatile part of the entertainment
industry, giving the DreamWorks portfolio a dangerous lack of
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks, of course, does not owe the world popular culture in
all flavors and formats. Nor is it under the stock market scrutiny
to which the media leviathans like Disney and Time Warner are
subjected. As a privately held company, it is financially
accountable only to its investors, who seem content.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are long-term investors,'' said William Savoy, who
represents the billionaire Paul Allen, owner of a roughly $600
million stake in DreamWorks. ``We believe that huge value is being
created for the long term. As long as that is the trajectory we are
on, we are thrilled to be investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in creative fields other than films, the dream team has
worked little magic. ABC's ``Spin City'' is the only TV hit to have
emerged from DreamWorks, though the company routinely produces
network pilots.
</P>
<P>
   In music, the industry where Geffen made his name and money,
DreamWorks expects revenue of $100 million this year, which he said
was ahead of the pace his former company achieved in its early
years. Still, DreamWorks has but one album, Papa Roche's
``Infest,'' among Soundscan's top 50.
</P>
<P>
   As for new media, the DreamWorks trio has had to learn the
meaning of a word previously unfamiliar to them: flop. Last month,
after spending at least $7 million to develop Pop.com, an
entertainment Web site, DreamWorks and its partner in the venture,
Imagine Entertainment, terminated the business before the Web site
had even opened.
</P>
<P>
   Like other companies trying to create entertainment Web sites,
Pop.com found that developing compelling material was a costly
proposition that presented no clear revenue opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   And so, for better or worse, these days ``we're essentially in
the movie business,'' Geffen said in a recent interview at his
10-acre estate in Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   With him was Katzenberg, who had been one of the most powerful
producers and executives at Disney before leaving to start
DreamWorks. The two executives, both wearing khakis and T-shirts,
were joined by the top executives of DreamWorks' live film
operation: Walter Parkes and his wife, Laurie MacDonald. (Spielberg
was away working on ``A.I.,'' a techno-thriller about artificial
intelligence that will star Jude Law and Haley Joel Osment.)
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that they had scaled back the original
DreamWorks plan, the executives betrayed little disappointment over
their curbed ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that I wish we were more lucky or better,''
Katzenberg said of DreamWorks' limited success in network
television. But like Geffen, he spoke not of failure but of changed
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every business has changed in significant ways,'' he said,
though several industry critics say the company's performance has
been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen noted, for instance, that the record business had become
``extraordinarily'' expensive. ``It used to be a cheap-entry
business, where you could sign an artist for less than $100,000,''
he said. ``Today you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   And Katzenberg pointed out that changes in federal regulation
that allowed the TV networks to take bigger ownership stakes in
programs mean the networks produce more of their own programming
now than they did five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen added that television, which DreamWorks had originally
seen as a core business, was now ``one of those businesses that are
in the margins of what we do but give Steven and Jeffrey an
opportunity to do things they really enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   But that joy has its limits. Just last week, for instance, NBC
pulled the plug on ``Semper Fi,'' a big-budget dramatic series
about life in the Marine Corps that Spielberg was to have produced
for introduction in midseason. After viewing the pilot, NBC
executives concluded it would not work as a series.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Katzenberg said that for the first time ``the company
is generating free cash flow.'' He offered no specific numbers, but
he meant that DreamWorks still had cash left over after meeting
interest payments and capital expenditures. Cash flow is the
preferred metric for media companies because it speaks to the
ability to generate enough revenue to pay stars and underwrite
multimillion-dollar production and marketing budgets _ to get the
next show on the road, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   But generating free cash flow is not the same as being
profitable, which DreamWorks is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies are the most capital-intensive, volatile and low-margin
of the entertainment businesses,'' said David Londoner, who follows
entertainment for ABN Amro. ``Profit margins run from negative 10
percent to only about 10 percent when a company is doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   It is to the dream team's credit that so far it has beaten the
odds in movies. But forecasting future performance is notoriously
hard in a business dependent on hits _ and harder yet at
DreamWorks, where the library of existing films does not yet
provide enough revenue to offset periods without new hits.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Katzenberg, Geffen and Spielberg put up a total of
$100 million for two-thirds of the company. They have raised an
additional $900 million, principally from Allen, the co-founder of
Microsoft, who now owns 24.5 percent of the company, and from the
Cheil Jedang Corp., a Korean company. The company has also borrowed
about $500 million from Chase Manhattan, and $350 million from Bear
Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the price of $500 million Allen paid in 1995 for an
initial 18 percent stake, DreamWorks at the time would have had a
market value of $3 billion. ``A pure financial investor with a
preferred stock might look for a compound rate of about 20
percent,'' one venture capital expert said. By that reasoning,
DreamWorks should have a market value of about $6.4 billion today,
but no financial analyst interviewed for this article thought it
could fetch such a price.
</P>
<P>
   The founders, who say they are not looking to sell, note that
DreamWorks would not be the kind of company to start if the point
was a huge payoff by traditional measures. ``If we were simply
about where is the most amount of money for us to make, we wouldn't
be in this area,'' Geffen said. ``This is not the best arena for us
to make money. But it is the best arena for us to do what we do
with the least amount of interference. And what we believe is, over
time, we will build a very, very attractive, substantial library.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Geffen said DreamWorks had even begun paying down the money it
had borrowed from Chase Manhattan. ``Our investment spending has
peaked,'' he said. Just two weeks ago, Columbia Pictures wrote
DreamWorks a check for $100 million for half-interest in ``Almost
Famous'' and two yet-to-be-released films, ``Evolution'' and
``Everlasting Piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the cost of film production with other big studios is
one way to hedge against the industry's inherent financial risks.
Spielberg, who raised industry eyebrows during DreamWorks' early
years by making some films for other companies, plans to produce
and direct at least two and possibly three movies that will be
co-productions between DreamWorks and other studios. After ``A.I.''
for DreamWorks and Warner Brothers, he will produce and direct
``Minority Report,'' a science fiction film with Tom Cruise that
will be shared by DreamWorks and 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   It is Parkes and MacDonald who make the day-to-day decisions
about the live- action movies, while Katzenberg oversees the
animation division. But Spielberg's presence is felt throughout the
company's film business.
</P>
<P>
   When the producer Jake Eberts met with Katzenberg for dinner to
discuss DreamWorks' financing Eberts' film ``Chicken Run,'' for
instance, Spielberg joined them because he was familiar with the
work of the movie's directors, Nick Park and Peter Lord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeffrey did not just trot Steven out,'' Eberts recalled.
``Steven was very knowledgeable about their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Eberts said that Disney had also expressed interest in backing
the film. ``But Jeffrey pursued me with a terrierlike passion,'' he
said. ``Disney didn't have that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``A.I.,'' Geffen recalled, he and Spielberg were
flying to New York one day in 1996, when Spielberg told him that
``the best project he had read was `A.I.,' but he couldn't get hold
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The script, by the filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, was under
development by Warner Brothers. Geffen said he began a
two-and-a-half year effort to secure the project for Spielberg _ an
effort that involved ``endless conversations with Terry Semel,''
who was then the Warner Brothers chairman. ``Steve kept telling me,
`You're wasting your time; this is never going to happen,''' Geffen
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But after Kubrick died in March 1999, DreamWorks was able to
work out a joint venture with Warner Brothers for the project, with
Spielberg as director.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its success in films, the dream team has shown no
particular edge in the Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   A person familiar with the development of Pop.com said several
Internet experts had warned DreamWorks that the involvement of
Allen could ``make it harder to get distribution on AOL, Yahoo and
Microsoft because there was some resentment toward Allen at those
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   And with its substantial financing, Pop.com too often seemed to
throw money at problems, critics said. For example, Pop.com offered
Steve Martin $100,000 to make a two-minute film for the Web site,
even though there was no evidence Web audiences want short films.
</P>
<P>
   As Geffen is quick to note, DreamWorks is not the only
entertainment company to have failed on the Web. But the DreamWorks
failure was particularly public, and its executives were singularly
thin-skinned. After a critical article about Pop.com in The Los
Angeles Times in July, the unit's head, Kenneth Wong, brought a
pinata to work, pinned the writer's name on it and encouraged
staffers to batter it, a former employee recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Pop.com was dying last month, reports appeared about a
possible merger with Ifilm, which never materialized. It was only
the latest of rumors that DreamWorks was about to merge or sell or
mutate in one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   But the dream team is not interested in merging with anybody,
and there are no such talks under way at the moment, Geffen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started DreamWorks because it allows us to do what we do in
an atmosphere where we are in charge of it,'' Geffen said. ``We're
not frustrated by having to deal with other people and their
agendas and their priorities and their tastes. We're dealing with
our own.''

TREND OF MODERATING ECONOMIC GROWTH EXPECTED TO CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trend of moderating economic growth is expected to be
reflected by the latest data for {personal income} and {personal
consumption}, which are due to be reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Most forecasters are estimating August's gain for income at 0.3
percent, while spending is generally predicted to have risen 0.4
percent. Neither number is expected to concern Federal Reserve
monetary officials, who meet again next month to assess the
inflationary pressures on the economy.
Monday
</P>
<P>
   Although a rebound from July's plunge is widely expected for
{existing home sales}, few analysts are predicting a strong enough
recovery to get resales back to their early summer level. The
consensus forecast anticipates an annual rate of 4.85 million
during August, which would be a 2.3 percent increase from July but
still well below June's pace of 5.31 million units.
Tuesday
</P>
<P>
   The Conference Board's {Consumer Confidence Index} is expected
to have lost ground again this month. The median forecast of
economists surveyed weekly by Thomson Global Markets anticipates a
September reading of 140.3, compared with 141.1 in August. The
gauge of consumer attitudes stood at 143 in July. After last
month's drop, a Conference Board analyst said the index's recent
fluctuations may be signaling a ``cooling in spending habits.''
Wednesday
</P>
<P>
   A small recovery is predicted for {durable goods orders} in
August, but not nearly enough to recover from July's record plunge.
Orders for big-ticket items with a useful life of three years or

AVILA COLLEGE LOOKS FORWARD TO NEW FOOTBALL TEAM, INCREASED
ENROLLMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the 84 years Avila College has existed, the school has never
played a football game. Tonight that will change.
</P>
<P>
   The new Eagles football team's first game will be against
Haskell Indian Nations University at 7:30 p.m. at Rockhurst High
School, 9301 State Line Road.
</P>
<P>
   Avila students, professors, administrators and trustees will
cheer from the sidelines. The new Glitter Girls dance team will
entertain the crowd at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Avila, founded as a women's college by the Sisters of St. Joseph
of Carondelet, has been coeducational since 1969. But the college
has never embraced football, a sport cherished by generations of
American college students.
</P>
<P>
   So why now?
</P>
<P>
   The south Kansas City school simply wants more students,
especially young students who want to live on campus.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same reason that other colleges nationwide, including
St. Mary College in Leavenworth, have started football teams in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Big football squads can bring up to 100 more students to a
college. Some players will get financial help from the college. But
the majority will pay thousands in tuition and room and board, a
bonanza for private colleges that need tuition to stay open.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges also believe that football, with its pep rallies and
fight songs, will enliven their campuses. A busier campus will
attract high school students who equate autumn not only with chilly
weather and dropping leaves, but also the thrill of post-game
parties, quarterback sacks and hail mary passes.
</P>
<P>
   Avila and St. Mary, which started football last year, also hope
the sport keeps alumni interested. And both former women's colleges
hope football brings more male students to campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football fits the new Avila image,'' said Jim Willcox,
president of Avila's board of trustees. ``The older Avila image is
one of a nursing school, and while that's an important part of the
future, we want to offer a situation that is as well-rounded as
possible -- a situation that fits the picture of the future.''
Rising enrollments
</P>
<P>
   Colleges in Ohio, Illinois, New Jersey, Texas, Florida, Georgia
and South Carolina are using football to help improve weak
enrollments and dull campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The new sport helped Monmouth University in New Jersey refashion
itself. Since Monmouth began playing football in 1993, full-time
student enrollment has jumped from 1,700 to 3,500. In the first
year of football, the private college attracted 700 freshmen, 300
more than the year before. It now has 1,050 freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Football doesn't explain all the increase, said Miriam E. King,
Monmouth's vice president for enrollment management. But bringing
``fall football fever'' to a former ``suitcase'' campus at which
many students lived off-campus has made the university more fun,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've built five residence halls and doubled the size of our
residential population,'' King said. ``The culture has changed.
It's a very positive, growing, changing culture. It's an exciting
culture because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the national trend toward more college football
teams does pose problems. They say the sport is too rough and that
some football players are violent on and off the field and don't
meet academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   They complain that the costly sport siphons money from
academics.
</P>
<P>
   Football at many schools is the most expensive sport, requiring
several coaches, high levels of insurance, lots of equipment and
transportation, and meals and lodging for more than 100 players.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Deighton, Avila's vice president and dean of student
affairs, said the college might spend up to $30,000 just on
equipment this year. Many other sports don't get that much for
their entire operating budgets, including equipment, travel, meals,
uniforms and officials.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors also say that colleges with football have a hard time
equalizing athletic opportunities for men and women. Federal law
forbids colleges from discriminating on the basis of sex.
</P>
<P>
   One -- but not the only -- test of whether schools are fair is
comparing the percentage of women among all students to their
percentage among athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act has required
colleges and universities that receive federal funds to prepare a
report for the public to inspect that shows how much money they
spend on women's and men's sports and how many men and women
participate.
</P>
<P>
   On its EADA form for 1998, William Jewell College in Liberty,
which has played football for decades, reported that women
comprised 60 percent of the student body. But women were just 38
percent of athletes (including 19 women on the cheerleading and
dance teams).
</P>
<P>
   The percentages would have been better if the trustees hadn't
approved a ``football bounty plan'' that year.
</P>
<P>
   The football coach had successfully recruited 23 more players
than the 43 for whom he had funding. So he asked the trustees for a
bigger football budget so he could accept the extra players.
</P>
<P>
   Even though trustees knew the extra players would badly skew
gender participation toward male athletes, they approved expanding
the football team.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: The college hadn't met its enrollment goal and
needed to sign up the football players to keep numbers up.
</P>
<P>
   Subtracting the extra money given to football for the additional
players, the plan netted the college $230,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to the EADA report, Jewell's trustees are spending
about $500,000 trying to equalize athletic opportunities for men
and women.
</P>
<P>
   Avila administrators say they believe they are being fair to men
and women in sports. Before adding football, Avila had 95 female
athletes and 88 male athletes. (The student body was about 70
percent female.) But now the school has added about 50 football
players and expects to add 50 more next year.
</P>
<P>
   Avila has never prepared an EADA form. Administrators say they
didn't know they were supposed to prepare a report. Deighton, who
is looking for a new athletic director, said he would prepare a
report this year.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:'Like a transformation'  &LR; tx:Avila's enrollment has dropped
steadily in the past two decades. In 1981, the school had almost
2,000 students. By 1990, it had about 1,350 students. Enrollment
rebounded to about 1,400 students in 1995 but fell to 1,270
students by 1998.
</P>
<P>
   To turn enrollment around, Avila decided to add football and a
spirit squad. But it also decided to expand intramural athletics
and add a debate team and new academic majors.
</P>
<P>
   More students already are choosing Avila. This year's freshman
class has 170 students, compared with last year's 113. The dorms
are full, with about 220 students, compared with 140 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a transformation of the college,'' said Cindy
Freeman, who has worked in Avila's athletics department for eight
years and who coordinates the spirit squad. ``Avila's been more of
a commuter school. With all these extra bodies, everybody's really
excited about this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Students say classes filled up quicker this year, parking spots
are tougher to find and the residence halls are rowdier.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Lakira Cavole looks forward to the Eagles' first game,
even though football is just a club sport for the first season.
When she transferred from the University of Missouri-Columbia as a
sophomore, ``Avila was kind of solitary. Now I see the football
team working out, and I think that's fun. Now I belong to this
school. I like it when it's busy.''
</P>
<P>
   But some students think football and Avila don't fit.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Blake, who is majoring in theater and sociology, rolled
her eyes and shrugged when asked her opinion. She said she doesn't
care about football or the spirit squad, and she thinks adding
football players will hurt the campus' academic reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But Avila administrators say they will bring football players to
campus as students first, athletes second. Coach Tim Johnson
stresses academic achievement, said Jacob Bustos, a freshman
cornerback from Mesquite, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bustos was recruited to play football and said he wouldn't have
heard of the school otherwise. Bustos said he liked Avila's
intimate atmosphere and the college's budding school spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people I talk to on campus are really excited about
football, Bustos said. ``People in freshman seminar (class) are
planning a tailgate party before the first game. I think that's
pretty neat.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: FOLLOWING SILK ROADS ON NEW PATHS OF DANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ On his deathbed in Venice in 1324, Marco Polo was
ordered by a priest to recant, as lies, all his tales of the fabled
silk roads from Asia to Europe. ``I haven't described half of what
I've seen,'' he retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Marco Polo might find the current Lyon Dance Biennial,
one of Europe's prime international festivals, stranger than
reality. ``The Silk Roads,'' its theme, is inspired by the maritime
and overland routes explored by this famous traveler and has
transformed the biennial, the ninth since its inception in 1984,
into an Asian dance festival. Yet this is hardly your standard
overview.
</P>
<P>
   The other day about 25 good citizens of Lyon moved slowly in a
public square in a tai chi workshop under the watchful eye of a
master from Taiwan. A Dutch folk troupe with Slovak dancers
performed Tibetan dances in the evening. Earlier a male soloist
from Hong Kong ran nude around the stage during his concert. In a
premiere a French choreographer offered a meditation on an actual
case study of three women erotically obsessed with silk.
</P>
<P>
   Kilina Cremona, another French choreographer (once a teacher at
Merce Cunningham's school), has included dancers from Mongolia in a
Croatian ballet company that she directs in Split, which faces
Korcula, an island under Venetian rule when Marco Polo was born
there in 1254.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxes abound here. Westernized dance companies from Taiwan
have focused on their Chinese roots. By contrast the Beijing Modern
Dance Company, founded a few years ago, has a postmodern look, and
its intense dancers received a stamping ovation.
</P>
<P>
   To distill the entire festival, 4,000 participants from Lyon,
its suburbs and nearby cities took part in the biennial's parade
before 200,000 spectators. The mix of hip-hop and Chinese dragon
dances said a great deal about this year's eclectic tone.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Guy Darmet, the biennial's indefatigable artistic
director, has made imaginative use of a geographical springboard,
the aspect that distinguishes this festival from all others. The
focus is on Asia and the silk trade, but folk material has been
deliberately played down. The event is essentially a contemporary
dance festival, fortunately free of embarrassing Orientalisms.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more than 30 groups performing here through Oct. 1,
Chinese (including Hong Kong), Taiwanese, South Korean and Japanese
modern dance troupes are dominant. But the geographic image
associated with the old trade routes by which silk traveled from
China to Europe has also allowed Darmet to make some ingenious
connections to Lyon as a silk center. Silk is a slippery fabric, as
Darmet's surprising combinations of dancers and events show.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand the biennial is celebrating Lyon as a longtime
silk capital (from the 16th century to World War I), still
appreciated for the high quality, if not quantity, of its silk and
fiber-optics industries. As part of the biennial, 300 silk banners
from leading manufacturers hang high above the city's main avenues.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, one of the best modern dance works seen so
far in the three-week festival brought into relief a less
commercial aspect of silk's appeal. Delphine Gaud, a 28-year-old
newcomer, is one of the few French choreographers from the Rhone
region invited to create premieres for the biennial. She has
focused on a study by a turn-of-the-century Parisian psychiatrist,
Gaetan Gatian de Clerambault.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference she said her piece, ``Bombyx Mori'' (the
scientific name for the silkworm butterfly), was not influenced by
a French film, ``La Crie de la Soie'' (``Silk's Cry''), which deals
with the same incident. Instead she worked from the psychiatrist's
interviews (1902-6) with three women who stole pieces of silk from
stores. Erotically obsessed with the fabric, the women were
imprisoned for theft or put into an asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Although the real events are not depicted onstage, and a
stylized loom is visible for only a few minutes, Gaud succeeds in
conveying a sensual unease among women who cannot relate directly
to men.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the audience found her piece, with three women and one
man, too oblique, but the soundtrack was a wonderfully resonant
collage: the steady rhythm of a mechanical silk loom, a stallion's
neigh symbolizing virility, the overlay of the voices of women who
had worked the looms in Lyon, speaking of their fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive was the choreography. In a duet that seemed
Sisyphean, Gaud and Mychel Lecoq repeatedly collided chest to
chest, fitting their bent bodies into each other's contours and yet
failing to make emotional contact. La Trisande, Gaud's company, is
a troupe to follow.
</P>
<P>
   On the more festive side the first ball of this biennial and the
festival's third parade in six years have swept much of Lyon into
moderate exotica. Those who paid to go to the masked ball,
``Carnival in Venice,'' also paid tribute to Marco Polo's heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in silk capes, masks, turbans and commedia dell'arte
costumes, they gyrated to a French pop band singing in English in
the basement of the Gallo-Roman Museum. Berangere Salagnon, a
student, decided to forgo silk and lace and made her 17th-century
dress out of pages from Le Dauphine, a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The festival's parade on Sept. 17 has been the biggest success
so far. Unlike the 1998 event, whose Mediterranean theme was
attacked by representatives of the National Front, France's
extreme-right political party, for its interracial and
multicultural aspects, this parade benefited from the sun (it
rained last time) and general good cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Lyon's working-class suburbs, largely populated by North
Africans, were again represented, but the city's middle class was
also visible among the participants dancing their way down the
Avenue de la Republique. Darmet said in an interview that despite
the parade's community outreach, he still saw it as a creative and
artistic event that involved amateurs guided by professional
choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   The parade was most beguiling when it was most inventively
homemade. A circus group from Taiwan led the way with an authentic
dragon dance. But more fun came from the young people moving along
a serpentine path, creating a dragon out of blue umbrellas. Drums
were made out of plastic water coolers. Stilt dancers encased in
huge white balloons represented cocoons, and floats laden with
suitcases recalled the many Armenians who came to Lyon to work in
the silk industry. Carpets and horsemen evoked Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But Central Asia, a key stretch of the silk route, is largely
missing from the biennial. Darmet said he did not find modern dance
companies there that were suitable for the festival's focus on
contemporary dance.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, present ``Samarkand, Samarkand,'' a program of
traditional music superbly performed by musicians from Uzbekistan,
and will present a similar group of Iraqi musicians. Dancers from
India, Thailand and South Korea, as well as the Kabuki star Kankuro
Nakamura, will pay tribute to tradition, although sometimes with a
modern creative touch.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the festival remains Asian experimental companies
unfamiliar to the French but often seen in New York. Taiwan's Cloud
Gate Dance Theater, a major company here, will appear next month at
the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
</P>
<P>
   There is more novelty for an American in another Taiwanese
group, Han Tang Yuefu, whose artistic director, Chen Mei-O,
presents reconstructions of exquisite songs and dances in what is
known as the Pear Orchard Theater style (12th-14th centuries).
</P>
<P>
   Here is a group that should be seen in the United States, as
should the Dutch professional folk troupe Het Internationaal
Danstheater. Its ``Gold of Xian'' program offered a cheerful
panorama of dances from Central Asia, China, Tibet, India and the
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   The troupe's approach is decorative rather than deep. But Dutch
musicians singing in Uzbek and blond women performing dances from
Tajikistan looked as polished as any theatricalized folk group. In
any case, Maurits van Geel, the Dutch artistic director who has
been researching Central Asian dances since 1991, gave Darmet just
the package tour he needed.

PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS NEGLECT SERIOUS ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why do Al Gore and George W. Bush talk so endlessly about how to
pay for your mother-in-law's thyroid prescription?
</P>
<P>
   Because they want to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Because prescription drugs are expensive. Because elderly people
need lots of prescription drugs. Because elderly people vote in
great numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about what's showing up in the polls,'' said Sid
Milkis, co-author of ``Presidential Greatness.'' The candidates
``understand that the way to get elected is to look at what the
surveys say and then talk about things in terms of fine-tuning
middle-class entitlements.''
</P>
<P>
   But polls, note academics and activists, are far better at
recording what average folk find interesting than underlining the
most serious issues likely to confront the new president.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning by survey leaves out issues such as the effects of
globalization -- on both the economy and the environment. It skips
the increasingly complicated dilemmas over how to deploy American
troops on missions other than all-out war. It forgets policy on a
post-Cold War planet, on agriculture and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't forgotten issues,'' said Richard Lamm, former
governor of Colorado. ``They're ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignored, say he and others disappointed in modern presidential
campaigns, because the dash for votes is a short-term venture
fashioned for pivotal voter blocs, such as those prescription
drug-buying seniors. And the discussion of issues must fit into
30-second commercials, 10-second sound bites for the evening news
or one-paragraph quotes. It must be connect-the-dots simple.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the dominant messages coming from the two major
party camps focus almost exclusively on domestic affairs and
typically appeal to voter self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with that is that prescription drugs are not the
world's biggest problem,'' said Kirkpatrick Sale, an
environmentalist author. ``Nuclear proliferation in the world --
now that's something serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious, perhaps, but it is neither a domestic nor a pocketbook
issue. Remember, Bill Clinton won the presidency in 1992 with the
mantra, ``It's the economy, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be fitting that the men who want to govern listen
attentively to those who are governed. Bush, then, is acting
appropriately by talking of tax cuts and Medicare reforms. And Gore
is right to voice popular notions such as channeling budget
surpluses toward strengthening Social Security and hiring more
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the candidates, complained diplomatic historian Dennis
Merrill, are missing a chance to educate the public about
challenges ahead and to reveal whose thinking on the world makes
the most sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to have some sort of discourse about what America's
role in the world should be in the coming decade,'' said Merrill,
who teaches the history of foreign relations at the University of
Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no votes in it,'' he said. ``You don't see the
candidates talking about spending taxpayer money to develop rural
India because there's not much constituency for that.''
</P>
<P>
   What that can do, said Merrill and others, is leave the country
largely blind to truly pressing issues and surprised at what
happens later. The trend is not new, and has caught presidents
napping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an irony of fate if my administration had to deal
with foreign problems,'' Woodrow Wilson told a Princeton chum
shortly after his inauguration in 1913, ``for all my preparation
has been in domestic matters.'' Before he left office, Wilson would
be sending soldiers to fight and die in World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Economy-obsessed candidate Clinton would become globe-trotting
President Clinton. He oversaw a minor military disaster in Somalia,
sent American troops into Haiti, dispatched peacekeepers to Bosnia
and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that candidates have thoughts only about the few things
on which they focus their campaigns. They have position papers and
dueling advisers to stake out all manner of public affairs. Even
their own expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, for one, built a reputation in Congress as a deep thinker
about nuclear arms control. He wrote a well-received book about the
environment. Yet he defers a clear position on a missile defense
system to another day. In the campaign, his speeches mostly gloss
over the tough choices needed to curb pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been governor for five years in Texas, a state where
the oil industry and an influx of Mexicans shape much of modern
life. Yet his talk of both energy and immigration has been passing
at best.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Internet. It's relatively new. It's a driving force
in popular culture. It's a vital cog in the vaunted new economy.
And it's not much talked about _ certainly not on the more
controversial areas of privacy and monopolies and censorship _ on
the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's virtually no argument about matters virtual,'' said
Jacob Weisberg on Microsoft's Slate.com. ``There's no discussion of
the Internet tax moratorium, electronic privacy, the Microsoft
trial, Internet pornography, the AOL-Time Warner merger, or the
Napster case.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisberg postulates two reasons Bush and Gore don't talk about
cyberspace. High-tech money, he notes, already flows to both
parties. And states such as California and Washington are not seen
as being at play in the battle for Electoral College votes.
</P>
<P>
   Other times, Bush and Gore's particular agreement on an issue or
their personal history argues for avoiding a topic.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates, for instance, favor the death penalty and have
said they are not moved by trends in some states to call for a
moratorium while the fairness of the criminal justice system is
studied. They both want more Internet terminals in schools. They
agree on the North American Free Trade Agreement and China's entry
into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   They differ somewhat on campaign finance reform, but neither has
much to gain by raising the issue. Bush hauled in record amounts of
money on his way to the Republican nomination. Gore is sullied by
the Democrats' 1996 fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the candidates do tackle issues, complain critics,
they engage them in superficial ways. Education, said Dale Neuman,
a political scientist at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, is
discussed in terms that are 25 years old. Why not, for instance,
challenge the whole framework of assigning children to grades based
on their age instead of their academic ability?
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead,'' Neuman said, ``they talk about simple things.''

POLICE BLAME FEWER ARRESTS ON LACK OF PERSONNEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even as crime continues to climb, arrests have
fallen 17 percent in Los Angeles largely because of a police
officer shortage, the Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Department commanders blame a good economy
and mass retirements for the exodus of officers, leading to fewer
arrests and cuts in some crime-fighting programs, including in the
San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But patrol officers contend Chief Bernard C. Parks' strict
discipline policy and the prospect of further monitoring under a
proposed federal consent decree have pushed officers off the force
and led others to avoid making as many arrests.
</P>
<P>
   What is not in dispute is that from Jan. 1 to Sept. 16, there
were 17 percent fewer arrests citywide and nearly 20 percent fewer
in the city's San Fernando Valley divisions, as compared to the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, violent crimes, burglary, larceny and auto
theft were up by 11.2 percent across the city, according to police
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   And as of last week, the department had just 9,230 officers,
down 820 from the 10,050 department goal, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have fewer officers, you can't make the same number of
arrests,'' said Deputy Chief Mike Bostic, the Los Angeles Police
Department's commanding officer for the Valley Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   This month's Police Academy class was canceled because there
were too few prospective cadets.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 1, only 99 officers have been hired _ not nearly
enough to replace the 140 who have left during the same time
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruitment is an ongoing effort that has been very, very
difficult,'' said Cmdr. Betty Kelepecz, in charge of the LAPD's
hiring.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer officers, police have cut back on programs that they
say have worked _ bicycle patrols and the career criminal unit at
the LAPD's Foothill Division, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The Foothill Division was down 24 officers over last year, while
response times have risen by as much as a minute, said Capt. Kenny
Gardner. Covering in the northeast corner of the city, the Foothill
Division gained notoriety when some of its officers were videotaped
beating motorist Rodney King in the Lake View Terrace neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect we have more people out there committing crimes
before we can get to them. We could definitely use more people. Now
we're playing catch-up,'' Gardner said. ``The proactive details
just aren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrol officers contend that the department's close scrutiny,
lack of a compressed work schedule and fallout from the recent
Rampart Division scandal have kept away prospective recruits.
</P>
<P>
   And the looming consent decree that would bring in a federal
monitor to deal with a series of police reforms will make matters
only worse, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of LAPD officers have taken out extra insurance
policies in the past year to protect themselves from the added
scrutiny, according to Clay McQuiddy, president of POLICE Insurance
Services, which stands for Peace Officers Legal Issues Coverage
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   For officers, the added insurance covers what their union does
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officers are scared. They're asking, How is this going to
affect me?'' said an officer from the North Hollywood Division who
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Although still under negotiation, the decree would establish a
monitor who would record the race of people whom officers stop to
determine whether racial profiling exists within the department.
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh, police have been under a federal consent decree
since April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Serious crimes have risen more than 14 percent since the decree
was signed and arrests have plunged, said Chuck Bosetti, second
vice-president of the police union, the Fraternal Order of Police.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you intimidate the police from policing, you increase
crime and decrease arrests,'' Bosetti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is causing the police to turtle-up. They will not be
proactive. Creativity and officer discretion have been outlawed.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Pittsburgh residents filed 193 complaints, far short of
600 complaints lodged last year, when the decree was in place,
Bosetti said.
</P>
<P>
   And in the first nine months following the decree being signed,
arrests for felonies and misdemeanors dropped 18.5 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as though complying with race-gender statistics is of
more interest than establishing innocence or guilt,'' Bosetti said.
</P>
<P>
   The department also has lost about 175 officers since the decree
was signed.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police have the same fears.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his 15 years on the department, a North
Hollywood officer took out liability insurance, paying about $100
every three months to cover lawyer costs and compensation pay if he
was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The officer said he fears frivolous complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every contact with a gangster brings up the odds that
something bad's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of doing proactive patrolling and pulling over
suspicious people, many officers said, they are only responding to
routine radio calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are what you call a blade of grass in the lawn of life.
Officers show up to work, eat their lunch and go home. And the ones
who are doing their work are impulsive and haven't seen the reality
of the situation _ that they could be indicted or sued,'' said
another officer.
</P>
<P>
   One Foothill Division officer is particularly concerned about
pulling over minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to want to do the work if they're going to get
labeled as a racist for stopping somebody that you had just cause
to stop?'' the officer asked. ``It's just ridiculous. You can't be
effectively policing while being second-guessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bostic defended the department discipline policy, saying that
more than 50 percent of the discipline cases stem from off-duty
misconduct. ``It's domestic violence, neighbor disputes and drunk
driving committed off duty.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said the Rampart scandal proves extra scrutiny is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single one of us have more complaints than we've had
before,'' he said. ``We're establishing credibility in the
community that we will investigate the misconduct of officers and
we will produce a fair and impartial investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Zine, vice president of the LAPD's Police Protective
League, which represents the rank-and-file, said the consent decree
would serve only to embitter officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they do is questioned. They feel that their careers
are in jeopardy,'' Zine said. ``It's another document tracking them
in their career. And at what point do we say this is ridiculous? I
think the avalanche is just going to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the department continues to scramble for recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Kelepecz is hopeful the newest recruitment media campaign called
``The Satisfaction of the Career,'' launched on July 17 will have
an impact. The $2,000 relocation fee begun in May for out-of-state
recruits may also help, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrol officers believe it is fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``These officers are voting. They're voting with their feet,''
said one North Hollywood officer who has sent out his resume to
several other departments. ``It's the old Titanic joke: We're going
down, and there ain't no band playing.''

...'' Changes ``indicated'' to ``indicted'' in graf that begins
``Milosevic, who was ...'') 
By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ An enthusiastic opposition to President
Slobodan Milosevic said early Monday that its candidate, Vojislav
Kostunica, was leading by wide margins in watershed elections for
president held on Sunday, but government spokesmen insisted that
their sampling indicated that Milosevic was ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who has ruled this country for the last 13 years,
called the election nine months early _ after changing the
constitution in a day _ in an effort to prolong and legitimize his
hold on power. While no official figures had been released six
hours after the polls closed, opposition leaders said they believed
that Milosevic had badly miscalculated in his first attempt at
direct election since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, government officials who had predicted an early
evening declaration of victory for Milosevic in the first round,
with the incumbent taking more than 50 percent of the vote, were
mistaken. Some officials in Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party said
privately that the mood was grim, and that there was some confusion
about how to respond to the vote.
</P>
<P>
   There were indications early Monday that the Socialists might
choose to allow a second-round runoff between Milosevic and
Kostunica rather than simply declare victory by means of a voting
fraud that could require Milosevic to claim a million phantom
votes. A runoff on Oct. 8 would in effect challenge the opposition
to respond in the streets if it felt cheated of a victory then.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other Western powers have invested much
effort and money in trying to unite Serbia's opposition, promote
independent media and oust Milosevic, against whom NATO fought a
three-month bombing war last year for control of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition spokesman Cedomir Jovanovic said the results he had
received so far made it clear that a second-round runoff between
Milosevic and Kostunica, his main opponent, a 56-year-old lawyer
backed by 18 opposition parties, would be required if Kostunica did
not win outright. Figures released by the opposition said that
turnout was nearly 78 percent in Serbia and about 25 percent in the
tiny sister republic of Montenegro, whose pro-Western president had
urged his citizens to boycott the vote.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:30 Monday morning (9:30 p.m. Sunday, Eastern time), Nikola
Sainovic, the Yugoslav deputy prime minister and a spokesman for
the Socialist Party, said that with 900,000 votes counted,
Milosevic was leading with 44 percent of the vote, to 41 percent
for Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   Polling experts noted that a lower turnout would require
Milosevic to win or manufacture fewer votes in order to claim a
first-round victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Radical Party of Vojislav Seselj, which is an increasingly
disaffected partner of Milosevic in the government and is
considered a watchful counter of votes in this election, offered a
larger sample of 600,000 votes. That sample showed Kostunica with
49 percent to Milosevic's 41 percent. But again, it was impossible
to judge how representative the sample was.
</P>
<P>
   Some Socialist Party officials were said to be arguing for a
second round, hoping to keep the turnout down, but opposition
leaders, pollsters and analysts believe that a second round would
produce a definitive victory for Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   People also voted for both houses of the Yugoslav Parliament and
for local governments, but the counting of those votes is slower.
The opposition claimed big victories in Belgrade, which it already
controls, and said it had lost no towns.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Stambuk, vice president of the Serbian Parliament and a
senior member of the party of Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic,
said, ``The turnout is very large, and it's clearly a kind of
referendum.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Serbian Renewal Movement, an opposition party
which did not back Kostunica, said he was winning by wide margins
over Milosevic in central Serbia and in large cities, while
Milosevic was running ahead, though less dramatically, in more
rural eastern and southern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department said Sunday night that it believed
that more than 70 percent of the population had voted in the
election. ``We congratulate the people of Yugoslavia on their
commitment to democracy,'' said Richard A. Boucher, a department
spokesman. He said that there were numerous reliable accounts of
irregularities during the voting.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets of Belgrade, there were rival rallies and
concerts. The opposition had planned to rally in the Square of the
Republic, but the government set up a loud concert instead,
featuring famous singers of folk and its popular derivative, known
here as ``turbofolk.''Some surprised opposition supporters yelled
``red thieves'' at the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition moved down the street to a smaller square, and
some 5,000 people gathered to hear scattered results, chant slogans
and cheer for Kostunica. They chanted: ``Kostunica, save Serbia
from this madhouse'' and ``Slobo, save Serbia and kill yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Police separated the crowds but there was no violence.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Milan Spasic, a lawyer of 52, said: ``We want
change, but with this guy we'll never have them. We'll have only
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who was indicted last year by the United Nations war
crimes tribunal in The Hague, is widely blamed for igniting the
wars that brought the breakup of the old Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Milos Cervenic, 26, a metalworker, spoke hopefully of an
opposition victory. ``I'm expecting to live like a man at last, to
not be ashamed of being a Serb anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the original constitution, Milosevic could serve only a
single term as Yugoslav president, which would end in July of next
year. His ally, Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic, says
Milosevic will run out his term no matter what the results of these
elections may be.
</P>
<P>
   In Montenegro itself, the elections caused little stir, with a
large majority not voting. Special police units loyal to Djukanovic
were on guard at state buildings in full combat gear but Yugoslav
army units, whose commanders have openly supported Milosevic, kept
to their barracks.
</P>
<P>
   In both Serbia and Montenegro, there were complaints of
electoral abuses, including inflated voter tallies, missing
curtains and opposition monitors being banned from a few polling
places. Police and soldiers voted in their barracks, away from the
scrutiny of party representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, which is run by the United Nations, Western troops
and officials tried to keep a count of those who voted, to try to
defeat any effort by Belgrade to inflate the numbers. Western
officials said that fewer than 40,000 inhabitants appeared to vote.
State media said Milosevic had done very well in Kosovo.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE REDSKINS' LONG LOUD LINE OF OWNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The way Daniel Snyder peered down from
the Redskin owner's suite at Giants Stadium on Sunday night, you
expected him to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down, the way Roman
emperors did in the Coliseum when they pardoned or condemned a
gladiator.
</P>
<P>
   And after an embarrassing thumbs-down loss to the Cowboys last
Monday night, the Redskins earned a thumbs-up pardon from Snyder
with a 16-6 victory that lifted their record to 2-2 while deflating
the Giants to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   With his demanding manner, his signing of running back Stephen
Davis to a nine-year, $90 million contract extension and his $40
million collection of free agents that include Deion Sanders, Bruce
Smith and Jeff George, the Redskins' tyrannical owner has upstaged
the Cowboys' Jerry Jones as pro football's rebel owner with a
cause: to win the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, the marketing zillionaire who bought the Redskins for
$800 million, has inspired a National Football League inside joke:
``He's making Jerry Jones look like Art Rooney,'' the Steelers'
longtime benevolent owner.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Daniel M. Snyder is just the latest in a long, loud
line of Redskin owners established by George Preston Marshall,
embraced by Edward Bennett Williams and enhanced by Jack Kent
Cooke.
</P>
<P>
   Notice that each of those previous owners went by three names,
as Franklin Delano Roosevelt or Lyndon Baines Johnson did as the
president. It must be a Washington thing. Snyder just uses an
initial, although he lets it be known that he expects to be
addressed by any and all underlings as Mr. Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   To purge the memory of Cooke's reign, he sold the name of the
Redskins' stadium (built by and named for his predecessor) to
Federal Express and turned it into a huge orange-and-purple FedEx
poster.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere Cooke must be steaming about that, although his ego
was such that he's probably still steaming over having left this
world. At lunch once with the Washington sports columnist Morrie
Siegel, Cooke casually said, ``If I die . . . ,'' prompting Siegel
to blurt, ``What do you mean, `If?' '' Cooke calmly replied, ``My
dear Morrie, I don't intend to die.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, apparently to his surprise, Cooke did die. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Cooke's bluster, his Redskins, with Joe Gibbs as
coach and Bobby Beathard as general manager, won three Super Bowls
with three different quarterbacks (Joe Theismann, Doug Williams,
Mark Rypien).
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's teams won two NFL championships, in 1937 (the
Redskins' first year in Washington after having deserted Boston)
and in 1942, when Marshall himself chalked ``73-0'' on the
blackboard before the championship game and the Redskins avenged
the Bears' rout by that score for the 1940 title.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, who owned a chain of laundries and was married to the
Hollywood actress Corinne Griffith, often suggested plays to his
coaches, but more than anything else, he was pro football's first
show-biz club owner. Back when nobody feared being politically
incorrect, Marshall formed the Redskins' marching band, which wore
feathered headdresses and played ``Hail to the Redskins,'' a
District of Columbia takeoff on ``Hail to the Chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Redskins played the New York Giants at the old Polo
Grounds, the band took the Sunday train from Washington to Penn
Station, then marched and tootled up Eighth Avenue to Columbus
Circle before going to the game.
</P>
<P>
   After the legendary passer Sammy Baugh retired, the Redskins
skidded, in the standing and in esteem. As other teams signed more
and more black players, Marshall signed none. Not until 1962 did he
surrender to sociological and political pressure, obtaining the
future Hall of Fame running back Bobby Mitchell in a trade with the
Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Four decades later, Mitchell remains the Redskins' constant
through the Marshall-Williams-Cooke-Snyder regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Redskins' assistant general manager, Mitchell joined
their front office in 1969 when Williams, the celebrated trial
attorney, revived the franchise by secretly persuading Vince
Lombardi to resign as the Packers' general manager and move to the
nation's capital as coach and overall boss.
</P>
<P>
   Williams lured Lombardi with 5 percent of the Redskin stock,
then a bonanza of about $500,000. And under Lombardi the Redskins,
who had not been over .500 since 1955, jumped to 7-5-2, but just
before the 1970 season, Lombardi died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' next trophy coach was George Allen, who had what
Williams called an unlimited expense account, but the owner soon
was complaining that Allen had already ``exceeded it.'' And in 1974
Cooke, who had owned the Los Angeles Lakers and Kings as well as
the Chrysler Building, moved in as the Redskins' owner, turning his
suite at RFK Stadium into a Sunday hangout for politicians and
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   But now Daniel Snyder is in that Redskin owner's box, and his
thumbs are always under surveillance. &QL;

BURRELL LEARNS SHE CAN COMPETE, NO-HEIGHT OR NOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 c.2000 San Bernardino Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Shelia Burrell kept running and throwing and
jumping. In hopes of winning an Olympic medal at Athens 2004, not
Sydney 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell, the former UCLA standout and Cal State Northridge
coach, failed to clear a height in the high jump, the second event
of the heptathlon, putting her out of medal contention.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she turned the two-day event into a test of mettle.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a split second, a split second, I thought, `What's the
point?' '' Burrell said, recalling the high jump disaster. ``But if
I had not finished this competition, it would not have solidified
the fact that I'm more than able and more than capable of competing
with these girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrell completed competition Sunday night at Olympic Stadium
with 5,345 points (in six events). She was 26th, one spot ahead of
a woman from Uzbekistan who scored in seven events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up beating somebody,'' Burrell said while laughing.
``Can you believe that? I no-heighted in the high jump, scored zero
points and I passed somebody. It's kind of cool, isn't it? Hoo-hoo,
I won!''
</P>
<P>
   The high jump often troubles Burrell, 28, who arrived at her
first Olympics with the sixth-best score (6,422) of the year and
opened competition with the third-fastest time in the 100 hurdles.
Then came the high jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I warmed up at (5 feet, 7 inches),'' she said. ``Chillin.
Skyin' the bar, skyin' the bar. I said, 'I'll come in at 5-4, a
easy height, a safe height.' I come in and caught a toe spike on my
first jump, kind of tweaked my ankle and jammed my hip . . . so
what, fine, get over it, right? Come back my next jump and my run
is completely off. Next jump I'm thinking, `OK, just power over it
because this is a low bar,' and I just didn't power over it
correctly, and there you go, I'm out of the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate DeDee Nathan came over and gave Burrell a hug. ``And I
said, `Oh my God, I just no-heighted at the Olympic Games,' ''
Burrell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ironic thing about it? I don't feel bad about it. I didn't
want to break down and cry. I sat there and I was like, `Oh well.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan said dropping out wasn't really an option for Burrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Shelia thought about it, but this is an event you just
finish,'' Nathan said. ``It's just the thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrell refocused and put up some solid scores, and that allowed
her to leave Olympic Stadium feeling good about herself and her
heptathlon future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tally up the points,'' she said. ``If I didn't no-height, I'd
probably be up in the top eight, top nine in this competition, so I
have nothing to be discouraged about because I'm there, you know?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm right where I need to be, and when my time comes to raise
up that next level, I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Lewis of Great Britain won the heptathlon with 6,584
points, 700 short of the world record of Jackie Joyner-Kersey,
Burrell's hero.
