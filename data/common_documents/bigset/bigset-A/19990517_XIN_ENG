<HEADLINE> Iraq Claims to Have Hit Enemy Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi anti-aicraft forces hit
an enemy plane Sunday, an Iraqi military spokesman announced .
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman said that at 10:30 (0630 GMT), 13
formations of enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace
violated northern Iraqi airspace over the provinces of Dohuk,
Erbil and Neineva.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired missiles at the enemy planes,
said the spokesman, adding that according to reports from Iraqi
observing posts in this region, one of the enemy planes was hit by
an Iraqi missile while the others fled to their base in Turkey at
13:35 (0935 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not say whether the plane crashed or not.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claimed several times previously that its anti-aircrafts
forces shot down U.S. or British warplanes violating its airspace,
but failed to present evidence.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain denied Iraqi claims each time,
saying all their planes patrolling the no-fly zones returned to
their bases safely.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
what they called Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes have been regularly
attacking Iraqi military and civilian targets, causing severe
civilian casualities and property damages.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has ever since declared that it does not recognize these
restricted zones and vowed to continue confronting any allied
plane violating its airspace.

CAIRO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on Sunday welcomed the normalization of relations
between Kuwait and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here, Abdel-Meguid expressed
satisfaction about this development and voiced hope that the two
Arab countries will further develop and foster their ties.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti-Yemeni rapprochement "comes within the context of
the efforts exerted to clear Arab atmosphere and restore Arab
solidarity," the league chief stressed.
</P>
<P>
The ties between Kuwait and Yemen soured during the 1990-1991
Gulf crisis triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Although Yemen
condemned the invasion, it refused to join the U.N.-sanctioned
coalition in driving Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in February
1991. Kuwait accused Sanaa of siding with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.

Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdul Qader Ba-Jammal traveled to
Kuwait on Saturday, the first Yemeni senior official to visit the

<HEADLINE> COMESA 7th Inter-Governmental Committee Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Focusing on realization of a free
trade area by October 2000, the 7th Meeting of the
Inter-Governmental Committee of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) opened in the Kenyan capital Nairobi
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are delegates from 21 COMESA members
states. They are Angola, Burundi, Comoros, Democratic Republic of
Congo, Djibouti, Egypt,
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi. Mauritius,
Namibia, Rwanda, Seychelles, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda,
Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day meeting, the delegates will discuss such
issues as tariff reduction for trade liberalization, the common
external tariff, the common investment area, financial, fiscal
and monetary systems, and transport and communications sector.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Kenyan Minister Nicholas Biwott for East
African and Regional Cooperation said that the realization of a
large regional market is more urgent in the current economic
environment, which is becoming increasingly global.
</P>
<P>
"Our region is endowed with abundant natural resources which,
if deliberately and fully exploited, provide a powerful base for
our economic development", Biwott said.
</P>
<P>
With such an array of resources, the Kenyan minister urged the
member states to join efforts in tapping the potential of
tourism, water resources for electricity generation and
irrigation, and minerals for industrial development, and
developing infrastructure and services projects.
</P>
<P>
He also called for his member states to embark on a promotional
campaign to raise COMESA's global profile and to promote the
region as an attractive investment destination offering a large
market with a population of 400 million and a combined Gross
Domestic Product of 170 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha of COMESA
told the participants that "over the next 18 months, we must
concentrate our collective efforts to achieve a free trade area
by October 2000 and continue working hard to remove all the
obstacles that stand in the way of making our vision a reality."
</P>
<P>
Citing much progress COMESA has achieved in trade
liberalization, financial and transport sectors as well as
cooperation with some world agencies, Mwencha noted that during
the meeting, the delegates must agree on how to tackle the
obstacles delaying tariff reduction and push forward on the
introduction of the common external tariff.
</P>
<P>
He urged the delegates to work together to remove the remaining
 barriers for finally realizing a free trade area next year and a
common external tariff by 2004.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Iran to Work for Stable Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Iran, two
biggest oil producers in the Gulf, agreed on Sunday to coordinate
policies aimed at stabilizing the global oil market, said Saudi
Oil Minister Ali Ibrahim al-Naimi.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is that Saudi Arabia and Iran have
agreed to coordinate to bring about the stability of the oil
market," al-Naimi said after holding talks in western Saudi city
of Jeddah with visiting Iranian President Mohmmad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Commitment to the March agreement and the production quota of
each country would help prolong stability of the oil prices, he
was quoted by Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) agreed last March to trim their output by 1.7 million
barrels per day (bpd). Riyadh and Tehran promised to reduce their
production by 585,000 bpd and 264,000 bpd respectively.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have climbed back to about 17 U.S. dollars per
barrel since OPEC members began to implement their pledged cuts
on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said the meeting did
not discuss any new deal to slash oil output.
</P>
<P>
Khatami arrived in Saudi Arabia Saturday for a five-day visit
as part of his Arab tour, which already took him to Syria, Iran's
long-time Arab ally.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's visit to Riyadh is the first ever by an Iranian
president to the kingdom since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution
which toppled the late Shah's regime and brought about the
clergymen's rule.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran were strained
during the past two decades, but have been on the upswing since
Khatami, a political moderate, took office in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Khatami has expressed the desire of easing tension and
establishing mutual trust between Iran and the Gulf Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, the two countries exchanged a
number of high-level visits aimed at coordinating positions on
ways of lifting oil prices as well as strengthening bilateral
ties.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hopes Israeli Elections Lead to Peace Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt expressed hope on Sunday that
Israel's elections on Monday will bring about a government that
will be a partner to help realize rather than wreck peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters that such
a partner "did not exist in the past years" as the policies,
practices and ideas of the Israeli Likud coalition stalled the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Likud coalition led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
came to power in June 1996. Egypt has been critical of Netanyahu,
who has been blamed for defying the international peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
"What concerns us at present is for the coming Israeli
government to be a partner in the peace process and capable of
shouldering its responsibilities regardless of who will be on the
top," Moussa stressed.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope the new Israeli government will realize the
future of the whole region, including Israel's, depends on peace,
justice and security for all parties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli voters will go to polls on Monday to choose the next
prime minister and the 120 members of the Knesset (parliament).
Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, leader of the opposition Labor Party,
will run for the premiership. Four other candidates have pull out
of the contest.

CAIRO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid left here for Beirut Sunday evening on a four-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid told reporters upon departure that he will take
part in meetings of the Arab arbitration authority starting on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the visit he is to confer with Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud on the stalled Middle East peace process
and the situation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He will discuss with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri
the continued Israeli aggression on south Lebanon and seek ways of
galvanizing Arabs on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet with Prime Minister Salim Hoss to find out
how to coordinate the Arab stances on the peace process, the chief
of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum said.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-claimed security zone in 1985 in south
Lebanon to allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
No results have been achieved since 1991 when Lebanon and
Israel kicked off peace talks in Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
Israel proposed last year that it would pull back from south
Lebanon if the Lebanese government agreed to guarantee the
security of the border areas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, insisting that the Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon be unconditional.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Thorough Investigation of Embassy Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the United
States Li Zhaoxing Sunday called for a thorough investigation of
the May 7 missile attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, it's imperative to conduct a serious, sincere
and comprehensive investigation," said Li Zhaoxing at NBC's
"Meet the Press" program.
</P>
<P>
Li said that May 7 was a "black day" for 1.2 billion Chinese
people as three people were killed and more than 20 others were
injured by the U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
"It's violation of China's national sovereignty and China is
entitled to an investigation," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We have every reason to demand a fair, thoroughgoing, and
comprehensive investigation of this atrocity," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on human rights situation in China, Li
Zhaoxing said the whole world and the whole people of China were
shocked by U.S. human rights record in the killing of the Chinese
people at the embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The barbaric bombing is a violation of the U.N. Charter, the
Vienna Commission on Diplomatic Relations, and international
laws governing relations among countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said China attaches importance to relations with America
and the two countries should work together toward maintaining
world peace and encouraging development.
</P>
<P>
However, the relationship has now suffered damages which arose
from the U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
China has decided to postpone the high-level military contact
between the armed forces of China and the U.S. and postpone its
consultations with the U.S. in the fields of proliferation
prevention, arms control and international security.
</P>
<P>
China has also decided to suspend its dialog with the U.S. in
the sphere of human rights in the wake of the brutal NATO attack
on the Chinese embassy.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Israelis Geared up to Decide on Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerusalem, May 16 (Xinhua) -- At a busy crossroad in downtown
Jerusalem, banners and posters of party slates contesting the
coming Israeli elections mushroomed Sunday as volunteers shuttled
among streaming cars to distribute leaflets of their favorite
candidates.
</P>
<P>
With the elections for parliament and prime minister less than
one day to go, Israelis accelerated their momentum in the day to
sell the party and candidates they support, and seemed fully
poised for voting.
</P>
<P>
"I came here three times last week and every day this
week. Banners and posters increased day by day," said Nachshon
Tamir, a supporter for opposition One Israel leader Ehud Barak,
holding one end of a large banner which reads "Israel wants
change. Ehud Barak."
</P>
<P>
"Barak is going to be a better prime minister. He is
broad-minded and can make peace with the Arabs. I will vote for
him," said Tamir, a college student.
</P>
<P>
According to Tamir, there are 400 volunteers for One Israel in
Jerusalem alone, who have been conducting campaign activities every
day in their spare time.
</P>
<P>
Just meters away from Tamir camped the supporters for Barak's
rival, incumbent hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who
is seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
They erected Netanyahu's portrait placards and banners that
read "Netanyahu is the best man," ignoring the existence of the
opposite camp, but showing no signs of hatred or violence.
</P>
<P>
Tamir said that in comparison with the previous elections in
1996, the election campaign this year has been basically quiet and
peaceful, and supporters from different camps treated each other
politely.
</P>
<P>
Being asked about his feelings about the supporters for
Netanyahu, Tamir said with a smile, " they are mistaken."
</P>
<P>
With all the other three candidates bowing out of the race,
most Israeli voters have a much simplier choice: Netanyahu or
Barak.
</P>
<P>
"I will vote for Netanyahu. Barak is a good man, for his
family, but Netanyahu is good for Israel," a religious student
said, who held a banner supporting Netanyahu for a few hours under
scorching sun.
</P>
<P>
While trailing behind in opinion polls, Netanyahu seemed to
have to confront Barak even in one of his strongholds, the Mahane
Yehuda market in downtown Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"All the people in Mahane Yehuda support Bibi (Benjamin)," said
a middle-aged vegetable-seller who wears a knitted-cap, a symbol
of his religious identity. The market was the target of several
terrorist attacks in the last few years and people here tend to
back Netanyahu who has promised them security.
</P>
<P>
But another stall owner said, hastily and firmly, " Barak, of
course. Don't talk about Bibi, he has done nothing good for us."
</P>
<P>
At a small vegetable shed with several portraits of Netanyahu
above it, a dispute broke out when two friends began to talk about
their choice Monday.
</P>
<P>
"(I support) Netanyahu. He is strong," a man in his fifties
said, clenching his fist.
</P>
<P>
"No, Barak," his younger friend retorted.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu," the old man stressed, once again raising his
fist.
</P>
<P>
The Barak's supporter made a wry face toward the old man,
standing up and announcing to the crowded market," Barak."

<HEADLINE> Disputed Deputy Loses Turkish Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government has decided
to revoke the Turkish citizenship of the disputed deputy of
pro-Islamic Virtue Party (FP) Merve Kavakci, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the decision was published in the Official
Gazette on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet decided that Merve Kavakci had violated the Turkish
Citizenship Law by failing to nofity authorities of her
U.S. citizenship, the publication stated.
</P>
<P>
Under the Turkish law, Turkish citizens are required to inform
authorities when they acquire a second citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Interior Ministry announced previously that
they had not received any notification from Kavakci that she had
become a United States citizen.
</P>
<P>
Havakci had received a green card in the United States on May
2, 1992 and she became an American citizen on March 5,1999.
</P>
<P>
When she entered the parliament hall on May 2 for oath-taking,
Kavakci wore a headscarf according to Islamic tradition, causing
chaos in the parlaiment and protests from other political parties.
</P>
<P>
Later, Kavakci left the parliament without taking oath.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Kavakci said that she wore a headscarf because
of her religion faith, but the government regarded the headscarf
as a political statement advocating Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Kavakci is expected to lose her seat in the parliament after
the cabinet decision.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Yugoslav Residents Protest Nato Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- About 100 Yugoslav residents in
Zambia Sunday staged another protest at their embassy in Lusaka to
denounce the atrocities being perpetrated by Nato, which is
bombing and killing innocent people in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav community were joined by local Lusaka residents
and other groups in their protest.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Charge d' Affairs, Dusama Zupan, said the protest
will send strong massage for peace against war not only in
Yugoslavia but also throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
He said for almost two months, Yugoslav people have lived
under bombs and more than 1,300 civilians have been killed while
more than 6,000 have been maimed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
Zupan further said the assessment of damage caused in
Yugoslavia exceeds 100 billion U.S. dollars and more than 500,000
people have been left jobless because their factories and
companies have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The strength of Yugoslavians to defend their country lies in
the fact that it has support from many governments and countries
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Independent Monitoring Team President Alfred Zulu at
the same function said his organization has been lobbying civil
societies and the government to call for an end to the war in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Zulu said the war being waged by Nato in the Balkans is
against international law especially that it is contrary to the
Geneva Convention and prohibited armaments and weapon are being
used by Nato invaders.
</P>
<P>
He said the war is also against the economic interest of
Europe and Russia which uses the area for its imports and
exports.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way we can allow Yugoslavia, a sovereign,
independent, autonomous state to be reduced to dust when the
conflict can be resolved through diplomatic means," he said.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Slams U.S.-led NATO's Hegemonism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China's foremost newspaper, the
People's Daily, will publish an observer's article in Monday's
issue to strongly condemn the war launched by U.S.-led NATO
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The article, titled "Humanitarianism, or Hegemonism?" said that
from the first day the U.S.-led NATO began its military
intervention in Yugoslavia, the world people, including those of
the NATO countries, have strongly denounced it and urged it to
stop its bombing and seek a political solution to the Kosovo
crisis. But U.S.-led NATO went against the world people's wish and
has made airstrikes on Yugoslavia for more than 50 days, said the
article.
</P>
<P>
On May 7, the U.S.-led NATO launched a missile attack against
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, killing three, injuring more than
20 and severely damaging the embassy buildings. This crime, a rare
occurrence in the history of world diplomacy, was not only a
trampling on the basic principles of international laws, but also
a wanton violation of China's sovereignty, seriously hurting the
Chinese people's dignity, stressed the article.
</P>
<P>
Facts indicate that the NATO air raids against Yugoslavia are
an extremely brutal war launched by a strong military bloc against
a weak nation, said the article, adding that it thoroughly exposed
the true face of hegemonism, destroyed the peace and stability in
the Balkans and Europe and became a challenge to all peace-loving
and standing-for-independence states and people.
</P>
<P>
The aggressive war waged by the U.S.-led NATO is groundless in
terms of either morality or law, the article said, pointing out
that the alliance has an explicit intention to gain control of
Yugoslavia by its troops. Under its careful, pre-mediated
arrangement, according to the article, NATO can achieve its goal
either by compelling Yugoslavia to allow its troops' free entry
into Kosovo at the Rambouillet peace talks, or, if Belgrade
refuses to do so, by military intervention.
</P>
<P>
The article termed as "not tenable at all" the NATO's saying
that its military intervention against Yugoslavia was for "
safeguarding human rights" or "providing humanitarian aid."
</P>
<P>
NATO's military intervention against Yugoslavia under the
pretext of ethnic conflict is a sheer violation of the U.N.
Charter. "It is well-known that the United States and some other
NATO members have their various ethnic problems too, some of which
involve violence. In their hegemonic logic, then could other
countries or country blocs resort to wanton military intervention
against the United States or Britain under such excuses? If all
others follow suit, wouldn't there be a great disorder under
heaven, with no world peace and international security to talk
about?" the article asked.
</P>
<P>
Under the wanton and indiscriminate bombardment against
Yugoslavia, at least 1,200 people were killed, 5,000 others
wounded and nearly a million rendered refugees, causing heavy
damages to the country's civil facilities and an immediate loss of
hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars. Among the killed were 18
Yugoslav journalists and three Chinese journalists. "Is this
humanitarianism" or "safeguarding human rights?" the article asked.
</P>
<P>
By looking at their recent words and deeds, it is easy to know
what the real aim of the U.S. and NATO is in the current war.
</P>
<P>
First, the U.S. and NATO openly vowed to uproot Yugoslavia, "
the last red bastion in Europe." It is thus evident that
dismembering and destroying Yugoslavia is their set political aim.
NATO's strategic goal is to force Belgrade to submit and "dissolve
" in their so-called "democratic society" by means of political
pressure, economic sanctions, cultural infiltration and military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Second, the Balkan region has been a strategic area of
contention among major powers. With the admission of some
neighboring countries of Yugoslavia to NATO, the U.S.-led military
alliance regarded Belgrade, which has refused to join NATO, as an
obstacle to its eastward expansion. The U.S.-led NATO launched the
war so as to gain control of the Balkans and then open a door for
its further eastward expansion and the control of whole Europe.
</P>
<P>
Third, NATO wants to set a precedent for its implementation of
"new strategic concept." After internal discussions and
coordination, the NATO summit in Washington on April 25 announced
"The Strategic Concept of the Alliance" which aims to extend the
NATO defense area to territories beyond its member states and turn
NATO into an offensive and aggressive military bloc. The new
strategy stresses that NATO should "defend the values of democracy
" and "have freedom of action" when necessary. This is to say that
NATO could do whatever it likes without the authorization of the
United Nations on issues of security interests. It shows that NATO,
the most powerful military bloc since the Cold War, is becoming an
important tool for Washington in carrying out its hegemonism in
the world.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Slams U.S.-led NATO's Hegemonism (part II) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. had become the only superpower in the word after the
Cold War and was too impatient to build "a new world order" for
its sole dominate of the world. In December, 1998, the U.S. made
it clear that it aims to "lead the whole world" and will never
allow any country or country blocs to challenge its "leadership
status." The eastward expansion of NATO in Europe, the
strengthening of U.S.-Japanese military alliance in the Asian and
Pacific region and the launching of the current aggression against
Yugoslavia, all these constitute an important step in the U.S.
implementation of its global strategy for world hegemony.
</P>
<P>
More than a hundred years ago, the Eight-Power Allied Forces
from the West invaded China, forcing it to accept unequal treaties
that deprived China of its sovereign rights and humiliated it.
</P>
<P>
Today, the U.S.-led western powers rely on their hi-tech
weapons to bully and oppress a weak Yugoslavia, a kind of
repetition of the invasion of China by the Eight-Power Allied
Forces.
</P>
<P>
The only difference is, due to the change of time, the U.S.-led
NATO had to adopt certain new tricks in the pursuit of its
hegemonic objective and produce a new set of theories.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO alleged that, as the new millennium
approaches, the international community should change the
traditional norms governing international relations. "Some
important aspects of the principle of non-interference in internal
affairs should be limited," they said, adding that "a country's
sovereignty is not as important as human rights."
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the importance of military intervention and
advertised to engage in arms expansion and strengthen military
alliance among them. They branded their home-made theories and
strategies as "new interventionism."
</P>
<P>
Now, the U.S.-led NATO claims that it is "not fighting for land,
but for values." However, the real purpose behind that is nothing
but the imposition of the so-called values of "democracy, freedom
and human rights" upon other nations and make those nations their
dependents, the article pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Should any nation dare to oppose those values, they would exert
pressure on them and even resort to threat or use of forces. This
in essence is a new form of colonialism, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The so-called theory of "state sovereignty is not as important
as human rights" is extremely absurd and tampers with the basic
principles of international law, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
When a country's sovereignty is infringed and trampled, how
could human rights of that nation be protected? It asked.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its western allies are taking advantage of the
problem of human rights to wantonly violate the sovereign right of
other nations and interfere with their internal affairs. They
support those so-called "dissidents" and separatists so as to
carry out a new Cold War against the socialist countries and
developing countries, and to achieve their political objective of
"westernizing" and "splitting" these nations.
</P>
<P>
The article went on to point out that the armed interference
against Yugoslavia by the U.S.-led NATO is a continuation and
development of the "gunboat policy."
</P>
<P>
The condition for NATO's existence has disappeared when the
Cold War ended. However, instead of dismissing, the military bloc
expanded its organization, strengthened its functions and even
alleged to replace the U.N. by forming "an international
organization of democratic nations." This tendency of sticking to
arms expansion and strengthening of military alliance is a key
characteristic of the new development of hegemonism, the article
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The world pattern has undergone important and profound changes
in the ten years since the end of the Cold War. People from all
countries have a strong wish to safeguard world peace and
facilitate common development.
</P>
<P>
However, hegemonism still threatens world peace and security.
All nations and peoples that love peace and independence should
maintain high vigilance against the danger, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The aggressive war by the U.S.-led NATO against Yugoslavia has
met with brave resistance of the Yugoslav people and strong
opposition from the people of the world. Facts have proven that
hegemonism is very unpopular and any conspiracy of building a "new
world pattern" of hegemonism is doomed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO should immediately stop its wanton and
indiscriminate bombing and military interference against
Yugoslavia and return to the track of a political solution, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
NATO will face a thorough failure and severe punishment by
history if it continues to act against the trend of the time, the
article warned.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Women Granted Political Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti cabinet Sunday
approved a bill granting Kuwaiti women the right to vote and
contest in the elections of the National Assembly (parliament)
and the municipality by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The draft law was ratified in line with the desire of Kuwaiti
Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah to "award the Kuwaiti women for their
sincere national efforts and siding with the men in combating
Iraq's invasion in 1990," First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah told Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Jaber pledged to consider granting Kuwaiti women full
political rights in April 1991, shortly after the Gulf emirate was
freed from Iraq's seven-month occupation.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet's approval of the bill, which is still subject to
parliament ratification, is regarded as a victory for the women
living in this male-dominated country.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti constitution grants equal rights and obligations
for women and men, and women can take government posts, ranging
from ministry undersecretaries and assistant undersecretaries to
ambassadors and university presidents. But the election law denied
them the right to vote and be voted.
</P>
<P>
Women, who constitute half of the country's 740,000 population,
have been demanding these political rights for over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Previous proposals to grant women voting rights were all vetoed
by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah expressed belief that the new national assembly,
which will be elected out on July 3, "will not deny the right of
their sisters to practice their political rights."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Mordechai's Pullout, Blow for Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Center party leader
Yitzhak Mordechai announced on Sunday to rescind his candidacy
for premiership in the Monday elections.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's announcement represents another blow to incumbent
Prime Minister and the ruling Likud party leader Benjamin
Netanyahu, who is endeavoring to be re-elected in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Tel Aviv, Mordechai, said that
after consultations with his party's key members, he decided to
quit the race in order to bring Netanyahu and his government down
in the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
In a sobber mode, Mordechai said this was his second most
difficult desicion that he had to make in his whole life,
the first one was his resignation as the defense minister in
January.
</P>
<P>
Giving his reasons why he had to pull out of the reace,
Mordechai said his pullout was to avoid any bloodshed or political
conflicts that might heppen during the elections.
</P>
<P>
But he further pointed out that his main purpose of
withdrawal was to help enhance the chance for One Israel leader
Ehud Barak to beat Netanyahu in the first round of voting on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
As former defense minister, Mordechai was a key member of
Netanyahu's inner cabinet until January this year.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai broke away with Netanyahu due to the differences
over how to move the Middle East peace process forawrd and
Netanyahu's administrative methods that caused so much internal
conflicts among the ruling coalition parties.
</P>
<P>
In the Monday elections, who would be elected as the next prime
minister of Israel has drawn much attention not only among the
Israels, but also among the countries that show much concerns to
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is representing the the hardline political groups
that do not want to make more concessions such as to hand over
more territories to the the Palestinians and Barak is
representing the left that want to move the peace process head.
</P>
<P>
Weekend polls indicated that Barak could get about 49.5
percent of the total votes in the Monday elections after another
prime ministerial candidate, Balad leader Azmi Bishara, announced
his pullout of the race Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
After Mordechai's withdrawal, local polls said that Barak
could receive over 50 percent of the votes that he needs to beat
Netanyahu in the elections.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Europe Party Launched in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A new political party calling for
Britain to join the European single currency was launched on
Sunday with a prediction that it can win seats in June's European
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Pro-Euro Conservative Party was formed by two former
Conservative MEPs, John Stevens and Brendan Donnelly.
</P>
<P>
It plans to field 84 candidates in the European elections and
the leadership says there is a real chance the party will win some
seats.
</P>
<P>
Stevens and Donnelly quit the Tories in protest at leader
William Hague's decision to rule out joining the single currency
during this Parliament and the next.
</P>
<P>
Donnelly said: "Our basic appeal is to the many former and
current Conservative voters who have been appalled at the
Euro-sceptic drift of the Tories over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
"We want to give them the chance to vote both pro-Europe and
Conservative," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the proportional representation system used in the Euro
elections, the party is confident of its chances, according to
campaign manager Mark Littlewood.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Conservative Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine is reportedly planning to remain in parliament to fight
for Britain's admission to the single european currency.
</P>
<P>
The reports mean that Heseltine, a firm opponent of the Tory
leadership's anti-euro stance, would find himself in the same camp
as Labor and the Liberal Democrats and when Britain votes in a
referendum on the single currency.
</P>
<P>
"I can confirm that I intend to play a full and active role in
the referendum on the single currency, whenever the prime minister
chooses to hold it," Heseltine told the Sunday Express.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Peace Talks Put Off to May 24 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between Sierra Leonean
government and rebels in a bid to end eight years of civil war is
put off to May 24 in stead of the originally planned May 17, said
a senior diplomat in Freetown Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The delay is due to logistical reasons, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan agreed by both sizes, The United Nations
will airlift representatives of both President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) to Lome, capital of Togo
to start the much-desired peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Among the RUF demands are the unconditional release of their
leader, Foday Sankoh, establishment of a four-year transitional
government and withdrawal of all foreign troops including the
Nigeria-led West African Peace Keeping force, ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah and his cabinet is reportedly studying the rebels'
positions carefully.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah is under pressure to make peace with the rebels from
both the international community and regional power of Nigeria who
provides bulk of West African peace-keeping force of ECOMOG
supporting the Kabbah government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 17 (Xinhua) -- NATO warplanes kept bombing
civilian buildings in southwestern Kosovo over Sunday and Monday,
local press said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said that more than a dozen
missiles were fired against civilian buildings within half an hour
in the border region south of Prizren and in the region of
Orahovac.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav army opened anti-aircraft fires against NATO
warplanes during the attack, downing a Tomahawk cruise missile on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
NATO warplanes later launched attacks against another Kosovar
town of Pec in the west on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nine missiles were fired over Pristina, the capital town of the
southern province of Kosovo, where NATO aircraft first attacked
the village of Zagradska Hoca before resuming the attack for
another 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports on casualties from the local press
service which only said that minor damages were inflicted on the
civilian buildings under attack.
</P>
<P>
No air strikes were launched against Belgrade, the capital of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
But the Yugoslav air defense system fired anti-aircraft rounds
around the capital city late on Sunday to fend off unmanned
aircraft flying over the city.
</P>
<P>
Early on Monday, NATO warplanes attacked Uzice in western
Serbia, where several detonations were heard.

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Push Forward Opening Endeavor: Wu Yi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, one must also realize, since the level of economic
development varies from country to country, market opening in
different countries should not, and indeed can not, come in quick
march, she said.
</P>
<P>
Each must move forward actively and steadily based on the
actual circumstances, she added.
</P>
<P>
China has recently taken important steps towards liberalization
of telecommunications, banking, insurance, trade and commerce and
tourism, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the issue of China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Wu stressed that China's attitude is positive
and its position remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
However, China will never sacrifice its fundamental national
interests in exchange for entry to WTO, she added.
</P>
<P>
"I therefore do not want to see any country or anyone active in
the business community to set its requests on China too high," Wu
said. "Otherwise, it is neither in the interest of the stability
and development of the Chinese economy, nor in the best interest
of the economic globalization process."
</P>
<P>
She said that during the past year and more, the Asian economy
was overshadowed by the financial crisis, and economies hit by the
crisis suffered heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the international community, the crisis hit
economies are leveling out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We believe, after going through this disaster and when
solutions to the problems are found, the Asian economic
fundamentals as a whole will be much stronger and healthier, and
the prospects for the Asian economy will be brighter and more
splendid," she added.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Attempt to Split Up China Fails Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The 52nd World Health Assembly
rejected a proposal to admit Taiwan into it as an observer in the
agenda of the annual conference, thus foiling again Taiwan's
attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one China and one Taiwan" in
the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
As in the past two years, manipulated by Taiwan, a handful of
countries this year put forward the same proposal entitled "
Inviting Taiwan to participate in the World Health Assembly as an
observer."
</P>
<P>
But the proposal was opposed by the overwhelming majority of
the 191-member WHO at the level of the General Committee, which
decided by consensus not to include the proposal in the agenda of
the assembly.
</P>
<P>
The General Committee's decision was then accepted by consensus
at the plenary session of the World Health Assembly, the WHO's
highest governing body.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the plenary session, Chinese Vice Minister of
Health Wang Longde said, "The World Health Organization is a
United Nations specialized agency open to sovereign states. There
is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part
of China."
</P>
<P>
The issue of representation of China in both the United Nations
and the WHO has long been settled by relevant U.N. resolutions in
the early 1970's, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"The very fact that a handful of countries are proposing, as
instigated by Taiwan authorities, to invite the latter to
participate in the World Health Assembly attests to their
ignorance of the common legal sense and cannot but make their
proposal ridiculous and lacking seriousness," said Wang, also head
of the Chinese delegation.
</P>
<P>
In the mainland of China and in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, which has returned to the motherland and
retains its distinctive social system, Wang explained, the
residents have benefited from services of the WHO because the
provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities or the special
administrative region are parts of China, not because they
themselves are WHO members or participate in the World Health
Assembly as observers.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that Taiwan is not qualified to participate in the
World Health Assembly does not mean that there is no channel to
enable the 22 million Taiwan compatriots to benefit from WHO
services," Wang told the plenary session. "In fact, a multitude of
exchange activities in the health field has already been going on
across the Taiwan Straits."
</P>
<P>
"We made it very clear at the last assembly that, with regard
to the WHO services for the Taiwan compatriots, as long as the
Taiwan authorities bring it up to the central government in the
spirit of one China, we are convinced that both sides across the
Taiwan Straits can surely work out a proper solution," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the Taiwan authorities have not yet
responded positively to the central government's call but chosen
to instigate a handful of countries to raise the observer status
issues on a repeated basis.

between human rights and the US-led NATO attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade was warmly welcomed by university students
here today.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Zhang Hongyi of Beijing Normal University told the
students that the attack indicates that the so-called human rights
diplomacy of the United States is really a sham.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by the Ministry of Education and the
Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wenbo, an official of the Ministry of Education, said that
in the past few days, Chinese students have staged various kinds
of protest activities at the atrocity of the US-led NATO.
</P>
<P>
"The students have firmly endorsed and supported the central
government's solemn position to safeguard state sovereignty,
uphold justice and oppose aggression," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
After attending the seminar, many students said that they now
have a deeper understanding of what the so-called human rights in
the United States really means and they will study harder to
contribute to the prosperity of their motherland.

election-related incidents, including suspected ballot fraud,
punch-ups and stabbings, had occurred at some polling stations and
other places of the country, and police had detained some 40
people.

hundreds of thousands of citizens who have voted, it is all pretty
quiet," he said.

soliders have been stationed throughout the country to maintain
order.

seats and the incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and One
Israel leader Ehud Barak, who is also chairman of the opposition
Labor party, are the two candidates of the premiership.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the polling going on smoothly, most Palestinians were
being kept out of Israel during the vote. The Israeli army
announced a 24-hour closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
effective at Sunday midnight.
</P>
<P>
Weekend polls suggested that Barak would beat Netanyahu during
the Monday voting. If Netanyahu were defeated, he would remain in
office as a caretaker prime minister until his successor has
formed a government. the winner has 45 days to do that.
</P>
<P>
If no prime ministerial candidates won the Monday voting, then
a run-off will be held June 1.

<HEADLINE> Britain Denies Split with U.S. ahead Blair's Visit to Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
has denied split between the U.S. and the U.K. over the deployment
of ground troops in Kosovo, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Cook said there's no split with the U.S., and said that during
his planned trip to the United State on Thursday, he and the U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would be carrying out joint
interviews to show their "solidarity."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks ahead of Prime Minister Tony Blair's trip
to Bulgaria and Albania on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Blair is due to leave here in the afternoon for a visit to
Bulgaria and Albania - his second visit to the region since NATO's
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia began seven weeks ago, the BBC
television said.
</P>
<P>
Blair has recently tried to play down reports of a rift between
the governments of the U.K. and the U.S. over the eventual
deployment of ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times quoted a "highly placed government source" as
saying Blair had a "deep sense of frustration" at failing to
persuade U.S. President Bill Clinton to send in troops.
</P>
<P>
But in an interview with the Observer, Blair praised the U.S.
for its "commitment and leadership" in the Balkan campaign.
</P>
<P>
Cook also told BBC that NATO was determined to intensify the
pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
"We have always wanted a settlement met our bottom line that
the refugees are able to return to Kosovo under the protection and
assistance of a NATO force," he said.

project here in China and the capability of Australia to be a
significant source of LNG," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A team of the United Nations
international staff Monday arrived in the largest city of northern
Afghanistan Mazar-i-Sharif, the first visit by U.N. members in one
and half years, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The six-member team will stay in Mazar-i-Sharif, capital of
Balkh province, till May 19 to figure out how to establish
international presence there.
</P>
<P>
U.N. international staff pulled out of the city in September
1997 when the U.N. offices were stormed and looted.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. announced to gradually send humanitarian workers back
to Afghanistan last March after reaching an agreement with the
Taliban to ensure security of the U.N. international and national
staff.
</P>
<P>
The organization withdrew all its international staff from
Afghanistan in August 1998 following the killing of an Italian
U.N. official and two local U.N. workers.
</P>
<P>
Several teams of U.N. international staff have visited Kabul,
Jalalabad and Kandahar as part of its plan to assess relief
operations in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. also plans to send a team of its international staff
to Badakhshan shortly to monitor relief activities in the
northeastern province.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. also intends to send international staff shortly to
the central province of Bamiyan, where fighting between the
Taliban and the Northern Alliance is going on.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials, however, emphasized that the Taliban must
fulfill their commitments concerning the security of U.N. staff in
Afghanistan and if they fail to keep it, the organization will
consider withdrawing again its staff from the country.

<HEADLINE> Resinged Coach Xu Appologizes to Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, Liaoning Province, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Xu Genbao
appologized to the club and fans after the Dalian Wanda's head
coach regined on Monday, saying that he was deeply sorry for a
team disappointed season.
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest loss in my coaching career," said Xu, who
giuded the Wanda to its third-successive league title last year.
But Dalian was six-draw and two-loss this season. "I appologize to
the club, the fans and to the city Dalian."
</P>
<P>
Xu, 55, former national assistant coach in 1993 and head coach
of two national Olympic teams in earlier 1990s, delivered his
resignation after a 2-1 defeat to the promoting side Qingdao
Hainiu on May 9.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai native, the two-time Best Coach of the Month in
Asia, has been at the center of critics for the dismal
performances of the Wanda this season as the Chinese football
powerhouse won no single league match so far after eight rounds
and is moaning at the basement in the standings with another
promoting side Wuhan Heart K.
</P>
<P>
The Wanda also failed its Asian Club Championship journey in
April when the last season's finalist lost twice in the finals
round of the Asian premier club competition in Teheran, Iran,
finishing fourth.
</P>
<P>
He delievered his second resignation following a 2-2 draw by
Shenyang Haishi last month.
</P>
<P>
"It's all my fault to guide the club to such an embarrassing
moment. I take the blame by heart," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
But the club chairman Wang Jianlin stood up to back Xu and
condemned the irresponsiblity of some veteran players of the squad.
</P>
<P>
"Some old players even do not join the routing trainings, and
never committed to any game in the season," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang also blamed anonymously a forward for not scoring a goal
after eight games.
</P>
<P>
"The club also should take some blame," Wang added. "We did not
give much attention to the second team and received penalties when
the first team could not hold onto their top level."

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Army Joins Fight Against Production of Drug Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi army has been
conducting various operations against the production of drug
materials and made progress in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT),
over 200 kilometers southeast of here.
</P>
<P>
The remote and inaccessible areas of the CHT, which consists of
three districts of Rangamati, Khagrachari and Bandarban, are being
used for plantation of opium, hashish and poppy crops, the
official news agency BSS Monday reported quoting a press release
of the army.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of reliable reports, the army and the local
governments made a decision in March this year to combat the drug
abuse in keeping with directive of the government. Since then, the
army has conducted a number of anti-drug operations in the area.
</P>
<P>
During these operations, the army, in close cooperation with
the local governments, has recovered about 630 kilograms of ganja,
over two kilograms of poppy, four kilograms of poppy seeds and 400
grams of opium seeds and destroyed about three acres (1.2
hectares) of standing opium and one acre (0.04 hectares) of poppy
plants.
</P>
<P>
Similar types of anti-drug operations were also carried out by
the army with assistance from local administration and other
security agencies last year, during which a notable amount of
drugs was recovered while standing opium, hashish and poppy plants
on vast areas were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Unscrupulous drug traders in the CHT have been encouraging the
poverty-stricken hilly people to cultivate the drug materials by
alluring them with a huge amount of money, according to the
release.
</P>
<P>
At present, the army is assisting the poor people of the
inaccessible areas with cash money and other necessaries to
rehabilitate them and motivate in alternate crop production. the
release added.

<HEADLINE> Wanda Coach Xu Resigns (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, Liaoning Province, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Xu Genbao
resigned as the head coach of the slumping Dalian Wanda after a
miserable season for the defending champion in the Chinese
professional soccer league, the club confirmed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Club chairman Wang Jianlin told a news conference that Xu
Genbao, along with his assistant Liu Zhicai, stepped down their
posts. Former second-division side Chongqing Hongyan coach Li
Yingfa, a Dalian native, takes over as the new head coach.
</P>
<P>
The Wanda, who was three-time in succession league's champion,
has not won a single match after eight rounds in the season,
moaning at the bottom of the standings with promoting side Wuhan
Heart K on six points from six draws and two losses.
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest loss in my coaching career," said Xu, who
guided Wanda to the league title last season in his first-year
spell in the Northeast club.
</P>
<P>
Xu, 55, a native in Shanghai, led Shanghai Shenhua to the
league championship and Super Cup title as the head coach in 1995.
Shenhua also stormed into the final of the League Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
As an assistant coach to German Klaus Schlappner in the
national team, Xu failed to qualify for the World Cup finals from
the Asian/Ocean Zone in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"After the defeat in Kuala Lumpur (in the World Cup final
qualifiers), this is another complete denial to my job," Xu added.
</P>
<P>
"I think I should sit down and examine my coaching career."
</P>
<P>
Wang sung high of Xu's work in the club, "It's hard for me to
receive Xu's resignation. He's the most committed coach I have
seen in my life."
</P>
<P>
Both Xu and the new head coach Li presented in Monday's news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Li, tagged one of the best coach in China, had his most
successive coaching experiences in the 1980s' when he guided
Liaoning to nine straight championships both in the first-division
league and the league cup.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident with the Wanda," Li said. "I will take it to its
top level as soon as possible."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese people have vowed to
firmly support the government's determination to unswervingly
carry out its independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, people across the nation have earnestly
studied President Jiang Zemin's speech last week, which honored
the Chinese journalists and embassy staff in Belgrade and
elaborated on China's position on international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have condemned the invasive behavior and
hegemonism of the U.S.-led NATO and pledged to further strive for
peace and development across the world.
</P>
<P>
Qi Huaiyuan, President of the Chinese People's Association for
Friendship with Foreign Countries, described as "all correct" the
Chinese government's position on dealing with the brutal action by
the U.S.-led NATO.
</P>
<P>
"We whole-heartedly endorse the solemn stand by the Chinese
government on safeguarding state sovereignty and national security,
" Qi, former vice foreign minister, said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Weiying, an associate professor of the Chinese People's
University, said that President Jiang's speech, in which he
reiterated China's independent foreign policy of peace, not only
tallies with the domestic conditions but also conforms to the
current international situation.
</P>
<P>
"The speech, while showing China's determination to safeguard
state sovereignty and national security, also expressed China's
willingness to further expand friendly cooperation with other
countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence," said Huang Jin, a professor with the Wuhan
University.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese residents believe that the international situation
has undergone profound changes in the post-cold war era and people
all over the world want to maintain world peace and promote
development, and expect to establish a new international order of
justice and fairness.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their confidence that the Chinese people, under
the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party with Jiang Zemin at
the core, are capable of coping with any provocation and
contributing to maintaining world peace and the fight against
hegemonism.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Considers Stopping IMF Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Though Thailand decided to continue
receiving financial and technical support from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), it will review the possibility of stopping
the support in the next few months, Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said that the government continued to ask for the
next-phase disbursement of the IMF bailout loans as well as
technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
Under the IMF bailout package agreed when Thailand was first
hit by the financial crisis in mid-1997, Thailand will receive an
overall loan of 17.2 billion U.S. dollars from the IMF. So far,
some 13 billion dollars have already been disbursed to the country
phase by phase.
</P>
<P>
The Thai authorities and IMF officials had agreed recently that
a new lot of the bailout package of 500 million dollars would be
soon disbursed to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
However, the government would review in August whether Thailand
would still need the remaining disbursements from the
Washington-based financial body.
</P>
<P>
The decision followed a recent report from the Bank of
Thailand, the country's central bank, that Thailand's
international foreign reserves stood at 30.7 billion dollars as of
May 7, reflecting that Bangkok might no longer need to ask for
more loans from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a group of IMF officials, who came to
Thailand for the latest assessment of the country's progress on
economic reforms, expressed their satisfaction with the Thai
government's achievement, saying that the government no longer had
to submit letters of intent to the IMF for further disbursement of
the remaining loans.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin said the government now wanted state enterprises to help
stimulate economic activities by speeding up their investment
plans.
</P>
<P>
As for a new Japanese initiative to lend Asian countries an
overall of 17 billion dollars loan to guarantee their issuance of
bonds, Tarrin said that a study must be carefully conducted on
whether the country would need the assistance before the
government decides whether to apply for the loan or not.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Continue Opening-up Steadfastly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Despite the attack on the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade by US-led NATO, a senior Beijing official has
declared that the Chinese capital will continue to carry out its
policy of opening-up steadfastly, protect foreigners legally
studying and working here and welcome overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
 Jia Qinglin, the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Chinese
Communist Party Committee, gave the assurance this afternoon to
representatives from 29 trans-national companies stationed in
Beijing, such as Motorola, Erricson, Nokia and Panasonic.
</P>
<P>
 Jia stressed: "The U.S.-led NATO's attack on the Chinese
Embassy has caused great anger among the Chinese people and we
obviously firmly support the Chinese Government's solemn statement
about this unwarranted attack."
</P>
<P>
 "However, Chinese leaders have affirmed repeatedly that China
will further improve opening to the outside world and carry out
economic and trade cooperation with other countries on the basis
of equality and mutual benefits," said Jia.
</P>
<P>
 He also confirmed that as the focus and window of the
country's opening-up, Beijing will accelerate its step of
modernization.
</P>
<P>
 Jia said that according to Beijing's economic development
strategy, the municipality will make it a priority to develop the
hi-tech industry, environmental protection and energy-saving, and
the transformation of traditional industries using high technology.
</P>
<P>
 He also revealed that the city is going to adopt a batch of
tentative measures to attract investment from at home and abroad
to establish more research and development institutions.
</P>
<P>
 Beijing's foreign trade registered a stable growth in the
first quarter of this year. Statistics show that the city actually
used foreign funds of 1.06 billion U.S. dollars during the period,
up 12.4 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
 The number of overseas tourists visiting Beijing reached 400,
000, up 7.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chain Stores Booming In China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economic experts believe that a country with an average per
capita income of 250 to 300 U.S. dollars is capable of developing
a sustainable chain store sector. In 1994, per capita income of
China's urban residents reached 3,197 yuan (370 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years China has established 71 enterprises
with annual sales volume exceeding 100 million yuan and 121
enterprises with more than 50 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's two largest chain stores-- the Shanghai Lianhua and the
Hualian corporations each have 3 billion yuan of annual sales and
more than 350 branch stores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, some world famous chain store enterprises are
investing more in China's vast market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that their participation undoubtedly reduced the
market share of domestic competitors, but their modern marketing
strategy is "a useful complement to China's overall commercial
pattern."
</P>
<P>
Observers say that although the industry is growing at a high
speed, it still has great market potential. Many domestic chain
store industries are now eyeing China's vast rural market as a
main strategy to expand sales outlets.

<HEADLINE> Two Universities Join Hands in Running Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing University President Chen
Jia'er and his Qinghua University counterpart Wang Dazhong today
signed an agreement on jointly running schools, which will benefit
future generations of students.
</P>
<P>
The program will put the emphasize on talent training, the
building up of teaching groups, scientific research, international
exchanges and campus services.
</P>
<P>
The two universities will invite famous professors to give
lectures, provide consultative services to graduate students from
the counterpart university, and exchange their teaching
curriculums.
</P>
<P>
Teachers and students in Beijing University and Qinghua
University will from today share libraries and labs. The two
universities will apply for major scientific programs together,
and strengthen academic and campus cultural exchanges between them.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dazhong said, "history and reality told us that only with
strong national strength can we protect our sovereignty and safety.
Beijing and Qinghua universities should strive to become world
recognized first-rate universities and make contributions to
improve China's comprehensive national strength."
</P>
<P>
This cooperation is based on the experiences of the
Southwestern Union University and will help nurture more excellent
talents for China's modernization construction.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Education Zhou Qingyuan said that he hoped it
would benefit the strategy of "Revitalizing China with Science and
Education."
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the two universities can be traced back to
the Chinese people's struggle against Japanese invaders in the
1930s. The Southwestern Union University, located in Kunming in
Yunnan Province, was a cooperative venture between Beijing
University, Qinghua University and Nankai University.

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda Habitat Opens in HK Ocean Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Giant Panda Habitat was
opened in Hong Kong's Ocean Park on Monday.
</P>
<P>
 An An and Jia Jia are the two giant pandas bestowed by
China's central government to the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
 An An, male, is about 14 years old and Jia Jia, female, is
about 21 years old. They were both rescued from the wild and
resided at the Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan before coming to
Hong Kong's Ocean Park.
</P>
<P>
 The habitat is built with a sponsorship of 40 million HK
dollars (5.13 million U.S. dollars) from the Hong Kong Jockey Club,
while Ocean Park shoulders the remaining 40 million HK dollars.
Measuring around 2,000 square meters, the habitat closely
resembles giant pandas' natural habitat in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
 The Ocean Park has initiated the establishment of the Hong
Kong Society for Panda Conservation with a view to educating the
public and promoting the protection of giant pandas and their
habitat.
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at the opening ceremony, Chairman of the Ocean Park
Board of Directors Payson Cha said that An An and Jia Jia's
presence here in Hong Kong will remind all the people how fragile
the continued existence of the giant panda and many other
endangered species is in the world today.
</P>
<P>
 "We will encourage people of all ages to come and make
friends with these two adorable giant pandas; and we will
encourage them to return home with a commitment to supporting
animal welfare and conservation," Cha said.
</P>
<P>
 Present at the ceremony were Wu Yi, China's state councilor,
Tung Chee Hwa, HKSAR chief executive, and others.

HONG KONG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa said here Monday that Asia will again emerge as an
influential player in the 21st century despite economic setbacks
over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the remarks at the 32nd International General
Meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC), which opened
here Monday.
</P>

"The challenges in the years to come for all of us in Asia are
for the economy in Asia to confront the need for reform head-on
and to tackle the reform with resolve and with determination,"
Tung told the conference.
</P>
<P>
"As financial markets settle and confidence gradually return to
Asia, we set out on our immediate task of putting ourselves back
on the road to recovery," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said as Asia recovers from the financial turmoil, Hong
Kong must be positioned to take full advantage of Asia's recovery.
Hong Kong's future also lies in even greater participation in the
growing Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is many of the critical success factors of Asia's
past success are still with us today," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"First and foremost, many countries in Asia need to instill
more discipline and need to carry out reform," he said.
</P>

"The leaders of each respective economy must have the political
will and determination to make far-sighted and often difficult
decisions," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Encouraged to Visit Museums Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- All museums in Chinese big cities
will open to the public free of charge tomorrow, marking the 22nd
anniversary of World Museum Day.
</P>
<P>
This is an attempt by the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage (SACH) to encourage people across the nation to discover
the joys to be found in the museums.
</P>
<P>
Museums visitors will also be provided with free advice and
information about cultural relics and other special items which
could be rarely obtained outside museums, a SACH official told
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, nationwide relics protection
departments administer more than 1,200 museums which house over
nine million relics. Some 90 million people visit over 7,000
exhibitions that are sponsored by museums on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another 600 specialized museums on agriculture,
science and technology, culture, and folk traditions provide
regular exhibitions for visitors.
</P>
<P>
Industrialist and educationalist Zhang Jian initiated the
museum industry in China in 1905 with his Nantong Museum.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the public only had access to two: the Palace Museum and the
National History Museum, which is the predecessor of the Museum of
Chinese History.
</P>
<P>
Museums in China are not well attended usually by the people
and recent surveys show that ordinary Chinese did not regard
museums as their first choice or favorite venues to visit during
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the SACH introduced in 1997 the annual selection of
the top 10 exhibitions in an effort to encourage museums to
arrange quality shows.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China marked the 31st World
Telecommunication Day, which has the theme of "e-commerce", by
launching a "government on-line" project today.
</P>
<P>
At a launch ceremony, Minister of Information Industry Wu
Jichuan confirmed that China now has 12 million personal computers
and 1.54 million Internet users.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in recent years information services have
been growing rapidly in China. Now, a public data and multi-media
network covers more than 2,000 counties, cities and townships
around the country, with 744,000 mainframe computers linked to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Ligui, head of the country's largest Internet service
provider and operator China Telecom, said that the company has
followed closely the latest developments of services and
technology in the international telecommunication sector.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China Telecom has extended the Internet service
to almost every place that is linked with a telephone line.
</P>
<P>
He said that the company will soon put into operation an ATM
wide-band data network, expanding the band-width of the existing
network to 155 mega bites per second. It will also increase the
total capacity of the country's outlets to international data
networks to 134 mega bites per second.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that in order to accelerate the development of e-
commerce in China, the Ministry of Information Industry (MII) is
working closely with other relevant government departments on
formulating plans, methods, technological standards and
regulations and laws. He said that the MII will focus on solving
the key technological problems such as on-line security,
identification and payment.
</P>
<P>
He added that the general lack of scientific training and
traditional habits are major obstacles to the application and
spread of e-commerce in China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the on-going "government on-line" project will
serve as a good model for the application of e-commerce which is
the most widely used part of the Internet service worldwide.
Hundreds of thousands of companies and over 1,500 banks around the
world have already adopted this new form of doing business.
Annual turnover of business on-line exceeds eight billion US
dollars at present. The figure is expected to grow to 450 billion
US dollars by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Greece Accuses Turkey of Violation of Territorial Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday accused neighboring
Turkey of violating its territorial waters in the eastern Aegean
Sea.
</P>
<P>
Two Turkish boats carrying some 20 journalists Monday entered
Greek territorial waters near the uninhabited rocky islet of Imia,
which is 3.8 nautical miles off the coast of Turkey and 11
nautical miles from the Greek island of Kalymnos, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He accused Turkey of choosing a path that is not in the
interests of Turkey itself.
</P>
<P>
Two of the people on the boats jumped into the sea and appeared
to be making for the coast of the deserted islet but returned to
the boats shortly afterwards when told they would not be allowed
to approach Imia, a 450-square-meter islet.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish boats left later after being warned by a Greek
patrol boat, Reppas said, adding that Greek coast guards were not
required to take any action and there had been no shots fired.
</P>
<P>
The entire incident reportedly occurred under watch of a
Turkish patrol boat sailing in Turkish territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have
been strained for their dispute in the territorial waters, air
space and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has questioned Greece's sovereignty over some islands in
the eastern Aegean Sea, but Greece has insisted that the islands
are in fact Greek in accordance with the treaty of Lausanne in
1923 and the peace treaty of Paris in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Greece has maintained that if Turkey believes it has a case it
should resort to the International Court at the Hague, but Turkey
has refused to do so.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fierce Telecoms Competition Emerging in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The China Jitong Tele-
communication Co. Ltd. today opened an IP telephone experimental
network in Tianjin, the biggest port city in north China, as well
as providing such services to local consumers.
</P>
<P>
 The city now has three large-scale telecommunication
companies -- China Telecom, China Unicom and Jitong, offering
telephone services, and become the market with the most fierce
competition in telecommunications anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
 As the cost of IP telephone calls is much cheaper than fixed
lines, most insiders are bullish about its prospects.
</P>
<P>
 Since the newly-established IP telephone network is still at
an experimental stage, only 12 Chinese cities, including Beijing,
Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, can provide such services at present.
</P>
<P>
 Insiders also pointed out that China Telecom and China Unicom,
the country's two biggest telecommunication companies, have
greatly improved Tianjin's telecommunication industry over the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
 And Jitong's arrival in the city will further activate the
local telecommunication market and hopefully help lower telephone
fees.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Urges Flood Prevention in Yellow River Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Local governments along the lower
reaches of the Yellow River have been asked to step up efforts in
flood prevention in case of any severe flooding this year.
</P>
<P>
Wen Jiabao, vice premier and concurrently chief of the State
Headquarters for Flood Control and Drought Relief, made the
request during an inspection tour of Shandong and Henan provinces
along the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
"The Yellow River, the second longest in China, has safely
withstood flooding seasons for the past 49 years, but the
possibility of a severe flooding has been increasing," Wen said.
</P>
<P>
The central government has attached great importance to flood
prevention in the Yellow River area and appropriated more funds
for water conservancy projects since last year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the situation is looking rather difficult in terms
of flood prevention along the river this year, Wen said that both
the army and the local people are shouldering huge responsibility
and should make full preparations to cope with possible flooding.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the importance of securing the quality of water
conservancy projects, stressing that flood prevention funds should
be properly used in order to produce economic and social
efficiency as much as possible.

<HEADLINE> Iran Interested in Expanding Tehran-Nicosia Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament) Speaker
Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri on Monday expressed Tehran's interest in
further expanding relations with Cyprus in all fields.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Speaker of the Cypriot House of
Representatives Spyros Kyprianou, Nouri said the two parliaments
played a key role in further promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
While expressing dissatisfaction over the present level of
bilateral economic ties, Nouri expressed the hope that trade ties
between the two countries would be boosted to a suitable level
in the future through efforts of both private and public sectors.
</P>
<P>
Nouri also underlined the two countries' cooperation within
the framework of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), adding
member countries can solve problems facing the movement through
further convergence, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran respects the territorial integrity of other
countries and believes in non-interference of aliens in their
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that problems facing Cyprus would be solved
through peaceful means and dialog under the U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
Interference by foreign forces in regional and internal
affairs of other countries has further aggravated problems of
those countries, the Iranian speaker said, adding the presence of
American forces in the Persian Gulf under the pretext of
preserving security in the region has disturbed security in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the countries in the region can best maintain peace
and stability in the region through cooperation and convergence.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou, who arrived here Sunday night for a three-day
official visit, said his visit to Iran would open a new
chapter in bilateral relations through cooperation between
parliaments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus attaches great importance to ties with
Iran, calling for promotion of parliamentary relations between the
two countries and closer cooperation in more specialized areas.

JAKARTA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 elementary school
students were killed and 18 others seriously injured when the bus
in which they were traveling hit the curb of a road bend in Ciater
village of Indonesia's West Java province Sunday.

The source believed the bus met the accident after its brakes
gave way.
</P>
<P>
A contributing factor seemed to be that the bus driver was
unfamiliar with the conditions of the road which had many sharp
bends.

The students from Kertajaya elementary school in Kerawang were
on the way to Mt. Tangkuban Perahu and Ciater for recreation, said

<P>
LAGOS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government Monday
published the country's new constitution to take effect on May 29,
binding the incoming civilian government.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution provides that the president-elect, General
Olusegun Obassanjo must appoint no fewer than 36 ministers with at
least one minister coming from each state of the federation.
</P>
<P>
The constitution limits the powers of the National Assembly,
the country' s parliament, to fix salaries for high-ranking
officials including the president, justices of supreme and appeal
courts, and auditor-generals etc., by creating a ceiling which
cannot be exceeded.
</P>
<P>
The constitution further restricts the president's power to
declare war by setting "the sanction of a resolution of the
National Assembly sitting in a joint session" as a prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution, education at all levels shall be
provided free to students. The government should take efforts to
promote science and technology.
</P>
<P>
It also provides that the National Assembly shall take into
account the allocation principles -- especially those of
population, equality of states, internal revenue generation, land
mass, terrain as well as population density.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution will legalize "the fourth republic" of
Nigeria which Nigerians hoped could re-secure their country from
decades-long mismanagement and the collapse of its economy.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar said here Monday that he expects "a serious breakthrough
towards a political settlement of the Kosovo conflict" within the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
The general principles for such a settlement, worked out by the
Group-8 nations, the European Union and NATO, "contain criteria
that may switch the conflict over to the rails of political
settlement," Aznar said after meeting Russian special envoy for
the Balkans Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Aznar arrived here late Sunday on a three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, for his part, said "the main thing is to use
these principles as the basis of a U.N. resolution on the Balkans.
"
</P>
<P>
"First of all, it is necessary to stop the bombing raids and
then to implement all these conceived measures," Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
He called for the intensification of the ongoing talks, warning
that "if we all continue to go roundabout all the time, nothing
will be resolved, and we shall lose precious time."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin is expected to fly to Helsinki in the next few
days to meet Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
Russia said last week that Ahtisaari would travel to Belgrade
together with Chernomyrdin, but the U.S. State Department said
that would not happen.
</P>
<P>
Tass said Chernomyrdin is expected to fly to Belgrade later
this week for talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
the third such trip since NATO started its bombing campaign 54
days ago.

<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are determined
to seek the source of the Mekong River, a world renowned river in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed as "The Danube of the East", the 4,880-km-long river
runs through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.
The 2,130-km section upstream in China is known as the Lancang
River.
</P>
<P>
"However, there are at least five different arguments about its
source," said Gao Dengyi, executive vice-chairman of the China
Association of Scientific Expeditions. He added, none of the
arguments have enough scientific proof, and this is the reason his
association is organising the new expedition.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the origin of the river, in Yushu Prefecture
in northwest China's Qinghai Province, is densely dotted with
tributaries and glaciers.
</P>
<P>
"We must conduct a large scale investigation of the whole
region, compare the tributaries' lengths and flow volume and then
determine the source of the river with satellite positioned
instruments," explained Gao.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chinese scientists will make a thorough
investigation of the water, glacier, biological and mineral
resources around the origin of the river.

<HEADLINE> NATO Says Air Strike Hampered by Poor Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

BRUSSELS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Most NATO air activities against
Yugoslavia were canceled due to poor weather conditions during the
last 24 hours, NATO said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A NATO spokesmen told reporters here that only 58 sorties flew
on the 54th day of the air war against Yugoslavia, adding air
operation continued over southwest Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Since the first day of this month, NATO has escalated its air
operations throughout Yugoslavia with an average of 600 sorties
each day, while it caused several serious civilian damages
including bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, killing
three Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
General Walter Jertz told reporters that a small number of Serb
armor, military vehicles and artillery positions were struck
Sunday. He also confirmed that an unmanned NATO plane was shot
down Sunday night even though he had said all NATO aircraft
returned safely.
</P>
<P>
The NATO spokesmen also said they expect "better weather in the
region until at least Thursday, which will allow for more
intensified operations."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook also gave a
news briefing here at NATO headquarters before joining other
European Union foreign ministers to seek a diplomatic way to solve
the Balkan crisis.
</P>

Cook ruled out any immediate employment of the ground troops.
He said NATO has so far no plan to launch a major ground invasion
to face organized army resistance. He reiterated that NATO forces
will escort refugees to return home. However, he said that NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana will review the situation with
NATO military chiefs before deciding on when and how to deploy
ground troops.

<HEADLINE> Zambian C. Bank Assures Stable Forex Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia Monday assured
that the continued inflow of donor funds will result in sustained
stability in the foreign exchange market of the country.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the central bank Jacob Mwanza said here that Zambia
has met the conditions set by its donors such as those relating to
government budget, international reserves and other structural
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Mwanza said that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has
already released 14 million U.S. dollars while the World Bank has
also given Zambia 65 million dollars and the European Union (EU)
has released another 35 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is expecting to receive another eight million dollars
from the African Development Bank soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor said the continued inflow of fund is an indicator
of the confidence of the donors in the Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
The inflation, which stood at about 31.6 percent in January
this year has had gone down, he noted, adding that the trend is
expected to remain stable as more money is expected to be released
on the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Mwanza attributed the stability of the foreign exchange market
to the increased reserves of Zambia's central bank and improved
non-traditional exports of the country.

<HEADLINE> Plans Unveiled to Promote Australia as Global Financial Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard unveiled Monday a number of ambitious strategies to develop
Australia as a global financial center, an idea which has been
advocated by high ranking government officials since last year.
</P>
<P>
The plans included establishing a task force, comprised of
members of the private sector, to look at the issue and the
reopening of a Treasury office in Singapore, the prime minister
told a press conference in Sydney, the country's financial center.
</P>
<P>
Australian Minister for Financial Services and Regulation Joe
Hockey would become a roving ambassador to promote Australia as a
financial center.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and
the Australian Financial Institutions Commission (AFIC) would work
to collect data to benchmark Australia's performance and assist
"the long term development of policy options to promote Australia
as a center for global financial services," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
He said Australia offered attractions as a regional financial
center that few other countries could offer, including a stable
economy and a stable, prudently regulated banking system.
</P>
<P>
"First and foremost we have a stable economy, we have an
economy that last year grew stronger than any economy in the
industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Asian economic crisis since mid-1997, the
Australian economy grew by 4.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We have a strong, stable, well supervised and prudently
regulated banking system and we have clear and coherent body of
law," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said there would also be an extensive
promotion campaign and a range of education and training
initiatives to help Australia become a key training ground for the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
He also used the occasion to promote his troubled tax reform as
essential for materializing his ambitious plan.
</P>
<P>
"Any hope we have of making Australia a global financial center
will be gravely threatened, if not totally destroyed, unless we
can get fundamental taxation reform," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"We do have taxation laws at the moment which discourage the
further promotion of Australia as a financial center," he said.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, he made public his taxation reform plan, known
as goods and services tax (GST) package, in a bid to replace the
"ramshackle, out-of-date wholesale tax system with a modern
internationally competitive broad based indirect tax."
</P>
<P>
However, his reform plans are in jeopardy after Independent
Senator Brian Harradine, who holds the balance of power in the
Australian Senate, said Friday he would vote with Labor and the
Democrats in opposition to block the GST.

Association in Myanmar Monday submitted a letter to Chinese
Ambassador Liang Dong here, strongly condemning the bloody crimes
of missile attacks by U.S.-led NATO against the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade on May 7.
</P>
<P>
The letter said, "NATO's barbaric acts violated the U.N.
Charter and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations as well
as the basic norms governing international relations." It was
also a deliberate infringement on China's sovereignty and
provocation to the peace-loving nations and people all over the
world, it added.
</P>
<P>
The letter expressed the utmost indignation and strong
condemnation against the NATO's acts, firmly supporting the solemn
stand of the Chinese government and all its measures taken.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The China Forum of the Credit
Lyonais Securities Asia (CLSA), held in Beijing last week, was
very successful with 130 international investors attending the
session, a CLSA researcher said here today.
</P>
<P>
Plus government officials and representatives of multinational
corporations, the total number of delegates to the forum was 250,
said Jing Ulrich, managing director of Greater China Research of
CLSA.
</P>
<P>
Many international investors wanted to see with their own eyes
what was happening in China, she added.
</P>
<P>
Ulrich, who conducts research mainly on economic development of
the Chinese mainland, said that although many of China's
enterprises did not achieve very good results in the whole year of
1998, the results achieved in the second half of the year were
encouraging compared with the first half, she said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds are now interested in buying China-related shares
-- H shares and Red Chips -- for the strong fundamentals of
China's economy and the low price of the shares, Ulrich said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Head of State Replies Critics on Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State Abdulsalam
Abubakar has replied critics on his administration for depleting
the federal reserve by citing oil price slump and the expended
necessary spending.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing head of state said at the weekend that though
inheriting a reserve of six billion U.S. dollars, his government
immediately faced an oil price slump after its taking over last
June.
</P>
<P>
"You are aware that we conducted elections in this country. I
inherited some commitment that I cannot go back on like the
hosting of ' Nigeria 99'," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have inherited problems in the joint venture cash call which
was threatening the oil industry. I have to make sure that it is
paid."
</P>
<P>
"Within 10 months, we have just solved quite a lot of things
that in normal circumstances would take the whole administration
quite a number of years," he noted, adding that "we also had to
review the minimum salary. All this cost money."
</P>
<P>
He said it was very unfair for somebody to sit down and accuse
the administration of looting the treasury, pointing out that
everything he had done was there to be seen by those who cared o
see.
</P>
<P>
On his life after retirement, he said that after serving the
country for 35 years, whether or not he became the head of state,
he should have retired last year.
</P>
<P>
It would be easy for him to adjust since he was a civilian
after all before becoming a soldier, he said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Sharply Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares suffered their
biggest one day fall since October 1997, with fears that interest
rates are about to rise in the United States hitting the banking
and finance sector.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index closed 2.18 percent, or 66.7
points, lower at 2,988.3 points.
</P>
<P>
In points terms, the fall was the sharpest since the 177.8
point fall on October 28, 1997, when concern about the economic
crisis in Asia impacted the market.
</P>
<P>
The drop on the Australian market followed a sell off on Wall
Street where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.75 percent or
193.9 points to 10,913.3.
</P>
<P>
On the Australian market, the banking sector was bearing the
brunt of most of the pessimism.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank plummeted 1.20 Australian dollars to
25.50 Australian dollars, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia lost
95 cents to 24.70 Australian dollars and ANZ bank was down 65.2
cents to 11.325 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Westpac bank, which is due to release its half year results
Tuesday, dropped 39.1 cents at 10.64 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the banking sector impacted the all industrials
index which fell 2.60 percent, or 139.6 points, to 5,230.8 points.
</P>
<P>
Resource stocks also did little to inspire the overall market,
with the all resources index closing unchanged at 1,207.0 points.
</P>
<P>
The gold sector barely impacted, closing marginally up at 992.0
points, a gain of 4.3 points.
</P>
<P>
Resource giant BHP closed 0.1 cent firmer at 16.917 Australian
dollars, global miner Rio Tinto slipped 27.8 cents to 23.45
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks were also mixed with gold bullion 2.05 U.S. dollars
lower in Sydney trading at 275.25 U.S. dollars per ounce.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 437.66 million shares traded worth 757.75
million U.S. dollars. Some 920 stocks fell while 415 rose with 412
stocks steady.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Slips on Tax Reform Uncertainty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar Monday
continued to be impacted by the political uncertainty created by
the Australian Senate's expected rejection of the Australian
federal government's tax reform package.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed near its high at 66.47 U.S. cents
from Friday's close of 66.76 U.S. cents. During the day it traded
between 66.18 and 66.45 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, key independent Senator Brian Harradine, who holds
the balance of power in the Senate, said he could not support the
federal government's goods and services tax (GST) bill,
effectively destroying any chance it had of passing in its current
form.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar's performance surprised some, given that
it also withstood a further fall in the price of Sydney bullion,
which closed Monday at 276.60 U.S. dollars an ounce, down 1.00
U.S. dollar from Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 0.6216 euro from 0.6268 euro
Friday, and 81.84 Japanese yen from 81.28 yen.

<HEADLINE> HK Unemployment Rate at 6.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The provisional seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate for the period February-April 1999 was
6.3 percent, and the provisional underemployment rate was 2.8
percent, according to the latest labor force statistics released
by the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong here today.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the period February-April 1999 with January-March
1999, increases in unemployment rate were seen mainly in
decoration and maintenance, and the wholesale and retail trades,
while decreases were seen in the transport and real estate sectors.
</P>
<P>
As to the underemployment rate, decreases were seen in the
construction and transport sectors, more than offsetting the
increase seen in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
The Local Employment Services of the Labor Department was able
to secure about 12,000 job vacancies in April and over 3,300
persons found jobs through this service during the month.
</P>
<P>
On the tourism front, total arrivals for April increased by 11
percent over the same month in 1998. The number of arrivals from
Hong Kong's neighbors such as South Korea, Thailand, the Chinese
mainland and Japan showed encouraging increases.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, hotel room occupancy rate improved to 80
percent from 76 percent in April 1998.

<HEADLINE> Manila Sees Budget Deficit Within Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
confident that it can meet its targeted budget deficit of 68.4
billion pesos (1.71 billion U.S. dollars) for this year, the
Presidential Palace said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing, deputy presidential spokesman Angelico
Salud allayed fears that the deficit would escalate to the "scary
projection" of 80 billion pesos (2 billion U.S. dollars) to 90
billion pesos (2.25 billion U.S. dollars) in some media reports.
</P>
<P>
"This scenario has no basis and is not being considered by the
government," Salud said.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the government's measures to keep the deficit within
the target, Salud said the current budget is based on an
assumption of the 91-day treasury bill interest rate at 14.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The rate level during the last auction was 9.97 percent, which
will enable the government to save at least 8 billion pesos (200
million U.S. dollars) in interest payment for l999, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Bureau of Customs are
intensifying their collection efforts to meet their revenue
collection targets by the year-end, Salud said.
</P>
<P>
The government is also finding other ways to raise funds, he
added.
</P>
<P>
One newspaper had reported the country's budget deficit this
year could balloon to as high as 90 billion pesos (2.25 billion
U.S. dollars) based on the assumption that the revenue shortfall
would reach 20.64 billion pesos (516 million U.S. dollars ) by
December.
</P>
<P>
As of April this year, the government had incurred a budget
deficit of 22 billion pesos (550 million U.S. dollars) after a
revenue shortfall of 19 billion pesos (475 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
SEOUL, May 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign exchange
reserves rose to 60.05 billion U.S. dollars on May 15 due to the
introduction of international loans, the Bank of Korea said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange reserves include deposits at overseas
branches of South Korean banks.
</P>
<P>
On May 11, South Korea received a second 1-billion-dollar
structural adjustment loan from the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).
</P>
<P>
Since the end of 1997, South Korea has borrowed a total of 7
billion dollars from the IBRD to restructure the nation's
financial and industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's foreign exchange reserves dipped to below 7
billion dollars in December 1997 when it sought a bailout package
from the International Monetary Fund to tide over a foreign
exchange crisis caused by corporate failures and bad loans of
financial institutions in late 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Monday signed a new law on central bank to ensure independence of
Bank Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, Bank Indonesia will no longer be under the
cabinet and will account for its actions to the public through a
routine report to the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
After witnessing the oath taking of the central bank governor
and his deputies at the Merdeka Palace here Monday, the head of
state said that under this law, the task of the central bank is to
determine and implement the country's monetary policies, regulate
and maintain the banking system, and control the country's banks.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said Bank Indonesia should be given full authority to
draw up and implement monetary policies so that money
distribution, exchange rate development and foreign exchange
reserve management could be directed toward maintaining stability
of the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"The monetary policy will not work well if it is not supported
by a healthy banking system," he said.
</P>
<P>
On bank control, the task will be transferred to an independent
supervising agency to be set up at by December 2002 at the latest.
</P>
<P>

will be carried out by other institutions.

<HEADLINE> German Businessmen Feel No Danger in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua ) -- German Businessmen working in
China do not feel any danger to their business and life in China
either at present or in the future, according to a survey on the
reaction of the German business community in China to the U.S.-led
NATO missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
A total of 100 German businessmen working in China responded to
the survey by the Beijing Representative Office of German Industry
and Commerce (AHK) on May 13, five days after the attack which
triggered nationwide protests against the U.S.-led NATO.
</P>
<P>
The result of the survey, which was faxed to Xinhua today by
AHK Beijing, shows that 73 percent of respondents felt "as safe as
prior to the attack" and 71 percent said that the incident did not
adversely affect their business in China, or even an individual
company was affected, their operations have soon become normal.
</P>
<P>
And 73 percent of respondents said that there is no need to
worry about life in China.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO attacked the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on
the early morning of May 8, killing three Chinese journalists
injuring 20 others.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder paid a working visit to
China last Wednesday, during which he, on behalf of the German
government and people, expressed his profound regret to the
Chinese government and people and made an unconditional apology to
the relatives of the dead and the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The NATO countries shoulder responsibility for this, he said,
and that he is willing to do the same on behalf of NATO, which, he
said, needs to make a thorough investigation of the matter and
make the results public.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji told Schroeder during their talks
that China valued its ties with Germany, and would like to join
the new government of Germany to establish and develop a long-term,
stable and mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields.

<HEADLINE> Traveling in China Is Safe: UN Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-general of the World
Tourism Organization (WTO), Francesco Frangialli, has found that
it is safe for foreigners to travel in China in the wake of the
nationwide protests against the U.S.-led NATO bombing of the
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Describing the protests as an "understandable and normal"
reaction to such a tragedy, he told Hainan Provincial Governor
Wang Xiaofeng that they were not at all aimed at foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Wang in the capital city of Haikou on Sunday,
Frangialli extended condolences to the three Chinese journalists
killed by a U.S.-led NATO missile attack on the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade on May 8, as well as to the more than 20 wounded embassy
staff on behalf of the international organization.
</P>
<P>
As for the demonstrations of Chinese students in protest
against the attack, he said that it was "understandable and normal
" for Chinese youth to make such reaction.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone and any country in the world would make the same
reaction if the same thing happened," he noted. "What I want to
emphasize is my observation tells that the demonstrations are by
no means aimed at foreign travelers in China."
</P>
<P>
"It is safe for foreign tourists to travel in China," he said,

senior executives of the situation when they meet this week in
Kuala Lumpur, capital of Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Rwandan Army Officer Adjourned Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania on Monday failed
again to deliver a ruling on the fate of Bernard Ntuyahaga, a
former army officer wanted by both Rwanda and Belgium for his role
in the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
</P>
<P>
Appearing at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court in Dar es
Salaam, Ntuyahaga said he wanted to have a counsellor to defend
for him.
</P>
<P>
The Principal Resident Magistrate, Projestus Rugazia, approved
his request and announced to adjourn the case to Wednesday. Before
that, Ntuyahaga said he wants to talk to his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
However, Rugazia, who presided over the case, turned down
Ntuyahaga's request of telephoning his family at the detention
facility on the grounds that the international call charges are
high.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga, 47, seemed to be relaxed at the court. The
bespectacled man, in black western suit, was talking to the court
in French through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
He was standing, occasionally took notes with a ball-pen with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
He also requested the court to allow him to communicate with
his family by mail while he is in detention. The court officers
declined to reveal where he is detained.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people, including a Belgian embassy staff,
attended the trial session in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Ntuyahaga is buying time to delay his case.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, when his case was first heard at the court, he
said he had difficulty in communicating with the interpreter who
spoke Rwandan and Kiswahili languages.
</P>
<P>
He requested the court to provide an interpreter who speaks
French, English and Rwandan languages, a demand which the court
agreed to.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga, who allegedly murdered former Rwandan Prime Minister
Agathe Uwiningiyimana and 10 Belgian peacekeepers escorting her in
the 1994 Rwandan genocide, is wanted by both Rwanda and Belgium
for extradition and trial.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have filed applications requesting the Tanzania
government to hand over the accused to their countries for trial.
And the Tanzanian government said that it will abide by court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga, was handed to Tanzania in March this year after the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) based in Arusha,
created by the United Nations Security Council in north Tanzania,
dropped charges of genocide and crimes against humanity against
him and set him free.
</P>
<P>
The accused, however, was re-arrested shortly after he was
released. The Tanzanian police caught him in the name of illegal
entry into the country as he came into the country without going
through immigration procedures.

<HEADLINE> China, Germany Cooperate in Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers have sped up
their space in carrying out a Sino-German cooperative
afforestation program at the water sources of Baiyangdian Lake in
north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
To date, 16,700 hectares of land and 10,000 hectares of
mountain slopes have been afforested, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The cooperative program is designed to improve eco-environment
of four counties and two state-owned forest farms in adjacent
Baoding City and to help more locals escape poverty through
planting more trees and improving water conservancy work.
</P>
<P>
The German side has put in 70 million yuan into the cooperative
program, which is expected to last for five years, while the Hebei
Provincial Government, Baoding City and relevant counties have
invested 42.6 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, farmers will be paid to plant 20,600
hectares of trees, close 9,700 hectares of mountainous areas for
afforestation, build 73-km-long water and soil conservancy
facilities, and construct 95-km-long afforested roads and 200-km
fire-proof belts.
</P>
<P>
Since the program was put into effect in 1996, more than 60
Chinese and German specialists and officials have inspected
various projects under the program and spoken highly of the
progress made thus far.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details Added China's Position on WTO Entry Unchanged: Trade Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China has never changed its
position, viewpoint and attitude on accession into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and
economic cooperation, reiterated here today.
</P>
<P>
What China insists on is "the balance between rights and
obligations", Shi said at the 9th Session of China-Australia Joint
Ministerial Economic Commission held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, China can only undertake obligations
that are commensurate with its national strength at present, he
noted, adding that China's accession to the WTO is beneficial both
to the country and the WTO itself, as well as the development of
world trade.
</P>
<P>
China will never sacrifice its fundamental interests in order
to join the WTO, Shi stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said he has taken note of the statement in support of
China's accession to the WTO within 1999 announced recently by the
trade ministers of the United States, Japan, Canada and the
European Union in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
"The statement is only one aspect of the matter, and it is more
important to take concrete actions," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
China is a country that stresses principle and will never trade
principles, he emphasized, adding that he has read some reports in
the foreign media saying that foreign countries have a bottom line
in their requests on China.
</P>
<P>
"However, I would also like to tell them that there is an
ultimate limitation on what China can offer. We will never go
beyond that limitation in making our commitment," he said.

The Daily Telegraph:

<P>
-- The Metropolitan Police is among eight forces at severe risk

closed-circuit televisions, crowd control systems and computers to
fail.
</P>

The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain and the U.S. will face up to sharp differences this
week over sending ground troops into Kosovo. As Tony Blair

be made quickly, U.S. officials played down the need for a speedy
decision.

The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Hopes rose Sunday night in Western and Arab capitals that
the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will be beaten in

Police Monday said the rocket grazed a tree-top before hitting
the roof of the ambassador's home, where it exploded.
</P>
<P>
So far no one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but
police believe it is the work of the country's terrorist
organization "November 17," which used similar rockets in numerous
previous attacks.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the garage of the Dutch ambassador in Athens and
three foreign banks -- the American-based Chase Manhattan, the
British-based Midland and the French-based Banque Nationale de
Paris, were also attacked by bombs and rockets.

<HEADLINE> Feature: To Vote for the Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Over 4.2 million Israeli voters
began casting their ballots Monday morning at over 5,000 polling
stations across the country to elect the 15th Knesset and the new
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the voters interviewed by Xinhua at
different polling stations said that they cast their ballots for
their children and the future of the country.
</P>
<P>
At Jerusalem's Biet Hahiunch School, where Benjamin Netanyahu,
the incumbent prime minister and one of the two prime ministerial
candidtes cast his ballots, several voters said that they voted
for peace, one of the biggest issue facing Israel.
</P>
<P>
Although the voters cast their ballots confidentially, they
did not keep secret their choices of parties and prime ministerial
candidates.
</P>
<P>
One male voter, asked not to be identified, told Xinhua that
"we Israelis really want peace in this region, and I voted for
Barak (Netanyahu's rival for the premiership and One Israel leader
Ehud Barak) because the Center party leader Yitzhak Mordechai has
pulled out from the race."
</P>
<P>
"Formerly I decided to vote for Mordechai and now I cast my
ballots to Barak because Barak is better than Netanyahu in moving
the peace process forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We Israelis consider peace a No. 1 issue and we want peace
now, so I voted for Barak because he could bring us peace, he
could bring new political changes in the country and could do a
good job in other fields such as education and economy," one woman
voter cut in.
</P>
<P>
The polling goes on very smoothly in Kochav Yair, Barak's
hometown near Tel Aviv. Barak cast his ballots in a polling
station near his home in the town and promised once again that he
will move the peace process forward if elected.
</P>
<P>
Most of the voters in this town are apparently supporters of
Barak and his Labor-led One Israel coalition.
</P>
<P>
Almost all voters here interviewed by Xinhua said they voted
for Barak, expecting him to be capable of bringing peace to the
country.
</P>
<P>
A male voter who cast his ballots accompanied by his three
children said he cast his ballots for his children's future.
</P>
<P>
"I want changes, I want a united Israel and I want peace...so I
voted for Barak," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another male voter giving his name only as Itehak said he
voted for Barak too, adding that he will support Barak in moving
the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Polls will close at 10:00 P.M. (1900 GMT) and first results
are expected at about Monday midnight.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Telecoms Sector Sets New Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's telecommunications sector,
one of the fastest growing industries in the country, has set new
goals for itself for the coming three years, the New Vision
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
It aims to increase the number of fixed telephone lines across
Uganda from the present 55,749 to 300,000 lines, raising the
telephone density from the current level of 0.25 lines per 100
people up to 2.0 lines per 100 people.
</P>
<P>
It also wants to improve telecommunications facilities and
services and to introduce new services such as electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
Increasing the geographical distribution of telecommunications
services throughout Uganda is also on the list. By doing so, the
telecommunications sector can ensure a balanced and
well-coordinated telephone network through appropriate licensing
regulation and standardization.
</P>
<P>
The call completion rate should be increased from 35 percent to
65 percent and fault recovery rate to 60 percent within 24 hours
and 95 percent within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
The national network will be upgraded to 75 percent
digitalization.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has made great progress in the telecommunications field
over the past few years. At present, the country has 55,749 fixed
lines and 40,000 mobile lines.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, it had 46,207 fixed telephone lines, of which 36,472
lines were in the Kampala metropolitan area. There were only
3,500 mobile lines.
</P>
<P>
Development of rural communications is stressed and the two
mobile cellular operators are also opening services in remote
districts.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Syria, Lebanon Coordinate Efforts Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordan, Syria and Lebanon have
agreed to strengthen cooperation in fighting against drug abuses
and trafficking in the region, Jordan Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Anti-drugs officials from the three countries concluded a
two-day meeting in Amman Sunday, and agreed to exchange
information on illicit drug trafficking, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was believed to be a major transit point for drug
trafficking in the Middle East, and Lebanon was suspected to be
one of the major sources of drugs in the region.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the United Nations extended assistance to Lebanese
farmers in a bid to convince them to substitute their crops of
poppy by agricultural produces, Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese chief anti-drug official Michel Shakour joined his
Syrian and Jordanian counterparts Ali Darbouli and Tayel Majali
in the consultations.
</P>
<P>
Majali said it was difficult to give an exact number of drug
users in his desert kingdom, but primary information indicated
that 8,000 among the 4.6 million Jordanians suffer from drug
dependency.
</P>
<P>
"We have started to feel the seriousness of the problem which
we are monitoring carefully," said Majali after the two-day
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Global Economic System in Transitional State: Camdessus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- International Monetary Fund
Managing Director Michel Camdessus said here Monday that the
global economic system will be in a transitional state for some
time and will therefore continue to face risks.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international conference, Camdessus said to
confront these risks and tasks will require a cooperative
approach.
</P>
<P>
Consensus and partnership between the private and public
sectors will be essential and with a major role for each in long-
term development, Camdessus told the 32nd International General
Meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the "architecture" of the world economic system
must be based on a "mature partnership between governments and
market players, and a higher sense of responsibilities for the
international common good," he said.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said progress has been seen but "conceptual and
practical work" is still required in four domains: making
transparency the "golden rule" of the new international financial
system, establishing standards and codes of good practice at
international level, deploying major and urgent efforts in
preventing and resolving crisis, and establishing a proper balance
in the fundamental question of the freedom of capital movements.
</P>
<P>
In this situation, the IMF chief pointed out that adding a
social pillar to the international economic "architecture" tops
the most urgent work at present.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian crisis has highlighted how important it is for a
country to build up its social defenses at the same time as it
builds up its economic defenses before crisis strikes," Camdessus
said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he added, efforts must be redoubled to best integrate
those developing economies that are still far from benefiting from
globalization into the globalized economy.
</P>
<P>
"Deep reflection is needed also to make sure that all
institutions, including the IMF, evolve in line with the demands
of the changing global economy and that all countries could
express their views on the preparation of decisions of a global
character that will have more and more importance in shaping
their destinies," said Camdessus.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of Information
Technology Services of Hong Kong Monday expressed confidence that
all territories of the world would soon be able to communicate in
scripts natively, electronically and unambiguously in the
digitally connected world of the new Information Age.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the 13th meeting of the Ideographic
Rapporteur Group under the International Standards Organization (
ISO) here, Lau Kan-hung, director of Information Technology
Services of Hong Kong, said the Group had made significant effort
and contribution in establishing a standard set of coded
ideographic characters.
</P>
<P>
"This standard set of coded ideographic characters will enable
people using the ideographic characters anywhere in the world to
communicate electronically and accurately in their native language,
" said Lau.
</P>
<P>
He added: "This is crucial in supporting the conduct of social,
cultural and commercial activities in the new Information Age."
</P>
<P>
Lau noted that Hong Kong needed a good mechanism for submitting
its unique Chinese characters to the ISO committee.
</P>
<P>
The 13th meeting of the Ideographic Rapporteur Group is
attended by some 30 participants from China's mainland, Hong Kong,
Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Vietnam where ideographic
characters are commonly used.

<HEADLINE> HK to Seek Out New Engines for Growth: Tung (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa said here Monday that the government needs to help Hong
Kong's economy respond to change and seek out new engines for
growth in addition to building on its existing and traditional
strengths.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a welcome speech at the sixth Credit Lyonnais
Securities Asia (CLSA)'s Investors Forum Monday morning, Tung said
innovation and technology are important drives of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"In a knowledge-based global economy, they are essential in
adding value, increasing productivity and enhancing our overall
competitiveness," Tung told international investors at the forum.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, in the years to come, Hong Kong will
additionally focus on areas where it has substantial competitive
advantage as compared with its neighboring communities such as
information technology, hub for telecommunication and center for
Chinese medicine, Tung noted
</P>
<P>
In area of information technology, progress has been
particularly noticeable. "We are developing a Cyberport together
with the private sector, intended to house a strategic cluster of
major international and local information services companies," he
said.
</P>
<P>
These companies will specialize in the development of services
and multimedia content to support enterprises and industries right
across the business spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Since the announcement of the project in early March, 10
leading international IT companies have signed up as anchor
tenants. Nearly 40 companies have registered interest in becoming
tenants.
</P>
<P>
The economy of China's mainland is growing strongly. Hong Kong
can take full advantage as China's economy opens up further, Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are indeed uniquely positioned in every respect to fully
participate in that growing economy," he added.

"As the 21st century unfolds, I see Hong Kong as New York of
North and South America and London of Europe. Indeed, Hong Kong is
well positioned to be the premier international city in Asia as
well as one of the major cities in China," Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
During his speech, Tung also said greater effort is needed in
the area of environmental protection. "Environmental protection is
on the top of my priorities for 1999 and even the next few years,"
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply rooted in the rule of law and independence of
judiciary. We treasure very much our way of life, including all
the freedoms we enjoy today," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Under the "One Country, Two Systems" concept, these will all be
preserved and enhanced, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has always had a corruption-free, dedicated and
efficient civil service.
</P>
<P>
"However, as the new millennium unfolds and in order to meet
the many new challenges which Hong Kong now faces, we are also
making a determined effort in civil service reform," he added.
</P>
<P>
The objective is to make the civil service even more efficient,
accountable and responsive to changing needs, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Concluding his speech, Tung said Hong Kong may have been
buffeted and bruised by the financial storms which have hit the
region. But the deeply-rooted fundamentals of Hong Kong's free
market economy have proved to be rock-solid.
</P>
<P>
"We have weathered the storm in better shape than most. We have
also seized the opportunity to look closer at the future. To see
where our strengths lie. To re-energize. To consolidate. To
diversify. And to re-assume leadership in our chosen path as one
of the world's most open, competitive and cosmopolitan economies,"
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung's welcome address was followed by a panel discussion
attended by Richard Li, chairman of Pacific Century Group; Andrew
Sheng, chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission; Tony
Latter, deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority;
and Mike Rowse, director of the business and services promotion
unit of CLSA.
</P>
<P>
Their topics were respectively about the development of the
Cyberport project, the financial reforms in Hong Kong, the
monetary policy of Hong Kong and the trend of privatization around
the world. The forum, opened Monday morning in Hong Kong, will
last till Friday.

NAIROBI, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has issued an
army-worm alert to all districts mainly in southeastern Coast
Province and dispatched pesticides to agriculture offices.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper reported Monday that the government
issued the alert three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Kenyan Agricultural Minister Musalia Mudavadi
as saying Sunday that the army-worm menace, first sighted in part

because the pests are a major threat to our food production."
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi urged all government departments and farmers in
affected areas to join the campaign to eradicate the pest.
</P>
<P>
He instructed department heads in the districts to release
vehicles to ferry pesticides to the affected areas and
agricultural officials to keep in close touch with the head office
to ensure a free flow of information on the supplies.
</P>
<P>
For the past three weeks, army-worm invasions have been

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Voters Reject Constitutional Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Guatemalan voters Sunday in a
referendum rejected a constitutional reform motion passed by the
parliament at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Statistics of the Supreme Electoral Court showed that 77
percent of the voters said "no" to the motion with another 23
percent saying "yes" and the voter turnout ran at only about 18.4
percent of the 4 million registered voters in this Central America
country of 11 million.
</P>
<P>
During the voting no violence was reported.
</P>
<P>
The motion is aimed at granting equal rights to the country's
Maya Indian majority and curtailing army power in the country's
first elections since a 36-year-long civil war ended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Partial results from 21 of Guatemala's 22 provinces showed
voters rejecting by a 2-to-1 margin a package of constitutional
reforms aimed at rectifying some of the underlying causes of the
war.
</P>
<P>
Analysts called the failure of the motion to pass in the
referendum a severe blow to Guatemala's peace process, referring
to the constitutional reforms as an important part of the
agreement on national peace reached between the government and the
former opposition guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> "Pro-democracy" Elements Rapped for Supporting Embassy Strike (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China's leading national newspaper,
the People's Daily, published a bylined article today condemning
the traitorous deeds of the so-called "pro-democracy" elements in
exile for supporting and defending the atrocities perpetrated by U.
S.-lead NATO against the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
All the Chinese people, irrespective of their gender, age,
ethnic background or social status, have been denouncing the NATO
attack in the past few days, along with compatriots in Hong Kong,
Taiwan and Macao, and Chinese descendants in foreign countries,
the article said.
</P>
<P>
"But, at this very moment, we also heard some weird and
eccentric voices from the other side of the Pacific Ocean," it
said, referring to the preachments of some die-hard "pro-democracy
" elements now resident in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
They were quoted as saying that "it is understandable that NATO
bomb the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, for it was a lesson the
United States gave to the Chinese government." They also flattered
the NATO forces as "civilized troops."
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily article pointed out that in this case, those
elements tore off their mask of democracy and patriotism, as well
as the loin cloth of their "foreign master," because the
perpetrator of the atrocities had already claimed that the
bombardment was "by mistake."

"As self-branded leaders' and 'elite' of the so-called
'patriotic pro-democracy movement,' which country do you love?"
the article asked.
</P>
<P>
"You take the side of the hegemonies, brazenly defend them,
defile your motherland and its people, and crow over encroachment
on the sovereignty of your motherland and the murder of your
compatriots. Do you still have any conscience or affection toward
the land where you were raised and fed?" the article continued.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that the ugly performances of the so-
called "patriotic pro-democracy elements" in the past 50 days has
more clearly exposed the fact that they have not being looking for
democracy for the Chinese people, but for one controlled by
hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a lesson that the Chinese people should learn, it
should be that if the attempts of those people had materialized
ten years ago, China would have been 'Westernized' and
'disintegrated,' traded out by those so-called 'elite,' and turned
into a dependency of the hegemonies," the article said.
</P>
<P>
"The criminal atrocities of NATO and the shameless slander of
the 'pro-democracy' elements further opened the eyes of the
Chinese people, especially the young generation, allowing them to
see the hegemonies and these elements in their true colors," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The article also said that the die-hards of the "pro-democracy"
elements are only few in number, and others who still have good
consciences should repent if they are shocked at the crimes
committed by the US-led NATO forces.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Meteorologists Provide Business Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese meteorologists are now
providing information useful to many businesses that are affected
by changes in the weather.
</P>
<P>
During the first three months of this year, more than 40
enterprises engaged in soft drinks, air conditioners, clothing,
and insurance service have made use of the Climate Prediction
Center under the State Meteorological Administration to prescribe
long-term weather information for this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Hanguang, senior engineer at the center, said they are
able to forecast China's droughts and floods as well as
temperature trends as much as a half year in advance.
</P>
<P>
The center also offers information on temperatures and
precipitation in 47 major Chinese cities, summer's maximum
temperatures, the length of the coming season, and typhoon
forecasts, according to Zhao.
</P>
<P>
He said weather information is playing a vital role in some
industries, especially in years with abnormal weather.
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1997, north China was every hot, while the
south was cool. According to weather information from the
meteorological department, the Qingdao Haier Group Co. stepped up
their air-conditioner production in March, and transported them to
northern cities in advance, and the company's market share in
Beijing increased from 20 percent to 50 percent during that summer.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that Chinese businesses have been paying greater
attention to weather information in recent years, and that the
Climate Prediction Center's annual income for its service in this
regard has increased from 50,000 yuan in 1995 to 250,000 yuan last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, long-term climate prediction is much more
difficult than short-term forecasts. China's meteorological
predictive ability is now at an advanced level, with an accuracy
rate of about 70 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Burning of Stalks Along Roadways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- In order to better protect the
environment and ensure safety, China recently banned the burning
of crop stalks along major roads and around airports.
</P>
<P>
The burning of stalks is prohibited in areas within 15
kilometers of airports, two kilometers of highways, one kilometer
of major roads, and near railways, according to a directive issued
by the State Environmental Protection Administration, the Ministry
of Agriculture, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Railways,
the Ministry of Communications, and the General Administration of
Civil Aviation of China.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection departments have been given the right
to fine violators, and those causing severe problems will also be
prosecuted, according to the directive.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also suggests that local governments promote the
comprehensive utilization of crop stalks.
</P>
<P>
By 2002, about 60 percent of the stalks will be scientifically
used in areas surrounding major cities, and by 2005, some 85
percent of the stalks in the country will be put to better use.
</P>
<P>
China now turns out some 600 million tons of crop stalks each
year. Farmers sometime burn them as waste anywhere they like,
causing pollution and even transportation hazards. In 1997, about
a dozen planes were grounded at Shijiazhuang Airport in north
China's Hebei Province alone because of the random burning of crop
stalks.

<HEADLINE> Lagging Equipment Hinders Development of Chinese Fastfood: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The development of China's fast-
growing fastfood sector is being hindered by the lagging
production of equipment related to the industry, said an official
with the State Administration of Internal Trade (SAIT).
</P>
<P>
Han Ming, director of the service and consumption department of
SAIT, was quoted by the China Business Times as saying that
insufficient equipment production has limited the expansion of the
country's fastfood industry, blunting the competitive edge of
Chinese fastfood outlets.
</P>
<P>
China's fastfood industry has been growing at an annual rate of
20 percent for nearly a decade, and the sales volume of the
country's 500,000 fastfood outlets last year accounted for one-
third of the entire restaurant industry, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
To remove this hindrance, SAIT will sponsor an international
fair in Beijing from April 18 to 21 next year, featuring equipment
and technologies used in the fastfood industry. Exhibits will
include refrigeration, air-conditioning units, and computerized
equipment and machinery.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Inspection of Amusement Park Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China has begun a large-scale
quality inspection of amusement park facilities, especially rides,
in an effort to prevent accidents.
</P>
<P>
Jointly sponsored by the State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision, the Ministry of Construction and several other
departments, the inspections are expected to be completed prior to
International Children's Day on June 1.
</P>
<P>
Amusement parks in China usually attract large number of
children on the weekends and on holidays.
</P>
<P>
Today's People's Daily reported that some accidents occurred
last year in several amusement parks because of the poor quality
of the rides and other manned attractions.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that at lease one-third of all amusement-
park rides fail to meet technical requirements.
</P>
<P>
A joint announcement stipulates that rides produced by illegal
factories will be shut down immediately, and rides with hidden
dangers must be made safe before being allowed to resume
operations.
</P>
<P>
A hotline was recently created for reporting problems related
to amusement-park rides as part of a general effort to better
supervise their quality and safety.

<P>
KAMPALA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States Peace Corps have
suspended its activities within Uganda following mounting fears of
increased insecurity after a recent series of bomb blasts in
Ugandan capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The decision was already communicated to the U.S. government by
U.S. Ambassador to Uganda Nancy Powell, according to a statement
issued here Monday by the U.S. Information Service.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the ambassador thanked the Ugandan
government and the people of Uganda for the support they rendered
to the volunteers of the corps and expressed regret for the
decision.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers are said to be working in such fields as
education, fisheries and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Peace Corps volunteer program reached Uganda in 1964. It was,
however, terminated in 1973.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, 15 volunteers returned to the east African country and
now there are 43 such unpaid workers in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Up to 800 peace corps volunteers have worked in Uganda since
1964.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the rebel National Union/Army for the Liberation of
Uganda (NULU/NALU) issued a statement claiming responsibility for
the recent bomb attacks in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The rebels warned again, among others, that U.S. citizens are
targets for possible attacks.

<HEADLINE> Barak Casts Ballots in Israel's Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KOCHAV YAIR (Israel), May 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel's One Israel
leader Ehud Barak, one of the two prime ministerial candidates,
cast his ballots here Monday in a polling station near his home.
</P>
<P>
Kochav Yair is Barak's hometown just northeast of Tel
Aviv. Barak told reporters after voting that he was fulfilling
his obligations to cast his ballots and said that his One Israel
and himself will win the elections.
</P>
<P>
While urging all Israeli voters to cast their ballots, Barak
who is also chairman of the opposition Labor party, expressed
thanks to the thousands of staffs working at all polling stations
across the country.
</P>
<P>
"If I was elected, I will work and solve the problems that
Israel is facing and that require the prime minister to do," Barak
said, adding that he is optimistic that he and his Labor-led One
Israel coalition will win.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the other prime ministerial
candidate, cast his ballots Monday in a polling station near his
residence in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told reporters after voting along with his wife
Sarah that he was optimistic that he will win the election.
</P>
<P>
"I felt very good and I want to let the Israeli people to
choose who will be the next prime minister, and Israel is a
democratic country and every citizen has the right to decide who
he supports," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu urged all the Israeli voters to cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
Israeli voters began voting early Monday morning to choose 120
members of the 15th Knesset (parliament) and the next new prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations opened to the public at 7:00 a.m. (0400 GMT)
and will close at 10:00 p.m. (1900 GMT). The first returns are
expected at about midnight the same day.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two political parties are vying for the Knesset
seats.
</P>
<P>
As announced by the Election Committee, about 4.2 million
voters will cast their ballots at over 5,000 polling stations
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Monday is an official holiday set by the Election Committee
specially for the polling. But early in the morning, the turn-out
at Jerusalem was a little bit low.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who came to power three years ago, was forced to
call early elections over his government's December freeze on
implementing the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace agreement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had grudgingly accepted the landmark Oslo interim
peace accords he inherited from his Labor predecessor Yitzhak
Rabin, but the peace process was virtually deadlocked for most of
his term, despite strenuous efforts made by the United States, the
European Union, the Arab and other nations in the world.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the polling goes on smoothly, most Palestinians
were kept out of Israel during the voting. The Israeli army
announced a 24-hour closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip from
Sunday midnight.
</P>
<P>
Before the nationwide voting began Monday morning, votes had
already been cast by Israeli diplomats abroad last week and
Israeli soldiers stationed inside the security zone in south
Lebanon had also cast their votes Saturday, and in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Weekend polls suggested that Barak would beat Netanyahu during
the Monday voting. If Netanyahu were defeated, he would remain in
office as a caretaker prime minister until his successor has
formed a government. The winner has 45 days to do that.
</P>
<P>
If no prime ministerial candidates won the Monday voting, then
a run-off will be held on June 1.

As announced by the Election Committee, about 4.2 million
voters will cast their ballots at over 5,000 polling stations
across the country.

<P>
Monday is an official holiday set by the Election Committee
specially for the polling. But early in the morning, the turn-out
at Jerusalem was a little bit low.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who came to power three years ago, was forced to
call early elections over his government's December freeze on
implementing the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace agreement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had grudgingly accepted the landmark Oslo interim
peace accords he inherited from his Labor predecessor Yitzhak
Rabin, but the peace process was virtually deadlocked for most of
his term, despite strenuous efforts made by the United States, the
European Union, the Arab and other nations in the world.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the polling goes on smoothly, most Palestinians
were kept out of Israel during the voting. The Israeli army
announced a 24-hour closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip from
Sunday midnight.
</P>
<P>
Before the nationwide voting began Monday morning, votes had
already been cast by Israeli diplomats abroad last week and
Israeli soldiers stationed inside the security zone in south
Lebanon had also cast their votes Saturday, and in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Weekend polls suggested that Barak would beat Netanyahu during
the Monday voting. If Netanyahu were defeated, he would remain in
office as a caretaker prime minister until his successor has
formed a government. The winner has 45 days to do that.
</P>
<P>
If no prime ministerial candidates won the Monday voting, then
a run-off will be held on June 1.

The program lifts a 40-percent limit on foreign ownership in

In conjunction with the announcement, trading of bank shares

<P>
CANBERRA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Australia will play the United
States on hardcourt in their Davis Cup quarter-final in Boston in
July after Australian players threatened a boycott over a plan to
play on clay, tennis officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision follows a month of speculation over the surface to
be used in the July 16-18 tie, which was moved to Boston from
Australia to mark the centenary of the Cup tie between the U.S.
and Great Britain at the Longwood Cricket Club.
</P>
<P>
The Americans were granted a "home" fixture after a special
request over the centenary. Australian players had threatened a
boycott over first the move and then the Americans' decision to
play on clay rather than hardcourt.
</P>
<P>
"While our team has been forced to sacrifice home ground
advantage, at least now they will be able to play on a neutral
surface," Tennis Australia president Geoff Pollard said from
Berlin in a statement.

LANZHOU, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Shulehe River Valley at the
western end of the Hexi Corridor in northwest China's Gansu
Province will become a grain, meat, eggs, and fruit production
base with the help of loans provided by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the province's efforts to develop the Hexi
Corridor in northwestern Gansu into one of the country's major
grain-production bases.
</P>

With the completion of the comprehensive agricultural
development project in the river valley, which covers an area of
41,300 square kilometers, irrigated farmland will be increased by
54,600 hectares, the green coverage rate will reach 70 percent,
and 200,000 people from the mountainous areas of central Gansu

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Savor Sweetness of Democracy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 17 (Xinhua) -- When he became the first elected
chief of his village after garnering 85 percent of the votes last
month, Liu Zhonglin, a farmer in central China's Henan Province,
looked both excited and nervous.
</P>
<P>
"I really lack experience to run such a large village," Liu
murmured to his friends around before accepting a red-covered
certificate of appointment in the face of all fellow villagers.
</P>
<P>
The certificate officially granted him the post of "the
director of the Villagers' Committee", or village head, of Qugou
Village in Anyang County of Henan Province, which has a population
of more than 4,000.
</P>
<P>
"We elected Liu because he is the most knowledgeable person in
the village and he is also an experienced businessman," said a
Qugou resident. A high school graduate, the 31-year-old Liu owns
an enterprise which runs well.
</P>
<P>
The first thing Liu did after assuming his office was calling
in some doctors with his own money to give all villagers above the
age of 60 a comprehensive medical check-up, which was one of his "
campaign promises".
</P>
<P>
In the following weeks, he also managed to have cable
television connected into every household at a very low cost and
have all roads to wheat fields broadened and repaired for farm
machines prior to the harvest season.
</P>
<P>
"Now we should say that we made a right choice and Liu did a
good job," commented a villager.
</P>
<P>
What has happened in Qugou is now happening everywhere and
everyday in China's vast rural areas, as the government is making
active efforts to promote the direct election of the leadership of
the country's some 900,000 villages.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Civil Affairs show that since
late last year, when a new round of direct election of the village
leadership started across the country, some 60 percent of all
Chinese villages, or 550,000 in actual number, have elected their
new village chiefs.
</P>
<P>
In fact, China abolished its traditional practice of having all
village officials directly appointed by governments at the higher
levels in as early as 1988, and most Chinese villages have held
two to three direct elections of their village leaders over the
past decade.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Savor Sweetness of Democracy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last November, the Organic Law of the Villagers' Committees,
which had been implemented on a trial basis for nearly 10 years,
was formally adopted and promulgated by the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress, China's top lawmaking body. This
was widely regarded as a milestone in China's promotion of rural
democracy, with the following new round of rural elections called
"a civil and direct election in real sense".
</P>
<P>
"When the farmers have adequate food and clothing, they will
naturally ask for political democracy. This is a sign of social
progress," said Du Runsheng, a famous expert on rural issues in
China.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jun, an expert on China's rural grass-roots organizations
with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, noted that the change
from appointment to election of leaders has forced village
officials to reconsider their power and obligations.
</P>
<P>
"In the past they only cared about the reaction of their higher
authorities, now they must first be responsible for the villagers
who gave them the power," he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
Governments at higher levels, especially that at the township
level, also felt great impact from the village elections.
</P>
<P>
"Many township officials were used to issuing orders to village
officials and often threatened to dismiss those who tried to
disobey. Now we can no longer do so, for it's against the law,"
said Kou Sijing, head of the Shangji Township government in
Xuchang County of Henan.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhan Chengfu, director of the Rural Areas Division
of the Grass-roots Political Power Building Department under the
Civil Affairs Ministry, many Chinese villages now have also
established villagers' congresses, which consist of
representatives from all local households and have the power of
monitoring village officials and participating in all the major
decision makings.
</P>
<P>
"Though the small meeting halls of the villagers' congresses
across China and the Great Hall of the People in Beijing represent
different levels of power and democracy, we surely can find some
internal links between them," Zhan added.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has called on the Common Market for Eastern and southern Africa
(COMESA) to boost intra-trade and play an active role on the world
market.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia newspaper Sunday quoted Chiluba as saying
that the organization had made tremendous strides in boosting
intra-trade.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who is also COMESA Chairman, noted in an interview
with Zambian television Sunday night that the 21 member states
were all committed to reducing their trade tariffs with some
reaching the 90 percent margins.
</P>
<P>
Zambia had lowered its tariffs to 60 percent, he said, adding
that "we want to have a free trade area by the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
The president said that the reduction of tariffs was a slow
process as member states were given time to adjust.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA would ensure the trade relations are not tilted
against member states at a global level.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba was pleased that foreign exchange restrictions and
exchange rate controls are almost gone and that the level of
compliance is high among states including non-COMESA members.
</P>
<P>
He called on Europe and the U.S. to write off debts to allow
Africa to rejuvenate its fragile economies.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Tourists Repudiate NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-led NATO's missile attack
on the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia is obviously intentional,
said a visiting German Sinologist in China.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia is not aimed at safeguarding
human rights but at protecting their economic interests, and
China's stand on the Kosovo Issue has made some people very
unhappy," explained Richard Buehler, a professor at Germany's
Munich University.
</P>
<P>
Buehler, who worked at Fudan University and the Shanghai
University of Foreign Languages some ten years ago, led a tourist
group to China's largest industrial and commercial city of
Shanghai four days ago.
</P>
<P>
Buehler's group is not the only foreign tourist group that has
come to China over the past week.
</P>
<P>
The China International Tourist Service's Shanghai Branch alone
received nearly 4,000 tourists and business people from overseas
in the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
James Huston, an American doctor, was traveling in inland China
when he heard of the attack and later the U.S. State Department's
warning against travel to China.
</P>
<P>
"Why? We're sound and safe all our way in this country," Huston
said adding he would tell his relatives in the United States about
the real facts of the attack upon his return home.
</P>
<P>
Joan Robincon was with a group of 112 Britons touring Xi'an,
home to the famous "Terra Cotta Worriers and Horses", the "
underground army" of China's first imperial emperor, last week.
She bought many model worriers and horses as gifts for her
relatives at home.
</P>
<P>
"Like you, I feel sorry and indignant, for I cannot agree to
NATO's bombing," Robincon said. "I hope to continue our friendly
contact with the Chinese people."

Monday is an official holiday set by the Election Committee
specially for the polling. But early in the morning, the turn-out
at Jerusalem was a little bit low.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who came to power three years ago, was forced to
call early elections over his government's December freeze on
implementing the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace agreement with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had grudgingly accepted the landmark Oslo interim
peace accords he inherited from his Labor predecessor Yitzhak
Rabin, but the peace process was virtually deadlocked for most of
his term, despite efforts made by the U.S., the European Union,
the Arab and other nations in the world.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the polling going on smoothly, most Palestinians
were being kept out of Israel during the vote. The Israeli army
announced a 24-hour closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
effective at Sunday midnight.
</P>
<P>
Even before Monday's nationwide balloting began, the first
votes had already been cast by Israeli diplomats abroad last week
and Israeli soldiers stationed inside the security zone in south
Lebanon had also cast their votes Saturday, and in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Weekend polls suggested that Barak would beat Netanyahu during
the Monday voting. If Netanyahu were defeated, he would remain in
office as a caretaker prime minister until his successor has
formed a government. the winner has 45 days to do that.
</P>
<P>
If no prime ministerial candidates won the Monday voting, then
a run-off will be held June 1.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Announces Banking Liberalization Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong Monday unveiled the long-awaited program to
liberalize commercial banking and strengthen corporate governance
of local banks.
</P>
<P>
The program lifts a 40-percent limit on foreign ownership in
local banks and moves to implement a five-year program to
liberalize access by foreign banks to Singapore's domestic markets
and improve corporate governance practices.
</P>
<P>
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the central bank
chaired by DPM Lee, said in a statement that it will create a new
category of full banking license known as Qualifying Full Bank
(QFB), to distinguish them from the existing foreign full banks.
</P>
<P>
Six QFBs will be selected in three years and they will be
allowed additional branches, off-premise ATMs and ATM sharing, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks with no QFB status will retain their existing
privileges and be allowed to relocate their sub-branches only on a
case by case basis.
</P>
<P>
MAS will also increase the number of restricted banks from 13
currently to 18 by 2001 and give off-shore banks more flexibility
in the Singapore dollar's wholesale business.
</P>
<P>
As to local banks, the statement said, all of them will be
required to appoint a five-member Nominating Committee within
their board to ensure a strong and competent leadership in key
management levels.
</P>
<P>
"Only then can they build up stronger corporate teams and give
them the necessary autonomy to make professional management
decisions." said the MAS.
</P>
<P>
While lifting the 40-percent foreign shareholding limit on
local banks, MAS said any attempt to increase foreign shareholding
beyond the 5, 12 or 20 percent thresholds will have to get
approval from it.
</P>
<P>
MAS urged in its statement Singapore banks to upgrade
themselves and hold their own against stronger competition, noting
that the liberalization will make more urgent the need for banks
to consolidate.
</P>
<P>
DPM Lee said the limited size of local market and fierce
competition allow no more then two local banks to operate but the
government will not dictate the merger.
</P>
<P>
Singapore currently has five major local banks: Development
Bank of Singapore, Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation, Overseas
Union Bank, United Overseas Bank and Keppel Tatlee Bank.
</P>
<P>
The government's policy is to maintain the local banks' share
at not less than 50 percent of total resident deposits, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
MAS said it will commit to a definite package only for the
first three years and after that it will reassess the progress
before making further liberalization measures.
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the announcement, trading of bank shares
and derivatives is suspended Monday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came a dozen days after Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew chided local banks for being too slow in upgrading their
competitiveness for the last six or seven years.
</P>
<P>
The program is believed to be in line with the proposals by the
International Advisory Panel that urges full foreign participation
in Singapore's banking.
</P>
<P>
Data show that foreign banks in Singapore now enjoy about 50-
percent market share in the local retailing domestic banking and
80 percent in whole sale banking.

<HEADLINE> Thai Ethnic Chinese Protest Against NATO Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 300 ethnic Chinese in Thailand
gathered Monday in front of the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok to protest
against NATO's air attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on
May 7.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Thai Ethnic Chinese Association, the
protesters first gathered in a park near the U.S. Embassy earlier
Monday morning before marching some three kilometers to the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the association handed over a letter of
protest to an official from the U.S. Embassy while other
protesters were chanting anti-U.S. and anti-NATO slogans.
</P>
<P>
The letter strongly condemned the NATO attack on the Chinese
Embassy, saying it was a gross violation of the U.N. Charter, the
basic principles of international relations and Chinese
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The letter said the Thai Chinese firmly backed the stance of
the Chinese government on this matter and called on the United
States and NATO countries to take the responsibility and punish
the culprits.
</P>
<P>
The protesters also demanded in the letter an immediate stop to
the "criminal" bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
They also held banners in English, Chinese and Thai, which
read, "Chinese People Can't Be Bullied," "Stop the Bloody,
Barbaric Act" and "Don't Buy U.S.A. Goods."
</P>
<P>
A 68-year-old ethnic Chinese, who is a chicken-rice peddler in
Nonthaburi Province near Bangkok, said he wrote a letter to the
organizers of Monday's protest to express his anger after reading
an article in a local Chinese newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said he left home at 5 a.m. Monday morning and took a bus to
attend the gathering and protest.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is absolutely wrong by bombing the Chinese
Embassy," he said indignantly. "We Chinese around the world should
be united to protest and condemn the U.S. barbaric act."
</P>
<P>
The NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade has aroused
anger among ethnic Chinese in Thailand, who condemned the bloody
act and demanded a thorough investigation into the accident.
</P>
<P>
They also asked the United States and NATO to stop bombing
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We need peace, not war," a young protester said.

MANILA -- The gross international reserves of the Central Bank

dollars as of the first week of May, the Malaya newspaper said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Amando Tetangco, managing director of treasury and economic
research of the bank, was quoted as saying the return of portfolio
investments which has been keeping the peso strong helped beef up
dollar reserves.
</P>
<P>
Corporations also needed less dollars, making it easier for
the bank to increase holdings, Tetangco said. (Philippines-

The scenario is possible, assuming that the Bureau of Internal

In the first quarter this year, the bureau was supposed to

<HEADLINE> Major German Bank Sued Over Slave Labor by Polish Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Dresdner Bank has faced a
class action on behalf of some 22,000 Poles who had been forced
into slave labor by the Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Dieter Wissgott has filed 2,700 charges against the
bank, which he said was one of the dominant financing banks during
the Nazi era from 1933 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed at the state court in the German financial hub
of Frankfurt, also targets other 34 major German firms including
BMW, Daimler Chrysler, Siemens, Osram, Krupp and IG Farben. The
suit seeks a total compensation of 5.4 billion U.S. marks (2.9
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Refusing to admit its links with German Nazi, Dresdner Bank
repeatedly stressed that nowadays Dresdner Bank has nothing to do
with the bank bearing the same name back in Nazi days.
</P>
<P>
Wissgott said the bank's response was a naked mock toward those
mistreated and enslaved. Noting that the Polish victims already
reached an average age of 78 years old, Wissgott urged the issue
to be solved as soon as possible. He also urged the concerning
companies to set up a compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, hundreds of thousands of Jews and people
from east European countries had been inmates in Nazi German
concentration camps and had been forced into labor for German
firms. The victims never stopped their efforts to demand a
compensation ever since the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
In August last year, a group of American Jews already filed a
similar suit against the German firms.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Factsheet (4): Key Political Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Major political parties in Nepal:
</P>
<P>
1. The Nepali Congress:
</P>
<P>
The party was formally founded in Calcutta, India, on April 9,
1950 as a result of the merger of the Nepali National Congress and
the Nepal Democratic Party. It was the dominant party in the House
of Representatives until late 1994. With the communists, the party
instigated the campaign of civil disobedience that led to
political reforms in 1990.
</P>
<P>
2. The Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist,
CPN-UML):
</P>
<P>
The party was established in January 1991 as a result of the
merger of the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) and the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist). In February 1993, the party
committed itself to working within the democratic multi-party
system. It emerged the single largest party in the mid-term polls
in November 1994 and formed its own minority government which
lasted 9 months. It was split in March 1998 with a group forming
the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist, CPN-ML).
</P>
<P>
3. Nepal Sadbhavana Party:
</P>
<P>
The party was founded in 1990 as an advocate for the interests
of the nation's Madhesiya community, who are of Indian origin and
reside on the Terai plain in southern Nepal. The party demands
that the government recognize Hindi as an official language, that
constituencies in the Terai be allocated on the basis of
population and that the government grant citizenship to those who
settled in Nepal before April 1990.
</P>
<P>
4. The National Democratic Party (RPP):
</P>
<P>
The center-right party was founded in January 1992 following a
merger of RPP (Chand) and RPP (Thapa) which were both founded in
May 1990. The RPP mainly comprised monarchists and former
Panchayat supporters. It split again into two factions in January
1998.
</P>
<P>
5. The Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist, CPN-ML):
</P>
<P>
The party was formed in March 1998 after 40 members of
parliament led by Sahana Pradhan and Bam Dev Gautam broke away
from the CPN-UML. It was recognized that month as a parliamentary
party. It joined the Nepali Congress minority government on August
25, 1998 and quit on December 10, 1998, forcing Prime Minister
Girija Prasad Koirala to recommend fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
6. The National Democratic Party (RPP, Chand):
</P>
<P>
The party was formally recognized in parliament on January 16,
1998 after 10 MPs led by former prime minister Lokendra Bahadur
Chand broke away from the RPP.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Nepal was founded in the 6th
century B.C. The Newars and other tribes lived in Nepal before the
12th century. Several small kingdoms were established between the
13th and 17th centuries. Prithvi Narayan Shah, a king of Gurkha,
united Nepal in 1768. Since then, Nepal has remained an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
In 1846, Jung Bahadur Rana carried out a bloody coup and
established a hereditary and all-powerful Rana regime until 1951
when an armed revolution toppled the Ranas and restored King
Tribhuvan to power. King Tribhuvan promulgated an interim
constitution on February 18, 1951 and formed a cabinet consisting
of members of various political groups.
</P>
<P>
After Tribhuvan died in 1955, his son Mahendra succeeded him.
Mahendra approved the first constitution of Nepal in February 1959
and a general election was held. The Nepali Congress won the
election and B.P. Koirala formed the government.
</P>
<P>
But a royal coup took place in December 1960. King Mahendra
dismissed the cabinet and dissolved the parliament. One month
later, he banned all political parties. In December 1962, he
introduced a new constitution, reasserting absolute royal power
and providing for a partyless Panchayat system in the country.
</P>
<P>
In January 1972 King Mahendra died and was succeeded by his
son, Birendra. After students demonstrated nationwide for reforms
in 1979, King Birendra announced a national referendum on whether
to restore multi-party democracy. In the referendum held in May
1980, 54.79 percent of the voters supported the Panchayat system
with reforms.
</P>
<P>
In early 1990, the Nepali Congress and the communists launched
a people's movement in the country, which turned to violent
demonstrations, strikes and mass arrests.
</P>
<P>
Later, King Birendra agreed to lift the 30-year-old ban on
political parties and abolish the Panchayat system. On November 9,
1990, he officially promulgated a new constitution, introducing a
constitutional monarchy and restoring the multi-party
parliamentary system. A general election was held on May 12, 1991.

<P>
HANGZHOU, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Beginning on June 8, east China's
Zhejiang Province will host a seminar for local private businesses
on cooperation with multinational corporations, in a move to
develop this sector into a major local economic force.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's leading economic powerhouses, Zhejiang
Province now has 102,000 private enterprises and 1.58 million self-
employed households. Their combined output value accounts for more
than 40 percent of the industrial total in the province.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a total of 2,800 self-employed households and private
enterprises handled 10.29 billion yuan worth of exports,
accounting for more than 10 percent of all local industrial
exports.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang province has 562 private businesses which have thus
far used 150 million U.S. dollars of overseas investment, more
than 50 million of which was introduced last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a growing number of local private enterprises have
invested overseas in order to expand their businesses.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Historians Condemn U.S.-Led NATO Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A group of historians from Nanjing,
capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, believe the barbarous
act of U.S.-led NATO exposed the true face of the their pursuit of
hegemonism under the cloak of worshipping human rights.
</P>
<P>
At a specially organized forum, Professor Chen Xiaolu of the
History Science Department at Nanjing University, said that in the
attack, the U.S.-led NATO trampled on China's sovereign rights,
but their blood-stained hands totally wiped out the aura of the
Western world's value concepts, and helped Chinese youth once
again be baptized in patriotism.
</P>
<P>
"The brutal act of U.S.-led NATO enables us to understand that
economic globalization has not killed patriotism, but let us see
that the chauvinism of superpowers run rampant," the professor
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade
violated international laws and the Vienna Convention on
Diplomatic Relations, and should be condemned by all just people,
said Professor Lu Minghua.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Yinquan, another professor, said the action of the United
States has undermined Sino-U.S. relations and the United States
should bear full responsibilities for any retrogression in these
relations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO raid on the Chinese embassy not only created
difficulties for resolving Kosovo conflict through political
channels, but also challenges China's reform and open-up drive ,
according to Professor Yang Yu, who also said China should
unswervingly keep to the policy of opening-up while strongly
condemning the barbarous act of the U.S.-led NATO.
</P>
<P>
In Anshan City, an iron and steel production base of northeast
China's Liaoning Province, iron and steel workers and medical
personnel have learned to turn grief and indignation against the
barbarous act of U.S.-led NATO, into strength.
</P>
<P>
These workers have been intensifying their efforts to turn out
more quality products and fulfill their production quotas ahead of
schedule, while medical personnel have been trying their best to
provide the best medical services possible.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Takes Measures to Control AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been making response to
AIDS since 1985, taking steps in its prevention and control and
setting up a technical committee in the very beginning to observe
and study the potential hazard of an AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
A short-term plan was formulated in 1988 when the first HIV
positive case was reported in the country, followed by the
formation of the National AIDS Committee (NAC) later in the same
year.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the coordinated HIV/AIDS control work plan was
developed and implemented as Medium Term Plan 1 and 2
successively.
</P>
<P>
HIV/AIDS was then designated as one of the priority diseases
and was recognized as the national concern.
</P>
<P>
Along with primary health care spearheaded in the country's
border areas and ethnic races, health education on HIV/AIDS was
targeted to all people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of auxiliary nurses and midwives were trained to play
an active role as health care providers in disease control,
clinical care and educational activities with special emphasis on
HIV/AIDS prevention and control.
</P>
<P>
Among the activities against the HIV/AIDS epidemic carried out
were a blood safety program covering all townships in Myanmar, HIV
epidemiological surveillance over all states and divisions,
sexually transmitted disease (STD) control, which was intensified
by adopting a syndromic management approach, behavior and STD
surveillance and community-based AIDS support volunteers training.
</P>
<P>
The programs also include active participation in UNAIDS
regional activities, ASEAN regional program and Greater Mekong
subregion AIDS program and cross-border programs being implemented
in Muse, Tachilek, Mongla, Kyaingtong, Kawthoung and Myawaddy
border areas.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with U.N. agencies such as WHO, UNDP, UNICEF and
UNAIDS, local and international non-governmental organizations as
well as the private sector, Myanmar has successfully carried out
these AIDS control activities to some extent.
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed that annual government fund allocation is
about 13 million kyats (43,000 U.S. dollars) for implementing
programs identified in the country's National Health Plan.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Officer Says NATO Bombing Blocks Yugoslav Troops Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- NATO is blocking Yugoslav military
and police units from pulling out of Kosovo by intensifying its
airstrike campaign in the southern province, a senior Yugoslav
officer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Milivoje Novkovic, chief of the Yugoslav Army
Information Service, told reporters that NATO forces have "
suddenly intensified all air operations up to 50 percent from the
previous intensity" since Yugoslavia announced the start of the
withdrawal of its army and police units on May 10.
</P>
<P>
"Under such conditions it is clearly impossible to carry out
the planned grouping of units for the partial withdrawal of army
and police forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that NATO, though it insists that the army and
the police must pull out from the province, is doing everything
possible to prevent it."
</P>
<P>
NATO's "ultimatums unveil the intention to occupy our country
and forever rule the region," Novkovic said, charging that "NATO
demanded Belgrade's unconditional surrender and turning our fate
over to them."
</P>
<P>
The officer also described as "sheer nonsense" NATO's reports
that the General Staff of Yugoslav Armed forces has moved into a
military and medical science academy.

</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The paper front-pages an observer's article entitled "
Humanitarian or Hegemonist", strongly condemning the U.S.-led
NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It points out that "NATO's military action, headed by the US,
has trampled on the norms of international law and brazenly
violated the principles enshrined in the UN Charter, which promote
peace and oppose war. NATO's real intention is to seek hegemony
rather than human rights. (More to be released separately)
</P>
<P>
-- Cadres and people throughout the country are studying
President Jiang Zemin's speech at the meeting to welcome Chinese
embassy staff members back from Yugoslavia. They expressed their
indignation toward US-led NATO's atrocity and said that they will
concentrate on economic construction and make China more stronger.
</P>
<P>
"Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
 -- University students in Beijing said that they now have a
better understanding of the US advocated "human rights" following
the NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A student said that he realized the hypercritical nature of the
"human rights" promoted by the United States and the Americans
have double standards towards the life of their own people and
that of other nations.
</P>
<P>
Another said the Chinese students firmly support the Chinese
government's solemn statement and stand, and believe that the
government is fully capable of seeking justice from the U.S.-led
NATO to defend the national interests and dignity.

<HEADLINE> China to Boost Nuclear Power Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Nuclear power is expected to
contribute about three percent of China's total power output by
2006, some two percent more than at present, a senior official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
China's State Development Planning Commission is now working
out an overall nuclear power development plan aimed at bringing
the country's nuclear power generating capacity up to 20 million
kilowatts by 2010, according to Shen Wenquan, director of the
Nuclear Power Department under the China Nuclear Industry Corp.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has two nuclear power stations under
commercial operation, the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station in east
China's Zhejiang Province, and the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station
in south China's Guangdong Province, with a total power output of
12 billion kwh and 50 billion kwh, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the second and third phases of Qinshan and
Ling'ao nuclear power stations and the Lianyungang Nuclear Power
Plant are in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Over a dozen provinces, including Shandong, Fujian, Hainan,
Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei and Sichuan, are all actively making
preparations to build their own nuclear power stations, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Of these, Shandong, an economically developed coastal province
in east China, has already selected a site for four generating
units, each with an installed capacity of one million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Presently, China needs to cooperate with international
businesses for key nuclear power equipment and related technology,
and this has increased the cost of nuclear power, pushing its
price to a much higher level than that of both thermal and hydro-
electric power, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ratio of nuclear power in China's total power
output, which is about one percent, is still much lower than the
world average of 17 percent.

<HEADLINE> Huge Potential Remains in China's Lead-Recycling Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- China's lead-recycling industry has
huge potential for development, as there are only a small number
of enterprises engaged in this sector at present, according to a
report in the Land Resources News.
</P>
<P>
Lead is the most recycled metal, and the cost of this procedure
can be by 40 percent less than refining lead from ore, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Energy consumption during the recycling process is only two-
thirds that of ore-refining, which makes this segment of the
recycling industry attractive worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The global output of recycled lead was 2.95 million tons last
year, accounting for 60 percent of total output of refined lead.
</P>
<P>
However, China's lead-recycling industry is underdeveloped with
production lagging far behind that of the countries of North
America, Europe, and Japan, where highly developed auto industries
provide adequate raw materials for lead recycling.
</P>
<P>
Most enterprises engaged in lead-recycling production still
apply the old polluting methods, and to date only two have adopted
environment-friendly techniques, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Experts have called for the strengthening of regulations in
this industry, both for development and environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Serb POWs to Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The two Serb soldiers held as
prisoners of war by the U.S. military authorities in Germany will
be released possibly on Monday, a senior Pentagon official said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official told reporters,
"We're just working out the details now."
</P>
<P>
After Belgrade released three U.S. POWs earlier this month, the
United States was pressured to release the Serb soldiers, who were
captured and turned over to the U.S. military authorities in
Albania by the ethnic Albanian separatist group -- the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
They were flown to Germany where they have been visited by
representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross in
accordance with the Geneva Convention on treatment of POWs
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, U.S. President Bill Clinton and Defense
Secretary William Cohen said the release of the two Serbs was
under consideration.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany last week,
Cohen said he expected to recommend to Clinton that the two Serbs
be set free.

<P>
ROME, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 80,000 people staged a "peace
march" in central Italy from Perugia to Assisi on Sunday,
demanding that NATO halt its bombing of Yugoslavia immediately and
resume peace in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
From early morning, demonstrators got off from Perugia, walking
silently towards Assisi 24 kilometers away, raising slogans
reading "Cease fire at once," "Italy refuses the war," "No one
will win in this war," "Clinton is an executioner" and "Yes peace,
no war."
</P>
<P>
The air strikes have killed a large number of innocent
civilians, bombs have thrown into the Adriatic sea and the war is
knocking at the door, said the organizers.

Some marchers said that first of all, an end should be put to
the bombing and then, a political solution of the Kosovo crisis
should be found through negotiations.

The march was organized by the "peace forum" and other local
pacifist organizations, and the marchers were members of the left-

<P>
JAKARTA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is optimistic about
winning the men's singles titles in the World Badminton
Championships this week after its failure in the Sudirman Cup semi-
finals on Friday, The Jakarta Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have a great chance to win the men's singles title. I have
told the shuttlers to get over the loss in the Sudirman Cup and
start concentrating on the World Championships," team manager Agus
Wirahadikusumah told reporters in Copenhagen, Denmark.
</P>
<P>
"Either Hendrawan or Taufik Hidayat has a chance to win the
title. I hope Taufik's semi-finals loss to Peter Gade Christensen
of Denmark will be his last. Hopefully, both players can meet in
the World Championships final and Taufik can take revenge," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has four men's singles players: world number three
Budi Santoso, number eight Hendrawan, number 10 Taufik Hidayat and
unseeded Hariyanto Arbi.
</P>
<P>
Hendrawan said he aimed to win the World Championships after
his poor performances in several tournaments after the Asian Games
last year, in which he won the silver after losing to Chinese Dong
Jiong.
</P>
<P>
"I want to become the World Champion this year because I might
not get another chance," said the 26-year-old Indonesian.
</P>
<P>
"After the Asian Games, I slackened my training and it affected
my performance in the tournaments. I then realized I had to work
harder to reach my best," he added.

The 17-year-old Taufik said he was ready to compete in the
World Championships.

<HEADLINE> Philippine International Reserves Hit All-Time High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The gross international reserves of
the Central Bank of the Philippines hit an all-time high of 13.79
billion U.S. dollars as of the first week of May, the Malaya
newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Amando Tetangco, managing director of treasury and economic
research of the bank, was quoted as saying the return of portfolio
investments which has been keeping the peso strong helped beef up
dollar reserves.
</P>
<P>
Corporations also needed less dollars, making it easier for the
bank to increase holdings, Tetangco said.
</P>
<P>
The bank had earlier set the full-year target reserves at 12.8
billion dollars, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
But in the first quarter alone, this target was reached as the
reserves of March stood at 12.9 billion dollars, it said.
</P>
<P>
The reserves are expected to increase by 223 million dollars
through the disbursement from the stand-by credit facility of the
International Monetary Fund, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Seen to Post Higher Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The budget deficit of the
Philippines could expand to as much as 90 billion pesos (2.25
billion U.S. dollars) this year instead of the 68.4 billion pesos
(1.71 billion dollars) as projected, the Journal newspaper said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The scenario is possible, assuming that the Bureau of Internal
Revenue continues to under-perform or miss its revenue goal this
year, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter this year, the bureau was supposed to
raise at least 89.33 billion pesos (2.23 billion dollars) but it
actually collected only 75.97 billion pesos (1.9 billion dollars),
it said.
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in the government was optimistic that the bureau
could actually raise its revenue target of 396.3 billion pesos
(9.9 billion dollars) this year, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Government sources attributed the weak revenue collection to
the increasing incidence of bank non-performing loans (NPLs)
reaching 13 percent of the total loans at the end of March this
year.
</P>
<P>
There was a decline in financial sector taxes which was linked
to higher NPLs for the period, they said.
</P>
<P>
The country's financial sector taxes totaled only 75 billion
pesos (1.88 billion dollars) for the first quarter this year
against 89 billion pesos (2.23 billion U.S. dollars) a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Committee Announces Legislative Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Election Committee
(PPI) finally announced a temporary list of 13,500 parliamentary
candidates on Sunday after it was delayed for two days, The
Indonesian Observer reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Temporary List of Candidates was earlier this month
submitted to the General Election Commission (KPU) by the 48
political parties contesting 462 seats in the House of
Representatives during the June 7 election.
</P>
<P>
The listed candidates do not include the 38 military
representatives in the house. Legislators from the Indonesian
military are to be appointed.
</P>
<P>
PPI Deputy Chairman Rasyidi said the delay in the announcement
was only due to technical problems, namely the sluggish process at
the print company.
</P>
<P>
He denied there were political reasons behind the delayed
announcement.
</P>
<P>
According to schedule, the temporary list should have been made
public last Friday and Indonesians were given until May 17 to
study the list.
</P>
<P>
But, because of the two-day delay, Rasyidi said, the election
committee will give the people until May 19 to express their
complaints on the listed candidates from the 48 parties, before
the list will be revised to become the Permanent List of the
Legislative Candidates.
</P>
<P>
Rasyidi said the Unity and Justice Party had submitted the
biggest number of candidates, totaling 935 in the 27 provinces,
followed by the Republic Party (924), Golkar Party (915) and the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (773).
</P>
<P>
The People's Democratic Party had submitted the smallest number
of candidates, namely with 54 candidates in 16 provinces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KPU Chairman Rudini said voter registration all over
the country has reached 85 percent from the total eligible voters
of 130 million up to Saturday, exceeding the KPU target of 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the enrollment will still be extended by a few days
before the voting day to give a chance to those who live in remote
areas.
</P>
<P>
"The extension in some areas like Aceh, Irian Jaya and East
Timor is due to technical and security problems," he added.

<HEADLINE> IBF Gives Warning in Fight of Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Badminton
Federation has issued a warning in its fight against drug cheats.
</P>
<P>
According to the IBF president Lu Shengrong on Sunday, the IBF
has recognized the danger of drug cheats when the sport becomes
more and more professional in accordance with its reforms.
</P>
<P>
At the general meeting of the IBF here today, the IBF council
proposed to support the final declaration of the International
Olympic Committee World Conference on Doping in Sport in February;
and confirms that it supports the principle that a minimum two-
year suspension should apply for doping offences described as "
major" in the IOC declaration, and that whilst IBF recognises that
each situation is different, players and their entourage should be
aware of the determination of IBF to implement the policy in such
situation.
</P>
<P>
The proposal pointed out that only in the most exceptional
circumstances should a penalty for a proven "major" offence be
less than a two-year suspension. For avoidance of doubt, such
exceptional circumstances do not include, for example, the player
claiming he/she was unaware of how the banned substance was
present in the analysed samples or the current or likely future
competition plans of the player concerned.
</P>
<P>
Lu Shengrong said that although drug cheats in badminton was
rare, it should be drawn attention to it when the sport gradually
became professional.
</P>
<P>
"We must be strict in our fight against doping," she said.
</P>
<P>
When drug cheats were widely spreaded in some sport such as
cycling, the sport of badminton remains a comparatively clean
sheet. The only drug case in the past few years is Indonesian
shuttler Sigit Budiarto, who was tested positive in Singapore Open
last August. He was consequently suspended for two years.

<HEADLINE> Fogarty Extends Superbike Lead in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 16 (Xinhua) -- World champion Carl Fogarty finished
third but still stretched his lead in the superbike championship
in Albacete, Spain, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time British rider has finished out of top
two this season. But he still managed to increase his lead over
Australian Ducati team mate Troy Corser to 36 points.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Noriyuki Haga gave the new Yamaha Y7 a win on its
competition debut in the first race while American Colin Edwards
took the second for Honda.
</P>
<P>
Haga, who was pressed all the way by compatriot Akira Yanagawa
on a Kawasaki before completing victory in the first race, had
appeared set for a double celebration as he roared into the lead
on race two.
</P>
<P>
But a problem with his Yamaha forced him out on lap 11,
allowing Edwards, who had to retire with electrical problems in
the first race, a clear run to the flag.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM to Propose Temporary Ceasefire in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou will propose a temporary ceasefire to give time to find
a final solution to the Yugoslav crisis through diplomatic means
when he visits France Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with Greece's Eleftherotypia newspaper
Sunday, Papandreou said that he would also make the same
recommendation to the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Describing this as "a last chance for peace," he said that the
Yugoslav government must give a clear response during the truce,
and the period would also give the United Nations Security Council
time to issue a resolution and for work to begin on the agreement
drafted recently by seven Western countries and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the need for a quick political settlement
of the Yugoslav crisis in which 1,200 people have reportedly been
killed and 5,000 others injured.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Greece had reservations on NATO's bombing of
Yugoslavia and refused to participate in any NATO military
operations.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou will visit Paris Monday for talks with his French
counterpart Hubert Vedrine.
