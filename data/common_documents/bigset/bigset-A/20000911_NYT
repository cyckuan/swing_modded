   One Debate Down. Three to Go. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The debate is over. Let the debates begin.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the week, the Bush and Gore campaigns sparred over
where and how _ or even whether _ the presidential debates would
occur this year. The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates,
which has been running the forums since 1988, had issued
invitations to Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore to
three debates on college campuses in October.
</P>
<P>
   But last Sunday, Bush issued a debate plan of his own that
included only one 90-minute commission debate and added 60-minute
showdowns on ``Meet the Press'' and ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, however, with Democrats accusing Bush of wanting to
duck the wider television audiences commanded by the commission
debates _ and Republicans increasingly worried that voters might be
seeing it that way, too _ Bush withdrew his plan. This week, aides
to both candidates are to meet in Washington with the commission to
negotiate a final deal that guarantees a series of forums.
</P>
<P>
   All the talk about talking was the dominant story of the first
week of campaigning after Labor Day, traditionally the kickoff of
the final leg of the election. It easily overshadowed the
governor's announcement of the details of his prescription drug
proposal on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's $198 billion overhaul of Medicare would encourage the
elderly to pick subsidized private insurance plans that had
prescription drug coverage. Gore, who previously unveiled his own
$253 billion plan, said Bush's subsidies were not sufficient for
older people.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore still in the throes of a post-convention surge, Bush's
advisers unveiled a retooled strategy and message, focused on a new
theme: ``Real plans for real people.'' The idea is to get Bush
mixing more with ``real people'' at town hall meetings and in
workplace chats.
</P>
<P>
   If It Moves, Impale It &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is struggling with all sorts of technological
challenges _ from designing a national missile defense that works
to perfecting new aircraft like the F-22. But its most embarrassing
technological failure these days is popping up right outside its
front door.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a heavy steel security barricade misfired, striking
a car carrying Germany's defense minister, Rudolf Scharping,
moments before a full-dress honors ceremony on the Pentagon's
steps.
</P>
<P>
   The freak accident wrecked the car, slightly injured Scharping,
the German defense attache and a U.S. security guard, and left
Defense Secretary William Cohen, who rushed to Scharping's aid,
fuming.
</P>
<P>
   Only it was no freak accident.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the same barricade sprang up beneath the car of
Japan's defense minister, Fukushiro Nukaga, injuring him and five
others. In 1995, another gate struck a car carrying then-Defense
Secretary William Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently the system, built in the early 1990s to keep
terrorists out, has a sentry's worst nightmare built in. It has
difficulty distinguishing between friend and foe.
</P>
<P>
   What made last week's accident even more infuriating was that
the Pentagon believed it had fixed the problem by replacing manual
switches with electronic controls meant to keep the barricades open
long enough for motorcades to pass through. (The redesigned
barricade struck a car carrying Chinese military officers last
January, but officials blamed tailgating and insisted the system
worked.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon vowed to conduct a new investigation into what is
being called ``Gategate.'' Asked if human error, not technology,
was to blame, the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said
simply, ``I don't think we fully understand yet.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gigantic Gathering Of World Leaders
</P>
<P>
   United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan called it ``a
remarkable convergence of views.'' When about 150 government
leaders representing a large majority of the world's nations ended
their first no-frills working summit on Friday night, there was not
much disagreement over the lopsided effects of the global economy.
That was the easy part. Now, what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders made lofty pledges in a declaration. That and three
days of speeches won't solve the problem, but behind the scenes,
there was an innovation. Leaders broke into groups that mixed rich
and poor, North and South, East and West, to thrash out ideas. The
White House said there was even a moment when President Clinton and
Fidel Castro exchanged a handshake and innocuous chitchat.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore, who led one
millennial roundtable, called it the organization's first
``interactive dialogue among leaders'' and suggested that the
United Nations not wait a thousand years to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone's Tough Week
</P>
<P>
   Even as it confronted lawsuits, congressional hearings and
public anger over its defective tires, Bridgestone/Firestone got
one piece of good news. The Japanese-owned tire maker reached a
settlement with the United Steelworkers of America, avoiding a
strike by 8,000 workers. Eager to avert a strike during its current
crisis, Bridgestone gave most workers raises of at least 15 percent
over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Still the crisis built, as hearings on Capitol Hill led to a
release of documents indicating that the tire company and perhaps
Ford knew about a pattern of tire failures long before a recall was
announced in August, and statistics from a widely used federal
database showed that fatal crashes involving Ford Explorers were
almost three times as likely to be tire-related as fatal crashes
involving other sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, Firestone and federal safety regulators said they had not
recognized such a pattern in the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Glacial School Improvement
</P>
<P>
   A study showed that if American eighth-graders continued to
improve their basic math skills at the pace they have since 1973,
it would take 125 years for them to catch up with their peers in
Singapore _ assuming those students don't raise their own scores.
The study, by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (the
standardized tests known as the nation's report card), showed that
while scores on a new test emphasizing problem-solving and geometry
have risen steadily throughout the 1990s, performance on a test
stressing arithmetic has improved only slightly, and reading scores
have been practically flat since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   An Upset in Lebanon  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon's government, handpicked by Syria's new leader, Bashar  &QL; 
Assad, took a trouncing as a former prime minister, the billionaire
builder Rafik Hariri, swept to an overwhelming victory in
parliamentary elections. It was a bitter blow for President Emile
Lahoud, whom Assad, son of Syria's late ruler, Hafez Assad, put in
power in 1988 during his apprenticeship.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Fish Weds Bicycle
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it seems, a fish really does need a bicycle. The
feminist Gloria Steinem, 66, and David Bale, 61, a businessman and
political activist, were married in Oklahoma. It was the first time
for her, the third for him and was a spontaneous decision taken
while the two were at a spiritual retreat. ``Honestly, she is as
stunned as we all are,'' Suzanne Braun Levine, a former writer for
Ms. magazine, said.
</P>
<P>
   A Rebuke for Haiti
</P>
<P>
   Rather than revive Haiti's political fortunes and unblock
hundreds of millions of dollars in desperately needed foreign aid,
the swearing-in of a new Parliament has accomplished the opposite:
the United States announced it will scrutinize any further foreign
aid and withhold millions of dollars in assistance for November's
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials acted because they and other international donors
could not persuade the Haitian government to recalculate the
results of the May 21 legislative elections, in which international
observers said 10 of the 18 senate seats won by the party of former
president Jean-Bertrand Aristide should have gone to a run-off.
</P>
<P>
   A New Concorde Clue
</P>
<P>
   Could the culprit behind the fiery crash of the Air France
Concorde in July be a slender 17-inch-long piece of metal that fell
off a Continental Airlines DC-10? French investigators said a metal
strip they found among the debris from the Concorde appeared to
match the description of a piece missing from a DC-10 that had
taken off only minutes before on the same runway. Investigators
believe the strip gashed a tire on the supersonic jet, causing huge
chunks of rubber to smash through the Concorde's fuel tanks and
triggering a fire.
</P>
<P>
   A Gambler Loses
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans who play slot machines understand that if
you keep playing you will eventually lose. The machines are
programmed that way. In a case decided in U.S. Tax Court, the IRS
stipulated that William T. Praytor of Fairhope, Ala., was in the
``trade or profession'' of slot machine gambler even though the tax
returns that Praytor and his wife filed bore out the inexorable
mathematics of one-armed bandits: Praytor had won $318,750 from
1994 through 1996 and lost $392,763. But when he tried to deduct
his $74,000 in losses plus $23,000 in interest on gambling markers,
he lost again. Judge Lewis R. Carluzzo ruled that professional
gamblers can deduct losses and gambling expenses only until their
winnings reach zero. He ordered the Praytors to pay $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   A Tragedy Is Remembered
</P>
<P>
   Resurrecting a World War II tragedy, 70 relatives and friends
gathered on the Black Sea to honor 778 people who died when a
Russian submarine, for reasons unknown, sank a defenseless steamer
carrying Jews fleeing Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners recited prayers and cast flowers on the spot where
divers think the Struma was sunk on Feb. 24, 1942. The ship's
engine failed early in the voyage and its passengers spent 70 days
on the ship in Istanbul while Turkish authorities tried to persuade
the British, who controlled Palestine, to let them continue to
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   When Britain refused, the ship was set adrift on the Black Sea,
where it was sunk for unexplained reasons.

THE NATION'S MEDICAL MALADY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore outlined his economic
vision for America in a speech in Cleveland last week, he did not
even mention health policy. That was quite a change from 1992, when
controlling health costs and providing health insurance for all
Americans was one of the driving forces of the Clinton-Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Back then the prevailing view was that the rising cost of health
care and the failure of many Americans to have medical insurance
posed a serious national problem. There was widespread disagreement
over how to solve the problem but not over whether it could and
should be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, in an era of unrivaled prosperity, when
Americans express complete confidence in their ability to handle
most economic concerns, the authorities and the public have begun
to doubt whether costs for the best medical care can ever be
contained, or whether a practical way exists to provide insurance
for all citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, health costs have risen much faster than the
overall rate of inflation or workers' wages. And the only main
economic indicator that has actually worsened during the Clinton
years is the number of Americans without medical insurance. A study
last spring by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation shows that 44
million people, or 18.4 percent of the population, had no insurance
in 1998, the last year for which figures were available, up from 38
million people, or 17.5 percent, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The case seems to be that what is economically rational is
politically unacceptable. And what is politically possible does not
fit with economic realities. People demand the finest doctors,
state-of-the-art technology and expensive drugs, no strings
attached. But neither they nor their political representatives are
willing to pay the price this would entail.
</P>
<P>
   For a time it was thought that health maintenance organizations
were the silver bullet. But the public rebelled against the
restrictions they imposed. And once the cost of premiums began to
rise, companies began dropping them.
</P>
<P>
   The political turning point, of course, was the collapse of the
mammoth health plan President Clinton offered in 1994. The plan,
grounded in large part on HMOs, was too complicated and ambitious,
and fell victim to opposition from the insurance industry and
Republicans. It was the worst legislative defeat of the Clinton
presidency, and it contributed to the Democrats' loss of control of
Congress in the 1994 elections. ``The political fallout from this
debacle was staggering,'' said Henry J. Aaron, an economist at the
Brookings Institution who has advised Democratic politicians on
health policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is obviously gun-shy from that defeat. The book-length
manifesto he put out with his policy speech in Cleveland last week
addresses his health proposals in passing on Page 118 _ including
an ambitious and expensive promise to guarantee all children health
insurance by 2005. But this was not one of the vice president's top
10 goals _ like encouraging home-ownership or expanding access to
college.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas would just as soon skip the issue
of health care and avoid further scrutiny of the record in Texas.
Thirty-seven percent of low-income children there are uninsured
(only Arizona does worse), and a federal judge ruled last month
that the state had failed to abide by a 1996 court order to provide
appropriate health care for more than 1.5 million children eligible
for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion on health policy has clearly changed, as well.
``In the last eight years,'' said Robert J. Blendon, an authority
at Harvard on health and public opinion, ``people got scared away
from big solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Blendon said, most people said they would accept a big
tax increase in order to guarantee health insurance for all. Now,
he said, two-thirds of Americans tell pollsters they would like a
government program to make sure people have insurance, but fewer
than 40 percent favor a sweeping measure that would require higher
taxes. And many people, Blendon said, are afraid that the
government might make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   The one health issue that has been joined in the campaign,
prescription drug coverage for the elderly, was hardly discussed
eight years ago. Since then, however, drug prices have risen by as
much as 15 percent a year. Last week, Bush laid out his plan for
subsidies that he said would allow the elderly to buy private
insurance to cover drugs. Gore would give the elderly drug coverage
under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, health maintenance organizations seemed to offer a
solution to the health care dilemma. Companies would pay a flat fee
per employee; workers could see only the doctors in their
particular plan; and primary-care physicians decided what treatment
was permitted. In turn, they were rewarded for holding down costs.
</P>
<P>
   In a Supreme Court decision in June upholding a health plan's
right to give doctors a financial incentive to hold down costs,
Justice David H. Souter used blunt words to describe the
fundamental principle behind HMOs: ``treatment rationing.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs seemed to work for a time. The rise in health costs slowed.
But the public began to complain about all the rules limiting the
services they could receive _ about the rationing. Eventually,
those complaints grew so widespread that politicians began debating

   Then the costs began to rise again. Last week, the Kaiser
Foundation reported that between the spring of 1999 and the spring
of 2000, monthly premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance
rose by 8.3 percent, a full 5 percentage points more than the
overall national inflation rate and 4 points more than the rise in
workers' earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in increasing numbers, companies are abandoning HMOs for
preferred provider organizations _ doctor networks that agree to
reduced rates for their services. They don't have the expensive
approval-referral bureaucracy of HMOs, and they offer a wider range
of doctors and relaxed rules about the availability of treatments.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no particular reason to believe that over the long
run PPOs can offer people the care they want at an acceptable cost.
``Don't be surprised if this bubble pops too,'' said Robert D.
Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute, who is one of the
foremost authorities in Washington on government health policy.
</P>
<P>
   A major problem with controlling health care costs is that
conventional economic principles do not fully apply. Employers want
to keep the cost of insurance down to protect their profits.
Doctors and hospitals will not perform services at a loss. Drug and
insurance companies want the largest profits possible for their
shareholders. The less money people pay out of pocket, the more
expensive treatments they demand.
</P>
<P>
   But market forces do not apply to other aspects. Because most
bills are picked up by insurance, people pay little attention to
the cost of treatment, and they have no way to assess the quality
of medical services they receive. Beyond that, for most people,
good health is priceless; they are willing to pay whatever it takes
for themselves and their families.
</P>
<P>
   So this is the conundrum for politicians. Their constituents
will not accept the rationing of their medical treatment. People do
not want to be told that good health has a price. On the other
hand, neither the politicians nor their constituents want to pay
the higher taxes or higher insurance premiums required for
unlimited health care.
</P>
<P>
   Some day this may be sorted out. But not in this election. The
best guess is that matters will get worse sooner rather than later.
With the tight job market, many employers are simply swallowing the
cost of higher insurance premiums because they cannot risk losing
workers. But when the economy turns the slightest bit sour,
employers will surely force workers to pay more or even cancel
insurance altogether.
</P>
<P>
   What this means politically is uncertain. But for now, the
policy experts and politicians agree, if changes are made, they
will be incremental.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely in a transition period,'' said Dr. David A.
Kessler, dean of the Yale Medical School. ``But no one knows where
we are headed.''

THE NATION'S MEDICAL MALADY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore outlined his economic
vision for America in a speech in Cleveland last week, he did not
even mention health policy. That was quite a change from 1992, when
controlling health costs and providing health insurance for all
Americans was one of the driving forces of the Clinton-Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Back then the prevailing view was that the rising cost of health
care and the failure of many Americans to have medical insurance
posed a serious national problem. There was widespread disagreement
over how to solve the problem but not over whether it could and
should be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, in an era of unrivaled prosperity, when
Americans express complete confidence in their ability to handle
most economic concerns, the authorities and the public have begun
to doubt whether costs for the best medical care can ever be
contained, or whether a practical way exists to provide insurance
for all citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, health costs have risen much faster than the
overall rate of inflation or workers' wages. And the only main
economic indicator that has actually worsened during the Clinton
years is the number of Americans without medical insurance. A study
last spring by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation shows that 44
million people, or 18.4 percent of the population, had no insurance
in 1998, the last year for which figures were available, up from 38
million people, or 17.5 percent, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The case seems to be that what is economically rational is
politically unacceptable. And what is politically possible does not
fit with economic realities. People demand the finest doctors,
state-of-the-art technology and expensive drugs, no strings
attached. But neither they nor their political representatives are
willing to pay the price this would entail.
</P>
<P>
   For a time it was thought that health maintenance organizations
were the silver bullet. But the public rebelled against the
restrictions they imposed. And once the cost of premiums began to
rise, companies began dropping them.
</P>
<P>
   The political turning point, of course, was the collapse of the
mammoth health plan President Clinton offered in 1994. The plan,
grounded in large part on HMOs, was too complicated and ambitious,
and fell victim to opposition from the insurance industry and
Republicans. It was the worst legislative defeat of the Clinton
presidency, and it contributed to the Democrats' loss of control of
Congress in the 1994 elections. ``The political fallout from this
debacle was staggering,'' said Henry J. Aaron, an economist at the
Brookings Institution who has advised Democratic politicians on
health policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is obviously gun-shy from that defeat. The book-length
manifesto he put out with his policy speech in Cleveland last week
addresses his health proposals in passing on Page 118 _ including
an ambitious and expensive promise to guarantee all children health
insurance by 2005. But this was not one of the vice president's top
10 goals _ like encouraging home-ownership or expanding access to
college.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas would just as soon skip the issue
of health care and avoid further scrutiny of the record in Texas.
Thirty-seven percent of low-income children there are uninsured
(only Arizona does worse), and a federal judge ruled last month
that the state had failed to abide by a 1996 court order to provide
appropriate health care for more than 1.5 million children eligible
for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion on health policy has clearly changed, as well.
``In the last eight years,'' said Robert J. Blendon, an authority
at Harvard on health and public opinion, ``people got scared away
from big solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Blendon said, most people said they would accept a big
tax increase in order to guarantee health insurance for all. Now,
he said, two-thirds of Americans tell pollsters they would like a
government program to make sure people have insurance, but fewer
than 40 percent favor a sweeping measure that would require higher
taxes. And many people, Blendon said, are afraid that the
government might make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   The one health issue that has been joined in the campaign,
prescription drug coverage for the elderly, was hardly discussed
eight years ago. Since then, however, drug prices have risen by as
much as 15 percent a year. Last week, Bush laid out his plan for
subsidies that he said would allow the elderly to buy private
insurance to cover drugs. Gore would give the elderly drug coverage
under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, health maintenance organizations seemed to offer a
solution to the health care dilemma. Companies would pay a flat fee
per employee; workers could see only the doctors in their
particular plan; and primary-care physicians decided what treatment
was permitted. In turn, they were rewarded for holding down costs.
</P>
<P>
   In a Supreme Court decision in June upholding a health plan's
right to give doctors a financial incentive to hold down costs,
Justice David H. Souter used blunt words to describe the
fundamental principle behind HMOs: ``treatment rationing.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs seemed to work for a time. The rise in health costs slowed.
But the public began to complain about all the rules limiting the
services they could receive _ about the rationing. Eventually,
those complaints grew so widespread that politicians began debating
what they called a patients' bill of rights.

GOD AND POLITICS: NOTHING NEW UNDER THE AMERICAN SUN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The polite disagreement over the proper place of religion in
politics summons us once again to the works of those ever-useful
observers of American life, Alexis de Tocqueville of France and
James Bryce of Britain. Both of their classic studies,
Tocqueville's ``Democracy in America'' (1835) and Bryce's ``The
American Commonwealth'' (1888) attend the matter in a spirit that
should elicit an amen from Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who has stirred
the issue anew with his avowal that religious faith supports a
moral foundation for public policy.
</P>
<P>
   The America that the two well-disposed European visitors
described more than a century ago was not quite the idyll of
diversity celebrated today by politicians on all sides. When
Tocqueville reported that the first thing that struck him on his
arrival in the United States was the religious atmosphere, he was
referring strictly to Christianity. This practicing Catholic made a
debatable case that Catholic immigrants were bringing their own
democratic spirit to the religious constellation, concluding _ as
some on the Christian Right still do _ that for Americans ``the
ideas of Christianity and liberty are so completely mingled that it
is almost impossible to get them to conceive of the one without the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryce took pains to sort out the differences among mainstream
Protestant denominations, yet emphasized their basic similarity of
beliefs and manners, which he found to be by and large inimitably
American. Although the prospect of a Jewish vice president (or a
Catholic president) did not figure largely in 19th-century
calculations, with just a little adjustment the visitors' religious
inclinations would have had less difficulty in accommodating those
of an observant Jew than those of a cracker-barrel atheist. Today,
Lieberman, who has run into criticism from the nondenominational
Anti-Defamation League, finds himself praised by Christian
believers.
</P>
<P>
   Admiring though both men were of the course of American
democracy, they had their misgivings about unfettered freedom. Both
evinced a concern that the young nation's cherished political
liberty, with its tendencies toward license or excessive
individualism or just plain moral indifference, required some
constraints, some protection of values different from and perhaps
higher than those that seemed to generate a vigorous democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Bryce's eloquent admonition: ``All that need be here
said is that a people with comparatively little around it in the
way of historic memories and associations to touch its emotion, a
people whose energy is chiefly absorbed in commerce and the
development of the material resources of its territory, a people
consumed by a feverish activity that gives little opportunity for
reflection or for the contemplation of nature, seems most of all to
need to have its horizon widened, its sense of awe and mystery
touched, by whatever calls it away from the busy world of sight and
sound into the stillness of faith and meditation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocqueville had already made the point a half century earlier
when he asked how a society could escape destruction if, when
political ties are relaxed by the give and get of democracy, moral
ties are not strengthened. As he put it, what could be done with a
people that is master of itself if it is not subject to God? This
good believer cautioned that ``while the law allows the American
people to do everything, there are things which religion prevents
them from imagining and forbids them to dare.'' On that account, he
praised American-style religion, which he credited with never
intervening directly in the government, as being ``the first of the
nation's political institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocqueville discerned a shakiness in the nature of American
democracy, with its constant change of leaders and legislators and
its openness to political innovation, which demanded the placement
of religion beyond the reach of ``the ebb and flow of human
opinions.'' He treasured religion for its conservative aspects,
standing as it does above mundane secular struggles, and his
forceful warning against an inclination of some believers to ally
themselves with political power might these days be called into
service by the American Civil Liberties Union. But his concern was
as much for the well-being of religion as for the freedom of the
state. Religion, he preached, does not need the secular power to
live, but in serving that power, it may die.
</P>
<P>
   So Tocqueville and Bryce, reverent democrats, took their stand
both as defenders of religion against the vagaries of the mob and
as defenders of freedom against the presumptions of the clergy. In
answer to the question of whether the citizenry would able, without
a moral code, to ``hold in check the violence of masses and the
self-indulgent impulses of the individual,'' Bryce directed his
readers to history, where he found support for what seems to be
Lieberman's discovery too, that ``hitherto civilized society has
rested on religion, and that free government has prospered best
among religious peoples.''

GLOBAL WAFFLING: WHEN WILL WE BE SURE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When several eminent scientists returned recently from a tourist
cruise to the North Pole aboard a Russian icebreaker and reported
finding water, not ice, at the top of the world, the image
resonated far and wide, providing a call to arms for scientists and
environmentalists who for years had been trying to convince
politicians and the public that heat-trapping gases from tail
pipes, power plants, even methane-belching cattle, could disrupt
the climate.
</P>
<P>
   But on second look, things were not nearly so simple. Although
arctic experts said there were many signs of warming, including a
thinning and shrinking of the polar ice cap, there was no way to
link a patch of sun-dappled water at the pole to climate change.
</P>
<P>
   So the question of what is happening to climate _ and whether
people or natural forces are to blame _ returned to the realm of
nuanced, statistical fuzziness, where it has been for nearly 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   What a moment to lose potential clarion calls. Hundreds of
negotiators from industrialized countries are to convene this week
in Lyon, France, and again in late November in The Hague to try to
firm up ways to cut emissions of greenhouse gases under a 1997
climate treaty called the Kyoto Protocol. The treaty was signed by
the United States and 84 other countries but is in danger of
falling apart because of disagreements over how to make and measure
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Most climate experts are certain that global warming is real and
that it threatens ecology and human prosperity, and a growing
number say it is well under way. But policy-makers, always eager
for black and white, have once again found science offering shades
of gray.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, global warming is a classic example of the persistent
mismatch between the language of science and the needs of policy.
</P>
<P>
   Science operates by steadily chipping away at ideas through
experiments or observations, eventually revealing truths, but often
obliquely _ by eliminating what is not true. The bigger the idea,
the harder it often is to verify with precision. The result is
persistent debate, whether the issue is how to manage forests to
reduce wildfires, how to set limits for chemicals in food to
prevent cancer, or _ in this case _ how to figure out whether
people are dangerously fiddling with the global thermostat.
</P>
<P>
   But before policy-makers can try to sell potentially costly or
difficult solutions, say, taxing fossil fuels, they need to build a
clear and compelling case that strong action is called for.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson in all of this, according to climate scientists _
some of whom think humanity is already in big trouble _ is that no
one should expect some alarm bell to start ringing to summon
societies to take action.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is subtle and complex, and probably will be so for
a long time to come, said Jerry D. Mahlman, who is retiring as
director of the federal Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in
Princeton, N.J. ``This is going to be incremental forever,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those increments continue to add up, he and other climate
experts said. Past climate ups and downs mostly mesh well with
natural variations in the brightness of the sun or the cooling
effect of parasol-like plumes of particles spewed by big volcanoes.
But the recent warming, according to several recent studies, only
correlates well with one thing: the buildup of carbon dioxide,
methane and the other greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   Hints that warming is being caused by emissions from industry
and other human activities have been extracted from air bubbles
trapped in ancient ice, from variations in tree rings, from the
quick retreat of alpine glaciers. Thermometers dropped deep in the
ocean and in holes bored in permafrost show warming patterns that
do not match up with natural influences like changes in the sun's
brightness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, the subtleties have allowed warming skeptics ample
opportunity to challenge the idea. Some, like Dr. Richard S.
Lindzen, a meteorologist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, have built durable counterarguments, saying the links
connecting the earth's oceans, air and ``cryosphere,'' its frozen
places, are impossible to elucidate with sufficient confidence to
predict much beyond next week's weather.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lindzen acknowledged the arctic warming trend
and slight global warming measured in the last century, but said it
all is well within the realm of natural variation or measurement
error _ and not yet within our power to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a field that was in a primitive state when it assumed
a policy importance a few years ago,'' Lindzen said. ``Suddenly
we've declared thousands of people in a primitive field as world
experts, and they're trying to have their day.'' And reports last
week that boats had traversed the normally frozen Northwest Passage
and northern rivers and lakes were freezing later and thawing
earlier were countered with the response that this seeming meltdown
could still be ascribed to natural wiggles in temperature or ocean
currents.
</P>
<P>
   But most scientists, including some who work with Lindzen at
MIT, say the balance of data has shifted firmly toward a conclusion
that people, through their impact on the atmosphere, are
influencing climate now and will have even more impact in coming
years.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, many experts say, if the threat is to be countered,
societies will have to figure out a way to act in the face of gray
uncertainty, to deal aggressively with a problem that lacks the
attributes of a crisis. That is no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Mahlman has pretty much given up on that hope, saying that many
countries, including the United States, have essentially decided

GLOBAL WAFFLING: WHEN WILL WE BE SURE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When several eminent scientists returned recently from a tourist
cruise to the North Pole aboard a Russian icebreaker and reported
finding water, not ice, at the top of the world, the image
resonated far and wide, providing a call to arms for scientists and
environmentalists who for years had been trying to convince
politicians and the public that heat-trapping gases from tail
pipes, power plants, even methane-belching cattle, could disrupt
the climate.
</P>
<P>
   But on second look, things were not nearly so simple. Although
arctic experts said there were many signs of warming, including a
thinning and shrinking of the polar ice cap, there was no way to
link a patch of sun-dappled water at the pole to climate change.
</P>
<P>
   So the question of what is happening to climate _ and whether
people or natural forces are to blame _ returned to the realm of
nuanced, statistical fuzziness, where it has been for nearly 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   What a moment to lose potential clarion calls. Hundreds of
negotiators from industrialized countries are to convene this week
in Lyon, France, and again in late November in The Hague to try to
firm up ways to cut emissions of greenhouse gases under a 1997
climate treaty called the Kyoto Protocol. The treaty was signed by
the United States and 84 other countries but is in danger of
falling apart because of disagreements over how to make and measure
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Most climate experts are certain that global warming is real and
that it threatens ecology and human prosperity, and a growing
number say it is well under way. But policy-makers, always eager
for black and white, have once again found science offering shades
of gray.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, global warming is a classic example of the persistent
mismatch between the language of science and the needs of policy.
</P>
<P>
   Science operates by steadily chipping away at ideas through
experiments or observations, eventually revealing truths, but often
obliquely _ by eliminating what is not true. The bigger the idea,
the harder it often is to verify with precision. The result is
persistent debate, whether the issue is how to manage forests to
reduce wildfires, how to set limits for chemicals in food to
prevent cancer, or _ in this case _ how to figure out whether
people are dangerously fiddling with the global thermostat.
</P>
<P>
   But before policy-makers can try to sell potentially costly or
difficult solutions, say, taxing fossil fuels, they need to build a
clear and compelling case that strong action is called for.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson in all of this, according to climate scientists _
some of whom think humanity is already in big trouble _ is that no
one should expect some alarm bell to start ringing to summon
societies to take action.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is subtle and complex, and probably will be so for
a long time to come, said Jerry D. Mahlman, who is retiring as
director of the federal Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in
Princeton, N.J. ``This is going to be incremental forever,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those increments continue to add up, he and other climate
experts said. Past climate ups and downs mostly mesh well with
natural variations in the brightness of the sun or the cooling
effect of parasol-like plumes of particles spewed by big volcanoes.
But the recent warming, according to several recent studies, only
correlates well with one thing: the buildup of carbon dioxide,
methane and the other greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   Hints that warming is being caused by emissions from industry
and other human activities have been extracted from air bubbles
trapped in ancient ice, from variations in tree rings, from the
quick retreat of alpine glaciers. Thermometers dropped deep in the
ocean and in holes bored in permafrost show warming patterns that
do not match up with natural influences like changes in the sun's
brightness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, the subtleties have allowed warming skeptics ample
opportunity to challenge the idea. Some, like Dr. Richard S.
Lindzen, a meteorologist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, have built durable counterarguments, saying the links
connecting the earth's oceans, air and ``cryosphere,'' its frozen
places, are impossible to elucidate with sufficient confidence to
predict much beyond next week's weather.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lindzen acknowledged the arctic warming trend
and slight global warming measured in the last century, but said it
all is well within the realm of natural variation or measurement
error _ and not yet within our power to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a field that was in a primitive state when it assumed
a policy importance a few years ago,'' Lindzen said. ``Suddenly
we've declared thousands of people in a primitive field as world
experts, and they're trying to have their day.'' And reports last
week that boats had traversed the normally frozen Northwest Passage
and northern rivers and lakes were freezing later and thawing
earlier were countered with the response that this seeming meltdown
could still be ascribed to natural wiggles in temperature or ocean
currents.
</P>
<P>
   But most scientists, including some who work with Lindzen at
MIT, say the balance of data has shifted firmly toward a conclusion
that people, through their impact on the atmosphere, are
influencing climate now and will have even more impact in coming
years.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, many experts say, if the threat is to be countered,
societies will have to figure out a way to act in the face of gray
uncertainty, to deal aggressively with a problem that lacks the
attributes of a crisis. That is no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Mahlman has pretty much given up on that hope, saying that many
countries, including the United States, have essentially decided
that the focus is going to be on painless, low-cost fixes like
growing trees to sop up the most common greenhouse gas, carbon
dioxide, and on adapting to coming warming instead of countering
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't want to face up to it,'' he said, adding that
people do not want to change their lifestyle or the economy ``for
the sake of avoiding future costs.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others stress that the real challenge with global warming
and similar issues is that, by the time the impact becomes too
clear to debate, it will be far too late to do anything about it.

   (For release Sunday, Sept. 17)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; GOD'S PERFECT CHILD: Living and Dying in the Christian Science
Church &LR;  By Caroline Fraser. (Owl/Holt, $16.) A former Christian
Scientist traces the history of the religion founded by Mary Baker
Eddy, which in its heyday drew many followers with its spiritual
approach to healing. Fraser ``does a splendid job of explaining the
reasons for Christian Science's rise and fall,'' Philip Zaleski
wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WELDING WITH CHILDREN &LR;  By Tim Gautreaux. (Picador USA, $12.)
These Cajun-flavored stories are set in a place where rusted car
engines dangle from trees and kids have names like Nu-Nu and
Tammynette. ``The author proves himself an able cartographer as
well as a nimble writer, mapping with affectionate but unflinching
accuracy both the back roads of Louisiana ... and the distance
between parents and children,'' Liam Callanan wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHEN PRIDE STILL MATTERED: A Life of Vince Lombardi &LR;  By David
Maraniss. (Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $16.) According to this
biography, the legendary Green Bay Packers coach was a complex
figure who was both a world-class motivator and a small-minded
bully. ``Maraniss has a superb eye for detail'' and he ``shows not
only that winning isn't everything, it's not even what it's cracked
up to be,'' Allen St. John wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DANGEROUS HUSBAND &LR;  By Jane Shapiro. (Back Bay/Little,
Brown, $12.95.) The heroine of this humorous novel is a 40-ish New
York photographer who is driven to distraction by her pathological
_ if well-meaning _ klutz of a husband. ``Shapiro's most subtle
accomplishment ... is her creation of a loony-beyond-belief
marriage that nevertheless bears a resemblance to every marriage,''
Karen Karbo said in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HUNGRY YEARS: A Narrative History of the Great Depression
in America &LR;  By T.H. Watkins. (Owl/Holt, $16.) This chronicle of the
1930s draws on the experiences of ordinary Americans in both urban
and rural areas. ``Watkins' prose often has the intensity and
warmth of a photo by Dorothea Lange or a novel by John Steinbeck,''
Michael Kazin wrote last year. ``He refreshes old accounts about
the misery and insurgencies of the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LAST DAYS OF LOUISIANA RED &LR;  By Ishmael Reed. (Dalkey
Archive, $11.95.) This 1974 novel, nominally a detective story
featuring a hoodoo sleuth named Papa LaBas, is mainly a
free-wheeling satirical attack on 1960s racial politics and
culture, exemplified by a militant movement known as the Moochers.
``Reed has a shrewd eye, a mean ear, a nasty tongue,'' Robert
Scholes said in The New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued another of Reed's novels,
 &UR; YELLOW BACK RADIO BROKE-DOWN &LR;  ($11.95), a loopy allegory about a
black cowboy in a surreal Wild West that lampoons organized
religion and white myths about American history. ``Reed's
topsy-turvy vision says something meaningful _ certainly in a
unique way,'' one critic said in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WORDS FAIL ME: What Everyone Who Writes Should Know About
Writing &LR;  By Patricia T. O'Conner. (Harvest/Harcourt, $12.) A former
copy editor at The New York Times Book Review offers advice on how
to draft, write, revise, unsnarl and rescue prose. ``The practical
and tough-minded O'Conner uses her playful sense of humor to help
us swallow with a laugh the rules that schoolmarms once forced down
students' throats,'' Diane Cole wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RIVER SOUND: Poems &LR;  By W.S. Merwin. (Knopf, $15.) Now in
his 70s, the poet continues to explore the grieving that
accompanies daily life, but his work here is infused with a desire
to settle old debts and bequeath particular moments. ``He's
performing what James Merrill knew was the most important task of
all, taking care of the `need to make some kind of house / Out of
the life lived, out of the love spent,''' Melanie Rehak wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PARROT'S LAMENT: And Other True Tales of Animal Intrigue,
Intelligence, and Ingenuity &LR;  By Eugene Linden. (Plume, $12.95.)
These accounts of wildlife behavior, drawn from interviews with
zookeepers, researchers and trainers, feature con artists,
scoundrels, jesters and even an orangutan escape artist. ``Linden's
respect and love for all creatures in the animal kingdom is
infectious,'' Sara Ivry wrote earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AARON COPLAND: The Life and Work of an Uncommon Man &LR;  By Howard
Pollack. (University of Illinois, $24.95.) This open-minded,
respectful biography portrays the great composer (1900-90) as an
indefatigable promoter of American music whose national convictions
were central to his art. The result is ``the definitive study of
Aaron Copland's life and work,'' John Rockwell wrote last year.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

A RECKONING FOR SELMA'S MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala. _ Ask Joe Smitherman to defend himself, ask him what
a former segregationist is doing still in power in this majority
black city at the heart of the civil rights movement, and
Smitherman will appeal to the good name of his former adversary,
John Lewis, Democratic congressman from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   On March 7, 1965, Lewis was leading 600 freedom marchers across
the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma when they were attacked by state
troopers wielding billy clubs, cattle prods, and tear gas. He got
his head cracked open that day, which came to be known as Bloody
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman, in those days, was holed up in his City Hall office,
trying to figure out how to quell the uprising of blacks demanding
their right to vote. He once referred to Martin Luther King Jr. as
``Martin Luther Coon,'' though he says it was a slip of the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the mayor is still sitting in his cluttered office,
adorned with, among other things, several photographs of himself
with former Alabama governor George Wallace. Now, though, Lewis is
saying reasonably nice things about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Smitherman is not the same person who called me a
troublemaker and an agitator. I think he's grown,'' Lewis said in a
recent interview. ``There's one thing about Southern politicians:
They can count, and Smitherman can count, too. After the Voting
Rights Act, some of them got religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman certainly can count, and does talk as if he got
religion now that he professes to be a reformed segregationist.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know him say Smitherman, 70, is a shrewd politician
who has done what it takes to stay in power for nine terms, even
though more than 60 percent of Selma's voters are black and the
city is mired in poverty and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday the mayor faces what some say is his most difficult
contest yet: a runoff election with a black businessman, James
Perkins. A win for Perkins, at least symbolically, will usher in a
new era for Selma.
</P>
<P>
   This time, also, the vote will be held under the watchful eyes
of a group of unofficial election monitors who have come to Selma
because critics charge that past mayoral elections were tainted by
fraud at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   One of those monitors is Kevin Peterson of the United Way of
Massachusetts Bay. He said many black voters in Selma are afraid to
vote their preference, or vote at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smitherman has been an intimidating force in the community for
over three decades, and that alone leads to the reticence of people
in the African-American community,'' said Peterson, former director
of Part of the Solution, a voter advocacy group based in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Still, observers give Smitherman a better-than-even chance of
holding on for a 10th term. While outsiders find this nearly
impossible to understand, Smitherman's seemingly endless tenure
makes sense in Alabama. His strategy for survival _ changing with
the times _ is straight out of ``the George Wallace playbook,'' in
the words of one analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say he's done well by a city stuck in the
poverty-ridden Blackbelt _ named for the color of its soil, not its
population. Political observers argue that the black community in
Selma has never been united enough, or active enough, to mount a
serious challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But Smitherman says that blacks have no reason to challenge him,
that he understands their struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be looking out at the marches; I would be looking
mean and tough at City Hall, trying to show defiance,'' Smitherman
said as he chain-smoked Winston cigarettes. ``But I'd wonder at
times if I was black what would I have done. I would have been out
there marching, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman's excuses for his past bigotry are disarmingly frank.
Apparently, he defines a politician as something distinct from a
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians change their tune with the times. I changed
mine,'' said Smitherman. ``I was playing a political role.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smitherman ran for mayor in 1964, race was barely on his
mind. He wanted to pave city streets and attract new jobs. But
then, civil rights leaders chose Selma as one of their main staging
grounds for massive demonstrations in favor of voting rights.
Bloody Sunday and the murders of activists such as Jimmie Lee
Jackson and the Rev. James Reeb sparked passage of the Voting
Rights Act of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman said his own humble, Depression-era beginnings give
him sympathy for blacks. The youngest of six children, he grew up
poor, with a sharecropper father who died when he was an infant and
a mother who succumbed to tuberculosis when he was 12. Smitherman
still remembers the powdered potatoes and barley bread the family
got from public assistance, and the shame he felt when middle-class
fathers would not let their daughters date him.
</P>
<P>
   He was an appliance salesman when he decided to ``make
something'' of himself and run for office. The modest issues that
concerned Smitherman then _ roads, town services _ are still
essentially his issues. His newspapers ads for the election
election boast of cheap water rates, back door garbage service
twice a week, and a good recreational program.
</P>
<P>
   It's a platform that works well with his main constituency, the
white population, which votes for Smitherman almost 100 percent.
``He's a great fellow; he takes care of garbage and city streets,''
said Milton Godwin, 82.
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman takes pride in having hired nine black department
heads, a black schools superintendent, and a black police chief.
But he also tells whites they will be under siege if his opponent
wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are trying to make the town all black, and that's
a bad thing,'' Smitherman said. ``It used to be all white; that was
wrong, too, but we need some white inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   To stay in office, of course, Smitherman has had to earn some
black support as well. And he has. ``I don't see anything that he's
done bad,'' said Police Chief Earnest Tate. ``He's brought the town
a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude infuriates civil rights activists who remember the
Selma of the 1960s. Lillie Brown, 69, says she sees little progress
in the town since Bloody Sunday, when she was stepped on by a
trooper's horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I come back to Selma, I ask, `What done change?' ''
said Brown, who makes frequent visits from Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, inequality persists. For example, while the city's
overall unemployment rate is 18 percent, it's 27 percent for
blacks. The public scohols are virtually all black. ``We still have
the same fights we had in the '60s,'' said Joanne Bland of the
National Voting Rights Museum and Institute in Selma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to think there's something wrong with Selma, to
keep a man that's done some ugly things to us,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for that has been divisiveness among blacks.
This year, the black candidate who was eliminated in the first
round of voting, Yusuf Salaam, is accusing Perkins of anti-Muslim
bigotry. Activists, however, are trying to unite black voters
behind a simple slogan: ``Joe Gotta Go.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet D'Linell Finley, a political scientist at the University of
Alabama, said the state has had enough blacks in public office for
voters to know that ``black folks are not going to somehow
magically get treated fair'' just because they have a black mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman's opponents say they want a chance to see for
themselves and that the mayor has denied them that chance through
dirty tricks. In last month's general election, he came in behind
Perkins at the polls, but pulled ahead after winning more than
three-quarters of the 1,500 absentee ballots. The fact that 1,500
absentee ballots were cast in a city with 21,000 registered voters
raised suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens have complained that elderly relatives' absentee
ballots were taken from them. Others went to the polls only to be
told they had already voted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vote fraud is not uncommon in Alabama,'' said Carl Grafton, a
specialist on state politics at Auburn University in Montgomery.
``Particularly in rural counties, there are examples of vote
buying, miscounts, and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Smitherman is a man who loves politics and can't see
a life without it. He says he could have been governor, if not for
Bloody Sunday. And he says time will show he did well by Selma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have some black pallbearers when I die, I'm sure,'' he
says.

SWEEPING A HOSPITAL PROBLEM UNDER THE MATTRESS

<P>
   Hospitals go to great lengths to avoid infections. That's why
they use disposable needles and syringes, and single-dose drug
packages. Items that can't be thrown away after use are carefully
cleaned before the next patient gets to them.
</P>
<P>
   Right?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Universidade de Sao Paulo, in Brazil, studied
the cleanliness of hospital beds. As reported in the April issue of
the Portuguese-language journal Reviste Dr Saude Publica, they
checked 52 hospital mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   Before cleaning, they found 259 bacterial colonies that might
have led to infection. After the mattresses were cleaned, a second
test revealed 255 bacterial colonies.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers conclude that the cleaning process doesn't get
rid of bacteria, it just moves the colonies to other places on the
mattress.
</P>
<P>
   So when the insurance companies make a fuss about getting
patients out of the hospital faster, maybe they know what they're
talking about.

 AUSTRALIA HOPING OLYMPIC EXPOSURE CLARIFIES ITS IMAGE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ NBC president Dick Ebersol had a sly warning: The
Olympics are prom night for Australia, and the prettiest girl in
school has a blemish big enough to compete with her corsage.
</P>
<P>
   What Ebersol called a ``pimple'' was a web of power lines
criss-crossing Olympic Park at Homebush Bay, obscuring his dream of
a ``beauty shot'' of central Sydney 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's still beautiful, but she would be even more beautiful
without it,'' Ebersol said, playing on a weakness of
image-conscious Australians.
</P>
<P>
   And so, displaying an eager-to-please Aussie nature as well as a
national fear of being exposed as imposters, government officials
spent $25 million to demolish 47 huge electric towers, and to bury
the lines they carried. Cynics said it was a good thing Ebersol
hadn't asked to relocate the Sydney Opera House, which remains
stubbornly just outside camera range.
</P>
<P>
   When the 2000 Summer Olympics open on Friday, Australia will
command the world's attention as never before. And as the power
line story illustrates, it is a country desperate to make a good
impression, to be seen in the best possible light.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, it is eager to shed its persistent image as a
pleasant but remote nation, strangely rooted in its penal colony
past, filled with bush-hat-wearing, crocodile-wrestling,
shrimp-barbecuing, Foster's-Lager-drinking yobbos.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we're all living under gum trees and slaughtering
kangaroos, if they know anything about us at all,'' said Mel
MacPherson of Canberra, a retired transportation worker riding a
Sydney Harbor ferry. Some foreigners, he said, even confuse
Australia with a landlocked European republic. To prove his point,
he nodded toward a beer-bellied man wearing a T-shirt with the
words: ``There are no kangaroos in Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, revealing a curiously Australian habit of self-blame,
McPherson added: ``In fairness, we might be at fault for not trying
to explain ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics, then, offer an unprecedented opportunity for
Australians to explain themselves, or at least to expose the other
six continents to this iconoclastic yet icon-loving island that in
almost every way is far, far away.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are the basics: They're called prawns here, not
shrimp. And Foster's isn't ``Australian for beer,'' despite the ad
slogan; the brew commands just 1 percent of the market. As for the
Outback hero Crocodile Dundee, actor Paul Hogan is considered
something of a has-been, the subject of facelift rumors as he films
another sequel south of Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
   In a larger sense, Australians hope to show the world the smart,
peaceful, prosperous face of a laid-back, ``no-worries'' society,
complete with cocky grin and ready ``G'day.'' It is a heartwarming
picture, not wholly inaccurate, but simplified to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australians like to think of themselves, justified or not, as
friendly, outgoing, hospitable, egalitarian, and this is the image
we will be trying to project,'' said Clive Kessler, a sociologist
at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, Australians want the world to be
clear about what they are not. That is, British or American.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always think of ourselves in opposition to England, a cold,
nasty country versus our warm, pleasant one,'' Kessler said. As for
America, ``We spend much of our time here at the end of the world
trying not to succumb to the onslaught of Americanism under the
label of globalism.''
</P>
<P>
   That impulse can be seen in countless small ways, such as
letters to the editor complaining that a new restaurant advertises
``carry-out.'' (Aussies prefer ``take-away,'' despite it's being
the British term). It also comes in regular doses from David Dale,
who writes a popular culture column in the Sydney Morning Herald
that seems to be based largely on how much Australians are
knuckling under to American influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past week,'' he wrote triumphantly this year, ``we
have been more different from the Americans than any time this
millennium.'' He then reported breathlessly that an Australian band
had the top-selling album, an Australian television show had the
highest rating, and an Australian movie ``has beaten a bunch of
Hollywood's most commercial products.''
</P>
<P>
   One result of all this effort, of course, is that Yank
(American) visitors here tend to view Australia as vaguely British
_ left-side drivers, fealty to the queen _ while Pommy (British)
visitors hear an American echo, with bronze surfer dudes, a disdain
for social class, and designer coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Distinctions between Australia and the United States seem
particularly important here because of similarities at birth.
</P>
<P>
   Both started as British colonies on the far frontier, blessed
with endless horizons and confronted by often-unwelcoming natives _
aborigines in Australia, Native Americans in North America. In the
1830s, Charles Darwin noticed the similarities and thought
Australia might eventually rival the United States for power and
grandeur, though he later recanted.
</P>
<P>
   The key differences were in both the people and the places.
</P>
<P>
   The American colonies were founded by intense religious freedom
seekers, while Australia was originally home to hooligans, the
refuse of overcrowded British prisons. And while Australia is
roughly the same size as the lower 48 states, it has a barren
heartland, as dry and inhospitable as North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Historians cite those differences to help explain the divergence
of psyches. Americans fell in love with the self-image of the
rugged individual, going it alone to tame a rich, wild land.
Australians embraced an ideal of ``mateship,'' of pulling together
to survive an unforgiving place with egalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to a golf club, you'll find employees playing
against their bosses, and if the worker is a better player, he'll
win,'' said Kessler, the sociologist. ``And far from being upset by
this, both sides feel rewarded by it because it proves this is
still Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   The other side of that coin is what's known as the ``tall-poppy
syndrome.'' Achievers who poke up their heads risk having them cut
off, figuratively speaking.
</P>
<P>
   But that has been changing. ``You used to be ashamed in this
country about being rich. That has stopped being the case,''
Kessler said. Still, a recent poll found that 70 percent of
Australians cling to old sensibilities, saying they would prefer a
narrower gap between rich and poor to a faster growth rate for
national wealth.
</P>
<P>
   There is also hand-wringing about the end of the mythically
class-free, ``fair-go society.'' The blame _ or credit, as the case
may be _ is often placed on 15 years of overhaul and deregulation,
during which the government has sought to heighten productivity,
bolster the service and high-tech sectors, and make the country a
global player. Successes include low unemployment, low inflation,
and a yearly growth rate of about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some of the complaining is attributed to a
fundamentally Australian belief that no matter how good things
might seem, they're really much worse. It is an impulse that seems
at odds with the easygoing Aussie style, but there is much about
Australia that seems in conflict with itself.
</P>
<P>
   For all the swooning about mateship, for instance, it never
included the native Aborigines, who continue to struggle for a
place in society. And despite an anti-British streak, Australians
voted last year to retain Queen Elizabeth II as the figurehead head
of state for their parliamentary democracy. The majority apparently
considered it the lesser of two evils; as the nation approaches its
first centennial next year, mistrust for native politicians is a
pastime second only to cricket.
</P>
<P>
   Some contradictions might be explained by the fact that in many
ways this is two countries, one urban and relatively rich, the
other rural and relatively poor.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three-quarters of the 19 million Australians are on 10
percent of the land, most on the southeastern coastline from
Adelaide to Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is in the middle of that congregation and is home to
nearly one in five Australians, seemingly all of them talking on
cell phones or in chat rooms. Despite a reputation for insularity,
a recent survey found that more than 36 percent of Australians use
the Internet, a higher rate than the United States and most other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the population is spread throughout the mostly
empty expanse of the vast interior, the bush, which 19th-century
poet Henry Lawson called ``the nurse and tutor of eccentric minds,
the home of the weird, and of much that is different from things in
other lands.'' Few city folks visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bush? Never been,'' said Shana Mills, a waitress at a
restaurant near Sydney's Manly Beach. ``I want to go to the States,
though. I've made friends there on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   For rural and urban Australians alike, a notable part of the
native psyche is devotion to a fairly inexplicable list of national
icons. There is a horse (Phar Lap), a hat and coat (the Akubra and
the Drizabone), a cricket player (Donald Bradman), a car (the
Holden), a boat (the aluminum dinghy), a food (meat pies), a
marsupial (the kangaroo), a macho cartoon pitchman (Chesty Bond),
and a yeast spread (Vegemite), among others.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, it is a nation that still stokes the memory of
the 1915 invasion at Gallipoli, a disastrous bid to knock the
Ottoman Empire, Germany's Turkish ally, out of World War I.
Thousands of Australians died, and the battle remains a defining
moment for a country that was just 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Those pillars of old Australia might be losing their hold,
though, as immigrants come ashore in huge numbers. The proportion
of the population born overseas rose from 10 percent in 1947 to 23
percent in 1998, with notable recent increases coming from Vietnam,
China, and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   One result has been occasional uprisings of racist and
xenophobic sentiment, although most observers consider race
relations cordial and perhaps even exemplary compared with
elsewhere. One exception is the historic mistreatment of
aborigines, who until 1967 weren't even counted in the census _
they were on a par with native fauna.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had his misgivings, Darwin in 1836 offered an
assessment that Australians consider relevant still: ``As a means
of making men outwardly honest, of converting vagabonds, most
useless in one hemisphere, into active citizens of another, and
thus giving birth to a new and splendid country _ a grand centre of
civilization _ it has succeeded to a degree perhaps unparalleled in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the impression Australians hope will remain long after
the Olympics have ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want everybody to like us,'' said MacPherson, the retired
transport worker. ``The minute someone arrives at the airport, we
ask, `So, what do you think of the place?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he added, when the visitor says it's wonderful, ``The
Aussie isn't quite sure whether to believe him.''

TRAILBLAZER LOUISE STOKES WENT NOWHERE FAST 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALDEN, Mass. _ Her Olympic metal is black iron. It stands
starkly atop a granite slab, elegant and dignified in its
simplicity, the centerpiece of the courtyard named in her honor _
the Louise Stokes Fraser Memorial _ at her alma mater, Malden High
School.
</P>
<P>
   It is a striking silhouette of a runner crouched in the starting
blocks, and beneath it, the inscription encapsulates both her
signal achievement and eternal frustration: ``Erected in honor of
the Malden High School track star and member of the Onteora Girls
Club, who, in the 1930's, was selected to the U.S. Olympic team as
an official entry . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   That is as close as Louise Stokes ever got to the starting
blocks in the 1932 and 1936 Olympic Games at Los Angeles and
Berlin, respectively. She was never given the chance for a harvest
of a more glorious cast: gold, silver, or bronze. With her death in
1978 at the age of 64, the wife of Wilfred Fraser carried the
definitive account of her heartache to her grave, as if it were the
baton she was not allowed to touch more than six decades ago in the
4x100-meter relay event of the world's greatest competition.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the 2000 Games at Sydney looming as a showcase for
Marion Jones and her quest for an unprecedented five track gold
medals, the efforts and plight of Louise Stokes _ the groundbreaker
for Jones and all future African-American women Olympians _ are
lost amid the conjecture and innuendo of history. Stokes is an
Olympic obscurity, save for the 1987 Malden tribute and a handful
of history books and magazine articles noble in intent and
ultimately inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   All postulate to at least some degree, but cannot unequivocally
prove, that Stokes and her fellow trailblazer on the '32 and '36
Olympic relay quartets, Tidye Pickett of Chicago, were victims of
racism and, to a lesser extent, sexism and political factionism.
The three surviving members of the '32 US world-record foursome _
Annette Rogers Kelly, Evelyn Furtsch Ojeda, and, most adamantly,
Stokes's archrival from neighboring Medford, Mary Carew Armstrong _
contend through hazy recollection that the four fastest American
women were selected and that Stokes and Pickett were not among
them.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the shreds of circumstantial evidence, only two facts are
indisputable: In 1932, Louise Stokes and Tidye Pickett became the
first two black American women chosen to run in the Olympics. And
did not run in them.
</P>
<P>
   While he was playing ball with the other kids, Bill Mini would
see her in the dusk, running, never stopping, through Malden's
Ferryway Green. He also watched her do roadwork along the Boston &AMP;
Maine Railroad tracks from Malden to Saugus and back, regular as a
train schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The particulars are misty, but Mini, who later would become a
teacher at Malden High and spearhead the courtyard tribute, knew
one thing as gospel: Louise Stokes was the fastest girl in town.
</P>
<P>
   That was no secret. Stokes had been Malden's preeminent speed
merchant since 1929, when one of her teammates on the Beebe Junior
High girls' basketball team, impressed with the way she gobbled up
the court whenever she ran, persuaded her to try out for the
Onteora Club. It was the local girls' track team, overseen by
William Quain, a legendary Malden athlete in the 1890s and now the
city's parks commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Quain knew little about the girl when she came to audition.
She'd been born in 1913, the great granddaughter of slaves and the
oldest of William and Mary Stokes's six surviving children. Louise
had first lived at 542 Ferry Street in Everett, exactly two houses
from Malden's border. But by the time Quain discovered her, or vice
versa, upheaval had entered Stokes's world. The family had moved to
55 Faulkner Street, a brown duplex in Malden. There William
supported his dependents as a gardener in the summer and a stoker
of the furnaces of the well-to-do in the winter. Mary worked as a
housekeeper, often outfitting her children in the castoffs of her
wealthy clients. They were borderline poor, but this was Depression
America, and they considered themselves fortunate to be employed.
</P>
<P>
   They also had become targets of tragedy. In 1922, Louise's
4-year-old sister, Alice, set her nightgown ablaze while playing
with a match and died several days later. As the oldest child,
Louise bore a sense of guilt for not having kept a closer watch on
her sister.
</P>
<P>
   But as Quain and her Onteora teammates discovered, running set
her free from the burdens of the outside world. She immediately
established herself as the club's prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was Mr. Quain's No. 1 on the track,'' says Genevieve
Ferrick, who as Genevieve O'Mara was a teammate and playmate of
Stokes. ``It was obvious right away that she was our best runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet O'Mara and the other girls didn't consider Stokes anything
special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took her for granted; she was just another kid,'' says
O'Mara.
</P>
<P>
   Also like most of her contemporaries, O'Mara regarded Stokes as
``a very nice kid, kind of quiet.'' She sang in the choir at the
Eastern Avenue Baptist Church. When not involved with schoolwork or
attending to her four sisters and brother, she would run from
Faulkner over to O'Mara's house in Salem Place and call for her to
come out and play _ ``Hiii, Jen'' _ without bothering to knock on
the door. And off they'd go to Amerige Park, a couple of kids
running carefree.
</P>
<P>
   Stokes also seemed blessedly untouched by the degradations of
color-coded America where, almost seven decades after the
Emancipation Proclamation, lynchings were still so commonplace that
they rarely rated headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no such thing as black and white'' in Malden, says
O'Mara. ``It didn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of Malden's 58,000 citizens would help underwrite
Stokes's Olympic quests with contributions for her expenses, and in
the meantime, they celebrated her increasingly impressive
achievements. In September 1931 at Fenway Park, Stokes won the
James M. Curley Cup, awarded in the name of Boston's roguish mayor
for the year's outstanding women's track showing. Stokes's
credentials were a victory in the 100 meters, second in the 50
meters, and third in the high jump. Runner-up for the Cup was the
local rival with whom Stokes often traded victories, Mary Carew of
the Medford Girls Club.
</P>
<P>
   During her career, Stokes later would add regional and/or
national titles in the 50 meters, 100 yards, 100 meters, and high
jump, setting a US record for the 50 with a time of 6.6 seconds in
1933. She also was a consistent contender at 40 and 200 yards. Her
crowning achievement occurred at the Boston YMHA in Roxbury Dec.
30, 1931, when she shattered the US record of Boston's Katherine
Mearls and tied the world mark with a leap of 8 feet 5 1/2 inches
in the standing broad jump. For this she was dubbed the
``sensational daughter of Mercury'' in the Boston Post, a lustrous
companion to her prevailing nickname, ``the Malden Meteor.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Olympics _ opened to women only four years earlier in
the 1928 Amsterdam Games _ became a logical target rather than
simply a lofty one.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very dedicated runner,'' says O'Mara. ``She worked
so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Quain began pointing Stokes in earnest toward the 1932 US track
and field trials in Evanston, Ill. He focused in particular on her
tendency to jump the gun, which in those days warranted a penalty
of stepping 1 foot farther behind the line for the restart.
</P>
<P>
   It all paid off on July 16, a sultry day at Northwestern's Dyche
Stadium. Stokes finished tied with Carew for fourth in the
100-meter finals and Pickett came in right behind them; as a
result, the two black 18-year-olds earned relay berths for the Los
Angeles Games two weeks hence.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than a milepost to glory, the trials served as a
warning signal of the roadblock that lay ahead. The murky
proceedings of LA were foreshadowed at Evanston.
</P>
<P>
   According to the rules, all six finals participants qualified
for the Olympic team _ the top three gained the individual
100-meter spots, the fourth through sixth finishers qualified for
the relay, and the final member of the quartet would be selected
later. In one of the preliminary heats at the trials, race leader
Ethel Harrington misjudged the finish line and pulled up short.
Sympathetic judges allowed her to compete in the finals, which
would have dropped Pickett from the field. Because of the asterisk
attached to Harrington's victory, George Donoghue, a white trials
judge, decreed that Pickett should be included as a seventh runner
in the finals field. Harrington then won the race ahead of
second-place Wilhelmina von Bremen of San Francisco and No. 3
Elizabeth Wilde of Kansas City. Pickett finished in the No. 6 spot
ahead of Furtsch.
</P>
<P>
   But the largesse _ and the muddle _ didn't end there. The
Chicago-based Rogers, who had qualified in the high jump but had
lost one of her new shoes and failed to finish her preliminary in
the 100, was allowed in the mix. And Furtsch, who ran for Tustin,
Calif., and is now 86, says, ``I had fallen at the tape during the
finals but I had won my preliminary heat, so they let me in.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, at least one competitor still disputes the order of
finish in the trials. Sitting in a Framingham nursing home and
caressing her cherished gold medal, Carew, 87, points to a tattered
newspaper photograph of the runners at the Northwestern finish
line. In it, she appears at least a stride ahead of Stokes. ``I
beat Stokesy,'' she says, ``pure and simple.'' But times weren't
factored beyond tenths of a second, and other accounts, including
the official report of the Olympic Committee, list Carew and Stokes
in a dead heat.

   TAKE-BOS  
 MALDEN, Mass.: ... in a dead heat.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At any rate, the women's team proceeded directly from the trials
onto a Pullman train bound for LA. Carew emphasizes that when the
competitors boarded, ``Stokesy knew she was going as an alternate.
She knew she wasn't going to run in the Olympics.'' Again, other
accounts indicate just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, no such discord existed among the overflowing field
of relay candidates as they traveled west.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all very close, very friendly,'' says Furtsch.
``Everybody got along real well.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rogers, 86, recalls Stokes as ``a wonderful person, a
wonderful teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   That solidarity was most poignantly evident during the team's
stopover in Denver, where Stokes and Pickett experienced their only
confrontation with racism _ at least of an overt nature. At the
Brown Palace Hotel, the two African-American women were ordered to
enter from the rear door. Rogers recalls that as a gesture of
support, the entire team joined them.
</P>
<P>
   The segregation did not end there, but the team's unified stance
did. Stokes and Pickett were consigned to a single attic room while
their fellow Olympians stayed individually in regular rooms. In
addition, the two teens did not partake of the team banquet because
blacks were denied access to the hotel dining facilities; their
meals were served on trays delivered to their room. And when the
Olympians took a celebrity turn on a Denver radio program, Stokes
and Pickett remained isolated in their room.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, almost every member of the team was left in a large
shadow _ that of headliner Mildred ``Babe'' Didrikson, the
all-around sensation who in 1950 would be named the top woman
athlete of the half-century. A native of aggressively
segregationist Texas, Didrikson was no friend of the black
sprinters. But she was not discriminatory in her hostility. As far
as she was concerned, the Olympics existed solely as a vehicle for
her, and anyone or anything that interfered with that mission was
the enemy. Rogers remembers Didrikson drowning out her teammates
during the Denver radio broadcast if the interviewing strayed too
far from her favorite subject: Babe. She was almost unanimously
reviled as a prima donna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody liked her,'' says Carew, Didrikson's roommate in LA.
``I became friendly with her, but she was always brag, brag,
brag.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no further incidents in Los Angeles. Pickett and
Stokes were excluded from the Athletes' Village, but that was
because of their gender, not their race; all the women were barred
from those special quarters and were housed at the Chapman Park
Hotel. There Pickett and Stokes shared the same accommodations as
their teammates and participated in all team functions.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one. The race they had come to run.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With eight candidates _ Carew, Furtsch, Harrington, Stokes,
Pickett, Rogers, von Bremen, and Wilde _ for four relay slots,
coach George Vreeland conducted informal tryouts. He had one
objective, say the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach picked whoever he thought the best runners were,''
says Carew, ``and didn't concern himself with status. He just
worked as good as he could and picked the best people he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers agrees, though she can't remember the specifics: ``I was
under the impression he picked the four fastest runners.''
</P>
<P>
   Furtsch recalls one other consideration _ dexterity in passing
the baton, which Vreeland regarded as pivotal to success: ``He
tried to pick the girls who had the best interchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his criteria, Vreeland's word was law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were 18 years old,'' says Furtsch. ``We never questioned
the authority of the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   How the coaches determined the fastest and most adroit quartet
is open to speculation. Extensive documentation of the women's
audition times is nonexistent, and there has been speculation that
rather than clocking the runners, the coach and his staff relied on
observation and memory. In truth, any of the women was capable of
beating the others in a given race; you could throw a blanket over
them. Instead, a shroud was thrown over Pickett and Stokes. Von
Bremen and Rogers were judged to be the two fastest, Carew the
quickest out of the blocks, and Furtsch the handiest with the
baton.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, those four women won the gold in a world-record time
of 46.9 seconds. Meanwhile, Pickett and Stokes watched from the
sidelines, devastated but apparently silent as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember anybody being difficult,'' says Furtsch.
``There was no resentment on anyone's part. There was no racism I
was aware of. Not until years later did the racism charges come
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The only official disclaimer was implicit. Fred Steers concluded
his report as track team manager by stating, ``I further recommend
that all matters pertaining to the team be transacted through the
Manager only. This was not done in many cases and as a result,
considerable confusion was caused which might otherwise have been
avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was a racial injustice that Steers wanted to prevent,
but like the formation of the gold-medal relay squad, the intent is
vague.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it was not in Stokes's nature to protest on her
behalf. Carew described her as ``shy, naive'' in her pre-Olympic
days. And that evidently didn't change upon her return to Malden,
where she was accorded a warm reception, medal or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never talked about why she didn't run,'' says O'Mara,
adding that ``everybody had been very excited and felt really bad
for her. She had trained so hard in the winter and summer.''
</P>
<P>
   That pattern continued as Stokes focused on the next
opportunity, the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Even as she gained
grander success and prominence with her national championships, she
made a precipitous decision that created grave distress on the home
front. With track her consuming interest, Stokes failed several
courses during her senior year of high school. And while her
parents were distraught, Louise decided not to return to make up
the work for her diploma, instead banking all her fortunes on
running. This was in contrast to Pickett, who while continuing to
compete also attended college at Northern Illinois and was an
esteemed school principal before she died in 1986 at age 72.
</P>
<P>
   Stokes left herself with no alternative except track, and she
risked disaster in the 1936 trials at Brown University in
Providence when she failed to qualify in the 100 finals. However,
she had won her preliminary heat, and several days after the
trials, she received a reprieve when Olympic officials added her to
the relay pool _ perhaps because they felt guilty about the
treatment of the black women four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the tensions attending these Games were of a far
greater scale, for they were the notorious Nazi Olympics of Adolf
Hitler, who promised that his blond, blue-eyed Aryan nation would
prove superior to all other competitors, especially blacks and
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk of the United States boycotting the Games, and
while that never materialized, fund-raising was shot. There were
none of the Olympic megasponsors who form a corporate parade of
jingoism today, and the competitors were required to subsidize at
least $500 of their Berlin trip, an enormous sum in the dying days
of the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   But Malden came through for Stokes. At the last second, just
before the US team's ship, the SS President Roosevelt, was
scheduled to depart from New York, a waiver for the required amount
arrived. It came courtesy of Malden Mayor John Devir and Onteora's
Quain, who had collected donations by soliciting the townspeople.
In addition, Stokes received $75 in expense money and $105 was set
aside for a homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the celebration would be enthusiastic but
bittersweet. Pickett finally got to compete _ in the 80-meter
hurdles, where she broke her foot in the semifinals. That meant she
was out of consideration for the relay, and so, ultimately, was
Stokes.
</P>
<P>
   One factor may have been cold cash, given the US Olympic
movement's shaky financial status. The Western establishment was
far more powerful, and better funded, than the Eastern. And
Hitler's virulent anti-Semitism may have trickled down to
indirectly block Stokes. These were the Games in which Jesse Owens
dominated _ and was repeatedly snubbed by Hitler, who refused to
shake any black athlete's hand. Owens won three gold medals, and
the coaches believed his presence would enhance the chances for a
fourth in the 4x100 relay. He and fellow African-American medalist
Ralph Metcalfe were added to the quartet _ at the expense of the
only two American Jewish competitors, Marty Glickman and Sam
Stoller.
</P>
<P>
   Conveniently enough, where an opening had developed for blacks
on the men's relay, it vanished for them on the women's. Pickett
was hors de combat, and Stokes was excluded from the team in favor
of ``veteran'' Western runners _ three of whom she'd beaten in
Berlin tryouts.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Stephens, Betty Robinson, Harriet Bland, and Rogers
retained the relay gold for the United States, while once again a
spot was reserved for Stokes on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This time she was more outspoken when she returned, but only a
bit. During a reception at the Ferryway following a welcoming
parade, she alluded to the superior organization of the Westerners.
There was no mention of race, nor would there be, it seems, until
late in her life.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Pete Kearin of the Malden Evening News on
Aug. 29, 1972, Stokes referred to the Olympic oversights. By then,
she had married a noted cricket player, Fraser; raised a son,
Wilfred Jr.; found work as a clerk in the state Department of
Corporations and Taxation; and transferred her athletic skills to
the alleys, becoming a proficient bowler.
</P>
<P>
   She indeed had been twice snubbed in her Olympic efforts, Stokes
told Kearin, ``and the worst part of it all is that they've never
said a word about it, not to this day.'' She described herself as
``just a cute little girl that hardly didn't know anything.'' Of
her Olympic shunning, she said, ``When we (Stokes and Pickett) went
out to run, we found other runners in our places. We just had to
stand there, and I felt terrible. I really should have said
something. But after it was done, what could you do?''
</P>
<P>
   That was it. No blistering diatribe. No self-congratulatory
reference to pioneering efforts, though they couldn't be
overlooked, as Pickett once told the Chicago Sun-Times: ``The girls
who came on later didn't have to face the same things. We took a
lot for them. We really opened the door for them, but I'm glad it
was opened.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Stokes passed quietly from the scene. But she was
not completely forgotten. In 1974, the New England AAU declared a
day in her honor, and several trophies were awarded in her name.
Posthumously, she was inducted into the Hall of Black Achievement
at Bridgewater State College last year.
</P>
<P>
   And there is her high school courtyard, where she is frozen
forever, poised and ready to take her place in posterity, though
never her rightful place.

FREEDMAN CYCLES TO HER OWN RHYTHM 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ She was weak. She bought a pair of sandals
today, $200 black leather beauties. They feel so good and she feels
so guilty; even as she luxuriates in them, Nicole Freedman ponders
the hedonistic implications. Two hundred dollars? That's a month's
rent. Literally. For some footwear. How utterly decadent. How
positively _ ugh! _ Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but maybe she can balance the moral ledger. She already has
observed that there are too many athletic shoes on her closet
shelf. Closet? Shelf? The uninitiated would more readily identify
it as the dashboard of a psychedelic 1978 Ford Econoline van that
reposes like a junkyard dog in the driveway and has served as
Freedman's bedroom the past four years, the antithesis of the
upper-middle-class entitlements she enjoyed while growing up in
Wellesley, Mass. Anyway, some of these ratty running relics will
have to go, just on general principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like having stuff,'' says Freedman. ``It's too much
stuff. I'm an antimaterialist. You can get too chained to things.''
</P>
<P>
   And that just doesn't fit with a lifestyle that the most ascetic
monk probably would reject as too heavy on self-denial. One sinful
indulgence cannot erase the no-frills equation that is Freedman's
core: Right now, at age 28, with a degree in urban planning from
Stanford and two undergraduate years of engineering at MIT on her
resume, she exists solely to cycle, to pursue the endeavor to its
sacred essence _ the Olympic Games, where she'll be riding at
Sydney Sept. 26 in the 100-kilometer road race. The van, an
heirloom from her earliest days of hard-core riding for the
now-defunct Odwalla team, is a handy metaphor for the regimen of
humbling sacrifice, the purist's reward of competition for
competition's sake, that once was the Olympic ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's the way it is,'' says Freedman. ``It's no big
deal. To the outside world, it's a symbol of what it takes in a
non-mainstream sport.''
</P>
<P>
   It also takes this:
</P>
<P>
   Sally Jean Alexander remembers the girl, no more than 9 or 10
years old, who used to run for the Wayfarers junior track club.
Alexander, a Wayland High School teacher, had organized a travel
team to help showcase the talents of a 16-year-old up-and-coming
star runner, John Mann. Little Nicole Freedman had been recommended
to her after winning a Patriots Day run for 9-year-olds at
Wellesley High with a 6-minute-49-second mile; the time was
indelibly precise because one of the men standing with Nicole's
father, Boston University mathematics professor Marvin Freedman,
had clocked her with a stopwatch and, duly impressed, had suggested
that the girl join Alexander's troupe.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet, innocent Nicole. Almost two decades later, Alexander is
hazy on many particulars but vividly recalls one race. It was at a
meet put on by a New England track group, and Freedman was doing
very well. As she entered the finish chute, she had fourth place
locked up. But after the winner broke the tape, the would-be
runner-up took a spill. Flat on the ground, she blocked the path to
the finish line. Instinctively, the No. 3 runner stopped to assist
her fallen comrade. Instinctively, the No. 4 runner assessd the
fallout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a chance to move up two places,'' says Freedman.
</P>
<P>
   So she jumped over the prone runner _ make that rival _ and
finished second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was going to deter her,'' says Alexander. ``I'm sure
if she saw the girl was hurt, she would have stopped, too. But she
did just what the high school runners would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. Competition for competition's sake. With a little
cutthroat thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
--------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is an incongruous mix, an apparent clash of mutually
exclusive elements, but genuine nonetheless. Calling Freedman an
idealistic pragmatist _ or a pragmatic idealist, take your pick _
does no disservice to either term. The evidence is as strong as it
is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   There was her Spanish experience. At 16, she raised the money to
participate in a volunteer health services organization, Amigos de
las Americas, which provides assistance for Latin countries. For
six weeks, she built latrines in Oaxaca, Mexico, and her only
regret was that she had been too young to qualify for duty the
previous year, when she originally tried to get into the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she'd never done another thing in her life,'' says
Freedman's mother, Corey, a Realtor, ``that alone would have been
remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   But this same civic benefactor was savvy enough to exploit her
Spanish studies for the greatest gain. Nicole was an academic
standout, as her college pedigree would indicate, but Corey
believed she never did more than what was necessary to excel.
Except in Spanish. Her essays were extensive, elaborate exercises
in the language, far more comprehensive than any of her other
schoolwork. Corey always wondered why. Then she found out. At the
Wellesley High 1990 commencement, Freedman earned a Spanish
scholarship _ ``I think it was worth something like $7,000,'' says
Marvin _ that was annually awarded to the top senior. Aha, thought
Corey, ``in all the other languages, they only got books (for
academic distinction), and Nicole must have realized as a freshman
that there was this financial award. That's why she put so much
work into the Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole is horrified that her mother would think she calculatedly
pursued the payoff for three years. ``I was a junior when I found
out about the money,'' she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   It's no different in her athletic endeavors. That Patriots Day
race that stamped her as a track prodigy was a fun run. But she'd
had her father take her to the track several weeks beforehand so
she could acclimate herself to the conditions because she wanted to
have the fastest fun.
</P>
<P>
   And until she transferred to Stanford, cycling never had been
more than an activity, probably her favorite one. She'd fallen in
love with it when she was 8 and Marvin and Corey would take their
daughters _ Nicole and Emily, two years older _ to Concord to
participate in American Youth Hostel rides. Rides, not races. But
Nicole _ aboard a miniature 10-speed bike Corey had scoured the
area to find _ only briefly would accompany her parents. ``She'd
wave to us and take off right to the head of the group,'' says
Marvin.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has changed except the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
--------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freedman is a 5-foot-2-inch, 115-pound laugh track for whom
conventional conviviality would be reclusive. Lisa Raskin, a
Stanford cycling colleague, was drawn to her like so many others _
``because she has such a strong, dynamic personality.'' Freedman
is, in fact, a Roman candle of enthusiasm who writes irreverent
diaries in the cycling publication Velo News and on the Internet
for CNN/SI, musings that have established her as a maverick on the
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the establishment considered her a comedian,'' says
her mentor, Steve Miller. ``She has what is considered an
overwhelming and unstoppable sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   The iconoclastic message doesn't necessarily enchant the
traditionalists. ``Her writing style can be a little sarcastic,''
says Julie Schwab, niece of investment guru Charles and overseer of
Freedman's current team, the first to pay her a stipend for riding.
``A lot of people take it way too seriously to have her come in and
say, `Hey, nobody is making a million dollars, so let's have fun.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Serious fun; that's what the skeptics don't get. Freedman's
philosophy is unwavering: ``If you're going to do something and
really enjoy it, you might as well have a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Cycling is her vehicle of expression. She isn't committed to it;
she is consumed by it. And as indicated by her startling Olympic
trials victory at Jackson, Miss., May 20 on the eve of her 28th
birthday _ a clinical masterpiece ``that brought tears to your
eyes,'' says Miller, a witness who was so moved _ the old guard had
better get used to her.

WHITE HOUSE DRAMA SWEEPS THE POLLS WITH NINE EMMYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I've got a `West Wing' feeling,'' host Garry Shandling said
midway through Sunday night's 52d annual Emmy Awards. And he was
right in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   In what was the most surprise-filled Emmy ceremony in years,
first-year drama ``The West Wing'' walked off with a whopping nine
statuettes, including best drama, best supporting actor for Richard
Schiff, and best supporting actress for Allison Janney. Aaron
Sorkin, creator and writer of the intelligent series that has
managed to make politics into popular TV, wryly noted: ``There's
going to be no living with me now.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about HBO's critically acclaimed ``Sopranos''?
Fuggetaboutem. Only actor James Gandolfini was honored for the mob
drama that many felt should have swept the awards last year, for
its brilliant freshman season. Maybe Emmy voters weren't ready to
give too many series honors to a cable effort, maybe it's an
election year and ``The West Wing'' was simply irresistible to
voters. Edie Falco, who was the only ``Sopranos'' win last year for
best actress, lost this year to Sela Ward, for her emotionally rich
work on ``Once and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   The comedy awards offered similar suprises, as ``Will &AMP; Grace''
claimed three major prizes _ best comedy, best supporting actor for
Sean Hayes, and best supporting actress for Megan Mullally. The
wins come at a good time for the witty sitcom that makes light of
sexual orientation, as it makes a risky move to Thursday nights at
9 this fall. Patricia Heaton won best actress in a comedy for her
long-suffering wife on ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' and sentimental
favorite Michael J. Fox won for his final season on ``Spin City.''
</P>
<P>
   Why all the unexpected victories, after years of Emmy same old
same old? A new voting system this year allowed members of the
Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences to vote after watching tapes
of the shows at home. Previously, members were permitted to vote
only if they attended weekend-long screenings and discussions at a
Los Angeles hotel. Naturally, most members never made it to the
screenings.
</P>
<P>
   As TV, Sunday night's Emmycast was a swift ride _ or as swift as
three hours of presenters, acceptance speeches, and clips can be.
Mostly that was thanks to the fresh batch of new winners. While
John Lithgow was blase accepting his third statuette last year, and
Helen Hunt was downright sullen accepting her fourth, each of
Sunday night's winners _ many of them first timers _ were
breathless and flustered. The towering Allison Janney, who has made
her press secretary C.J. Cregg into an instantly beloved TV
character, sputtered with excitement as she accepted best
supporting actress for ``The West Wing.'' She gave a touching nod
to the ``exquisite, elegant'' Nancy Marchand, the late actress who
played the murderous Livia in ``The Sopranos'' and who was her
biggest competitor in the category.
</P>
<P>
   Sela Ward, overwhelmed and on the verge of tears as she jumped
to the stage for her best actress nod, exclaimed, ``Can I tell you
how excited I am?'' ``Will &AMP; Grace'' supporting actor Sean Hayes
was just about dumbstruck after winning for his fabulous Jack
McFarland, the character who is never struck dumb. Indeed, the
entire ``Will &AMP; Grace'' contingent appeared exhilarated by their
good fortune. Executive producer Max Mutchnick noted, ``This award
conveys a whole new meaning to the phrase `acceptance speech'.''
</P>
<P>
   Shandling was at his vain, sarcastic best, a fountain of
neurotic confessions and sharp observations. ``I read for the part
of vice president,'' he said about ``The West Wing.'' ``They said,
`too Jewish.' '' A series of ``Larry Sanders''-esque vignettes _
some funnier than others, but all quick _ found him in the men's
room receiving a hand towel from attendent David Duchovny, or
grossing out Sarah Jessica Parker with an idea for ``Sex and the
City.'' An opening ``Survivor'' skit heralded a night of reality-TV
bashing, no surprise since the Emmys are primarily a celebration of
scripted dramas and comedies.
</P>
<P>
   The movie category was equal parts ``The Corner'' and ``Tuesdays
with Morrie.'' While the Emmy voters mysteriously ignored the
extraordinary performers in ``The Corner,'' particularly Khandi
Alexander, they gave the HBO miniseries awards for best miniseries,
director, and writing. Hank Azaria and Jack Lemmon won best actor
and supporting actor, respectively, for ``Tuesdays with Morrie,''
which also took best movie. Lemmon teared up as he honored his wife
and family: ``You are my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the pre-show red carpet parade was rockin', rollin',
jumpin' and jigglin'. Spirits were as high as the temperature, with
lots of fashion do's and doosies, from Ward's leather dominatrix
garb to Geena Davis' slinky, see-through, pop-art gown. Joan Rivers
was in fine form, yelling out her usual roster of bad jokes and
inane questions to distracted celebrities. Face to face with
Michael Badalucco, who won her worst-dressed award last year for
his Emmy outfit, Rivers was impressed by his humility and good
taste. ``You won't be worst-dressed this year,'' she assured him as
he walked away.

   TAKE-BOS  
 PALO ALTO, Calif.: ... used to her.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most everything about her is geared toward cycling. Hence the
minimalist lifestyle that most would consider quirky but Freedman
regards as imperative. Oh, sure, she'll share in the inevitable
laughter when people get a gander at her immobile home in the
driveway _ decorated garishly along the sides and windows with
large fruit and other Odwalla insignia. She'll good-naturedly point
out that this old team van has occupied this spot since Miller
nursed it here from Colorado despite a crippling generator problem
that meant the engine couldn't be restarted once it was turned off.
And, though she's now the van lord rather than the resident, she'll
chuckle through a guided tour of the interior, featuring a spartan
bed on which she's placed a futon; a cabinet console that houses an
assortment of nutritional supplements _ ``I think I take more pills
than my 80-year-old grandmother''; the guest room, also known as
the passenger seat; the laundry room, formerly the driver's seat;
and an eclectic library scattered along the floor consisting of
cycling tomes and works ranging from ``Schindler's List'' to Jackie
Joyner-Kersee's autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   She's lighthearted about the whole thing, but it's no joke. She
lives this way because she believes it facilitates her cycling.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman prefers New England and intends to settle there,
probably in Western Massachusetts, ``because it's more rural. The
people are more family-oriented. They may lack some of the social
graces, but you can know what they're really thinking. You can know
your neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, she stays here, living under dorm-like conditions
in _ and outside _ an obscenely overpriced ramshackle ranch that is
a glorified tract house but still rents for $2,875 monthly, this
being Silicon Valley and all. ``Ask people why they're here and
they say to live for a couple of years and make lots of money,''
says Freedman. ``For them, it's get-rich-quick. I guess for me,
it's get-poor-slow.''
</P>
<P>
   So she sacrifices by subletting, enabling her to share indoor
privileges with four fellow transients in a house that is decorated
in what best could be described as collegiate dishabille, the major
furniture being five bikes hanging from a wall in the foyer. ``It's
a cardboard box,'' says Freedman. But it's worth it because she
considers the training conditions here perfect _ the moderate
year-round weather, the trails and hills wending to the coast on
which she rides some 350 miles a week and where ``she knows every
leaf and rock,'' says her father.
</P>
<P>
   Even her temporary move indoors, which will end after the
Olympics, was planned with Sydney in mind. She needs her sleep,
Freedman explains, and it's futile trying to get much in the
driveway because a train regularly traverses the tracks in the
shadow of the neighborhood and sounds its horn throughout the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, unused in the nine-room, four-bedroom family home in
Wellesley is Freedman's room. There a papier-mache monkey that took
her a half-year to create in high school still dangles on a
makeshift branch from a window, a la Curious George. But Freedman
eschews these familiar niceties and the career track many of her
friends _ now doctors and lawyers and teachers _ have followed. She
works part time for an on-line women's sports company but is on
hiatus now as she devotes all her energies to Olympic preparations.
And she hopes never to have a cursed 9-to-5 desk job, preferring to
settle into a career connected with women's sports that will enable
her to get out and about. In the meantime, she follows a trail that
almost defies orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think she enjoys the underdog role,'' says
Schwab. ``It's because of the way she lives. She could live where
the cost of living is lower, work full time, train less . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   And hate every minute of it. For better or worse, this is
Freedman's unique interpretation of the American dream. And even
while her parents _ who thought she would proceed directly from
college into a career _ cautiously wonder when, if ever, she'll use
that bachelor's degree in the marketplace, they applaud her
resolve. ``I kind of admire the way she lives,'' says her mother.
``It makes sense to me to pursue what you enjoy doing, not spend
your money on frivolous things but on what gives you enjoyment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just that Marvin and Corey Freedman never envisioned such
all-encompassing enjoyment coming from this.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
--------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even when she became an itinerant track apprentice with the
Wayfarers, her parents thought sports were a diversion. ``She's the
only one in the family who's competitive,'' says Marvin. And Corey
adds, ``We didn't realize she was this competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, little did they know. ``We'd go on bike rides to Walden
Pond,'' says Dr. Julie Damon, a Freedman friend since sixth grade.
``She always said she wanted to go to the Olympics, but she never
specified in what event.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not cycling. At least not on the surface. But there
were hints . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell track wasn't a love for her,'' says Peggy
Kriss, who used to employ Freedman as a baby sitter and will
accompany her husband, Cliff Pollan, to Sydney for the road race.
``When she started biking, you knew it was a passion for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, track, if anything, seemed her athletic destiny. Sally
Jean Alexander would write accounts of Wayfarers races for various
local newspapers, and Nicole took great pleasure in the publicity.
``She always enjoyed the limelight,'' says her mother. ``She liked
seeing her name in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``she was competitive in a good way,'' says Dr. Amy
Spooner, who has known Freedman since second grade. ``And she
basically was good at everything she tried.''
</P>
<P>
   That continued in high school, where Freedman captained the
track team, excelling in events ranging from the 100-yard dash to
the 2-mile, and played tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was probably the best all-around athlete I ever had,''
says former Wellesley High track coach Mickey Walsh. ``What I found
special about her was her toughness. She was dynamic, a great kid
with a great sense of humor. She's the reason people go into
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   When she got to MIT, she continued to compete in track and
played basketball, but these seemed no more than extracurricular
activities as Freedman focused on her studies. ``If I did what I'm
best at,'' she says, ``I'd be a mechanical engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   She discovered that MIT wasn't the best for her. For one thing,
she wanted to pursue liberal arts. For another, she wanted a more
intensive athletic challenge. ``She found MIT boring,'' says
Spooner. ``I think she wanted to be with people who were more
serious about track.''
</P>
<P>
   Hello, Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   But once there, Freedman took a major detour, and not just
academically. At the Division 1 level in track, ``I was thoroughly
mediocre,'' says Freedman. ``If I fell dead on the track, it
wouldn't matter'' to the team.
</P>
<P>
   So after her junior year, she tried another approach. ``I
decided to do what I wanted to do,'' says Freedman. ``If I felt
like running, I'd run.''
</P>
<P>
   The first week of this new regime, she felt like running 40
miles. ``I said to myself, `See? That proves I'm a runner,' '' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Then she promptly proved she wasn't. ``I didn't do any after
that,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, her footwork involved pedals. And passion. ``I found
myself riding 200 miles a week,'' says Freedman. ``I did it with
absolutely no pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Or thoughts about any riding other than recreational. But Art
Walker, coach of the Stanford club team _ it's not an
NCAA-sanctioned sport _ persuaded her to try competition. And thus
was born an obsession. Freedman helped Stanford win the informal
national college championship, then participated in the Ride Across
America. And she was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents discovered her addiction almost by accident. When
they visited Corey's relatives in Los Angeles, Nicole joined them _
by bike. Some 440 miles from the Stanford campus. And on excursions
to the beach during their stay, Nicole would ride while they would
drive. She'd start out earlier, and she'd always be there to meet
them when they arrived, having covered a route that included uphill
ascents even Corey considered taxing _ and she was in a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw how Nicole had gone over the mountains,'' says
Corey, ``I was amazed. I wasn't surprised when she won the trials
because what she does is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Nicole is living for the ultimate moment _ the Olympic race,
where she'll try to put the pedal to the medal in what would truly
be an amazing acccomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's risk and reward,'' says Miller. ``She'll have a go at it.
It may pay off or she may finish last.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, she'll embody the ultimate contradiction in her
life. ``I think there's something about this competitiveness,''
says Marvin Freedman as he attempts to explain his daughter's
decisions to a visitor and to himself. ``You get instant
gratification.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're long-suffering enough, as Nicole Freedman is.

   They've built an electronic tennis racket.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous, yes. But even as the weekend player with no serve
rejects the latest madness from a gadget-centric world, a sick
curiousity begins to work on the brain. Maybe, just maybe it can
end years of mediocrity on the court. Maybe, just maybe, it can
blow a doubles match wide open in Weymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Smartest racket in the world, they say. Probably the most
expensive racket in the world, too, says a spokesman for Continuum
Control Corp. in Billerica, Mass., which engineered the guts of the
beast, available from Head in February.
</P>
<P>
   Something about ``piezoelectric power,'' transforming mechanical
motion into energy when the ball hits the strings. Something about
a circuit board in the handle sending messages to the racket head.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. A death ray in a zippered case is what we're after,
and for a crazy minute or two the player with no serve starts to
believe it exists. For an even crazier minute that person thinks
about ordering it online.
</P>
<P>
   This is America, ladies and gentlemen. This is human nature.
Hard-charging capitalism meets the soaring ego, and a whole lot of
money changes hands.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, we can do a self-righteous dance blaming the excesses
of a materialistic society on Mephistophelean inventors, but nobody
is taking the plastic out of our pockets at The Sharper Image.
Nobody is forcing us into the shower with a water-resistant compact
disc player so we can think we sing like Sinatra through the
shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   Big item at the gadget emporium, the CD player. Goes for about
$190. Comes with an AM-FM radio, plays TV audio, picks up European
stations overseas, and sports two time zones. Another model has a
tape to record a 20-second message, should someone want to save a
great thought, or leave one for the next person in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   But why would a sane person want to do that? For the same reason
a weekend player with no serve wants robo-racket. Because the
technology is there. Because we feel we are owed nice toys in
payment for stressful days. Because we are the most sophisticated
people ever to walk the planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Romans have ionic air dryers? No way, and Rome was damn
good. ``Ionics'' _ the word is edging out ``natural'' and ``clear''
as the most over-used advertising adjective. Something about
positive and negative charges. Bathes the hair shafts. Also comes
as an air purifier. Deodorizes the house, the car, the dog, and
beats all heck out of those little cardboard pine trees hanging on
rearview mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   The most sophisticated people ever to walk the planet Earth
demand perfection from the cosmos. That's why Brookstone is selling
a clock radio with its own sun. When the clock goes off in the dead
of a winter morning, a bulb comes up out of the works to light the
bedroom. Hit the snooze button and the sun sets.
</P>
<P>
   The most sophisticated people ever to walk the planet Earth
leave nothing to chance. They buy the corkscrew with the degree
from MIT and a ``computerized probe'' indicating if a wine needs
chilling, or warming, or is ready to drink. It's part of a family
of ``smart tools'' that can tell when chickens have been barbecued,
if steaks are rare, and if pasta is al dente.
</P>
<P>
   Cooks used to be able to tell this simply by looking at the
food, or tasting it, but that's so 20th century. People are busy.
Too much going on. Too many decisions to make about equipment. And
choices create tension, which could explain the proliferation of
products designed to help people relax.
</P>
<P>
   There are foot baths, back massagers, ergonomic porch chairs,
pillows that untangle neck knots, interactive mood lights, and
``heart and sound soothers'' that claim to slow the pulse with
recordings of ocean waves, rain forests, and chirping crickets _
but not all at once, unless something goes terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Do we need therapy? Will the human behavior experts of a future
age stare at the artifacts of the most sophisticated people ever to
walk the planet Earth and figure that ionized air must have been a
hallucinogen?
</P>
<P>
   What a racket.

<P>
   They seem the picture of health. But there are alarming signs
that athletes are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with
the unrelenting drive toward excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most athletes say that they are happy to die early if it means
that they could win Olympic gold,'' says exercise physiologist
Richard Winsley of Exeter University. ``That's the mindset we are
dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Although deaths are rare, sportsmen and women are falling ill
with an ever-widening range of ailments. Many are caused by one
particular problem, overtraining syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``People train harder and harder,'' says sports physiologist
David Jones at Birmingham University. ``But the more they train,
their performance gets worse and worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include fatigue, sore muscles, loss of energy, frequent
infections and mood disturbances. To arrest this decline, sufferers
push themselves even harder. ``But of course that's the worst thing
they can do,'' says Winsley.
</P>
<P>
   Overtraining syndrome troubles around 65 per cent of endurance
athletes at some point in their careers. Now the problem is
starting to appear in sprinters and power athletes too. ``They
present primarily with changes in mood with subsequent changes in
performance,'' says Richard Budgett of the British Olympic
Association. Although rest is the usual cure, sometimes the
condition becomes increasingly hard to treat.
</P>
<P>
   When we exercise normally, the body releases hormones such as
cortisol and growth hormone to help cope with the stress. ``If you
do it over and over, the hormonal responses become abnormal,'' says
Jones. Chronic high levels of cortisol can lead to muscle wasting,
loss of bone and a suppressed immune system. The result can be
recurrent injuries such as stress fractures, and minor infections
such as colds that won't clear up.
</P>
<P>
   Jones believes overtraining syndrome may have similar origins to
chronic fatigue syndrome. Some doctors think that the reason people
with CFS find easy tasks arduous is that they are hypersensitive to
the neurotransmitter serotonin, which tells the brain how active
the body is.
</P>
<P>
   Jones thinks that overtrained athletes also sometimes become
abnormally sensitive to serotonin, and that this leads to feelings
of extreme tiredness. He is currently testing buspirone, a drug
that mimics serotonin to see whether these athletes show the same
sensitivity to the drug as CFS patients do.  &QL;

<P>
   Keep your eyes peeled. Among this year's gold medallists you
might see something close to the perfect athletic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes have consistently shattered records throughout the past
century. But now they are pushing against the very limits of human
potential, say researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The improvement is real. But it's starting to level off in
most events,'' says Frangois Pironnet, a sports physiologist at the
University of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean there will never be new records. But as
athletes begin to hit the ceiling of human ability, we'll no longer
expect each year's performance to be better than the last. For
example, in the classic running events even the best athletes are
finding it increasingly hard to run faster than the champion before
them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, new world records will occur randomly, just like
record-breaking rainfall or droughts. Take the men's 1500-meter
event. The world record of 3 minutes 26 seconds was set only two
years ago. But Pironnet says results from the past 15 years are
essentially random. From now on, the best times for that event may
scatter around the 3:26 mark _ sometimes a little better, sometimes
a little worse, but with no overall trend toward faster times.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are already trying to predict the ultimate human
performance. Robert W. Schutz, a statistician at the University of
British Columbia, has made predictions based on past performances
in seven track and field events and projected them into the future.
He calculates that by the year 2050 the marathon will be run in 2
hours 2 minutes 39 seconds (2:02:39), just three minutes faster
than the current best time of 2:05:42. Schutz has also projected
the ``asymptotic value'' for each sport _ the point at which for
all practical purposes progress will stop _ based on the flattening
performance curves.
</P>
<P>
   Pironnet has drawn up his own projections of what the ultimate
athlete may be capable of. He has tried to isolate those
physiological factors that limit performance. Pironnet combined lab
studies and performance statistics to spot changes in anaerobic and
aerobic power and endurance in runners over time. On the basis of
these figures, he suggests that over the next 50 years, record
times will begin to hit these limits.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more doubtful. ``Every time someone says we've
reached the limit, somebody else goes out and breaks a record,''
says Carl Foster at the University of Wisconsin in La Crosse.

<P>
   Arguments over whether to store or reprocess nuclear waste have
been thrown into confusion following a change of heart by the
British Atomic Energy Authority (AEA).
</P>
<P>
   In April, the AEA said the costs of both options were
``comparable'' if plutonium is defined as waste. Now New Scientist
has learned that a confidential draft of the report, completed in
January, concluded that storage ``has a large advantage'' because
it is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   The government is considering whether to reprocess or store 25
tons of plutonium fuel from a defunct reactor run by the AEA at
Dounreay in Scotland. The April report was part of a public
consultation.
</P>
<P>
   The draft was obtained from the Scottish Environment Protection
Agency by lawyers acting for the group Nuclear Free Local
Authorities. Jamie Woolley, legal adviser to the group, is now
calling on the government not to agree to funding for reprocessing
at Dounreay until it has studied the earlier, draft report. ``It
looks like the AEA has attempted to suppress a conclusion that it
doesn't like,'' he claims.
</P>
<P>
   The AEA denies this. It says the conclusion was altered because
the draft underestimated the cost of treating spent fuel before it
was stored.  &QL;

   Physicists think they've caught tantalizing glimpses of the
elusive particle that gives matter its mass.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers working with a giant particle detector called ALEPH
at the CERN particle physics laboratory near Geneva say a handful
of oddball collisions may mark the fleeting appearance of the Higgs
boson. The Higgs is a crucial piece in the jigsaw of fundamental
particles. Finding it is currently the big prize for particle
physicists.
</P>
<P>
   The machine that produced these events, the Large Electron
Positron Collider (LEP), is scheduled to close down for good at the
end of this month. So the ALEPH researchers have precious little
time to collect enough data to confirm their observation.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Higgs boson, or some more convoluted explanation,
the Universe as we know it wouldn't exist. Postulated more than 30
years ago, the Higgs gives particles such as quarks and electrons
their mass. Particles swim through a sea of hidden Higgs bosons,
which drag on them and produce inertia, the essence of mass.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have been searching for the Higgs for more than a
decade. Although Higgs particles are extremely massive, they are
normally hard to spot because they exist only ``virtually.'' Higgs
particles exploit the inherent uncertainty in quantum mechanics to
pop in and out of existence for only the briefest of instants, too
short a time to be observed.
</P>
<P>
   To see a Higgs, physicists have to manufacture one by smashing
extremely fast-moving particles together. The energy of the
collision is converted into matter, and if the energy is high
enough, a bona fide Higgs may pop into existence. Having done so,
it decays into a telltale combination of other particles.
</P>
<P>
   Such decays could account for several unusual events observed
recently at LEP, ALEPH researchers said this week at a meeting at
CERN. But they admit that their evidence is not yet conclusive.
``It's unfortunately not enough to say we have made a discovery,''
says ALEPH's Wolf-Dieter Schlatter.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that the events are chance combinations of random
particles, or fakes produced by familiar particles such as Z bosons
decaying in just the right way to mimic a Higgs. Such explanations
are made more likely by the fact that none of the other three
particle detectors arrayed around LEP has seen any sign of Higgs
events.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether CERN should keep LEP running to try to
confirm the Higgs sighting. ALEPH researchers could double their
data if LEP ran until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-kilometer-long LEP, housed in a ring-shaped tunnel
straddling the Swiss-French border, has already painted detailed
portraits of the W and Z bosons, and has proved that there can be
no more than six quarks. It is due to be dismantled to make way for
a new machine in the same tunnel, the Large Hadron Collider,
scheduled to begin hunting for the Higgs particle in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, CERN's great rival, Fermilab near Chicago, may
find the Higgs first. Fermilab will resume colliding beam
experiments this month, after more than four years of renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the ALEPH team may be making too much of too little.
``You wonder if it's just a way for them to extend their running
time,'' says Dave Besson of the University of Kansas in Lawrence.
ALEPH collaborator Alan Litke rejects this suggestion. ``We have no
interest,'' he says, ``in running LEP for the sake of running
LEP.''  &QL;

   First Napster, then MP3.com. The uninitiated might be forgiven
for assuming that the entire digital-music world is made up of
pirates fighting a pitched battle against the recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   But that's hardly the case.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to the mall to pay $13 for your next CD, take a
few minutes to peruse the online music offerings. Net-savvy music
lovers will find a variety of sites that allow them to download
tunes quickly, cheaply, and perfectly legally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record labels aren't going after all digital-music
sites,'' said Eric Scheirer, an analyst at Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass. ``There are important legal differences between
what (most music sites) do and what MP3.com does.''
</P>
<P>
   Before using any of the sites, you'll need to download a free
MP3 player, which is also completely aboveboard. On that count you
have dozens of choices, but RealPlayer (www.real.com) and Winamp
(www.winamp.com) are the most popular.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, while the Napster and MP3.com cases wend their way
through the appeals process, drop by the sites below to preview the
next Wynton Marsalis album, find a rare or out-of-stock tune,
compare prices with the mall stores, or just see what all the
digital-music fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   If none strikes the right tone for you, there are more than 150
other music sites available on the Web. Not all, though, are as
scrupulous about avoiding ``objectionable material'' (translation:
illegal MP3s).
</P>
<P>
   --www.EMusic.com is designed for people who want to pay for
their digital music, a prospect that might shock (or at least
amuse) some Web users. But it does have plenty of tunes to choose
from, featuring 125,000 tracks in a variety of genres, including
blues, classical, country, jazz, reggae, rock, and hip hop.
</P>
<P>
   Buying individual songs from EMusic.com costs 99 cents, albums
$8.99. Or you can download as much music as you like for a $9.99 to
$19.99 monthly subscription, depending on the length of the
contract you agree to. Before buying anything, shoppers are allowed
to sample 30-second song clips.
</P>
<P>
   EMusic also offers a free-download area, with a smattering of
individual tunes that change regularly. The day I checked, gratis
MP3 tracks from Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Buddy Guy, and Phish
were there for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   --www.epitonic.com started out as a pay-per-download site along
the lines of EMusic.com, but it threw in the towel pretty quickly.
These days, it features free downloads and pays the bills by
selling banner ads. (Record labels don't object to sites such as
Epitonic, because, unlike Napster and MP3.com, they don't allow
users to digitally store or swap songs.)
</P>
<P>
   As with EMusic, you're not likely to find the biggest stars and
their latest hits at this site. Playing down that weakness,
Epitonic focuses on niches, such as folk rock, techno music, and
20th Century classical composers.
</P>
<P>
   Within each genre, you can sample or download a few songs from
each album. If you like what you hear, you can also click through
and buy the entire CD from Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   --www.GetMusic.com not only has the major record labels on
board, it is the major record labels. The site is a joint venture
of powerhouses BMG Entertainment and Universal Music Group, and it
has sales agreements with others on the A List.
</P>
<P>
   That means it is more likely to have the latest hot tracks you
want. It also means the site is geared not only to selling CDs, but
also to giving fans ample opportunity to chat about, send postcards
of, and generally obsess about entertainers that the labels want to
promote. It seems especially geared to preteens and their millions
in annual music spending.
</P>
<P>
   The site does have a page of free downloads that change
regularly, but not in MP3 format. You're allowed to download the
songs only in Liquid Audio format (available from
www.liquidaudio.com), which assures the labels that you can listen
for only 30 days. If you want more after that, you have to buy the
CD.
</P>
<P>
   --www.launch.com, in a different twist, lets you design your own
Web-cast radio-television station. For starters, you're asked to
enter your music preferences, so that Launch.com can create a
profile. Then you're given a list of other users with similar
tastes, so you can combine your playlists and video watchlists with
theirs if you like.
</P>
<P>
   When you look up music, you are given the option of adding it to
your virtual station or buying the CD. You can also refine your
profile by rating songs as they play.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the way Launch.com stays on the good side of the
record studios limits its usefulness. For example, I wanted to add
``Louis Armstrong: An American Icon'' to my cyber station, so I
could listen to the three-CD set and decide whether it was worth
$50. But the site won't play more than four songs by the same
artist in a three-hour period, making the effort too time-consuming
and cumbersome to bother with.
</P>
<P>
   --www.musicmaker.com issued a statement the day the MP3.com
decision was announced last week, making sure everyone knew its
content is ``fully licensed.'' The predictable downside: Nothing is
free. But the site still offers an interesting and low-cost option
for CD shoppers, especially fuddy duddies without the technology to
rip or burn their own albums at home.
</P>
<P>
   What Musicmaker.com does is allow you to make a custom CD,
picking and choosing individual tracks from among 160,000 stored at
the site. Essentially, you pay $10 for any five songs you want,
plus $1 for each additional song, then place your order. Within a
few days, a customized CD arrives at your doorstep with the songs
you want in the order you want.
</P>
<P>
   Before selecting your tunes, you can sample the offerings at the
site. You'll need RealPlayer to do it.

PORTFOLIO GROWTH AND TAXES COMPLICATE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. I am a teacher and plan to retire at about age 60. Am I
diversified enough? I don't contribute regularly to the taxable
mutual fund accounts, but I do when I can. Should I get out of
some? Which should I be adding to?
</P>
<P>
   L.A., Long Beach, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are some uncertainties that make a precise answer
difficult. How is your annuity account invested? What should you
expect in the way of growth from the state retirement system? What
is the level of your irregular contributions to the taxable mutual
funds?
</P>
<P>
   If the answers to the first two questions are that the growth
can be tied to stock-market performance, you should probably be
able to expect overall portfolio growth of about 10 percent.
Without factoring in any contributions to the taxable fund
accounts, the pool would grow to $1,976,139 over 14 years with 10
percent growth and total contributions of $20,500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   If growth in the annuity and retirement system savings is likely
to be more modest, say 8 percent, that would take the pool to
$1,552,160.
</P>
<P>
   Both projections assume that you use other funds to pay the
taxes generated by the fund portfolio. That may become quite a
burden toward the end of your working years. For example, if you
project the growth of just the fund portfolio over 14 years, 10
percent returns would take it to $604,718 by the time you are 60.
In the last year before retirement, the internal growth of those
accounts would be $57,320, at least on paper. That could generate
considerable tax liability. One way to forestall that problem, to a
degree, would be to add an index fund to the mix, since index funds
tend to be quite efficient. They are, by definition, buy-and-hold
investments. Another alternative would be to try tax-managed funds.
If you take the first course, you could consider Fidelity Spartan
500 Index fund. In the latter case, consider either Vanguard
Tax-Managed Capital Appreciation fund or Vanguard Tax-Managed
Growth and Income fund.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I do not like your selection of a fund for the Roth IRA
account. Since this is the single holding from which you will be
able to withdraw funds in retirement without any taxes due, it
should be your most aggressive investment. The Fidelity Freedom
funds are fine vehicles for saving for retirement, but not within a
Roth IRA that is part of a diversified portfolio. Right now the
Freedom 2020 fund holds 71 percent of its assets in stocks and the
rest in bonds, cash, and other instruments. But by the time it
reaches its target year of 2020, it will resemble the current
portfolio of Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, which is 39.7 percent
stocks and the balance in bonds and cash. It's only a bit more
aggressive than Fidelity Asset Manager Growth, although it does
have a better performance record.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say I am against either Freedom 2020 or Asset
Manager Growth to give your portfolio some conservative balance,
but both should be among your taxable accounts. If you have faith
in American Century Vista, a high-risk, feast-or-famine mid-cap
growth fund, that would be a better investment for a Roth IRA. (I
don't have particular faith in that fund; if it were my portfolio,
I'd swap that position for shares in Fidelity Select Health Care,
and use the IRA as the vehicle for those shares.)
</P>
<P>
   If my thoughts on American Century Vista scare you off that
fund, I would seek out some other fund in the mid-cap universe to
balance your concentration in large-caps. I use Alger Mid-Cap
Growth, Class B. Vanguard Mid-Cap Index is also a solid fund in
that peer group.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. After 32 years of teaching, I will retire in 2001 with a
fixed annual pension. At a 3 percent average inflation rate in the
following 22 years of my retirement, the added income I would need
to maintain the same $50,000 purchasing power is quite substantial.
Is there a formula to compute how much money I would need with a 7
percent annual return at the beginning of my retirement?
</P>
<P>
   H.P., Chelmsford, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I knew I didn't know the answer to your specific question _
the formula behind the answer. But I thought it would be easy
enough to find. Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   I went online, and the Google search engine came up with 80,500
hits for retirement calculator. After about three hours of
wallowing through them _ well, since this is a family newspaper, I
won't say what I think most of them are worth. But eventually I
came upon the site of New England Financial, a unit of MetLife, and
got to the page at
www.nefn.com/Content/Needs/retirement/calculator.cfm and, Eureka!
There it was.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that if you now have about $168,750 earning 7
percent annually, you could die perfectly broke at age 87. (But
this calculation does not take into effect the tax liability on
your supplemental savings.)
</P>
<P>
   A simpler bit of work was to track how much you would be
spending to maintain that target lifestyle, beginning with $50,000
in the first year of your retirement and escalating to $93,614 in
the 22nd. That, of course, leads to the further question of what
would happen if you lived beyond age 87, with your pension income
representing only 52.2 percent of what you would need in the 23rd
year of retirement. So it certainly would be a more comfortable
situation if you have a bit more than that target $168,750.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to those online retirement calculators, after working
through several dozen of them, I thought the best overall was the
Vanguard Retirement Planner _ with a single problem that was
critical, in the case of your question. It simply could not be
shaken out of the assumption of 4.5 percent annual inflation. A
locked-in assumption of 4.5 percent for annual inflation seems
pretty silly, since other calculators said for the 25 years ending
in 1999 that the average US inflation rate was 3.8 percent _ and
those years included the horrible inflation of the 1980s, to which
we all earnestly hope not to return.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest flaw in most of the calculators was either that they
don't provide for adjustments for inflation, or that they don't
make provisions for people who have both fixed pensions and other
investments.
</P>
<P>
   For investors with similar questions but without the complexity
of a fixed pension, I did find a nice program called Retirement
Calculator, from American River Software. This allows a person to
include an inflation rate on calculations relating to a retirement
pool _ very much worth the 10-minute download and something I've
been searching for for several years. Go to www.americanriver.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can I get a list of low-interest credit cards?
</P>
<P>
   A.L., Lakewood, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you have a computer, you can go to
www.asque.com/creditcards and click on ``rates and fees'' and then
on ``interest rate'' and you will find a list of credit-card
interest rates, the issuers, their phone numbers, the annual fees,
grace days allowed, introductory rates and their duration, and any
other benefits offered.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can just type in www.asque.com/creditcards/ccir1.htm to
go directly to the list.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the list begins with the American Express card, with
no interest (but with the requirement that the bill be paid in full
monthly) and with a $55 annual fee. It is followed by First
National Bank of Atlanta, with an 8.5 percent interest rate and an
$88 annual fee. You'll have to consider your particular situation
to decide if your typical balance makes the interest rate or the
annual fee the more important criterion.

BIDDING ON GAS CAN SAVE MONEY, MAYBE NOT TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Priceline.com's new gasoline card gets a thumbs up from me, but
not for the reasons you might think.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the card is relatively easy to use and saves you several
bucks a month. But what I really like is the psychological boost
the card provides _ the feeling that you have a tiny bit of control
over what you pay at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Readers who responded to my recent query about Priceline were
divided, with fans of the gas card slightly outnumbering critics.
The critics either encountered glitches or said the savings weren't
worth the extra hassle.
</P>
<P>
   Fans, including Kevin Stock of Boston, who has saved as much as
15 cents a gallon filling up his Ford Explorer, offered cautious
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's been successful for me, I'm not sure it's
worth the time,'' he said. ``But I guess with gas prices as high as
they are, there's some psychological benefit to not paying full
price.''
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com is the Connecticut company that has revolutionized
the sale of everything from airline tickets to groceries by letting
customers bid the prices they want to pay.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds great, but there is always a drawback.
</P>
<P>
   With airline tickets, it's flexibility. If your bid is
successful, you have to accept the flight times and routes
Priceline offers.
</P>
<P>
   With groceries, it's the extra time. You in effect have to shop
twice (once on the Internet and once in the store) and check out
twice (once for your Priceline items and once for anything you buy
on impulse).
</P>
<P>
   The drawbacks of the gas card, which hit the market in June, are
far less onerous. Once you've obtained your card, given Priceline
your credit card information, and selected which stations you want
to use, the bidding for gas takes only a few minutes. Other than
that, the gas-buying and pumping are the same.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline's participating gas stations are arranged by Zip code,
and you have to select at least three. The stations tend to be the
more expensive brand names, such as Mobil, Shell, Sunoco, and
Texaco. The stations that already sell gas at cheaper prices don't
appear to participate.
</P>
<P>
   To save time, Robert Sedell of Berkley, Mass. suggests selecting
stations that let you use your credit card at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding is simple: Priceline's Web site tells you the
average price per gallon at the stations you've selected ($1.62 for
my five stations last Tuesday) and then gives you four price
options and the chances of acceptance (e.g., $1.57 great, $1.53
good, $1.50 fair, and $1.47 low). You can also pick your own price.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last couple of weeks, I successfully bid twice on the
price that had a fair chance of being accepted, at $1.50 and $1.47
a gallon. My own bid for $1.42 was rejected, but not rejected
outright. Priceline told me I could purchase the gas at the price I
had bid, if I was willing to go to a station not included among the
five I had selected, or by buying a service or gift certificate
from one of Priceline's sponsors. They included Essential.com,
Net2Phone, Cattoys.com, Movie Cash, Red Lobster, and the Olive
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   To pump the gas, you use your Priceline card instead of a credit
card and punch in the access code. You have already prepaid for the
gas, so all you need to keep track of is how many gallons you pump.
If you lose track, you may be penalized.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how: Let's say you purchase 20 gallons at $1.50 a gallon
and pump 14 gallons on one visit to the gas station. On your next
visit, you have six gallons left on your order, and Priceline will
let you pump an extra five gallons at the same price. If you exceed
11 gallons (the six left on your order plus the five-gallon
buffer), you will be charged the pump price for the extra gas you
pumped, plus a $1.50 surcharge _ which would wipe out any savings.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald C. Wiedemann of Amesbury, Mass. said that trying to pump
only as much gas as you ordered is a pain in the neck. On his order
for 20 gallons at $1.55 a gallon, Wiedemann pumped 17.469 gallons,
leaving him with 2.531 gallons. He took the time to go back and
pump the 2.531 gallons, but he suspects many customers wouldn't
bother.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't gone back, I would have paid $31 for 17.469
gallons, for a unit price of $1.77 per gallon. Where are my savings
then?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you slice it, Priceline's savings aren't huge. If
you pump 50 gallons during a month at what Priceline says is the
average discount of 12 cents a gallon, that's a savings of just $6.
And those savings are based on prices at brand-name stations that
tend to charge more.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, using the Priceline gas card gave me a good
feeling. It was fun (visually, the bid process is a bit like a slot
machine), easy, and I saved some money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds up over time,'' said Priceline spokesman Robert
Padgett. ``It's amazing what people will do to save 5 or 6 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   Priceline had been preparing to charge its 250,000 cardholders
$3 for every month they use the card, which would have made using
it a waste of time. Priceline wisely did away with the fee two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   I still wonder how Priceline turns a profit. The company pays
the gas stations their full pump prices, and makes its money not by
selling gas but by selling its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Padgett said that 5,000 of the 30,000 stations listed on the Web
site have agreed to pay Priceline between 25 cents and $2 for every
customer delivered to them. The 5,000 stations, apparently hoping
to boost their sales volume and sell other items to gas customers,
are given preference in referrals.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors also pays Priceline an undisclosed fee for every
referred customer.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce D. Weinberg, associate professor of marketing and
e-commerce at the Bentley College graduate school of business, has
been impressed with the Priceline gas card. But he thinks the
company is using its gas card as a loss leader, to pull customers
to other parts of its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really getting customers for other parts of their
business that will yield better returns,'' Weinberg said.

   MCI Worldcom price hike
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Customer service seems to be an alien concept at long-distance
phone companies these days, with MCI Worldcom the latest offender.
</P>
<P>
   Alfie Kohn of Belmont, Mass. was on an MCI Worldcom calling plan
that charged him 7 cents peak and 5 cents off-peak, with a monthly
fee. Without any notice, the company recently hiked the peak fee to
9 cents (an increase of 29 percent) and boosted the monthly fee by
a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ABellTolls.com, a consumer comparison site of long-distance
plans, says thousands of MCI Worldcom customers were affected by
the backdoor changes. Those on the company's 5-cent Everyday Plus
plan saw their monthly fee go up 20 percent and their peak rate
rise 28 percent. Internet billing discounts were also cut 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ABellTolls was also critical of MCI Worldcom for misleading
customers about the cost of in-state calls and calling-card calls,
as well as sales pitches that were either misleading or out-and-out
false.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom did not return my phone calls.

   --Gasolineprotest.com _ This site is for people who want to
gripe about the price of gasoline, help others find cheap gas, or
place gas prices in perspective. My favorite was the site's
GasGripe software. Gasoline may cost $1.62 a gallon, but the
software showed me that's still a bargain when compared to
Gatorade, which costs $10.17 a gallon, Pepto Bismol, at $123.20 a
gallon, or Vick's Nyquil, which is $178.13 a gallon. I feel better
already.

   --Paper or plastic? Vicki Lansky, author of ``The Bag Book,''
says it requires 40 percent less energy to make a plastic bag as

percent less solid waste and and produce 70 percent fewer
atmospheric emissions. But whatever bag you choose, Lansky advises
reusing it until it's used up or worn out. Her book, just published
by Book Peddlers of Minnetonka, Mn., offers 500 possible reuses for
bags.

 &HT;    Official site gets you in mood for Olympic Games to begin
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Caught the Olympic fever yet?
</P>
<P>
   Already program the Palm, the pager and the phone to deliver
track and field results and soccer scores? That's OK. You still
have some time before the torch lights up in Sydney to work up some
enthusiasm and national pride for the good old US of A.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you could care less about platform diving,
world-class cycling or even basketball, one visit to the official
Olympic site (www.olympics.com/eng) is something you absolutely
must do if you do nothing else Olympics-related for the entire
month of September.
</P>
<P>
   Built for the nations of the world by the good folk at IBM who
know a thing or two about sports sites _ they do the Web handiwork
for the Masters golf tournament, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, after
all _ the Sydney 2000 site is really something to see.
</P>
<P>
   This official Olympics site is exactly what the Olympic Games _
or any major sporting event _ of the modern era are all about: the
merger of sports, commerce and high-tech entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Equally entertaining are the well-designed sponsor boxes in the
top right-hand corner. Is it just irony that the Games devoted to
discipline, endurance and self-sacrifice are sponsored by Cadbury
chocolates and Olestra, the fake-fat product found in products like
Lay's Wow potato chips?
</P>
<P>
   Log on to the Olympics site, and you can look at a breathtaking
view of Sydney's harbor from the Goodyear ``blimpcam'' while music
plays in the background from the CD ``Olympic Record.'' The CD is
for sale in the Olympic shop, in case you were wondering, along
with a variety of unique and un-touristy objects ranging from fine
jewelry to works of art and one-of-a-kind quilts on sale to support
the Paralympics. There are, of course, the ever-popular Olympic
pins _ think of them as Pokemon cards for the over-40 set. Prices
are in Australian dollars, but there is a currency converter that
pops up in a separate screen so you can see how many American
dollars it'll cost you to get the goods from Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   But shopping and technological fireworks aside, the Sydney 2000
Web site gets down to some fundamentals clueless North Americans
might need. For example, where is Australia anyway? Let's answer
that puzzler before we move on to tougher topics _ like when will
Americans get to see the gymnastics on TV?
</P>
<P>
   Click on the words ``What time is it in Sydney?'' and you'll get
another pop-up screen with a world map, a time and temperature
check, a three-day forecast and the time difference between Sydney
and every time zone in the world. We discovered, for example, that
11 p.m. on the East Coast of the United States is 2 in the
afternoon the next day in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Compare the official Olympics site with NBCOlympics.com. NBC has
exclusive U.S. broadcast rights to the Olympics, and its site is a
frenzy of pro-American news. And it's brought to you not by a candy
bar company but by those pushing good old-fashioned red-blooded
American products like Budweiser, adidas and Ameritrade. Beer,
running shoes and stocks _ the hot dogs and apple pie of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC site was designed by Quokka Sports, the extreme-sports
Internet company that's much admired by Web designers for its
ability to make nearly any sport jump off the computer monitor and
into your home. (Check out the Mountainzone.com site for a
combination of great photos and climbers' diaries to get a sense of
what Quokka is all about).
</P>
<P>
   So between the official site and the NBC site, there's an
international and a country-specific look at the Olympic Games,
which is fine. But neither site can answer one very fundamental
question: When will we get to see the actual Olympics on TV?
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Olympics site lists events in local time. The NBC
site offers two schedules: an ``Olympic schedule'' and a
``broadcast schedule.'' NBC will also be using all three of its
broadcast properties (including CNBC and MSNBC) to round out
coverage of the Games. But unless you want to bust open another
browser and toggle back and forth between the American broadcast
schedule and the timing of the actual events, it's easy to become
very confused.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Web and our good neighbors to the north come
in. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (www.cbc.ca) is going to show
the events live. That means the opening ceremonies will begin at
3:45 a.m. Friday on the East Coast (that's 6:45 p.m. in Sydney).
But NBC won't be airing the ceremonies until 7:30 that evening.
Sports junkies can also check out a number of international Web
sites in the wee hours of the morning to get scores and results
even if they have to wait to see the action stateside.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in the broader issues surrounding the Olympics
will enjoy the CBC's detailed coverage of athletes bounced from the
Games for failing drug tests. Or check out a BBC report
(news.bbc.co.uk
</P>
<P>
   /sport/hi/english/olympics2000/default.stm) on the questionable
manufacturing practices of Nike sneakers. There's a lot more than
sports going on in Sydney, and the Web is a window to a
multicultural perspective on a multinational event.

 &HT;    Alarm watches can dispense reminders about medication
 &HT;    By Anne Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Our activities rely on a set schedule. There are
meetings, appointments and outings that can be coordinated by
leather-bound calendars, time-management systems, Palm Pilots and
computerized calendar merges.
</P>
<P>
   There are also simple lunch dates, scheduled on scraps of paper
and synchronized with simple wristwatches.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1980s I lived without a wristwatch. My bedside
alarm clock signaled the start of a new workday.
</P>
<P>
   I drove a car without a factory-installed clock, so I purchased
a stick-on digital clock for $1.99 and placed it on the steering
wheel. I was frequently on time, and the clock lasted beyond the
car's usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1990, my friend Linda gave me a watch. At first, I
wore it during Linda's wedding activities to show that I was
grateful for the gift. It took a few days and I had a new habit. I
became watch-dependent.
</P>
<P>
   My watches are simple time-keeping devices. Some have second
hands, but none tells the date.
</P>
<P>
   Being the chief time-keeper of my household makes watch-wearing
a significant part of my job description. I get to the schoolbus on
time, coordinate our play dates, and manage my work and volunteer
duties all within a reasonable fraction of punctuality.
</P>
<P>
   I am also responsible for doling out a regular set of
medications, and have failed more than once at getting them
delivered on time. With medication, timing is everything.
Non-compliance with medications is a universal problem, causing
added strain on patients and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Forgetting to take a medication brings repeat and more severe
infections, added hospitalizations, deaths and billions of dollars
in added health care burden in the United States each year. (See
this article from the American Medical Association at
www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/article/2036-2515.html.)
</P>
<P>
   I take my job seriously, but my memory plays its own game. There
are times when my recollection of removing the pill from the
dispenser is of yesterday or the day before.
</P>
<P>
   It helped when I got a seven-day pillbox. Pills for each day are
placed in compartments in the box. If there are still four pills
remaining at 5 p.m., I know that I have missed a dose. This system
has a huge fault; by the time I realize the dose is missed, eight
hours have passed.
</P>
<P>
   Technology will now assure accuracy in pill-dispensing. I will
buy a reminder system.
</P>
<P>
   My first choice will probably be a watch with an alarm. There
are also pillbox alarms and compact timers for briefcase, purse,
backpack or pocket.
</P>
<P>
   An extensive selection is available online at www.epill.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site features a line of vibrating reminder watches and
clocks. The vibrating timepieces assure privacy for watch-wearers
of all ages. The six-alarm watches start at $80.
</P>
<P>
   If a watch is not your choice, you can buy the tiny MedAlarm
Micro Medication Computer. The product offers up to 24 alarms a day
and keeps tabs on you with a built-in compliance tracker. Retailing
for $50 with batteries ($40 on sale at e-pill), it features a loud
alarm sound.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a more elaborate alarm watch, the e-pill site also
offers the Cadex 12-alarm watch with a medical ID. Users can
program up to 12 reminders, including scrolling text messages. This
watch also keeps critical health information in a Medical ID
Databank. Press the ``alert'' button to display name and phone
number, medical conditions, allergic reactions, medications,
emergency contact, insurance information and more. This watch
retails for $90, but is on sale at e-pill for $60.
</P>
<P>
   Another item is the MedTimer clock. This portable,
5-inch-by-1-inch device is programmable by the half-hour, allowing
the user to set up to 31 alarms per day. It costs $35.
</P>
<P>
   For simple pill reminders, you can buy the Pill Bottle Alarm.
This device attaches to a pill vial with suction. It beeps if the
user forgets to take the medication. This product is only useful
for twice-a-day or once-a-day medications (unless the user resets
the device after each pill) and is sold in a three-pack for $50.
</P>
<P>
   Many manufacturers offer watches with alarms. There are analog
and digital ones, attractive and homely ones, one-alarm and
multialarm varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Fossil's (www.fossil.com) Brain line starts at $75 and comes in
more than a dozen styles. The Brain is a unisex watch. It stores up
to 30 memos with 32 characters each. With seven alarms, this
chrono/stopwatch is also an ideal pill reminder.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping online at Yahoo's shopping site (shopping.yahoo.com), I
came across an LCD calculator/alarm watch. It may not be pretty,
but it adds and it alarms for $10.
</P>
<P>
   Search the Casio watch collection (www.casio.com) for ``alarm,''
and you will find more than 100 matches. The Technowear Timepiece
features a voice recorder and five multifunction alarms for $80. It
offers time for 24 time zones, a stopwatch, a calculator and a
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Trusty Timex (www.timex.com) has a number of watches in varying
sizes with alarms. Starting at $30, some styles are attractive
enough to sell on their looks.
</P>
<P>
   The Timex Turn &AMP; Pull alarm is an analog watch with an
accurate-to-the-minute alarm function. The instructions are brief
and simple enough to be engraved on the back of the watch.
</P>
<P>
   Timex boasts about the simplicity of the watch settings,
describing it as a settable watch for everything you need to do. An
added selling point of the watch is its 40 beeps and flashing
nightlight to rouse even the soundest sleeper. It works as a
perfect traveling alarm clock.
</P>
<P>
   The Timex Turn &AMP; Pull alarm is available in eight different
styles ranging in price from $50-$65.
</P>
<P>
   For the higher-end watch enthusiast, Omega (www.omega.ch) offers
the X-33 timepiece with alarm. The watch is said to be the choice
for manned space missions and costs just over $2,000. I won't be
purchasing this model unless I have a planned trip to the moon.

 &HT;    Both software, hardware can help keep interlopers from getting
your stuff
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Readers: Broadband connections, hackers and home firewall
solutions all make for one big, raging debate out there. You've
e-mailed us tons of comments and responses to recent columns and,
frankly, they're too good to keep to ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Rich Wilson of Atlanta, a system administrator, worries
that broadbanders may get a false sense of security if they think
unplugging their network connection when not in use is the ultimate
way to ward off hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Users are creatures of habit, he says, and they access
their computers in fairly regular patterns. Hackers can predict
when you are online and can bore through any security hole in your
system in no time. Plus, intruders have this nasty way of slipping
out a ``back door'' sight unseen.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Rich is pretty hip on firewalls, though, as is Bob
Ventimiglia of Mableton, Ga. Bob offers up one of his favorite
options for the PC. Thanks, Bob. He gave high marks to ZoneAlarm
software from Zone Labs (www.zonelabs.com).
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It's free for personal and nonprofit use. Not to be
confused with ZoneAlarm Pro, which is more customizable and
beefier. It's cool but not free. Zone Labs has it for $39.95.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Mike Butcher of Lawrenceville is a ZoneAlarm fan, too. He
said he learned a lot about intrusion attempts on his computer from
the firewall software's pop-up alerts. Mike was full of good info
about finding out how vulnerable you are. He suggests putting
Shields Up to work. Surf to www.grc
</P>
<P>
   .com and click the Shields Up link to find out how Windows users
can get a free Internet connection security analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: George Notel of Cumming, Ga., prefers the muscle of a
hardware solution. He's been using a cable/DSL router with his
cable modem setup for three months and believes the router is the
best deterrent to a hacker. The router sits between the broadband
modem and your computer, like a fortress against attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: George likes the router built by Linksys at Netgear
(www.linksys.com/). It provides firewall protection, plus allows
users to share their connections with other computers in the house.
To anyone looking for openings, the only thing they see would be
that router. It masquerades as your computer while your system
remains hidden from the prying eyes of the Internet. Users can
leave file sharing up and running because the router blocks
incoming connections. You can expect to pay $120 to $175.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Another hardware option is the DI-701 Internet
gateway/firewall. It's made by D-Link and costs $99. Have a
look-see at www.dlink.com/. It bonds with any operating system that
can connect to the Internet, including Windows, the Mac OS and
Linux.

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Intel camera a good intro to digital
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A little device called the Intel Pocket PC Camera has
given me my first taste of digital photography, and it's been a
very good introduction.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel camera is designed to work both as one of those
cameras tethered to a PC or as a free-range camera like its big
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tiny thing, about 4 inches by 2 1/2, all plastic, and it
looks like a toy. However, the Intel camera is surprisingly
capable.
</P>
<P>
   When connected by a long cable to your computer's USB port, it
draws its power from the computer.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat awkward to use as a proper camera in this mode,
because you're supposed to use the image presented through the
accompanying software on your computer monitor instead of the
viewfinder.
</P>
<P>
   This means that regardless of how long the cable may be, you
have to be positioned behind the PC monitor.
</P>
<P>
   In this mode, you can adjust the focus by turning the little
blue lens housing, and every press of the snapshot button produces
an image in the software.
</P>
<P>
   Unhooked from the computer and powered by four AAA batteries,
the operator uses the viewfinder and the little display window on
the top of the camera. This indicates whether the presumed subject
is in focus, how many photos are in memory and whether the camera
is set to make high-quality images (640x480 pixels) or normal
quality (320x240).
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable thing about this camera, perhaps, is its 8
megabytes of memory. That's as much as provided with some digital
cameras costing five times as much.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Intel camera can hold up to 128 high-quality
images. There is no way, of course, to view and selectively delete
images from memory when the camera isn't connected to the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The camera has a 10-second self-timer; it can take 10-second
movies and run off a string of five sequence shots. The mode is
selected by a button beside the display window, and the window, in
addition to noting the mode, also indicates battery life and the
timer's progression.
</P>
<P>
   Images from the camera are, it seems to me, better than they
ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   The camera comes with MGI Photosuite, which allows considerable
manipulation of the images and a program that downloads the images
and affords basic manipulation, plus help in making e-mail
postcards and other productions. It's quite easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with a little wrist strap, a base on which the
camera can be placed while tethered to the computer, and a carrying
case.
</P>
<P>
   The only real downside is the documentation, which is entirely
online. There is, however, a little basic guide that will fit in
the carrying case with the camera.
</P>
<P>
   The Pocket PC Camera lists for $149. For more information, see
www.intel.com/PCcamera.

 &HT;    Broadband users need firewall to prevent hackers from prying
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If I were an explorer, I would just be getting around
to discovering America. Despite a love of technology _ and a
glimmer of understanding _ I stumble along way behind the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   I'm just now getting around to installing a firewall in my home
computer. Despite my own backward ways, I figure some of you are
also two steps behind. Think of this as remedial education on
computer security.
</P>
<P>
   A firewall, according to its original meaning, is a fireproof
bulkhead used in building construction to delay the spread of fire.
When the Internet and computer networks came along, the name was
applied to software designed to keep hackers out. Like in the
original meaning, it can't stand up to an intense attack but it
does nicely for ordinary purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, firewalls were of more use to business and
government networks. For most home users, who used a dial-up modem
to connect to the Internet for just a few hours or minutes, a
firewall was overkill. In those days, since firewall programs were
written for the sophisticated audience of users, configuring them
was way beyond the skills of most people with home PCs.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the advent of fast and constant broadband
connections to the Internet, the landscape has changed, and it
makes sense to have a firewall on a home computer. The notion of an
``always on'' high-speed connection is no longer exotic, and that
has made the need for computer security more intense.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been the case that each computer on a network
needs an address. Just like on a postal route, the address is used
so packets of information can be delivered to the right place. If
you log on with a dial-up modem, it is likely your address changes
each time you connect. That's called a dynamic address.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when you log on with DSL or a cable modem _
like the one I have at home _ it is likely your address stays
constant. That's called a static address.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one of those rare times in the computer world where
common sense will help you understand the two reasons why there's
an increased danger of hackers. The first reason is that the longer
you stay online, the more opportunities a hacker has of finding and
invading your computer. The second reason is that if you have a
static address, you are no longer a moving target for the hackers.
Instead, your computer just sits there hooked up to the Internet,
making it easier to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, as the market has changed, so have the firewall
programs. What once was a complicated mess of settings has become
easy. There are plenty of firewall programs designed for the home
(and small-business) user. Norton has one, there's one called Black
Ice that's very popular, and the one I use and prefer, called Zone
Alarm. It is available free to home users and nonprofit
organizations as a download at www.zonelabs.com.
</P>
<P>
   The download is almost instantaneous using a cable modem or DSL.
</P>
<P>
   The real joy of this program is the setup. There really isn't
any. It installs in the most logical configuration for your
computer and should work great without tweaking with settings on
your part. You won't be faced _ as is true with some other
firewalls _ with answering esoteric questions about your IP address
and system settings. Instead, it automatically fills in all the
information for you.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as time goes on, and you get more familiar with how it
works, you may want to make some changes so that the firewall suits
the risks you face and your own preferences for security. You can
do that at any time, using the manual settings. And, if you have
questions, the ZoneLab Web site is a good source for answers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone who uses a firewall program is shocked at the
number of alerts you'll get when another computer comes knocking on
the door. Many are false alarms (generated by Web sites you've
visited that are too stupid to know you've disconnected and are
still trying to send data). But a good number are not. Many are
attempts to get into your machine that might have succeeded without
a firewall. If a hacker gets into your machine, he can do anything
you can do, including deleting files or looking at personal or
financial information.
</P>
<P>
   I recommend installing a firewall if you use a high-speed
connection. You can figure that _ as slow as I move in deciding
things like this _ that is a conservative opinion.

 &HT;    Online play, price cut ensure Sega's survival
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This time last year, consumers were excited about the
launch of the Sega Dreamcast video game console. The graphics and
animation of the Dreamcast were considerably more advanced and
visually impressive than the Sony PlayStation and the Nintendo 64
game consoles.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamcast also came equipped with a 56k bps modem, enticing
gamers with the thought of playing games online _ a feature never
before experienced with a home video game console.
</P>
<P>
   Excitement was mixed with some skepticism, however. Sega's
previous video game console, the Saturn, had a short lifespan in
the United States due to the small number of popular games and a
$399 price tag. With only 18 games available at launch, it was
uncertain whether the Dreamcast would follow the same path.
</P>
<P>
   The Sega system was also in the approaching shadow of Sony's
PlayStation 2, and many consumers were considering holding out for
the successor of the reputable PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   These factors left the Dreamcast on shaky ground. One year
later, with a robust selection of games, online capabilities and a
new pricing strategy, Sega's game console has found stability.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of games for the system has blossomed from 18 to
more than 100 and is expected to grow to 200 by the holiday season.
Notable developers such as Namco, Capcom, Infogrames, Midway and
Ubi Soft have created games for the system and are continuing
future developments.
</P>
<P>
   The price of a typical Dreamcast game is between $39.99 and
$49.99. However, Sega has reduced the price of some of its
best-selling titles to $19.99 for the All Star series. Other
first-generation games have been reduced to less than $30.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Robison, group director of third-party licensing at Sega of
America, feels this is a good factor for consumers. ``When a family
goes in to buy a video game console, they don't just look at the
price of the hardware; they look at the price of the software as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial cost of $199 for the Dreamcast console has also been
reduced to $149 _ $50 higher than the current PlayStation but half
the price of the upcoming $299 PlayStation 2.
</P>
<P>
   Sega has also given Dreamcast owners some clarity about online
gaming with its dedicated gaming network, SegaNet. The service not
only allows PC and Dreamcast users to surf the Web and send e-mail
like an ISP, it also lets gamers play certain titles online.
</P>
<P>
   Before the release of ``NFL2K1,'' the only title playable online
was ``Chu Chu Rocket.'' Although the puzzle game finally delivered
network playability, the title didn't represent the intense online
gaming experience consumers were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Robison feels ``Chu Chu Rocket'' was integral to delivering
Sega's promise of online gaming. He describes the title as an
``experiment that allowed us to really test out game servers,
online connectivity and look at behavior of playing online games.''
</P>
<P>
   Sega's advanced network is expected to run without the lagging
witnessed in typical online games via the PC. With a dedicated
network for the Dreamcast, gamers won't be subject to the numerous
hops and rerouting of ISPs. Games like ``NFL2K1'' can be played by
two players coast-to-coast as if they were playing in the same
room.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``NFL2K1'' and ``Chu Chu Rocket'' are currently the
only Dreamcast games online, Sega and other developers have such
games in the works. Some online titles that will be available
before the holidays are ``Quake 3,'' ``Speed Devils 2'' and ``POD
2'' by Ubi Soft; and ``Unreal Tournament'' by Infogrames.
</P>
<P>
   With the purchase of the $149 Dreamcast, owners can try SegaNet
free for 50 hours. The full, unlimited service is $21.95 a month.
Customers who sign up for 18 months of the SegaNet service get a
Dreamcast keyboard and a $150 rebate _ in essence, a free Dreamcast
console.
</P>
<P>
   After a year, Sega is showing that its system will subsist and
grow. With original games, competitive pricing and, most notably,
advanced online gaming, the Dreamcast is looking like a solid game
console.

 &HT;    Role-playing title features plenty of options in odd location _
space
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like many PC role-playing games, ``Terminus'' has a
detailed and intricate story line, complete with multiple
characters, missions and scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other role-playing games, ``Terminus'' serves up a
virtual smorgasbord of role-playing options for players to explore,
including multiplayer modes and career options.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a ``scenario web'' that changes the story line based
on the success, or failure, of the missions and career choices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``Terminus'' has taken many elements commonly found
in the traditional role-playing game and fused them with space
combat. The result is a story line that can be played again and
again from different perspectives and with varying outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really good game, so far,'' said Randy Rogers, 16, who
reviewed the game. ``I haven't tried a lot of the options yet, but
I like to have a lot of flexibility. This game is kind of like a
cross between `Mantis' and `Wing Commander.' I liked both of those
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among the options is a player's choice of a career path
to follow. Gamers can choose to be on either side of the law,
choosing among military service, trading, engineering, hijacking or
other criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   One of the game's five modes is ``multiplayer,'' an option not
usually found in RPGs. In multiplayer, gamers can play
cooperatively with a friend in the same career or competitively
against friends in different careers.
</P>
<P>
   Randy, who's been playing PC games since he was 10, said most of
the time he chooses to be a fighter pilot, flying among the 18
space stations throughout the solar system where players can trade,
organize and re-arm. He said it took him a while to tweak the
adjustable flight controls until he got them to his liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the easiest game to get into,'' he said. ``If I
hadn't done this before, I would have given up after the first
couple of tries.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the game's setting is the 22nd century, Randy said the
program's graphics are nearly archaic by today's standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really surprises me,'' the Stockbridge resident said. ``I
would have thought the graphics would be better, but they are way
behind the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characters don't look that good, and the explosions aren't
that great. I think they could have done a better job with that
part of the game. The sound wasn't that great, either, but it was
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   `TERMINUS'
</P>

   Format: PC
</P>
<P>
   Developer: Vatical Entertainment
</P>
<P>
   Price: $42.99

 &HT;    Getting an education online
 &HT;    By Anne Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The computer has become the classroom for an
increasing number of college students, in a transformation that
eliminates the boundaries of geography and scheduled class times.
</P>
<P>
   Computers provide virtual classrooms, cyberlibraries and online
chat areas where students can plug in to their college classes from
any location. The ability to enroll in full-fledged undergraduate
and graduate programs has opened the possibility of college
instruction for time-pressed professionals as well as those
shackled to home by family responsibilities or physical
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience of course work, combined with greater access to
computers, has fueled the growth of Internet offerings at Georgia
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   At Southern Polytechnic State University in Marietta, the
Internet was first used in the fall of 1997 for the master's of
science in quality assurance program. That semester, 69 students
were taking classes on campus and 29 were taking courses online. In
the fall of 2000, 19 students are taking on-campus classes and 76
are taking the courses using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see more courses and degrees offered in the
Internet distance-learning format,'' said Larry Aft, a professor
who helped develop the pilot degree program for Southern Tech.
``The convenience and flexibility of this format make it very
attractive to students.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet offerings made up approximately 31,560 credit hours in
fiscal year 2000 for the 34 public colleges and universities of the
University System of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is becoming much more of a tool in our everyday
lives,'' says Kris Biesinger, assistant vice chancellor of advanced
learning technologies for the Board of Regents of the University
System of Georgia. ``Using this same tool to access education is
becoming more mainstream. It is converging in a one-stop approach
to education, and it's becoming more user-friendly. Technology
affords us to really match learning environment with learning
need.''
</P>
<P>
   An August report by media measurement firm Media Metrix shows
overall growth in Internet use plus a significant increase in
Internet accessibility for families with a household income under
$25,000 a year. ``Among the reasons for the gradual closing of the
`digital divide' are the continued fall in computer prices,
increased technological ease-of-use, and improved access to the
Internet in professional, academic and community environments,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Green is vice president for communication for Georgia
GLOBE, a University System of Georgia program designed to increase
access to courses and degree programs offered by the public
colleges and universities. Green is pursuing her education
doctorate through an online degree program.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an online student, I have a much greater flexibility as to
how and when I study,'' Green said. ``There was no way I could do
my job and go through a doctoral program. But because I've been
able to do a large portion of it online, I now can.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said many Georgians share in her enthusiasm. ``In a
statewide survey of over 500 respondents, over 60 percent indicated
they would use either the Internet or Georgia Public Broadcasting
to take courses,'' Green said. ``The numbers of people taking
online and/or distance-learning courses is increasing rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Distance learning isn't new. But technology has changed the
delivery of the old-fashioned correspondence course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distance education has been around since a reliable post
office,'' says Lynne Schrum, associate professor at the University
of Georgia's department of instructional technology. ``We now have
the whole gamut from totally online to still sending out
videotapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech, one of the world's leading engineering schools,
offers graduate level degrees through distance learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students want courses anytime, anyplace,'' says Joe Boland,
director of Georgia Tech's Center for Distance Learning.
``Engineers realize that a master's degree in a technical field is
important, and some cannot interrupt their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Boland, Georgia Tech's distance-learning program
reaches a wide range of students. The program has admitted students
who range from fresh-out-of-college 22-year-olds seeking master's
degrees to a 70-year-old student wanting to brush up on his skills.
</P>
<P>
   Distance-learning programs often attract working professionals.
Some may live far from the teaching institution; others may work
late hours or travel in their careers. For these students,
on-campus classes are not a viable option. Distance learning allows
these professionals to pursue their desired degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got people in north Atlanta that take courses and attain
the degree by distance learning,'' Boland said. ``They choose to do
them this way because of the convenience. ... We deliver the
courses anywhere in the world where we can ship videotapes or they
can have access to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 34 public colleges and universities in the
University System of Georgia participates in distance education.
Some may use distance learning to only enhance traditional courses,
while others may only receive courses that originate from other
campuses through GSAMS (Georgia Statewide Academic and Medical
System), an interactive videoconferencing system.
</P>
<P>
   The number of distance offerings and types of courses varies by
institution. Degree programs are offered through six of these
institutions, and an online MBA is offered by a consortium of five
others. More institutions will be offering degrees through distance
learning in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Distance-education delivery formats vary by course, with some
courses using several technologies. Options include GSAMS,
Internet, CD-ROM, satellite, cable and video-based instruction.
</P>
<P>
   GSAMS allows an instructor to teach students in multiple
locations simultaneously. It links approximately 400 sites in
Georgia for primarily academic programs. The students reduce travel
time by selecting a site near them. This technology could be
likened to a visual group phone call where students and instructor
communicate in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is used in several ways. Students can access course
notes and assignments on the World Wide Web. Some online courses
are supplemented with CD-ROMs and videotapes. Classmates can
communicate with each other and the instructor using e-mail, online
chat, electronic bulletin boards or a combination of methods,
sometimes including face-to-face meetings.
</P>
<P>
   A popular method of delivery is the telecourse. Telecourses use
television or videotapes as well as printed materials. Access to
telecourses is through satellite, cable television, public
television and wireless cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely degrees that people get almost entirely
without seeing each other,'' Schrum said.
</P>
<P>
   There are also combinations where some classes meet at select
times during the semester but the majority of course work is
completed at a distance. A distance-learning course, by definition,
requires at least 51 percent of the course to be conducted through
distance-learning formats.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary statistics that cover the past year in
distance learning within the University System of Georgia,
Internet-based courses hosted approximately 11,000 course seats.
This number compares to GSAMS' 5,300 course seats over the same
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear a great deal about Internet-based courses because it
is the new thing and very appealing in theory,'' Schrum said.
</P>
<P>
   Grading systems vary by course and instructor, just like those
in a traditional environment.
</P>
<P>
   There are distance courses that grade by class participation,
research papers and essay exams.
</P>
<P>
   Some courses weigh heavier on midterm and final exams, which may
even be offered at a student's workplace with a proctor.
</P>
<P>
   The distance-learning courses are as difficult and
time-consuming as traditional courses. ``When I speak with
potential students, I tell them that it requires every bit of
effort that it takes you if you come to campus,'' Boland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be motivated, self-disciplined, and you have to
see the need for the program and how it will benefit you.''

 &HT;    Duke it out with mutants in Activision's X-Men Mutant Academy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   X-Men Mutant Academy ($40; www.activision.com; for the
PlayStation), is a game simpatico with the recent summer
blockbuster, which in turn is based on an immensely popular comic
and cartoon franchise. Unfortunately, the game is merely another
means to brand name us with X-Men; it has little to do with the
film. In fact, it only vaguely resembles a modern video game.
Mutant Academy is a well-drawn, well-animated 2-D fighting game _
and that's it. There's no adventure akin to a movie plot, just the
various super-antiheroes duking it out in a face-to-face,
side-scrolling romp. Even on the aging PlayStation console, most
fighting games are known to contain so much more than flat-action
eye-candy, such as three dimensions. Nevertheless, X-Men Mutant
Academy is a good 2-D fighting game complete with trademark
super-moves and painful powers of mutant punishment. But it's the
weakest member in the grand amalgamation scheme of console,
cartoon, comic and cinematic extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   SquareSoft is pushing the bounds of electronic entertainment
into artistic interactive storytelling on game consoles like nobody
else. Besides being the most graphically bright and beautiful game
the PlayStation has seen, Chrono Cross ($40; www .squaresoft.com;
for the PlayStation) is the closest we have yet to come to fully
interactive storytelling. Players move through an engaging world
full of interesting characters, all the while feeling like their
decisions have consequence. The rare computer-generated cut-scenes
are astounding and further draw one emotionally into the adventure.
An elemental rock-paper-scissors combat system is interesting and
effective, yet nonintrusive. Gamers who like turn-based combat can
battle to their hearts' content, while those more interested in
following the storyline are able to mostly avoid conflict, though
not the important battles with boss creatures that they wouldn't
want to miss anyway _ that is until the last third of the game: a
fifteen hour repetitive battle sequence in which the otherwise
remarkable combat system of Chrono Cross loses all entertainment
value. The weak ending, however, isn't enough to drown the memory
of the game's brilliant beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing about this PlayStation version of Worms Armageddon:
($30; www.hasbro-interactive .com; for the PlayStation) Sony
initially nixed the idea of a 2-D,
cuter-than-dimples/funnier-than-Looney Tunes action/strategy game
starring squeaky-voiced invertebrate simply for the fact that the
idea of a 2-D, cuter-than-dimples/funnier-than Looney Tunes
action/strategy game starring squeaky-voiced invertebrate didn't
seem like a viable PlayStation game a few years back when Sony was
marketing a hardcore gamer's machine. Now, of course, Sony will
license everything just to saturate the market, which is usually a
bad thing in the watered-down library sense of things, but a very
good thing in this specific case as Worms Armageddon is a
surprisingly great 2-D, cuter-than-dimples/
</P>
<P>
   funnier-than-Looney Tunes action/strategy game starring
squeaky-voiced invertebrate. Excellent even.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Just another racing game? Perhaps, but Breakneck ($40; www
.southpeak.com; for Windows) delivers some of the finest-looking,
smoothest-moving, most engaging racing ever found in the otherwise
saturated genre. Some 40-odd vehicles screaming around eight
variations of a couple dozen tracks promise more bang-for-the-buck
than most. Playable as both a tetchy racing simulation or a
balls-out, crash-bang-smash-`em-up arcade motor-romp, Breakout even
includes an optional combat mode where vehicles are armed with
delightfully effective James Bond-type weapons. Lord knows there's
nothing like dropping a sack of nails behind you to thwart that
aggressive tailgater, and hey, who hasn't wished for a heat-seeking
missile on that dolt who always manages to take the lead despite
one's best efforts?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In a world of clones, you've got to admire innovation, even when
it succeeds modestly. Case in point: Evolva ($50,
www.interplay.com, for Windows), a refreshingly unusual squad-based
third-person-shooter set in a vastly distant future in which humans
_ or what humans have become _ must devour the DNA of their enemies
and evolve on the fly to survive. You control a customizeable
four-person squad of genohunters who must defeat a planetary
infestation of evil space spore. It sounds strange, and it is _
almost too strange. An undefinable coolness creeps into the
gameplay, with its lack of verbal communication or music, its
muted, pastel environments and its reptilian kill-or-be-killed
gameplay. Multiplayer fighting becomes a race to evolve fastest,
and the single-player levels border on the mundane. That said,
Evolva gets extra credit for going out on a limb with its weird
premise, smooth controls, multiple camera screens, creepy monsters
and uncanny alien feel.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A simple, durable puzzle game geared more toward
conceptual thinking than basic motor skills, the Changing Places
Puzzle ($10; www .allaboardkids.com offers animal picture pieces on
transparencies that overlay onto corresponding scenery; the owl
goes in the tree, the octopus in the ocean, the spaceman in space,
that sort of thing. And while even the hardiest cardboard puzzle
games don't seem to withstand the chewing, stomping and throwing
tests most toddlers manage to put toys through, Changing Places
Puzzle pieces are made of smoothly polished wood. And, the puzzle
comes with a lifetime guarantee should any part be damaged or lost.

   A GENTLE BOUNCE FOR BABY
</P>
<P>
   Fisher Price really seems to shine when it doesn't they don't
try too hard. The Deluxe Soothing Bouncer Seat ($30;
www.fisher-price.com) is a marvel of simple technology,
well-implemented. A cute and colorful cloth hammock in a stalwart
but springy wire frame, complete with retractable sun-screen
canopy, is further enhanced by a single-battery motor that will set
the unit to vibrating like a gentle martini maker. This comforting
movement is reportedly ``similar to a ride in the car,'' albeit one
in which case your car is in desperate need of on an alignment.
Regardless, the Deluxe Soothing Baby Seat is wonderfully efficient,
cost effective and a must-have for any parent wishing the
second-best thing to an old-fashioned, hands-on, comforting cuddle
for their soothable wee one.

 &HT;    A MiniDisc Walkman to get you groovin'
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The MiniDisc format, which allows
digital-quality recording and re-recording on a tiny, flat disc,
may never reach its full potential now that recordable CDs are all
the rage and portable MP3 players make the idea of any kind of disc
seem almost quaint. But Sony is proving there's still life in the
format with its array of MiniDisc Walkman models, including the
MZ-R70PC ($300; www.sel.sony.com), which includes a USB connector
for hooking up to a computer and recording audio right off the
desktop. The player/recorder looks and sounds fantastic, and the
sparse packaging is packed with stuff _ an AC adapter, a
headphones/wired-controller combo that allows you to edit tracks,
an optical digital cable for hooking up to your sound system and
even a rechargeable battery. Setup and installation is a breeze. If
there's any complaint it's that the MZ-R70PC isn't Mac-friendly and
doesn't seem to record at very loud volumes off a PC, even with the
volume in Windows cranked up all the way.

   GOLF SCOPE'S GOT A LINK TO DISTANCE
</P>
<P>
   There was quite a frenzy around Radio Shack's Golf Scope ($20;
www.radioshack.com) last Christmas. After all, everybody knows at
least one golfer, and the friendly price tag pretty much made this
distance-to-pin elucidator a no-brainer gift idea. Hence, it sold
out at every store. I finally had the chance to evaluate a Golf
Scope only to find, first off, that a lot of golfers were looking
at me funny. But regardless of how nerdy the technogeek device made
me look, it really did exactly what it's supposed to do. You merely
peek through the telescope and line up the pin on an inset grid
pattern that effectively gives you the distance. No matter, I
continued to slice right regardless of the apparently appropriate
club the scope helped me to select . . . Good golfers may find it
more useful _ the technogeek golfers at any rate.

<P>
   GLADIAC'S GOT A LEG UP ON THE COMPETITION
</P>
<P>
   While the next generation of ``next generation'' 3-D accelerator
cards seem to appear about as fast as they collectively push
polygons, Elsa's Gladiac ($330; www.elsa.com) not only uses
nVidia's current iteration of its fast graphics chip, the GeForce2
GTS, it was the first out of the gate and onto retail shelves,
which gave it a huge head start on all the other manufactures using
nVidia chips. More importantly, the Gladiac's Winman Suite utility
includes, among other things, an overclocking tool, which allows
one to tweak performance beyond its stock specs. That means
blindingly fast graphics in first-person-shooter games like Quake
III. A bold addition further enhanced by a crash utility that will
perceive a system lock, notify you at reboot and automatically
reset your tweaks back to the default settings. Regardless, Elsa's
Gladiac GeForce2 GTS is remarkably stable and frightfully fast; it
promises to remain faithfully powerful and stinky speedy in spite
of the fact that a GeForce2 GTS ``Ultra'' chip is due to appear on
the market shortly.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ While Apple ``reinvents'' the mouse a year after
Microsoft does the same thing with an optical sensor _ or
``IntelliEye'' _ replacing the underbelly trackball, it's worth
visiting the sci-fi-sexy Razer Boomslang 2000 ($99;
www.razerzone.com), a frightfully fast precision mouse that
reinvents, instead, how that underbelly trackball is read. With a
pinpoint accurate laser light reader, the Boomslang's refined
encoder accurately tracks mouse-ball movement at 2000 dpi, far more
than the typical rodent reading at 400 dpi. This means, of course,
you get fast and accurate cursor movement with very little throw of
the actual device. Essentially the quintessential gamer's mouse
(it's particularly malicious with first-person-shooting games), the
USB Boomslang can also replace your MAC or PC mouse for everyday
usage at work.NO MORE NOTEBOOK CRAMP
</P>
<P>
   3M, ever the innovator of unglorified office products, scores
again with the Adjustable Notebook Platform ($70; www.3m.com) from
its Office Ergonomics line. Mindful of the fact that the compact
design of laptop computers can put a strain on the user's body,
particularly when it is placed on a support surface that isn't
height and tilt adjustable, the Adjustable Notebook Platform has an
``adjustable wedge'' design that angles a notebook toward the user
to improve wrist angle and viewing posture. It also features a
built-in mousing area with a gel-filled wrist rest that
accommodates standard-sized mouse.

 &HT;    Online play, price cut ensure Sega's survival
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This time last year, consumers were excited about the
launch of the Sega Dreamcast video game console. The graphics and
animation of the Dreamcast were considerably more advanced and
visually impressive than the Sony PlayStation and the Nintendo 64
game consoles.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamcast also came equipped with a 56k bps modem, enticing
gamers with the thought of playing games online _ a feature never
before experienced with a home video game console.
</P>
<P>
   Excitement was mixed with some skepticism, however. Sega's
previous video game console, the Saturn, had a short lifespan in
the United States due to the small number of popular games and a
$399 price tag. With only 18 games available at launch, it was
uncertain whether the Dreamcast would follow the same path.
</P>
<P>
   The Sega system was also in the approaching shadow of Sony's
PlayStation 2, and many consumers were considering holding out for
the successor of the reputable PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   These factors left the Dreamcast on shaky ground. One year
later, with a robust selection of games, online capabilities and a
new pricing strategy, Sega's game console has found stability.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of games for the system has blossomed from 18 to
more than 100 and is expected to grow to 200 by the holiday season.
Notable developers such as Namco, Capcom, Infogrames, Midway and
Ubi Soft have created games for the system and are continuing
future developments.
</P>
<P>
   The price of a typical Dreamcast game is between $39.99 and
$49.99. However, Sega has reduced the price of some of its
best-selling titles to $19.99 for the All Star series. Other
first-generation games have been reduced to less than $30.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Robison, group director of third-party licensing at Sega of
America, feels this is a good factor for consumers. ``When a family
goes in to buy a video game console, they don't just look at the
price of the hardware; they look at the price of the software as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial cost of $199 for the Dreamcast console has also been
reduced to $149 _ $50 higher than the current PlayStation but half
the price of the upcoming $299 PlayStation 2.
</P>
<P>
   Sega has also given Dreamcast owners some clarity about online
gaming with its dedicated gaming network, SegaNet. The service not
only allows PC and Dreamcast users to surf the Web and send e-mail
like an ISP, it also lets gamers play certain titles online.
</P>
<P>
   Before the release of ``NFL2K1,'' the only title playable online
was ``Chu Chu Rocket.'' Although the puzzle game finally delivered
network playability, the title didn't represent the intense online
gaming experience consumers were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Robison feels ``Chu Chu Rocket'' was integral to delivering
Sega's promise of online gaming. He describes the title as an
``experiment that allowed us to really test out game servers,
online connectivity and look at behavior of playing online games.''
</P>
<P>
   Sega's advanced network is expected to run without the lagging
witnessed in typical online games via the PC. With a dedicated
network for the Dreamcast, gamers won't be subject to the numerous
hops and rerouting of ISPs. Games like ``NFL2K1'' can be played by
two players coast-to-coast as if they were playing in the same
room.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``NFL2K1'' and ``Chu Chu Rocket'' are currently the
only Dreamcast games online, Sega and other developers have such
games in the works. Some online titles that will be available
before the holidays are ``Quake 3,'' ``Speed Devils 2'' and ``POD
2'' by Ubi Soft; and ``Unreal Tournament'' by Infogrames.
</P>
<P>
   With the purchase of the $149 Dreamcast, owners can try SegaNet
free for 50 hours. The full, unlimited service is $21.95 a month.
Customers who sign up for 18 months of the SegaNet service get a
Dreamcast keyboard and a $150 rebate _ in essence, a free Dreamcast
console.
</P>
<P>
   After a year, Sega is showing that its system will subsist and
grow. With original games, competitive pricing and, most notably,
advanced online gaming, the Dreamcast is looking like a solid game
console.

 &HT;    Official site gets you in mood for Olympic Games to begin
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Caught the Olympic fever yet?
</P>
<P>
   Already program the Palm, the pager and the phone to deliver
track and field results and soccer scores? That's OK. You still
have some time before the torch lights up in Sydney to work up some
enthusiasm and national pride for the good old US of A.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you could care less about platform diving,
world-class cycling or even basketball, one visit to the official
Olympic site (www.olympics.com/eng) is something you absolutely
must do if you do nothing else Olympics-related for the entire
month of September.
</P>
<P>
   Built for the nations of the world by the good folk at IBM who
know a thing or two about sports sites _ they do the Web handiwork
for the Masters golf tournament, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, after
all _ the Sydney 2000 site is really something to see.
</P>
<P>
   This official Olympics site is exactly what the Olympic Games _
or any major sporting event _ of the modern era are all about: the
merger of sports, commerce and high-tech entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Equally entertaining are the well-designed sponsor boxes in the
top right-hand corner. Is it just irony that the Games devoted to
discipline, endurance and self-sacrifice are sponsored by Cadbury
chocolates and Olestra, the fake-fat product found in products like
Lay's Wow potato chips?
</P>
<P>
   Log on to the Olympics site, and you can look at a breathtaking
view of Sydney's harbor from the Goodyear ``blimpcam'' while music
plays in the background from the CD ``Olympic Record.'' The CD is
for sale in the Olympic shop, in case you were wondering, along
with a variety of unique and un-touristy objects ranging from fine
jewelry to works of art and one-of-a-kind quilts on sale to support
the Paralympics. There are, of course, the ever-popular Olympic
pins _ think of them as Pokemon cards for the over-40 set. Prices
are in Australian dollars, but there is a currency converter that
pops up in a separate screen so you can see how many American
dollars it'll cost you to get the goods from Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   But shopping and technological fireworks aside, the Sydney 2000
Web site gets down to some fundamentals clueless North Americans
might need. For example, where is Australia anyway? Let's answer
that puzzler before we move on to tougher topics _ like when will
Americans get to see the gymnastics on TV?
</P>
<P>
   Click on the words ``What time is it in Sydney?'' and you'll get
another pop-up screen with a world map, a time and temperature
check, a three-day forecast and the time difference between Sydney
and every time zone in the world. We discovered, for example, that
11 p.m. on the East Coast of the United States is 2 in the
afternoon the next day in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Compare the official Olympics site with NBCOlympics.com. NBC has
exclusive U.S. broadcast rights to the Olympics, and its site is a
frenzy of pro-American news. And it's brought to you not by a candy
bar company but by those pushing good old-fashioned red-blooded
American products like Budweiser, adidas and Ameritrade. Beer,
running shoes and stocks _ the hot dogs and apple pie of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC site was designed by Quokka Sports, the extreme-sports
Internet company that's much admired by Web designers for its
ability to make nearly any sport jump off the computer monitor and
into your home. (Check out the Mountainzone.com site for a
combination of great photos and climbers' diaries to get a sense of
what Quokka is all about).
</P>
<P>
   So between the official site and the NBC site, there's an
international and a country-specific look at the Olympic Games,
which is fine. But neither site can answer one very fundamental
question: When will we get to see the actual Olympics on TV?
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Olympics site lists events in local time. The NBC
site offers two schedules: an ``Olympic schedule'' and a
``broadcast schedule.'' NBC will also be using all three of its
broadcast properties (including CNBC and MSNBC) to round out
coverage of the Games. But unless you want to bust open another
browser and toggle back and forth between the American broadcast
schedule and the timing of the actual events, it's easy to become
very confused.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Web and our good neighbors to the north come
in. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (www.cbc.ca) is going to show
the events live. That means the opening ceremonies will begin at
3:45 a.m. Friday on the East Coast (that's 6:45 p.m. in Sydney).
But NBC won't be airing the ceremonies until 7:30 that evening.
Sports junkies can also check out a number of international Web
sites in the wee hours of the morning to get scores and results
even if they have to wait to see the action stateside.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in the broader issues surrounding the Olympics
will enjoy the CBC's detailed coverage of athletes bounced from the
Games for failing drug tests. Or check out a BBC report
(news.bbc.co.uk
</P>
<P>
   /sport/hi/english/olympics2000/default.stm) on the questionable
manufacturing practices of Nike sneakers. There's a lot more than
sports going on in Sydney, and the Web is a window to a
multicultural perspective on a multinational event.

 &HT;    Alarm watches can dispense reminders about medication
 &HT;    By Anne Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Our activities rely on a set schedule. There are
meetings, appointments and outings that can be coordinated by
leather-bound calendars, time-management systems, Palm Pilots and
computerized calendar merges.
</P>
<P>
   There are also simple lunch dates, scheduled on scraps of paper
and synchronized with simple wristwatches.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1980s I lived without a wristwatch. My bedside
alarm clock signaled the start of a new workday.
</P>
<P>
   I drove a car without a factory-installed clock, so I purchased
a stick-on digital clock for $1.99 and placed it on the steering
wheel. I was frequently on time, and the clock lasted beyond the
car's usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1990, my friend Linda gave me a watch. At first, I
wore it during Linda's wedding activities to show that I was
grateful for the gift. It took a few days and I had a new habit. I
became watch-dependent.
</P>
<P>
   My watches are simple time-keeping devices. Some have second
hands, but none tells the date.
</P>
<P>
   Being the chief time-keeper of my household makes watch-wearing
a significant part of my job description. I get to the schoolbus on
time, coordinate our play dates, and manage my work and volunteer
duties all within a reasonable fraction of punctuality.
</P>
<P>
   I am also responsible for doling out a regular set of
medications, and have failed more than once at getting them
delivered on time. With medication, timing is everything.
Non-compliance with medications is a universal problem, causing
added strain on patients and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Forgetting to take a medication brings repeat and more severe
infections, added hospitalizations, deaths and billions of dollars
in added health care burden in the United States each year. (See
this article from the American Medical Association at
www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/article/2036-2515.html.)
</P>
<P>
   I take my job seriously, but my memory plays its own game. There
are times when my recollection of removing the pill from the
dispenser is of yesterday or the day before.
</P>
<P>
   It helped when I got a seven-day pillbox. Pills for each day are
placed in compartments in the box. If there are still four pills
remaining at 5 p.m., I know that I have missed a dose. This system
has a huge fault; by the time I realize the dose is missed, eight
hours have passed.
</P>
<P>
   Technology will now assure accuracy in pill-dispensing. I will
buy a reminder system.
</P>
<P>
   My first choice will probably be a watch with an alarm. There
are also pillbox alarms and compact timers for briefcase, purse,
backpack or pocket.
</P>
<P>
   An extensive selection is available online at www.epill.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site features a line of vibrating reminder watches and
clocks. The vibrating timepieces assure privacy for watch-wearers
of all ages. The six-alarm watches start at $80.
</P>
<P>
   If a watch is not your choice, you can buy the tiny MedAlarm
Micro Medication Computer. The product offers up to 24 alarms a day
and keeps tabs on you with a built-in compliance tracker. Retailing
for $50 with batteries ($40 on sale at e-pill), it features a loud
alarm sound.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a more elaborate alarm watch, the e-pill site also
offers the Cadex 12-alarm watch with a medical ID. Users can
program up to 12 reminders, including scrolling text messages. This
watch also keeps critical health information in a Medical ID
Databank. Press the ``alert'' button to display name and phone
number, medical conditions, allergic reactions, medications,
emergency contact, insurance information and more. This watch
retails for $90, but is on sale at e-pill for $60.
</P>
<P>
   Another item is the MedTimer clock. This portable,
5-inch-by-1-inch device is programmable by the half-hour, allowing
the user to set up to 31 alarms per day. It costs $35.
</P>
<P>
   For simple pill reminders, you can buy the Pill Bottle Alarm.
This device attaches to a pill vial with suction. It beeps if the
user forgets to take the medication. This product is only useful
for twice-a-day or once-a-day medications (unless the user resets
the device after each pill) and is sold in a three-pack for $50.
</P>
<P>
   Many manufacturers offer watches with alarms. There are analog
and digital ones, attractive and homely ones, one-alarm and
multialarm varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Fossil's (www.fossil.com) Brain line starts at $75 and comes in
more than a dozen styles. The Brain is a unisex watch. It stores up
to 30 memos with 32 characters each. With seven alarms, this
chrono/stopwatch is also an ideal pill reminder.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping online at Yahoo's shopping site (shopping.yahoo.com), I
came across an LCD calculator/alarm watch. It may not be pretty,
but it adds and it alarms for $10.
</P>
<P>
   Search the Casio watch collection (www.casio.com) for ``alarm,''
and you will find more than 100 matches. The Technowear Timepiece
features a voice recorder and five multifunction alarms for $80. It
offers time for 24 time zones, a stopwatch, a calculator and a
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Trusty Timex (www.timex.com) has a number of watches in varying
sizes with alarms. Starting at $30, some styles are attractive
enough to sell on their looks.
</P>
<P>
   The Timex Turn &AMP; Pull alarm is an analog watch with an
accurate-to-the-minute alarm function. The instructions are brief
and simple enough to be engraved on the back of the watch.
</P>
<P>
   Timex boasts about the simplicity of the watch settings,
describing it as a settable watch for everything you need to do. An
added selling point of the watch is its 40 beeps and flashing
nightlight to rouse even the soundest sleeper. It works as a
perfect traveling alarm clock.
</P>
<P>
   The Timex Turn &AMP; Pull alarm is available in eight different
styles ranging in price from $50-$65.
</P>
<P>
   For the higher-end watch enthusiast, Omega (www.omega.ch) offers
the X-33 timepiece with alarm. The watch is said to be the choice
for manned space missions and costs just over $2,000. I won't be
purchasing this model unless I have a planned trip to the moon.

 &HT;    Role-playing title features plenty of options in odd location _
space
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like many PC role-playing games, ``Terminus'' has a
detailed and intricate story line, complete with multiple
characters, missions and scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other role-playing games, ``Terminus'' serves up a
virtual smorgasbord of role-playing options for players to explore,
including multiplayer modes and career options.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a ``scenario web'' that changes the story line based
on the success, or failure, of the missions and career choices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``Terminus'' has taken many elements commonly found
in the traditional role-playing game and fused them with space
combat. The result is a story line that can be played again and
again from different perspectives and with varying outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really good game, so far,'' said Randy Rogers, 16, who
reviewed the game. ``I haven't tried a lot of the options yet, but
I like to have a lot of flexibility. This game is kind of like a
cross between `Mantis' and `Wing Commander.' I liked both of those
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among the options is a player's choice of a career path
to follow. Gamers can choose to be on either side of the law,
choosing among military service, trading, engineering, hijacking or
other criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   One of the game's five modes is ``multiplayer,'' an option not
usually found in RPGs. In multiplayer, gamers can play
cooperatively with a friend in the same career or competitively
against friends in different careers.
</P>
<P>
   Randy, who's been playing PC games since he was 10, said most of
the time he chooses to be a fighter pilot, flying among the 18
space stations throughout the solar system where players can trade,
organize and re-arm. He said it took him a while to tweak the
adjustable flight controls until he got them to his liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the easiest game to get into,'' he said. ``If I
hadn't done this before, I would have given up after the first
couple of tries.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the game's setting is the 22nd century, Randy said the
program's graphics are nearly archaic by today's standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really surprises me,'' the Stockbridge resident said. ``I
would have thought the graphics would be better, but they are way
behind the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characters don't look that good, and the explosions aren't
that great. I think they could have done a better job with that
part of the game. The sound wasn't that great, either, but it was
OK.''

 &HT;    Getting an education online
 &HT;    By Anne Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The computer has become the classroom for an
increasing number of college students, in a transformation that
eliminates the boundaries of geography and scheduled class times.
</P>
<P>
   Computers provide virtual classrooms, cyberlibraries and online
chat areas where students can plug in to their college classes from
any location. The ability to enroll in full-fledged undergraduate
and graduate programs has opened the possibility of college
instruction for time-pressed professionals as well as those
shackled to home by family responsibilities or physical
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience of course work, combined with greater access to
computers, has fueled the growth of Internet offerings at Georgia
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   At Southern Polytechnic State University in Marietta, the
Internet was first used in the fall of 1997 for the master's of
science in quality assurance program. That semester, 69 students
were taking classes on campus and 29 were taking courses online. In
the fall of 2000, 19 students are taking on-campus classes and 76
are taking the courses using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see more courses and degrees offered in the
Internet distance-learning format,'' said Larry Aft, a professor
who helped develop the pilot degree program for Southern Tech.
``The convenience and flexibility of this format make it very
attractive to students.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet offerings made up approximately 31,560 credit hours in
fiscal year 2000 for the 34 public colleges and universities of the
University System of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is becoming much more of a tool in our everyday
lives,'' says Kris Biesinger, assistant vice chancellor of advanced
learning technologies for the Board of Regents of the University
System of Georgia. ``Using this same tool to access education is
becoming more mainstream. It is converging in a one-stop approach
to education, and it's becoming more user-friendly. Technology
affords us to really match learning environment with learning
need.''
</P>
<P>
   An August report by media measurement firm Media Metrix shows
overall growth in Internet use plus a significant increase in
Internet accessibility for families with a household income under
$25,000 a year. ``Among the reasons for the gradual closing of the
`digital divide' are the continued fall in computer prices,
increased technological ease-of-use, and improved access to the
Internet in professional, academic and community environments,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Green is vice president for communication for Georgia
GLOBE, a University System of Georgia program designed to increase
access to courses and degree programs offered by the public
colleges and universities. Green is pursuing her education
doctorate through an online degree program.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an online student, I have a much greater flexibility as to
how and when I study,'' Green said. ``There was no way I could do
my job and go through a doctoral program. But because I've been
able to do a large portion of it online, I now can.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said many Georgians share in her enthusiasm. ``In a
statewide survey of over 500 respondents, over 60 percent indicated
they would use either the Internet or Georgia Public Broadcasting
to take courses,'' Green said. ``The numbers of people taking
online and/or distance-learning courses is increasing rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Distance learning isn't new. But technology has changed the
delivery of the old-fashioned correspondence course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distance education has been around since a reliable post
office,'' says Lynne Schrum, associate professor at the University
of Georgia's department of instructional technology. ``We now have
the whole gamut from totally online to still sending out
videotapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech, one of the world's leading engineering schools,
offers graduate level degrees through distance learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students want courses anytime, anyplace,'' says Joe Boland,
director of Georgia Tech's Center for Distance Learning.
``Engineers realize that a master's degree in a technical field is
important, and some cannot interrupt their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Boland, Georgia Tech's distance-learning program
reaches a wide range of students. The program has admitted students
who range from fresh-out-of-college 22-year-olds seeking master's
degrees to a 70-year-old student wanting to brush up on his skills.
</P>
<P>
   Distance-learning programs often attract working professionals.
Some may live far from the teaching institution; others may work
late hours or travel in their careers. For these students,
on-campus classes are not a viable option. Distance learning allows
these professionals to pursue their desired degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got people in north Atlanta that take courses and attain
the degree by distance learning,'' Boland said. ``They choose to do
them this way because of the convenience. ... We deliver the
courses anywhere in the world where we can ship videotapes or they
can have access to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 34 public colleges and universities in the
University System of Georgia participates in distance education.
Some may use distance learning to only enhance traditional courses,
while others may only receive courses that originate from other
campuses through GSAMS (Georgia Statewide Academic and Medical
System), an interactive videoconferencing system.
</P>
<P>
   The number of distance offerings and types of courses varies by
institution. Degree programs are offered through six of these
institutions, and an online MBA is offered by a consortium of five
others. More institutions will be offering degrees through distance
learning in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Distance-education delivery formats vary by course, with some
courses using several technologies. Options include GSAMS,
Internet, CD-ROM, satellite, cable and video-based instruction.
</P>
<P>
   GSAMS allows an instructor to teach students in multiple
locations simultaneously. It links approximately 400 sites in
Georgia for primarily academic programs. The students reduce travel
time by selecting a site near them. This technology could be
likened to a visual group phone call where students and instructor
communicate in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is used in several ways. Students can access course
notes and assignments on the World Wide Web. Some online courses
are supplemented with CD-ROMs and videotapes. Classmates can
communicate with each other and the instructor using e-mail, online
chat, electronic bulletin boards or a combination of methods,
sometimes including face-to-face meetings.
</P>
<P>
   A popular method of delivery is the telecourse. Telecourses use
television or videotapes as well as printed materials. Access to
telecourses is through satellite, cable television, public
television and wireless cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely degrees that people get almost entirely
without seeing each other,'' Schrum said.
</P>
<P>
   There are also combinations where some classes meet at select
times during the semester but the majority of course work is
completed at a distance. A distance-learning course, by definition,
requires at least 51 percent of the course to be conducted through
distance-learning formats.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary statistics that cover the past year in
distance learning within the University System of Georgia,
Internet-based courses hosted approximately 11,000 course seats.
This number compares to GSAMS' 5,300 course seats over the same
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear a great deal about Internet-based courses because it
is the new thing and very appealing in theory,'' Schrum said.
</P>
<P>
   Grading systems vary by course and instructor, just like those
in a traditional environment.
</P>
<P>
   There are distance courses that grade by class participation,
research papers and essay exams.
</P>
<P>
   Some courses weigh heavier on midterm and final exams, which may
even be offered at a student's workplace with a proctor.
</P>
<P>
   The distance-learning courses are as difficult and
time-consuming as traditional courses. ``When I speak with
potential students, I tell them that it requires every bit of
effort that it takes you if you come to campus,'' Boland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be motivated, self-disciplined, and you have to
see the need for the program and how it will benefit you.''

 &HT;    Both software, hardware can help keep interlopers from getting
your stuff
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Readers: Broadband connections, hackers and home firewall
solutions all make for one big, raging debate out there. You've
e-mailed us tons of comments and responses to recent columns and,
frankly, they're too good to keep to ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Rich Wilson of Atlanta, a system administrator, worries
that broadbanders may get a false sense of security if they think
unplugging their network connection when not in use is the ultimate
way to ward off hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Users are creatures of habit, he says, and they access
their computers in fairly regular patterns. Hackers can predict
when you are online and can bore through any security hole in your
system in no time. Plus, intruders have this nasty way of slipping
out a ``back door'' sight unseen.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Rich is pretty hip on firewalls, though, as is Bob
Ventimiglia of Mableton, Ga. Bob offers up one of his favorite
options for the PC. Thanks, Bob. He gave high marks to ZoneAlarm
software from Zone Labs (www.zonelabs.com).
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It's free for personal and nonprofit use. Not to be
confused with ZoneAlarm Pro, which is more customizable and
beefier. It's cool but not free. Zone Labs has it for $39.95.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Mike Butcher of Lawrenceville is a ZoneAlarm fan, too. He
said he learned a lot about intrusion attempts on his computer from
the firewall software's pop-up alerts. Mike was full of good info
about finding out how vulnerable you are. He suggests putting
Shields Up to work. Surf to www.grc
</P>
<P>
   .com and click the Shields Up link to find out how Windows users
can get a free Internet connection security analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: George Notel of Cumming, Ga., prefers the muscle of a
hardware solution. He's been using a cable/DSL router with his
cable modem setup for three months and believes the router is the
best deterrent to a hacker. The router sits between the broadband
modem and your computer, like a fortress against attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: George likes the router built by Linksys at Netgear
(www.linksys.com/). It provides firewall protection, plus allows
users to share their connections with other computers in the house.
To anyone looking for openings, the only thing they see would be
that router. It masquerades as your computer while your system
remains hidden from the prying eyes of the Internet. Users can
leave file sharing up and running because the router blocks
incoming connections. You can expect to pay $120 to $175.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Another hardware option is the DI-701 Internet
gateway/firewall. It's made by D-Link and costs $99. Have a
look-see at www.dlink.com/. It bonds with any operating system that
can connect to the Internet, including Windows, the Mac OS and
Linux.

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Intel camera a good intro to digital
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A little device called the Intel Pocket PC Camera has
given me my first taste of digital photography, and it's been a
very good introduction.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel camera is designed to work both as one of those
cameras tethered to a PC or as a free-range camera like its big
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tiny thing, about 4 inches by 2 1/2, all plastic, and it
looks like a toy. However, the Intel camera is surprisingly
capable.
</P>
<P>
   When connected by a long cable to your computer's USB port, it
draws its power from the computer.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat awkward to use as a proper camera in this mode,
because you're supposed to use the image presented through the
accompanying software on your computer monitor instead of the
viewfinder.
</P>
<P>
   This means that regardless of how long the cable may be, you
have to be positioned behind the PC monitor.
</P>
<P>
   In this mode, you can adjust the focus by turning the little
blue lens housing, and every press of the snapshot button produces
an image in the software.
</P>
<P>
   Unhooked from the computer and powered by four AAA batteries,
the operator uses the viewfinder and the little display window on
the top of the camera. This indicates whether the presumed subject
is in focus, how many photos are in memory and whether the camera
is set to make high-quality images (640x480 pixels) or normal
quality (320x240).
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable thing about this camera, perhaps, is its 8
megabytes of memory. That's as much as provided with some digital
cameras costing five times as much.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Intel camera can hold up to 128 high-quality
images. There is no way, of course, to view and selectively delete
images from memory when the camera isn't connected to the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The camera has a 10-second self-timer; it can take 10-second
movies and run off a string of five sequence shots. The mode is
selected by a button beside the display window, and the window, in
addition to noting the mode, also indicates battery life and the
timer's progression.
</P>
<P>
   Images from the camera are, it seems to me, better than they
ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   The camera comes with MGI Photosuite, which allows considerable
manipulation of the images and a program that downloads the images
and affords basic manipulation, plus help in making e-mail
postcards and other productions. It's quite easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with a little wrist strap, a base on which the
camera can be placed while tethered to the computer, and a carrying
case.
</P>
<P>
   The only real downside is the documentation, which is entirely
online. There is, however, a little basic guide that will fit in
the carrying case with the camera.
</P>
<P>
   The Pocket PC Camera lists for $149. For more information, see
www.intel.com/PCcamera.

 &HT;    Broadband users need firewall to prevent hackers from prying
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If I were an explorer, I would just be getting around
to discovering America. Despite a love of technology _ and a
glimmer of understanding _ I stumble along way behind the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   I'm just now getting around to installing a firewall in my home
computer. Despite my own backward ways, I figure some of you are
also two steps behind. Think of this as remedial education on
computer security.
</P>
<P>
   A firewall, according to its original meaning, is a fireproof
bulkhead used in building construction to delay the spread of fire.
When the Internet and computer networks came along, the name was
applied to software designed to keep hackers out. Like in the
original meaning, it can't stand up to an intense attack but it
does nicely for ordinary purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, firewalls were of more use to business and
government networks. For most home users, who used a dial-up modem
to connect to the Internet for just a few hours or minutes, a
firewall was overkill. In those days, since firewall programs were
written for the sophisticated audience of users, configuring them
was way beyond the skills of most people with home PCs.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the advent of fast and constant broadband
connections to the Internet, the landscape has changed, and it
makes sense to have a firewall on a home computer. The notion of an
``always on'' high-speed connection is no longer exotic, and that
has made the need for computer security more intense.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been the case that each computer on a network
needs an address. Just like on a postal route, the address is used
so packets of information can be delivered to the right place. If
you log on with a dial-up modem, it is likely your address changes
each time you connect. That's called a dynamic address.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when you log on with DSL or a cable modem _
like the one I have at home _ it is likely your address stays
constant. That's called a static address.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one of those rare times in the computer world where
common sense will help you understand the two reasons why there's
an increased danger of hackers. The first reason is that the longer
you stay online, the more opportunities a hacker has of finding and
invading your computer. The second reason is that if you have a
static address, you are no longer a moving target for the hackers.
Instead, your computer just sits there hooked up to the Internet,
making it easier to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, as the market has changed, so have the firewall
programs. What once was a complicated mess of settings has become
easy. There are plenty of firewall programs designed for the home
(and small-business) user. Norton has one, there's one called Black
Ice that's very popular, and the one I use and prefer, called Zone
Alarm. It is available free to home users and nonprofit
organizations as a download at www.zonelabs.com.
</P>
<P>
   The download is almost instantaneous using a cable modem or DSL.
</P>
<P>
   The real joy of this program is the setup. There really isn't
any. It installs in the most logical configuration for your
computer and should work great without tweaking with settings on
your part. You won't be faced _ as is true with some other
firewalls _ with answering esoteric questions about your IP address
and system settings. Instead, it automatically fills in all the
information for you.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as time goes on, and you get more familiar with how it
works, you may want to make some changes so that the firewall suits
the risks you face and your own preferences for security. You can
do that at any time, using the manual settings. And, if you have
questions, the ZoneLab Web site is a good source for answers.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone who uses a firewall program is shocked at the
number of alerts you'll get when another computer comes knocking on
the door. Many are false alarms (generated by Web sites you've
visited that are too stupid to know you've disconnected and are
still trying to send data). But a good number are not. Many are
attempts to get into your machine that might have succeeded without
a firewall. If a hacker gets into your machine, he can do anything
you can do, including deleting files or looking at personal or
financial information.
</P>
<P>
   I recommend installing a firewall if you use a high-speed
connection. You can figure that _ as slow as I move in deciding
things like this _ that is a conservative opinion.

 &HT;    What to say about (at)$&AMP;?
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Reporters can be a pain in the posterior.
But describing them as more particular parts of a posterior is
going too far.
</P>
<P>
   So when George W. Bush described a New York Times reporter last
week as ``major league'' in a vividly uncomplimentary manner while
a microphone broadcast it, a certified issue was created.
</P>
<P>
   And editors had to decide how to impart this tastefully.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press report described the word only as ``a
profanity.'' This is tasteful but vague. You didn't know if the
offending word was something very bad, something pungently
Texas-sounding in the tradition of fellow-Texan Lyndon Johnson, or
merely something a little too naughty to say around the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Did Bush evoke one of the mild expletives deleted from a Richard
Nixon recording or one of the stronger expletives not deleted from
an Eminem recording? If you didn't hear it, you wouldn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``THAT GUY'S AN (at)$&AMP;!'' The New York Daily News blared. I like
this approach. Yet it, too, can be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``(at)$&AMP;'' suggests a string of curses not one, lonely noun. Any
comic page reader will confirm this. It is always in the next panel
after you see Dagwood carrying a hammer and picture frame.
</P>
<P>
   No such niceties were observed by editors of National Public
Radio's ``Morning Edition.'' They rolled the tape and let it speak
for itself. No beeps.
</P>
<P>
   There is something to be said for this. When I hear a beep over
a word, I assume the worse. If I heard a tape of Bush calling the
reporter ``a major-league beeeeeep,'' I would have reached into the
further reaches of my vocabulary to fill the blank.
</P>
<P>
   And I would have been wrong and excessively creative. NPR
editors said, reasonably enough, they included the offending
reference to human anatomy because after all the yucky Starr Report
stuff, it didn't seem that bad.
</P>
<P>
   True enough. But I suspect a post-Monica backlash is brewing
among news consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The printed word has a certain power and lastingness that
amplifies any offhand remark, any biting sound bite, any snippet
overheard by a microphone's indifferent circuitry. Which is why
newspapers handle matters of popular vocabulary rather
conservatively.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone wanting the exact language may look it up on the
Internet, a medium in which you may seek out a word without a word
seeking out you.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, I have learned firsthand about reader
sensitivities. I received complaints for using the phrase ``old
f_t'' in a self-depreciating way. Several people contacted me to
depreciate me themselves, feeling I had done an inadequate job.
</P>
<P>
   I have been more careful since.
</P>
<P>
   Bush apologized for his statement. Sort of. Mostly he said was
sorry other people heard. He wasn't sorry he dissed someone for
doing his job.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a certain amount of tsk-tsking, the result is a wash.
Bush may have been embarrassed _ though probably not _ but nobody
ever lost an election by insulting the press. The key to
press-bashing is to seem like a person righteously provoked and not
a (at)$&AMP; whiner.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter, meanwhile, gained street credibility his
colleagues can only envy.
</P>
<P>
   In most occupations, being insulted by a potential president of
the United States so that's it's heard everywhere on the planet
would considered A Bad Thing. For a reporter, it could go on a
resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``That major-league (at)$&AMP;! Why wasn't it me?'' his colleagues
on the bus are thinking.

 &HT;    The mysterious Aunt Rob
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Aunt Rob lived just around the corner from
the Parkers on Herschel Street. She was Granddaddy Parker's sister,
but as I recall, there wasn't a whole lot of visiting back and
forth. I don't ever remember seeing Aunt Rob at Grandmother's table
for Sunday dinner or sitting on the front porch drinking tea and
talking with visitors. I never knew if she'd been married or had
any children. Guess no one thought to mention it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a short walk to Aunt Rob's and if I really concentrated,
and if I was lucky enough to be wearing my canvas beach shoes, the
ones with the soft soles, I could walk all the way over and back
without slipping off the half-round, six-inch curb stones that
separated Riverside lawns from the octagonal stone sidewalks that
were okay for hopscotch but impossible for roller skating.
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Rob's house, like Mrs. Parker's and so many other places in
Jacksonville, had a cane break in the yard for shade and privacy.
Summer nights I remember lying in my bed beside the sleeping porch
window and listening to the sough of the cane as the river breeze
stirred it into a loosely conducted symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Fat columns lined the porch that surrounded Aunt Rob's house,
and I remember hugging one each time I went there to see if I'd
grown enough to reach around it. I never had.
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Rob didn't answer her own door. That was Nelson's job. He
lived on the place and took care of things like phones and doors,
and emptying the drip pan under the icebox that Aunt Rob had kept
even though there was a Norge refrigerator in the pantry, because
she had to have chipped ice, not cubes, in her tea and Co'Cola.
</P>
<P>
   It was always quiet and shady in Aunt Rob's parlor because
Nelson had learned the finely tuned southern art of climate control
long before anyone had air-conditioning. As the sun moved across
the house, he'd adjust the wooden-louvered shutters that covered
the downstairs windows, four and six to a room, running from the
floor almost to the 12-foot ceilings, to take advantage of any
breezes that might stray in across the St. John's River.
</P>
<P>
   Once I asked Nelson if he had any children I could play with and
he looked sad. Said his babies had all grown up and gone away.
``Moved to Georgia,'' I remember him saying with such a sour look
coming across his face that for years I was wary of stepping off
the train with my parents for a walk around the platform in places
like Waycross or Valdosta, for fear something awful would happen
and I too would have to leave home and move to Georgia. A couple of
decades later, I did just that, but nothing too awful came of it.
</P>
<P>
   Visits to Aunt Rob's were always kind of formal, but I was
fascinated by what I couldn't see there. I often wondered what life
was like in the other rooms _ the ones I'd never seen and never
would see. I tried to imagine what Aunt Rob might be like when no
one else was around.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, early, I sneaked out of Grandmother Parker's house
and padded barefoot around the curbstones and into Aunt Rob's side
yard. I knew better than to peek through the dining room shutters,
but I did it anyway and saw Aunt Rob sitting at the little table by
the windows, picking toast from a rack that I guessed Nelson had
put there with her breakfast. Her hair was loose from the wispy bun
she usually wore and she looked so pretty and so young that I
wanted to run back and tell someone, but of course, I couldn't
because I'd been snooping. Aunt Rob remained my mystery.
</P>
<P>
   I was seven the summer I walked the curb to Aunt Rob's for the
last time. I rang the bell and hugged a column while I waited for
Nelson to answer. He never did. Aunt Rob was gone too.
</P>
<P>
   I walked the same curb back to Grandmother's and asked where
Aunt Rob was. I was told, ``Away.'' That's all I ever knew.
Finally, I stopped asking.
</P>
<P>
   And now there's no one left who knows.

 &HT;    Duke it out with mutants in Activision's X-Men Mutant Academy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   X-Men Mutant Academy ($40; www.activision.com; for the
PlayStation), is a game simpatico with the recent summer
blockbuster, which in turn is based on an immensely popular comic
and cartoon franchise. Unfortunately, the game is merely another
means to brand name us with X-Men; it has little to do with the
film. In fact, it only vaguely resembles a modern video game.
Mutant Academy is a well-drawn, well-animated 2-D fighting game _
and that's it. There's no adventure akin to a movie plot, just the
various super-antiheroes duking it out in a face-to-face,
side-scrolling romp. Even on the aging PlayStation console, most
fighting games are known to contain so much more than flat-action
eye-candy, such as three dimensions. Nevertheless, X-Men Mutant
Academy is a good 2-D fighting game complete with trademark
super-moves and painful powers of mutant punishment. But it's the
weakest member in the grand amalgamation scheme of console,
cartoon, comic and cinematic extravaganza.

   SquareSoft is pushing the bounds of electronic entertainment
into artistic interactive storytelling on game consoles like nobody
else. Besides being the most graphically bright and beautiful game
the PlayStation has seen, Chrono Cross ($40; www .squaresoft.com;
for the PlayStation) is the closest we have yet to come to fully
interactive storytelling. Players move through an engaging world
full of interesting characters, all the while feeling like their
decisions have consequence. The rare computer-generated cut-scenes
are astounding and further draw one emotionally into the adventure.
An elemental rock-paper-scissors combat system is interesting and
effective, yet nonintrusive. Gamers who like turn-based combat can
battle to their hearts' content, while those more interested in
following the storyline are able to mostly avoid conflict, though
not the important battles with boss creatures that they wouldn't
want to miss anyway _ that is until the last third of the game: a
fifteen hour repetitive battle sequence in which the otherwise
remarkable combat system of Chrono Cross loses all entertainment
value. The weak ending, however, isn't enough to drown the memory
of the game's brilliant beginnings.

   Funny thing about this PlayStation version of Worms Armageddon:
($30; www.hasbro-interactive .com; for the PlayStation) Sony
initially nixed the idea of a 2-D,
cuter-than-dimples/funnier-than-Looney Tunes action/strategy game
starring squeaky-voiced invertebrate simply for the fact that the
idea of a 2-D, cuter-than-dimples/funnier-than Looney Tunes
action/strategy game starring squeaky-voiced invertebrate didn't
seem like a viable PlayStation game a few years back when Sony was
marketing a hardcore gamer's machine. Now, of course, Sony will
license everything just to saturate the market, which is usually a
bad thing in the watered-down library sense of things, but a very
good thing in this specific case as Worms Armageddon is a
surprisingly great 2-D, cuter-than-dimples/
</P>
<P>
   funnier-than-Looney Tunes action/strategy game starring
squeaky-voiced invertebrate. Excellent even.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Just another racing game? Perhaps, but Breakneck ($40; www
.southpeak.com; for Windows) delivers some of the finest-looking,
smoothest-moving, most engaging racing ever found in the otherwise
saturated genre. Some 40-odd vehicles screaming around eight
variations of a couple dozen tracks promise more bang-for-the-buck
than most. Playable as both a tetchy racing simulation or a
balls-out, crash-bang-smash-`em-up arcade motor-romp, Breakout even
includes an optional combat mode where vehicles are armed with
delightfully effective James Bond-type weapons. Lord knows there's
nothing like dropping a sack of nails behind you to thwart that
aggressive tailgater, and hey, who hasn't wished for a heat-seeking
missile on that dolt who always manages to take the lead despite
one's best efforts?

   In a world of clones, you've got to admire innovation, even when
it succeeds modestly. Case in point: Evolva ($50,
www.interplay.com, for Windows), a refreshingly unusual squad-based
third-person-shooter set in a vastly distant future in which humans
_ or what humans have become _ must devour the DNA of their enemies
and evolve on the fly to survive. You control a customizeable
four-person squad of genohunters who must defeat a planetary
infestation of evil space spore. It sounds strange, and it is _
almost too strange. An undefinable coolness creeps into the
gameplay, with its lack of verbal communication or music, its
muted, pastel environments and its reptilian kill-or-be-killed
gameplay. Multiplayer fighting becomes a race to evolve fastest,
and the single-player levels border on the mundane. That said,
Evolva gets extra credit for going out on a limb with its weird
premise, smooth controls, multiple camera screens, creepy monsters
and uncanny alien feel.

 &HT;    The thinking tot's puzzle
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A simple, durable puzzle game geared more toward
conceptual thinking than basic motor skills, the Changing Places
Puzzle ($10; www .allaboardkids.com offers animal picture pieces on
transparencies that overlay onto corresponding scenery; the owl
goes in the tree, the octopus in the ocean, the spaceman in space,
that sort of thing. And while even the hardiest cardboard puzzle
games don't seem to withstand the chewing, stomping and throwing
tests most toddlers manage to put toys through, Changing Places
Puzzle pieces are made of smoothly polished wood. And, the puzzle
comes with a lifetime guarantee should any part be damaged or lost.

   A GENTLE BOUNCE FOR BABY
</P>
<P>
   Fisher Price really seems to shine when it doesn't they don't
try too hard. The Deluxe Soothing Bouncer Seat ($30;
www.fisher-price.com) is a marvel of simple technology,
well-implemented. A cute and colorful cloth hammock in a stalwart
but springy wire frame, complete with retractable sun-screen
canopy, is further enhanced by a single-battery motor that will set
the unit to vibrating like a gentle martini maker. This comforting
movement is reportedly ``similar to a ride in the car,'' albeit one
in which case your car is in desperate need of on an alignment.
Regardless, the Deluxe Soothing Baby Seat is wonderfully efficient,
cost effective and a must-have for any parent wishing the
second-best thing to an old-fashioned, hands-on, comforting cuddle
for their soothable wee one.

</P>
<P>
   www.icebox.com _ Animation on the Web has matured in
sophistication but much of it has severely regressed in taste.
Icebox.com is at the center of a storm of controversy over its
``Mr. Wong'' cartoon, deemed offensive by some Asian-American
groups. While you may want to skip that show, others, such as
``Superhero Roommate'' and a new show by ``Ren and Stimpy'' creator
John Kricfalusi are funny and entertaining, if a bit dirty.

 &HT;    A MiniDisc Walkman to get you groovin'
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The MiniDisc format, which allows
digital-quality recording and re-recording on a tiny, flat disc,
may never reach its full potential now that recordable CDs are all
the rage and portable MP3 players make the idea of any kind of disc
seem almost quaint. But Sony is proving there's still life in the
format with its array of MiniDisc Walkman models, including the
MZ-R70PC ($300; www.sel.sony.com), which includes a USB connector
for hooking up to a computer and recording audio right off the
desktop. The player/recorder looks and sounds fantastic, and the
sparse packaging is packed with stuff _ an AC adapter, a
headphones/wired-controller combo that allows you to edit tracks,
an optical digital cable for hooking up to your sound system and
even a rechargeable battery. Setup and installation is a breeze. If
there's any complaint it's that the MZ-R70PC isn't Mac-friendly and
doesn't seem to record at very loud volumes off a PC, even with the
volume in Windows cranked up all the way.

   GOLF SCOPE'S GOT A LINK TO DISTANCE
</P>
<P>
   There was quite a frenzy around Radio Shack's Golf Scope ($20;
www.radioshack.com) last Christmas. After all, everybody knows at
least one golfer, and the friendly price tag pretty much made this
distance-to-pin elucidator a no-brainer gift idea. Hence, it sold
out at every store. I finally had the chance to evaluate a Golf
Scope only to find, first off, that a lot of golfers were looking
at me funny. But regardless of how nerdy the technogeek device made
me look, it really did exactly what it's supposed to do. You merely
peek through the telescope and line up the pin on an inset grid
pattern that effectively gives you the distance. No matter, I
continued to slice right regardless of the apparently appropriate
club the scope helped me to select . . . Good golfers may find it
more useful _ the technogeek golfers at any rate.

   GLADIAC'S GOT A LEG UP ON THE COMPETITION
</P>
<P>
   While the next generation of ``next generation'' 3-D accelerator
cards seem to appear about as fast as they collectively push
polygons, Elsa's Gladiac ($330; www.elsa.com) not only uses
nVidia's current iteration of its fast graphics chip, the GeForce2
GTS, it was the first out of the gate and onto retail shelves,
which gave it a huge head start on all the other manufactures using
nVidia chips. More importantly, the Gladiac's Winman Suite utility
includes, among other things, an overclocking tool, which allows
one to tweak performance beyond its stock specs. That means
blindingly fast graphics in first-person-shooter games like Quake
III. A bold addition further enhanced by a crash utility that will
perceive a system lock, notify you at reboot and automatically
reset your tweaks back to the default settings. Regardless, Elsa's
Gladiac GeForce2 GTS is remarkably stable and frightfully fast; it
promises to remain faithfully powerful and stinky speedy in spite
of the fact that a GeForce2 GTS ``Ultra'' chip is due to appear on
the market shortly.

 &HT;    One quick mouse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While Apple ``reinvents'' the mouse a year after
Microsoft does the same thing with an optical sensor _ or
``IntelliEye'' _ replacing the underbelly trackball, it's worth
visiting the sci-fi-sexy Razer Boomslang 2000 ($99;
www.razerzone.com), a frightfully fast precision mouse that
reinvents, instead, how that underbelly trackball is read. With a
pinpoint accurate laser light reader, the Boomslang's refined
encoder accurately tracks mouse-ball movement at 2000 dpi, far more
than the typical rodent reading at 400 dpi. This means, of course,
you get fast and accurate cursor movement with very little throw of
the actual device. Essentially the quintessential gamer's mouse
(it's particularly malicious with first-person-shooting games), the
USB Boomslang can also replace your MAC or PC mouse for everyday
usage at work.NO MORE NOTEBOOK CRAMP
</P>
<P>
   3M, ever the innovator of unglorified office products, scores
again with the Adjustable Notebook Platform ($70; www.3m.com) from
its Office Ergonomics line. Mindful of the fact that the compact
design of laptop computers can put a strain on the user's body,
particularly when it is placed on a support surface that isn't
height and tilt adjustable, the Adjustable Notebook Platform has an
``adjustable wedge'' design that angles a notebook toward the user
to improve wrist angle and viewing posture. It also features a
built-in mousing area with a gel-filled wrist rest that
accommodates standard-sized mouse.

   Consumer Q&AMP;A
</P>
<P>
   By Jane Greigc. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: I am desperately, desperately in search of a
3- or 4-foot-tall Statue of Liberty (inflatable?) for a display. It
has to be somewhat affordable.
</P>
<P>
   _ C.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Is $390 somewhat affordable? That is the going rate for a
30.5-inch-high resin replica of this 151'1'' tall lady, who
celebrated her 100th birthday in 1986. Contact the small book shop
on the statue's pedestal at (212) 363-3180 for details. Short gig?
Dress up like the statue in a costume from Any Kind-A Costume, 2700
W. Anderson Lane, where a $30 rental fee gets you the torch, crown,
sash and dress. Q: How can the famous Olsen twins, Mary-Kate and
Ashley, be fraternal twins if they look exactly alike? How can they
not be identical twins? I am a triplet and one of my sisters looks
like me and the other doesn't. I have always thought that meant I
have an identical twin and a fraternal twin, but now I am not too
sure.
</P>
<P>
   _ K.O.
</P>
<P>
   A: Similar appearance is no guarantee that twins are identical _
only strong evidence, says University of Texas genetics lecturer
Nan Hampton. Triplets may be all single zygotes (three different
eggs fertilized by three different sperm), in which case no pair is
genetically identical. Triplets may also be a pair of identical
(monozygotic, a single egg fertilized by a single sperm split into
two embryos) twins with the other triplet being a single zygote.
</P>
<P>
   How to tell? Differences in traits such as blood groups and
plasma protein types indicate twins are not identical, reports
Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Famous triplet? Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, author and expert on
death and dying, was the first born in her set. And Texas' own Todd
triplets, Joseph, Michael and Daniel, played the sons of Katie and
Robbie Douglas on ``My Three Sons.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: On Trinity Broadcasting Network is a performer named Carman
(no last name). He is a singer, actor, dancer, Bible teacher and
very, very handsome. Could you please tell me how old he is, his
nationality, marital status and how tall he is? Oh yes, could you
give me his address?
</P>
<P>
   _ Donna B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Carman does have a last name _ Licciardello. Born in New
Jersey on Jan. 19, 1956, he is of Italian heritage. I could not get
his exact height from the folks at Carman Ministries, but they
estimate about 6 feet. Good news? Carman is not married, and
autographed photos are free. Write to him at Carman Ministries,
Inc., P.O. Box 5093, Brentwood, Tenn. 37024 or visit
www.carman.org. Q: I remember a cartoon that featured superheroes
like Strong Man, Rope Man, Baby Man, Tornado Man and Cuckoo Man.
Unfortunately, no one else does! Can you dig up any information on
these guys?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jason Kutac
</P>
<P>
   A: You are right. ``Mighty Heroes'' was a short lived
(1966-1967) half-hour series that replaced the popular, albeit
dated, ``Mighty Mouse Playhouse'' on Saturday morning. Directed by
Ralph Bakshi (``Lord of the Rings'') this CBS series had a lock on
odd characters. Diaper Man as a leader? For more on this wacky set
of villain chasers, pick up copy of Alex McNeil's ``Total
Television.'' Q: I've been trying to remember the old adage that
dictated the daily routines of our grandmothers and
great-grandmothers. Part of it goes like this: ``Wash on Monday;
iron on Tuesday; clean on Friday; bake on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   What did these busy women do on Wednesday and Thursday?

 &HT;    So what if Olympics are tape-delayed? Get over it
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Here's a bulletin for all you folks whining
about NBC's forthcoming tape-delayed coverage of the Summer
Olympics:
</P>
<P>
   There are three alternatives to taped coverage of the Games in
Sydney and none is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   First, NBC could telecast the Games live as they are taking
place in prime time in Australia. That means American viewers would
get to watch premiere events such as gymnastics, diving and track
at about 3 a.m. We could set our alarms, gather around the tube and
squeeze in all our family viewing before work and school. We'd be
exhausted and grumpy by lunch, but we'd get to watch the Olympics
live.
</P>
<P>
   Second, we could somehow convince organizers of the Olympics
that no matter where the Games take place, athletes must perform at
times that coincide with prime time in America. That means hundreds
of athletes who have spent their entire lives training for that
moment of glory would have to perform at unnatural times. Marathon
at high noon? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Third, we could insist that all Olympic Games take place in the
United States, so this ugly problem with time zones would
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of ugly . . . it is the height of Ugly Americanism
(theme song: ``Jingo Bells'') to assume that the world should
revolve around our prime-time TV schedule. It is our privilege to
watch Olympic athletes perform. They should do so at their
convenience, and they should be seen at the convenience of the host
country.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a teensy bit unsettling that results of the competition
will be all over the media before prime-time TV coverage begins?
Well, maybe for some people, especially obsessive sports fans like
Austin American-Statesman executive sports editor David Humphrey,
who was ``appalled'' to learn that all of NBC's coverage will be
tape-delayed, and KTBC sports anchor Dave Cody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say tape-delay ruins the Games, but it does take away
some of the immediacy,'' Cody says. ``As a viewer, I wish they'd
carry them live because I like live TV. I'd tune in in the middle
of the night to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cody says he'll probably watch some of the Olympics, but he'll
check news sources, including the Internet, to find the results of
events he's particularly interested in before they're on TV.
Viewers who don't want to know ahead of time will need to steer
clear of news reports during the day.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, though, it's a thrill to see the international
spectacle of the Olympics. Who wins or loses _ the thrill of
victory and the agony of defeat _ is only part of the story. The
human drama, the journey to the result, are equally compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the complaints have been louder this time around because
NBC is being up-front about the tape-delay issue, instead of using
those ``plausible'' and ``virtual live'' tags from the past.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not like this is the first time we've had taped
Olympics. The '96 Games in Atlanta were 60 percent tape-delayed and
turned out to be the most-watched Olympics ever. The '92 Games in
Barcelona were all tape, and the '94 Winter Games in Lillehammer,
with that spectacularly high-rated women's ice skating contest,
were on tape. Obviously people can stomach tape-delayed Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Ebersol, vice president of NBC Sports and executive
producer of the Olympics, has wrestled with time zone problems for
years and said in a recent teleconference that he thought briefly
about asking the Australians to change the times of the events. But
after less than a day Down Under, he changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 19 1/2 million people who live there, and they
deserve to come home, turn on the Olympics at the end of the day
and watch all of the key events in their prime time,'' Ebersol
said. ``We have to learn to get along, and we have to accept the
fact that we cannot walk into somebody's country and say, `This
would be more convenient for people in America to watch in the
evening, while they're having their chips and Cokes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   I'm pumped. We've been watching reruns for months, and this week
we get the Parade of Nations, followed later by platform diving,
profiles of obscure but fascinating jocks from Belarus and the
fastest men and women alive. When Michael Johnson slips on his gold
track shoes, I'll be there. And I won't have to set an alarm to do
it. So what if he's on tape? He's going for the gold.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Aunt Rob lived just around
the corner from the Parkers on Herschel Street. She was Granddaddy
Parker's sister, but as I recall, there wasn't a whole lot of
visiting back and forth. I don't ever remember seeing Aunt Rob at
Grandmother's table for Sunday dinner or sitting on the front porch
drinking tea and talking with visitors. I never knew if she'd been
married or had any children. Guess no one thought to mention it.

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _
Reporters can be a pain in the posterior. But describing them as
more particular parts of a posterior is going too far. So when
George W. Bush described a New York Times reporter last week as
``major league'' in a vividly uncomplimentary manner and a
microphone broadcast it to the world, it became a certified issue.
And editors had to decide how to impart this tastefully.. (Lane,

   Consumer Q&AMP;A
</P>
<P>
   By Jane Greigc. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: I am desperately, desperately in search of a
3- or 4-foot-tall Statue of Liberty (inflatable?) for a display. It
has to be somewhat affordable.
</P>
<P>
   _ C.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Is $390 somewhat affordable? That is the going rate for a
30.5-inch-high resin replica of this 151'1'' tall lady, who
celebrated her 100th birthday in 1986. Contact the small book shop
on the statue's pedestal at (212) 363-3180 for details. Short gig?
Dress up like the statue in a costume from Any Kind-A Costume, 2700
W. Anderson Lane, where a $30 rental fee gets you the torch, crown,
sash and dress. Q: How can the famous Olsen twins, Mary-Kate and
Ashley, be fraternal twins if they look exactly alike? How can they
not be identical twins? I am a triplet and one of my sisters looks
like me and the other doesn't. I have always thought that meant I
have an identical twin and a fraternal twin, but now I am not too
sure.
</P>
<P>
   _ K.O.
</P>
<P>
   A: Similar appearance is no guarantee that twins are identical _
only strong evidence, says University of Texas genetics lecturer
Nan Hampton. Triplets may be all single zygotes (three different
eggs fertilized by three different sperm), in which case no pair is
genetically identical. Triplets may also be a pair of identical
(monozygotic, a single egg fertilized by a single sperm split into
two embryos) twins with the other triplet being a single zygote.
</P>
<P>
   How to tell? Differences in traits such as blood groups and
plasma protein types indicate twins are not identical, reports
Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Famous triplet? Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, author and expert on
death and dying, was the first born in her set. And Texas' own Todd
triplets, Joseph, Michael and Daniel, played the sons of Katie and
Robbie Douglas on ``My Three Sons.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: On Trinity Broadcasting Network is a performer named Carman
(no last name). He is a singer, actor, dancer, Bible teacher and
very, very handsome. Could you please tell me how old he is, his
nationality, marital status and how tall he is? Oh yes, could you
give me his address?
</P>
<P>
   _ Donna B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Carman does have a last name _ Licciardello. Born in New
Jersey on Jan. 19, 1956, he is of Italian heritage. I could not get
his exact height from the folks at Carman Ministries, but they
estimate about 6 feet. Good news? Carman is not married, and
autographed photos are free. Write to him at Carman Ministries,
Inc., P.O. Box 5093, Brentwood, Tenn. 37024 or visit
www.carman.org. Q: I remember a cartoon that featured superheroes
like Strong Man, Rope Man, Baby Man, Tornado Man and Cuckoo Man.
Unfortunately, no one else does! Can you dig up any information on
these guys?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jason Kutac
</P>
<P>
   A: You are right. ``Mighty Heroes'' was a short lived
(1966-1967) half-hour series that replaced the popular, albeit
dated, ``Mighty Mouse Playhouse'' on Saturday morning. Directed by
Ralph Bakshi (``Lord of the Rings'') this CBS series had a lock on
odd characters. Diaper Man as a leader? For more on this wacky set
of villain chasers, pick up copy of Alex McNeil's ``Total
Television.'' Q: I've been trying to remember the old adage that
dictated the daily routines of our grandmothers and
great-grandmothers. Part of it goes like this: ``Wash on Monday;
iron on Tuesday; clean on Friday; bake on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   What did these busy women do on Wednesday and Thursday?
</P>
<P>
   _ Rosemary W.
</P>
<P>
   A: Close. Wash on Monday, iron on Tuesday, mend on Wednesday,
clean on Thursday, shop on Friday, cook on Saturday and rest on
Sunday.

   COKE-REPLAYTV _ Coca-Cola Co. has inked a deal to become one of
the first advertisers on ReplayTV, a fledgling service that lets
watchers record shows without videotape and alter the way they
watch live programs. Dubbed ``personal television,'' ReplayTV and
rivals such as TiVo could change the way people use the tube.
Digital video recorders pose challenges for advertisers, however,
because they can make it easier than ever to skip commercials.
Coke's deal could help the company find a way to splash its name in
front of ReplayTV viewers, including through sponsorship of
ReplayTV's high-visibility viewer menu. (Leith, Cox News Service).

dispute as to where doctors belong on the spectrum from defying

   COKE-REPLAYTV _ Coca-Cola Co. has inked a deal to become one of
the first advertisers on ReplayTV, a fledgling service that lets
watchers record shows without videotape and alter the way they
watch live programs. Dubbed ``personal television,'' ReplayTV and
rivals such as TiVo could change the way people use the tube.
Digital video recorders pose challenges for advertisers, however,
because they can make it easier than ever to skip commercials.
Coke's deal could help the company find a way to splash its name in
front of ReplayTV viewers, including through sponsorship of
ReplayTV's high-visibility viewer menu. (Leith, Cox News Service).

   END-DRDEATH _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Doctors are trained to prevent
death, not cooperate with it. The result is that they're at

the hospice concept. It's generally agreed that doctors need more
training in end-of life care, particularly the pain-relief and
psychological aspects, but aside from that, there is an honest
dispute as to where doctors belong on the spectrum from defying
death to embracing hospice care. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) 50

<P>
   The federal government lost what may be a key battle in the drug
war last week over doctor-recommended use of marijuana for medical
purposes. The federal government deserved to lose.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup for the
Northern District of California issued a permanent injunction
forbidding the government from threatening California doctors for
recommending medical marijuana to their patients (Dr. Marcus Conant
v. Barry R. McCaffrey).
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, the
Compassionate Use Act or Medical Marijuana Initiative. The law
states, in part, that ``seriously ill Californians have the right
to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes where that medical
use is deemed appropriate and has been recommended by a physician
who has determined that the person's health would benefit from the
use of marijuana in the treatment of cancer, anorexias, AIDS,
chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any
other illness for which marijuana provides relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 215 specifically protects physicians who recommend
marijuana: ``(No) physician in this state shall be punished, or
denied any right or privilege for having recommended marijuana to a
patient for medical purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Drug Czar Barry R. McCaffrey's claims to the contrary,
doctors across the nation have found that marijuana is a very
effective anti-nausea drug, stimulates appetite and takes the
cutting edge off cancer and other pain _ with few side effects.
</P>
<P>
   A mere two months after Proposition 215 was passed, the Office
of National Drug Control Policy issued the Clinton administration's
official response: ``a practitioner's action of recommending or
prescribing Schedule I controlled substances is not consistent with
the `public interest' and will lead to administrative action by the
Drug Enforcement Administration to revoke the practitioner's
registration.'' The response also stated that the U.S. Department
of Justice would review cases for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, like peyote and
heroin. Schedule I drugs do not have established medical value.
Therefore, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Justice
and McCaffrey began threatening to take away doctors' ability to
dispense medical drugs if those same doctors recommended medical
marijuana to their patients _ despite California's law.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is ample evidence that the Clinton administration
fashioned its punitive response after California and Arizona had
each passed medical marijuana initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after California's Proposition 215 took effect, a
DEA agent began investigating Robert Mastroianni, a physician in
Pollock Pines, because he had allegedly written a marijuana
recommendation for one of his patients. This action by the DEA
stopped most doctors from talking freely to their patients about
the use of medical marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors filed a class action lawsuit in a federal district
court against McCaffrey and federal government drug agencies. The
point of the doctors' original lawsuit is that drug agencies were
interfering in the doctor-patient relationship and keeping doctors
from giving patients their best medical advice. The lawsuit asked
for a temporary injunction against the government _ to halt the
unwarranted harassment of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors won that lawsuit on April 30, 1997, but the terms
laid out by U.S. District Court Judge Fern M. Smith weren't clear
enough to protect the doctors from further harassment.
</P>
<P>
   So the doctors went to court again and asked that the temporary
injunction be made permanent and urged the court to define the
terms of allowable communication more clearly. The doctors sought a
clear demarcation line that says a doctor can recommend medical
marijuana to a patient without being in jeopardy of retaliatory
action by the DEA.
</P>
<P>
   However, doctors cannot dispense or prescribe marijuana for the
patient without falling outside the law. The doctors did not seek
the authority to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The new ruling does just what the doctors hoped it would. It
permits California doctors to recommend the use of medical
marijuana and enter it on the patient's charts without worrying
about being penalized.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union's attorneys, representing
doctors and patients, crafted their brief carefully so that it
raised a First Amendment issue only. Can doctors speak freely to
their patients without drug agents interfering?
</P>
<P>
   Alsup analyzed the legislative history and language of the bill
that created the drug laws. He notes: ``Congress did not address
whether the government may revoke a physician's registration based
on the physician recommending a Schedule I drug to a patient. The
term `recommend' does not appear in Section 824 of the statute. The
legislative history is silent as to whether Congress intended that
such conduct could constitute a ground for revocation. As stated,
no case law addresses the point. No regulations have been issued.
All that exist are statements by the government, including the
administration's Response, giving its current view of the
statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress did not address the issue and the drug agencies
had not issued rules regarding doctor recommendations, the judge
decided that the First Amendment must take precedence. He wrote:
``The government itself would allow physicians to `discuss' the
pros and cons of marijuana therapy with their patients. In some
cases, however, it will be the professional opinion of doctors that
marijuana is the best therapy or at least should be tried. If such
recommendations could not be communicated, then the
physician-patient relationship would be seriously impaired.
Patients need to know their doctors' recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge also noted that a patient armed with such knowledge
may enter the public debate about the medical use of marijuana.
``In the marketplace of ideas, few questions are more deserving of
free-speech protection than whether regulations affecting health
and welfare are sound public policy. ... To hold that physicians
are barred from communicating to patients sincere medical judgments
would disable patients from understanding their own situations well
enough to participate in the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge permanently enjoined the government from revoking a
doctor's DEA registration ``merely because the doctor recommends
medical marijuana to a patient based on a sincere medical
judgment'' and prohibits the government from initiating any
investigation solely on those grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Will the government appeal? Gretchen Michael, press officer for
the U.S. Department of Justice, would not say. She said that she
can't discuss strategy of ongoing cases.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is narrowly written to protect the doctor-patient
relationship in regard to medical advice _ based upon the rights
guaranteed under the First Amendment. There seems little room to
overturn the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the eight states that have passed medical marijuana
laws fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon and
Washington. An appeal from the federal district court in northern
California would go directly to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals _ known to be a liberal court.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling from the federal appeals court that affirms the lower
court would force the government to toe the line in all those
states.
</P>
<P>
   One almost hopes that the Department of Justice decides to
appeal Judge Alsup's well-argued decision.

 By RICHARD ROEPER  
 c.2000 The Chicago Sun-Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``ROEPER!''
</P>
<P>
   It was my first week on the job at a warehouse in an industrial
park in the south suburbs. Financial need had necessitated a break
between my sophomore and junior years in college, and I was
thrilled when a buddy hooked me up with a full-time gig that paid
$6.50 an hour, plus overtime.
</P>
<P>
   My job was to roam the cavernous warehouse on foot or driving a
forklift, plucking various machine parts and supplies listed on an
order sheet, and then delivering the orders to area steel mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``HEY ROEPER,'' the boss yelled again. I ignored him.
</P>
<P>
   ``ROEPER!'' the boss screamed one more time, but I didn't turn
around until he amended it to: ``RICH!'' Then I hustled right over
and asked what I could do for him.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he wanted to know why I had ignored him three times.
I said that after far too many afternoons on football practice
fields with husky, embittered men grabbing my face mask and
screaming ``ROEPER!'' at me, I hated to be addressed by last name.
He looked at me like I was nuts but promised to keep that in mind.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen years later, I was walking through the Sun-Times
newsroom on my first day as a city reporter, and the editor had an
assignment for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir Richard of Dolton!'' he said in his erudite way. ``May I
present to you an assignment which I believe is perfectly tailored
to your muse?''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. What he really hollered out, of course, was:
``ROEPER!''
</P>
<P>
   Since then I've been addressed by last-name-only on dozens of
occasions, as I'm sure you have. Strangers on the street,
colleagues, a jock-type woman I briefly dated _ all have called me
``Roeper,'' sometimes with great affection, but I'm still not a fan
of that pseudo-tough guy greeting.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when it comes from somebody younger. I don't want to
be called ``Mr. Roeper'' because it makes me feel like either my
dad or Norman Fell on ``Three's Company,'' but even that is
preferable to a stand-alone ``Roeper.''
</P>
<P>
   So I can see why Bob Knight blanched last Thursday when a
19-year-old student at Indiana University said: ``Hey, what's up,
Knight?''
</P>
<P>
   Knight turns 60 next month. Some smirky dweeb a third his age
has no right calling him ``Knight.'' (I know I just called him
Knight. But that's the accepted journalistic style.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Knight isn't just any 60ish man; he's a famously
short-tempered bully who was on double-secret probation. Given his
situation, Knight should have ignored the smart aleck. He should
have kept walking, but he is a man without grace or restraint _ so
he grabbed the kid by the arm and scolded him. It was a lesson in
manners, Knight claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Ahem. Bob Knight has insulted women to their faces. He has made
a joke about rape. He has grabbed, choked, pushed and cursed at
players. He has thrown a chair across a basketball court, deposited
a human being in a trash can and has peppered reporters with
obscenities and verbal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   This man giving a lesson in manners makes about as much sense as
Eminem doing a private concert at a Barney Frank house party. The
kid who charges that Knight hurt him and cursed at him is the
stepson of a former talk show host who has ripped the coach over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence or conspiracy? Knight thought it was the latter, as
his press conference last Friday included a session at a blackboard
where Knight outlined the incident like Kevin Costner's Jim
Garrison ridiculing the magic bullet theory in ``JFK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to be an absolute moron, an absolute moron, with
the things that have been laid down on me, to grab a kid in public
and curse at a kid in public,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   Right. Because you've been such a restrained genius over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   According to CBS SportsLine, Indiana University President Myles
Brand contacted Knight on Sunday morning and asked Knight if he
wanted to recant anything from the press conference. When Knight
declined to do so, Brand fired him. If it hadn't happened this
time, it would have gone down after the next embarrassment. Or the
one after that.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Knight is not a moron. He's a smart man who
consistently makes the mistake of thinking he's smarter, and of
superior moral quality, than everyone else in the room, and that's
the sword he finally fell on. That chair didn't fly across the
court ``Bewitched'' style on its own; that guy didn't jump into the
trash can; his players haven't pushed their throats and jerseys
into Knight's hands.
</P>
<P>
   You can call him Bob, or you can call him Bobby, or you can call
him Mr. Knight or Coach Knight or ``Knight.'' He's a sad man by any
name, and he's the one who slayed his own legacy.

   JAPANESE-AMERICANS (San Francisco) _ Once called the
``unassimilable race,'' Japanese Americans are the very symbol of
assimilation _ upwardly mobile, marrying outside their ethnic group
at high rates and dispersing throughout suburban America. By ANNIE
NAKAO.

   DIABLOS (Kerrville, Texas) _ Gerardo Ureste, a firefighter from
Mexico, has been working here for $9.75 an hour, many more times
what he could earn in his village across the Rio Grande from Texas'
Big Bend National Park. He was among 23 Mexican villagers recruited
in 1990 and trained by the National Park Service to fight fires.
His squad, known as the Diablos, has since expanded to 43 members,
and with hundreds of U.S. blazes the Diablos have seen action this
year in Arizona and Colorado as well as Texas. By ZEKE MacCORMACK.

   FROG (San Francisco) _ The threatened red-legged frog, which is

Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,'' is on the verge of
getting extra protection from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

   BLUM-LAWSUIT (Los Angeles) _ Richard Blum, a wealthy financier
and husband of U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.), wants $20
million in punitive damages from a retired carpenter who accused
him on an Internet Web site of looting a union pension fund, for
which Blum is the investment adviser. In an unusual claim filed in
U.S. District Court, Blum contends he has been defamed by Horacio
Grana, a disabled retiree who draws a $570-per-month union pension.

   EAGLETS (San Francisco) _In the high sandstone desert of
northeastern Arizona, two Hopi men traveled to a sacred ancestral
spot last year in search of nests of golden eagle chicks to be
killed in Hopi rites. But National Park Service managers turned
they away, saying their permit to capture 40 golden eaglets in
three Arizona counties was invalid in national parks. Claiming a
loss of religious freedom, the Hopi tribe complained to Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt, and his department may resolve the issue
this fall. By JANE KAY.

   OLD-NAVY (San Francisco) _ When everyone wants to be in vests,
as many did last year, it looks great on Gap Inc.'s bottom line.
But when everyone doesn't, it can get ugly. In recent months, Gap's
sales have tumbled, and its stock has tumbled. Last month's sales
drop at Gap's Old Navy store was especially disturbing since the
chain has been Gap's main growth vehicle and is now responsible for
35 percent of the San Francisco-based retailer's sales of $11.6
billion last year. By VICTORIA COLLIVER.

   DOW-JONES-GAYS (San Francisco) _ Talk about an ironic sight: a
room packed with gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender
journalists, leaping to their feet to applaud an organization not
noted for its sexual radicalism _ Dow Jones &AMP; Co. The firm,
publisher of the conservative Wall Street Journal, will award
domestic partner benefits to its employees regardless of sexual
orientation, the newspaper's managing editor said in a speech to
the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association meeting last
weekend. By KEAY DAVIDSON.

Fox is re-issuing a special VHS version of the movie, as well as a
new DVD version. And RCA Records, which has sold 7 million
soundtrack albums, has put together a digitally remastered version,
including a two-CD ``collectors edition,'' with unreleased musical
material, including preludes and interludes. It's the musical that

   VIDEOS-FLY (San Francisco) _ Fox Home Entertainment has released
three extraordinary, double-feature DVDs for $35 each. These
selections are especially fitting for Halloween and include ``The
Fly,'' ``Return of the Fly'' and ``The Fly 2.'' They deal with a
scientist who, while working on teleportation experiments,
accidentally merges with one of the tiny insects on a molecular
level. The mishap leaves the man with a head of a fly, and the fly
with the head of a man. By BOB STEPHENS.

   OLY-OLYMPICS-MAGAZINE (San Francisco) _ The U.S. Olympic

``Olympics USA'' magazine sold by the publisher of the National
Enquirer, and filled with references to Olympic events, athletes

   OLY-SOCCER (San Francisco) _ Jerry Smith is used to being
introduced as ``Mr. Brandi Chastain,'' which doesn't bother him
because he knows his wife is not only a world-class soccer player
but also owns the world's most famous sports bra. Smith, however,
deserves a moment or two in the spotlight on his own, heading into
the 2000 Olympics. Two of his Santa Clara University women's soccer
players, Nikki Serlenga and Danielle Slaton, have joined Chastain,
an assistant coach with the Broncos, on the U.S. national team that
will play in Sydney. By DWIGHT CHAPIN.

It's a well-designed and inexpensive watering system. It costs
$23.95 postpaid from Lee Valley Tools Ltd., 12 E. River St.,
Ogdensburg, NY 13669.

 (ART ADV: Illustrations showing the Nissan Frontier pickup and the
Hyundai Santa Fe SUV available on Newscom or by calling William
Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.)
 By JIM DUNNE AND BEN STEWART 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   2001 NISSAN FRONTIER
</P>
<P>
   Little more than a year ago Nissan restyled its compact pickup
truck, Frontier. New styling, new cabin, and a new four-door cab
were among the highlights of the revamped 2000 model. With those
changes, the popularity of Frontier rose dramatically. Sales zoomed
50 percent. And to many, it seemed that Frontier's new styling was
set for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But the folks at Nissan weren't satisfied. They wanted more, and
in a hurry. So now we have a new Frontier for 2001, a four-door
pickup with a new, more aggressive appearance from the cowl forward
and a powerful supercharged V6 engine to back up that in-your-face
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   And it's the truck face that'll get your attention first,
starting with the assertive shape of the front end. Hood, fascia,
grille, fenders, headlamps and foglamps have all been changed. The
aggressive image is carried to the rear with the oversize lips on
the rear fenders and a new, more sculptured shape for the tailgate.
Not everything has changed, however. The cab and cargo box have
been taken directly from the 2000 model.
</P>
<P>
   For the less demanding drivers, Frontier offers a tame
143-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and a 3.3-liter
naturally aspirated V6 as lesser-cost choices. Four-wheel drive is
an extra-cost option with both V6s, but is not available with the
four-cylinder. And that's just the beginning of the mix-and-match
menu of the Frontier's order sheet. You have the choice of models,
base XE, upscale SE, the SC (supercharged) and the Desert Runner.
All are available with two- and four-wheel drive except the Desert
Runner, which is 2-wheel-drive only. Listed under cab choices are
Regular, King and four-door Crew Cab. The length of each affects
the length of the cargo box _ 56.3 inches with the Crew Cab, 77.4
inches with the Regular and 74.6 inches for the King Cab.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the 2001 models will be much in line with the '00
models, except for the supercharged option, which adds about an
extra $1500.
</P>
<P>
   2001 HYUNDAI SANTA FE
</P>
<P>
   What the market needs is another SUV. Well, maybe not, but
Hyundai and its dealers felt that they needed one. So the Korean
maker has jumped into the already crowded pool with its own
car-based compact sport utility, the Santa Fe. And to help it stand
out, the folks at Hyundai sent the Santa Fe into the world with its
own, distinctive styling.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Sonata midsize car platform, Hyundai's new Santa Fe
sport utility was designed in California, and is the Korean
manufacturer's first foray into SUVdom in this country. Besides its
rather unusual look, Santa Fe offers an optional V6. And, since it
is a Hyundai, it's priced in the low 20s _ fully optioned. There it
will compete with the smaller four-cylinder Honda CR-V and Toyota
RAV4, as well as the new Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute.
Dimensionally, the Santa Fe is closer to the Escape and Tribute
with a 103.1-inch wheelbase, an overall length of 177.2 inch and an
overall width of 71.7 inches.
</P>
<P>
   A 150-horsepower 2.4-liter DOHC four-cylinder engine powers the
base models with either a five-speed manual or four-speed
automatic. The optional 185-horsepower 2.7-liter dual overhead cam
aluminum V6 is coupled solely to Hyundai's Shiftronic four-speed
auto with manual override shifting. The Santa Fe is available with
either front- or all-wheel drive, the latter providing traction
through a viscous-coupled transfer case without low range.
</P>
<P>
   Though not the hot setup for serious boulder hopping, the 60/40
torque split of the all-wheel-drive system will get you down the
rutted dirt road or up to the ski lodge _ more agility than 99.9
percent of the populace needs. Opting for the front-wheel-drive V6
model not only saves some green and some 400 pounds of weight, but
also provides noticeably quicker acceleration, lighter-effort
steering and more nimble handling.
</P>
<P>
   Though car-based, the all-wheel-drive Santa Fe drives like a
real SUV. Command-style seating and a Weight Watchers-like
3700-pound bulk combined with the relatively slow and heavy
steering make drivers think they're in a truck. But the soft
independent MacPherson struts up front and multilink rear
suspension provide a close-to-carlike ride when the dirt is covered
with macadam.
</P>
<P>
   When pushed through corners, the Santa Fe remains fairly neutral
with the front tires losing adhesion before the suspension gets too
unsettled, resulting in predictable understeer. Aside from the
SUVesque seating and steering wheel position, the Santa Fe is as
comfy as many cars. This is especially true in the rear where a
raked seatback and plentiful legroom make the Santa Fe legitimate
transport for four sufficiently plump passengers. And all models
get a 60/40-split rear seat that, when folded, can hold 78 cubic
feet of mountain bikes, camping gear or plain old groceries. Santa
Fe offers standard air conditioning, power windows, CD player and
16-inch wheels. Rear disc brakes come on GLS and uplevel LX models.
Options include leather seating and four-wheel, four-channel
antilock braking system.

 (ART ADV: Illustrations showing a man installing an attic fan and

 By MERLE HENKENIUS 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You may not spend much time thinking about attic ventilation,
but if you own your own home, you owe it to yourself to give the
subject serious thought. Inadequate venting leads to high attic
temperatures that can reduce comfort, raise utility bills and
shorten the useful life of roofing materials. The good news is that
adding a few vents usually solves the problem. And for even greater
effectiveness, you might consider installing an attic fan, as well.
</P>
<P>
   These inexpensive fans are thermostatically controlled so they
run only when they're needed. When you consider that attics can
reach 150 degrees F, and that attic heat accounts for 20 percent of
the average cooling bill, these fans are a good investment. Most
can be installed for around $100. Attic-ventilation fans are also
available with humidistats as well as thermostats. A
humidistat-equipped fan is a good choice for controlling excess
attic humidity during the colder months.
</P>
<P>
   VENTILATION BASICS
</P>
<P>
   Before running out to buy an attic fan, take some time to check
the existing attic ventilation on your house. While the type and
number of vents will vary depending on the specific roof design,
house location and amount of direct sun, a minimum venting system
should have 1 square foot of roof vent area for every 300 square
feet of attic area.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to vents, more are better, and every vent mounted
high on a roof needs a counterpart on the lower roof, usually under
the eaves in the soffit. With this arrangement, hot air rising
through the upper vents will pull cooler air into the attic through
the soffit vents. Without soffit vents, it's like trying to cool
your home by opening the windows on only one side of your house.
</P>
<P>
   Common signs of an overly hot attic are asphalt shingles with
corners curled up, or bulges in the felt and shingles directly over
the seams in the sheathing. On cold winter days, look for frost
inside the attic. This frost is trapped moisture, which, if not
allowed to escape, can rot the entire roof.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, check your existing soffit vents to make sure
they're not clogged with debris. On hot days, the air movement
through these vents is strong enough to pull light seeds from trees
and bushes right into the vent screens. Clogged vents will need to
be cleared if your new fan is to work properly.
</P>
<P>
   CHOOSING YOUR FAN
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic attic fan designs: those made for roof
installations and those intended to be mounted in a gable wall.
Roof fans are mounted on plastic or sheetmetal bases that serve as
flashing. Simply cut an opening in the roof, typically near the
peak, and install the fan over the opening. Then shingle above and
around the flashing just as you would for a standard roof vent or
plumbing stack.
</P>
<P>
   In our case, we chose a gable-wall fan that was slightly easier
to install because we simply installed our fan in place of an
existing gable vent.
</P>
<P>
   We paid about $40 for our fan, plus about $30 for an automatic
shutter that remains closed against the weather until the fan blows
it open. You'll also need caulk, a few electrical items and a piece
of 1-by-2-inch plywood on which to mount the fan.
</P>
<P>
   INSTALLING THE SHUTTER
</P>
<P>
   If the existing gable vent is smaller than the diameter of the
fan, you'll need to remove the vent and install either a larger
vent or an automatic shutter. Begin by removing the screws or nails
that secure the old vent (Fig. 1), and lift it from its opening.
Center the front of the automatic shutter over the vent hole, make
sure the shutter's frame is level and trace around it with a pencil
(Fig. 2). This will give you the final position of the mounting
flange. To establish the edges of the new opening measure in 5/8
inch on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Our installation was simplified because our gable wall was
surfaced with Texture-111 plywood siding that provides a flat
surface on which to attach the shutter flange. If your wall has lap
siding, you will need to cut the siding around the perimeter of the
vent hole and install 1-by-3 or 1-by-4 boards around the hole to
act as a flat mounting surface on which you can secure the vent
flange.
</P>
<P>
   If you find the bottom of the old opening framed with 2-by-4
blocking, use a reciprocating saw to cut through the nails that
hold it in place, and set the blocking aside (Fig. 3). With all
obstructions cleared, use a sabre saw to enlarge the opening to its
new size (Fig. 4). Screw the automatic shutter over the opening
(Fig. 5) and seal the perimeter with an acrylic caulk. Finally,
nail the old blocking in place just below the bottom of the shutter
(Fig. 6).
</P>
<P>
   MOUNTING THE FAN
</P>
<P>
   The carton our fan came in had a circle cutout pattern that we
used to size the fan opening on a piece of plywood. Installing the
fan on a plywood mounting panel is a good idea because it keeps the
fan blades away from the wall and it enables you to center and
secure the assembly with little concern for the underlying framing.
</P>
<P>
   Cut a piece of plywood to a size that will accommodate the attic
framing that surrounds the vent hole. Cut the circle from the
carton and position the cardboard template on the plywood so the
finished hole will be centered over the vent hole when the plywood
is secured to the wall. Trace around the template with a pencil
(Fig. 7), and cut the hole with a sabre saw (Fig. 8). Place the fan
mounting bracket on the plywood, center the fan over the opening
and screw the bracket to the plywood (Fig. 9). We backed our screws
with washers to keep the heads from pulling through.
</P>
<P>
   The fan assembly needs to be oriented vertically, so look for
the Up/Down markings on one set of supports and mark the top of the
plywood mounting panel accordingly. Then, carry the fan and panel
assembly into the attic, position it behind the shutter and nail it
to the gable framing.
</P>
<P>
   WIRING YOUR FAN
</P>
<P>
   How you wire your attic fan will depend on local codes and
whether you can find an attic circuit with enough reserve capacity
to handle the 3.2-amp fan motor.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find plenty of reserve capacity in a nearby
existing circuit, you will need to go back to the service panel and
create a new 15-amp circuit dedicated to the fan and perhaps a few
new attic lights. Your installation will need to meet prevailing
electrical codes and will have to be inspected by a codes official.
If you have any doubt about your ability to do the wiring, install
the fan yourself and hire a professional to complete the electrical
work.
</P>
<P>
   To determine if an accessible circuit has reserve capacity, shut
off its breaker and count the number of light and receptacle boxes
that are on this circuit. Assign each a value of 1.5 amps and add
up the total. A 15-amp circuit can serve 10 boxes and a 20-amp
circuit, 13. If you find a circuit with 4 or 5 amps to spare,
you're in luck. If not, go back to the service panel and fish 14-2
grounded cable into the attic. In our case, we were able to tap a
nearby 15-amp circuit that powered pull-chain lights in our attic.
As always, make sure the power is off before working on any wiring.
</P>
<P>
   The fan's thermostat is already mounted in a box that is
attached to the fan by a flexible conduit. Screw this box to the
plywood so it is in the direct path of the airflow (Fig. 10). Then,
go to the nearest circuit box _ in our case, a pull-chain fixture.
Disconnect the fixture and set it aside for now (Fig. 11).
</P>
<P>
   Next, bore holes in the rafters between the gable wall and the
open fixture box (Fig. 12). Use a 5/8-inch bit and drill only the
center of the board. Pull 14-2 grounded cable through the holes
between the two boxes and staple the new cable to the rafter within
8 inches of the ceiling fixture box. Do the same with the cable
near the thermostat box (Fig. 13).
</P>
<P>
   Bring the cable through one of the studs supporting the fan and
strip about 8 inches of insulation from the end. Attach a box
connector to the cable and feed the wires into the thermostat box
(Fig. 14). Tighten a fastening nut onto the box connector and
connect the bare ground wire to the green terminal in the box.
Then, connect the white circuit wire to the white fixture lead and
the black circuit wire to the black fixture lead with twist
connectors (Fig. 15). Replace the box cover and set the thermostat
to start the fan at about 105 degrees F (Fig. 16).
</P>
<P>
   To finish the wiring, return to the open fixture box and attach
two 8-inch lead wires to the pull-chain fixture. Connect a black
lead to the brass terminal screw and a white wire to the silver
terminal. Then, join like-colored wires in twist connectors (Fig.
17) and mount the fixture on the box.

   ROCKET RECOVERY SUBMERSIBLE
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the risky task of recovering a space shuttle
booster from the Atlantic Ocean has been done with the aid of a
mini-submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the job is done by divers, who must insert a car-size
plug into the spent rockets that parachute into the Atlantic about
140 miles off the Florida coast, after every launch. They are
brought to shore, refurbished and reused.
</P>
<P>
   The DeepWorker 2000, built by Nuytco Research of North
Vancouver, British Columbia, fits the plug in half the time, and
reduces risk to divers. NASA will conduct more tests before using
the sub on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   PLASMA SATELLITE THRUSTERS
</P>
<P>
   France will equip the Stentor satellite it launches in 2001 with
four plasma engines.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny engines, which make orbital corrections, use
electricity to create jets of plasma, making them lighter than
chemical rockets. Two engines will be made by Fakel, a Russian
company, two by Snecma of France.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this launch, more companies will start to use plasma
engines to reduce mass and lengthen satellite lifetimes,'' predicts
a Snecma spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRICITY FROM OLIVES
</P>
<P>
   Electric power companies in Spain are dipping into olive oil for
fuel. A plant in the southern city of Benameji is burning crushed
olive pulp and skins to produce 12 megawatts of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the world's olive oil comes from Spain. With that
comes the sticky problem of getting rid of more than 5 million tons
of waste. For centuries, Spanish farmers have been burning dried
olive pulp to warm their houses. By using the same principle on an
industrial scale, engineers have found a way to turn the
environmental concern posed by agricultural waste into a relatively
cheap fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year project has been so successful that Spain's
biggest utility company is now ready to begin construction on two
16-megawatt plants. Spain's annual olive harvest could fuel eight
plants.
</P>
<P>
   FOAM SEALS CHERNOBYL RADIATION
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years, Chernobyl Unit 4, the site of the world's worst
nuclear accident, continues to stress the ability of cleanup crews.
One difficulty is stabilizing odd-shaped debris piles in
hard-to-reach areas. A recent successful test should make this task
easier. Workers applied a radiation-resistant material known as
Ekor over a fuel-containing mass that had collected underneath the
reactor.
</P>
<P>
   The foam is said to withstand intense radiation fields, without
loss of its physical properties. It differs from most other
containment coatings in that it does not itself become radioactive,
says its supplier, Eurotech of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that Ekor will provide the first practical
solution for safe, long-term containment of radioactive waste and
debris, not just at Chernobyl, but at nuclear facilities around the
world,'' says Eurotech president Don Hahnfeldt.
</P>
<P>
   SELF-FABRICATING SPACE MIRROR
</P>
<P>
   Glass won't cut it when it comes to making mirrors for future
space telescopes. Glass is heavy and grinding it costs too much
money.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque,
N.M., and the University of Kentucky say the solution could be to
switch to smart materials.
</P>
<P>
   Made of thin, lightweight films of piezoelectric material, their
shape changes in response to the flow of electric current. Mirrors
would fold for flight, unraveling in space, then be smoothed out
with electron guns built into the telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Smart mirrors could be standard on space telescopes by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   A CEILING WORTH LOOKING AT
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to spend hours flat on your back to decorate the
ceiling. The marriage of computers and plastic has created a new
way to pretty up cracked or stained ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Send a photo or drawing to the Newmat Web site (www.
cattoire-rp.fr). In two weeks, the company will ship you an
enlarged image printed on a PVC sheet. Corner fittings stretch the
material, forming a ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ULTRASOUND HELPS BRAIN DRUGS
</P>
<P>
   Precisely placed bursts of ultrasound could make it possible for
drugs to cross the protective barricade that obstructs the passage
of material between blood and brain tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The blood-brain barrier consists of specialized cells that line
the capillaries within the brain. At a recent meeting of the
Acoustical Society of America held in Atlanta, University of
Washington researchers described a hairnet covered with transducers
that would apply high-frequency sound to any portion of the brain.
According to lead researcher Pierre Mouran, the sound disrupts the
barrier, allowing drugs to pass.
</P>
<P>
   While the idea needs further development, it may lay the
groundwork for at last providing a safe and effective way to
deliver medicine to the brain.

THE ARROGANCE OF POWER: THE SECRET WORLD OF RICHARD NIXON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;    (ATTENTION EDITORS: ``The Arrogance of Power: The Secret World
of Richard Nixon,'' written by former BBC journalist Anthony
Summers with Robbyn Swan, is an exhaustive investigation of the
life and career of the 37th president of the United States. In
researching the book, Summers conducted more than a thousand
inteviews and drew on hundreds of thousands of documents. The New
York Times Syndicate is pleased to offer three 1,000-word excerpts
from the biography. NIXON-BIOGRAPHY-EXCERPT1 examines Nixon's
alleged abuse of his wife, Pat. NIXON-BIOGRAPHY-EXCERPT2 deals with
how Nixon's obsession with the office and trappings of the
presidency led him to behave ``like Napoleon,'' as one longtime
associate recalled. NIXON-BIOGRAPHY-EXCERPT3 recounts Nixon's use
of the prescription drug Dilantin and personal behavior so erratic
that it worried those in charge of national security.)

 &HT;    ``The Arrogance of Power: The Secret World of Richard Nixon''
 &HT;    By ANTHONY SUMMERS with ROBBYN SWAN 
 &HT;    (North American rights only) 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Anthony Summers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (In his book Mr. Summers describes a troubled relationship
between Pat and Richard Nixon, punctuated by accounts of abuse, on
occasion allegedly physical.)
</P>
<P>
   Evlyn Dorn, Nixon's longtime secretary, saw her boss reach out
to touch his wife's hand only once _ and then merely to steady her
as they stood in the back of a car. ``He had a way of ignoring
her,'' she said. ``I never saw him touch Pat's hand,'' recalled Tom
Dixon, a broadcaster who acted as an aide during elections in the
late forties. ``I have never seen quite so cold an arrangement.''
...
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never, ever, ever, ever any sign of affection
whatsoever,'' recalled Kandy Stroud, who specialized in covering
Pat for Women's Wear Daily. ``I rode in the limousine with them,
the first time I was alone with them together. He did all the
talking, she did none. She just sat there ... like a staff member
... the entire ride and he didn't refer to her, or defer to her.''
...
</P>
<P>
   The damage from Richard Nixon's loss in the 1960 presidential
election went beyond politics. In 1961, journalists in search of a
``human interest story'' got more than they bargained for. On the
day the moving van was being loaded for the family's return to
California, Pat suddenly came rushing out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   She was ``screaming like a banshee,'' recalled Washington Daily
News reporter Tom Kelly, ``completely out of control. Her hair was
disheveled, her face red, and her eyes were wild.'' Kelly and an
Associated Press colleague quickly discovered that it was they who
were the targets of Pat's rage. She stood cursing them, claiming
that a hostile press had caused her husband's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   This was a Pat the public had never seen, a Pat embittered by
the experience of the previous year. ``I've given up everything I
loved,'' she had said even before the campaign, referring to the
loss of privacy and family time. Other intimates noted that much of
Pat's rage was directed against her husband, the husband who had
ignored her appeals to quit politics. ...
</P>
<P>
   There are varying versions of her reactions during dinner at a
restaurant in late September 1961, the night Nixon publicly
announced he would run for California governor. Future cabinet
member Bob Finch's wife, Carol, recalled Pat's saying suddenly,
``I'm trapped. Which way can I go?'' ...
</P>
<P>
   But in public Pat acted out her role, telling reporters, ``Our
hearts are in politics and we are glad to be back in the thick of
it.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Watching as she went through the motions, the Los Angeles
Times's Richard Bergholz thought her ``just a stick of furniture
sitting there ... she was obviously on edge. He abused her
perpetually.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Word spread about an ugly moment during a plane trip from San
Francisco (during the 1962 California governor's race, which he
lost to Pat Brown by 297,000). Pat, sitting apart from her husband
while he talked with others, had asked if she might join them for a
drink. The answer, reportedly was a snarled, ``Keep you f---ing
mouth shut.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   In the blur of Nixon's defeat, when he was drunk in his suite at
the Beverly Hilton, aides were preoccupied with preventing him
going downstairs. Pat reportedly sat alone, sobbing quietly in an
adjoining room. ...
</P>
<P>
   Future cabinet member Bob Finch, Nixon's intimate for many
years, once admitted cautiously that he had sometimes witnessed
Nixon in a rage, a rage ``irrational in that it was much broader
than the incident that provided it.'' Speechwriter William Safire
would write of Nixon's capacity of ``deep, dark rage.'' Pat had a
temper too. ...
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that that Nixon had physically abused Pat circulated in
Washington for years. Two investigative reporters stumbled on such
stories, but none were at the time well enough sourced to publish.
While writing ``The Final Days'' with Carl Bernstein, their account
of the end of the Nixon presidency, Bob Woodward was told of an
incident in which Nixon supposedly hurt his wife badly enough to
put her in the hospital. Seymour Hersh, while working on his study
of Henry Kissinger, ``The Price of Power,'' was told by sources of
three alleged wife-beating incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after resigning the presidency, Hersh was told, Nixon
attacked Pat at their home in San Clemente. According to the
source, she had to be taken to a nearby emergency room. The doctor
who treated her corroborated the story. The most compelling account
of such abuse, however, relates to the 1962 defeat and comes from
several sources. Governor Pat Brown said years later, ``We got word
at one stage of the campaign that he kicked the hell out of her,
hit her.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Los Angeles area reporter, Bill Van Petten, years later
told a friend, the writer Jon Ewing, of his experiences while
covering the gubernatorial campaign. Nixon, he said, had been a
``terrible, belligerent drunk, mean when drunk, and would become
obnoxious at night when in hotels on the road.''...
</P>
<P>
   (After the defeat) Nixon ``beat Pat badly ... so badly that she
could not go out the next day. ``This had happened before,'' Van
Petten was told, ``and aides like Haldeman, Robert Finch, or
Ehrlichman would on occasion have to go in and intervene. On this
particular night there was a lot of commotion at an ungodly hour,
and one or some of the aides had to run in and pull him off Pat.
She had bruises on her face. Everyone was shaken up.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   First credible corroboration of the 1962 beating allegation was
provided during the writing of this book by John Sears, a former
Nixon aide who went on to political distinction. ... He was to be a
key figure in the Nixon comeback in 1968 and would join the Nixon
White House as a political strategist under Ehrlichman.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he met the couple, Sears recalled in a 1997
interview, the marriage seemed to him ``peculiar.'' ... Then Sears
related what he had learned of Nixon's physical abuse. ``The family
lawyer told me that Nixon had hit her in 1962 and that she had
threatened to leave him over it. ... I'm not talking about a smack.
He blackened her eye. ... I had heard about that from Pat Hillings
(a longtime Nixon friend and associate) as well ...'' Sears
identified the ``lawyer'' as the late Waller Taylor, who in 1962
had been a senior partner at Adams, Duque and Hazeltine, the firm
Nixon had joined after his defeat by John F. Kennedy. ... According
to Taylor, divorce was discussed at this time. ...
</P>
<P>
   In her memoir of her mother, Julie Nixon recalled how the day
after the 1962 election ended, ``Mother lay on her bed, the room
darkened by closed shutters, and cried in front of us for the first
time we could remember. Tricia and I sat on the floor by the bed
and cried also.'' That evening close family friends took both the
Nixon daughters away to their home for a few days. ``When we
returned,'' said Julie, ``my parents seemed fine.'' But ``There was
a sadness,'' as Tricia told Nixon himself later when he asked for
her teen-age memories of the 1962 race, ``and the sadness went on
for years.''

   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (This excerpt describes how winning the presidency changed
Richard Nixon. As former Republican Party chairman Len Hall put it,
Nixon became ``regal, kinglike. ... He loved power, power to sit in
the Oval Office and just issue orders. ...'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you dare call me Dick. I am the president of the United
States. When you speak to me you call me Mr. President.'' So
commanded Nixon, early in the presidency, at a meeting with Florida
banker Hoke Maroon, a man he had known for years. ``He was as
obsessed with the office as any president has ever been,'' his old
friend Bob Finch ruefully recalled. ``He gloried in it, night and
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The outward signs were quickly obvious. Before the Nixons moved
into the White House, the message they had conveyed to the public
was that it did not need refurbishing. That soon changed, however,
and a massive remodeling program, costing millions, began.
</P>
<P>
   Military planes were dispatched to Italy to bring back green
watered silk for just one medium-size room. An ornate four-poster
bed for Nixon cost six thousand dollars, its draperies ten
thousand. The next presidential couple to occupy the White House,
the Fords, thought it unbelievable, ``something Marie Antoinette
would have slept in,'' and promptly had it removed.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Lyndon Johnson had maintained three Boeing passenger
jets, Nixon had three Boeings, eleven Lockheed Jetstars, and
sixteen helicopters at his exclusive disposal. The existing Air
Force One was refurbished at a cost of $800,000, with the emphasis
on the First Family's accommodation. Later, when a new plane was
delivered _ with a layout the Nixons did not like _ another
$750,000 went toward the alterations.
</P>
<P>
   The fleet was not used solely for government business. Nixon's
extended family, including in-laws, availed themselves of the
planes. When a troubled official reported that senior aides were
taking Air Force One on transcontinental flights to and from
vacations, Nixon signed off on them. An Air Force Jetstar was once
used to ferry a package from Florida to Camp David for senior
aides, at a cost of five thousand dollars in fuel alone. Its
contents: ten pounds of crabs from Joe's Stone Crabs in Miami
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the Camp David retreat were not sufficient
for Nixon. He bought houses on Key Biscayne _ the complex that came
to be known as the Florida White House _ and at San Clemente, the
fourteen-room house and estate in California styled the Western
White House. Nixon himself purchased the properties, with a massive
financial assist from Bebe Rebozo and aerosol tycoon Robert
Abplanalp. The government, however, was to spend more than ten
million dollars _ more than forty-four million dollars at today's
values _ to install special features not only at Nixon's
out-of-town homes but also at houses he frequented, like
Abplanalp's in the Bahamas. ...
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had nine offices for his personal use: the Oval Office, a
hideaway in the Executive Office Building, a room in his private
quarters, two at Camp David, one at the Key Biscayne house, another
at Abplanalp's Caribbean home, and two at San Clemente. All
required sophisticated communications systems, installed at public
expense. A former Budget Bureau official would calculate that, by
four years into the presidency, Nixon's household expenses had
added up to a hundred million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon spent more than one in three nights away from the White
House in the first eighteen months of his term. While the days of
absence included foreign trips, there were also forty-two trips to
Camp David, fourteen to Key Biscayne, and nine to San Clemente. The
California stays tended to last two or three weeks. ...
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's assistant Alexander Butterfield was struck by the fact
that his boss ``had so much leisure time. There were many days with
no appointments at all. Every now and then he would work like a
Trojan. ... But generally he allowed plenty of time to sit and kick
things around. ... And every afternoon Nixon took a nap.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Early in his travels as president, Nixon was greeted in Brussels
by royal guards in operatically grand uniforms. In India he was
escorted by outriders in British Empire-vintage scarlet coats. One
of these trips reportedly inspired the outfitting of the White
House police in similarly outlandish uniforms. The new outfits,
high-necked white tunics with gold epaulets, first appeared on
public view a year after the inauguration. They were topped by tall
military caps with blue and gold visors, reportedly paid for by
Nixon himself.
</P>
<P>
   After early critics noted how plump the uniforms made their
wearers look, the policemen were ordered to diet. Then, following a
national chorus of ridicule, the regalia was withdrawn altogether.
The tunics were eventually sold off to high school bands in Iowa,
and the caps reappeared at an Alice Cooper rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President,'' H.R. Haldeman said by way of explaining the
uniforms, had ``wanted something more formal.'' Peter Flanigan,
Nixon's political adviser, thought the livery an attempt to emulate
the ``grandeur'' his boss admired in Charles de Gaulle. ... Defense
Secretary James Schlesinger, who agreed that Nixon tried to imitate
de Gaulle, suggested dryly in a 1997 interview that therein lay the
difference: Nixon was ``a shrewd, calculating figure, but no giant.
He would have liked to have been more giant than he was. He was not
an imposing figure like de Gaulle.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The official roster of Britain's nobility, Burke's Peerage,
pronounced Nixon one of thirteen U.S. presidents able to claim
royal ancestry. The grocer's son from Whittier was supposedly a
direct descendant of King Edward III (d. 1377) and thus distantly
related to Queen Elizabeth II and Sir Winston Churchill. While
thousands of people can claim similar bloodlines, one should
perhaps not assume this was totally irrelevant to Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often felt that inwardly the president secretly wanted to be
considered an English lord,'' said his close associate Herb Klein,
``someone who, like Jack Kennedy, would be praised for upgrading
the social dignity of the White House. ... he longed for this elite
social distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon himself denied such notions. ``The Imperial President,''
he wrote, was a straw man created by defensive congressmen and by
disillusioned liberals. ...'' One such critic was future Speaker
Tip O'Neill. ``After he became President,'' O'Neill recalled,
``Nixon seemed to change. He no longer played cards with our group,
and I doubt he played with anybody. Unlike Truman, Kennedy and
Johnson, Nixon didn't pal around much with his old friends ... he
became aloof and imperial.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Republican stalwarts had similar thoughts. ``I could
not detect a touch of humility in his demeanor or in his facial
expression,'' Federal Reserve chairman Arthur Burns said of the
inauguration. ``That troubled me very much. That, combined with his
attitude when he took me through the White House and talked about
its splendor.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   He behaved ``like Napoleon,'' said the San Diego entrepreneur
Arnholt Smith, who had known Nixon since childhood. ``I mean, he
was very imperious, gave you a feeling you were almost traveling
with God.'' Former Republican Party chairman Len Hall thought Nixon
became ``regal, kinglike. ... He loved power, power to sit in that
Oval Office and just issue orders. ...''

 &HT;    c. 2000 Anthony Summers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Mr. Summers describes how, in 1968, the founder of the Dreyfus
Fund gave Richard Nixon a large quantity of the prescription drug
Dilantin, which Nixon began taking without a doctor's supervision.
In 1974, as his presidency deteriorated, Mr. Summers recounts how
Nixon's aides and advisers took steps to ensure that an
increasingly erratic president didn't compromise national
security.)
</P>
<P>
   It became clear during research for this book (that) Nixon
consumed large quantities of one particular drug over a long
period, apparently without a prescription or proper medical
supervision. The drug was Dilantin, the brand name of an
anti-epileptic medication known to pharmacologists as Phenytoin,
and the circumstances in which Nixon came to start taking it were
alarmingly casual. He heard about the drug, probably soon after
being elected president, while dining at Key Biscayne with Bebe
Rebozo and the millionaire founder of the Dreyfus Fund, Jack
Dreyfus, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus, who had contributed to the Nixon campaigns in both 1960
and 1968, had no medical qualifications. Having credited Dilantin
with relieving him of chronic depression almost overnight, he had
become the leading advocate of it as a panacea for all manner of
ailments. ...
</P>
<P>
   At their 1968 meeting in Key Biscayne, as Dreyfus told the
author, ``Nixon said, 'Why don't you give me some Dilantin?' So I
thought, 'What the heck, he's (going to be) president of the United
States. I can't get in trouble. ...' So I went out to the car and
got a bottle of a thousand and gave it to him. A few days later he
called me and said, 'Is it all right if I take two a day?' I said,
'Yes, I think so.' Later on when I went to see him at the White
House, he asked me if he could have some more. I gave him another
large bottle ....''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Nixon wanted the Dilantin for, Dreyfus was vague.
Nixon, he said, had ``a lot of things ... worries.'' At one point,
when Dreyfus suggested that the president should perhaps get the
medication from a doctor, Nixon had said, 'To heck with the
doctor.''' ... The ``Physicians' Desk Reference,'' used by doctors
nationwide, lists numerous known adverse reactions to Dilantin.
They include ``slurred speech, decreased coordination, and mental
confusion, dizziness, insomnia, transient nervousness ...'' Dr.
Lawrence McDonald, a Washington physician consulted by the author,
was alarmed at the notion of anyone's _ especially a person in a
position of high responsibility _ using Dilantin in uncontrolled
doses or combined with other medications or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``If such a user of the drug were the president of the United
States,'' Dr. McDonald said, ``I would be very nervous. Mental
confusion is not something you want in a leader. Dilantin certainly
could impair someone of that caliber from making correct and timely
and appropriate judgments. It's a potential time bomb, waiting to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon did use alcohol and did use sleeping pills. His longtime
speechwriter Ray Price recalled how even a single drink could make
him appear drunk ``if he had a sleeping pill.'' As if the drinking,
the sleeping pills, and the Dilantin were not troubling enough,
Rabbi Baruch Korff _ a Nixon apologist late in the presidency _
said he learned that ``at times he resorted to amphetamines.''
Amphetamines, of course, are stimulants, the opposite of the
relaxing medications mentioned by other associates. ...
</P>
<P>
   The uncertain days of August 1974 sparked unprecedented
precautions, the logical outcome of months of anxiety about the
president's mental stability. ... A group of legislators, headed by
Jacob Javits, the Republican senator from New York, even consulted
the director of the National Institute of Mental Health, Dr.
Bertram Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had breakfast with a half dozen senators,'' Brown recalled.
``It was to talk about these issues, whether he would lose his
cool. ... Whether he was going crazy, becoming psychotic, whether
he would start a war.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of defense, James Schlesinger ... was already
alert to such fears. His attention had been drawn to the
president's state of mind by a phone call a few months earlier from
Joseph Laitin, the public affairs spokesman of the Office of
Management and Budget, based in the Executive Office Building, just
across from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the author Laitin vividly recalled the
encounter with Nixon in the spring of 1974 that prompted him to
phone Schlesinger. ``I was on my way over to the West Wing of the
White House to see Treasury Secretary George Shultz,'' Laitin said.
``I'd reached the basement, near the Situation Room. And just as I
was about to ascend the stairway, a guy came running down the
stairs two steps at a time. He had a frantic look on his face,
wildeyed, like a madman. And he bowled me over, so I kind of lost
my balance. And before I could pick myself up, six athletic-looking
young men leapt over me, pursuing him. I suddenly realized that
they were Secret Service agents, that I'd been knocked over by the
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Laitin was so shocked at Nixon's appearance that he postponed
the meeting with Shultz and returned to his office. ``I sat there
stunned,'' he said, ``and I thought, you know, 'That madman I have
just seen has his finger on the red button.' I had a number for
Schlesinger, a phone that only he would answer. I called him, and I
asked him if the president could order the use of atomic weapons
without going through the secretary of defense. I said, 'If I were
in your position, I would want to know who the nearest combat-ready
troops were who would respond to the president's wishes to surround
the White House. I would want to know what the next nearest
combat-ready division was, which would not only be able to overcome
them but also respond only to the chain of command. That's what I
have to say.' Then there was just a click at the other end, as the
secretary of defense hung up.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Given his own access to the president, Schlesinger also had the
benefit of his own observations. He was also aware of concern that
the White House might attempt to use the military to prevent the
president from being forced from office. ... In late July, he asked
for a meeting with the chairman of the joint Chiefs, Air Force
General George Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him,'' the former secretary recalled in an interview
with the author, ``that every order that would come from the White
House had to come to me directly, immediately upon receipt. ... The
message had to be gotten through that there were not to be any
extraordinary measures taken. The message did get through.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   A former army operations intelligence specialist, Barry Toll,
told a Senate committee in closed session: ``The last week or so of
the Nixon administration we received a top secret 'eyes only,'
limited distribution order effectively instructing us not to obey
the president _ on anything, not just nuclear, until further
notice. ... It was signed, at the Joint Chiefs' insistence, as I
understood it, by not one but two cabinet officers. The names I
recall as having signed were Secretary Schlesinger and Secretary
Kissinger.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of the Nixon presidency was an extraordinary episode
in American history,'' former Secretary Schlesinger said in 2000.
``I am proud of my role in protecting the integrity of the chain of
command. You could say it was synonymous with protecting the
Constitution.''

TEXAS' MISS ON MEDICAID SCRUTINIZED &HT;    By CLAY ROBISON
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ As the presidential campaigns continue to fight over
Texas' record of providing health care to the poor, Democrats and
health-care advocates here say Gov. George W. Bush missed a chance
in the mid-1990s to expand medical coverage to more than a half
million low-income children.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration blames the failure on the federal
government and, by implication, Bush's Democratic opponent, Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But a Democratic legislator and several health-care advocates
and government-policy experts said foot-dragging by the governor's
office was at least partly responsible for the state's failure to
broaden its Medicaid program a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The critics include both Democrats and Republicans, but, mindful
of Bush's power either as the next president or as a governor with
two more years in office, most didn't want to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the debate is a health-care initiative drafted
by the Legislature in 1995 that failed to win federal approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Bush's office) did everything they could to keep it
from getting approved in the manner in which the Legislature had
envisioned,'' said a member of then-Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock's staff
who did not want to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, a Democrat who died last year, had endorsed Bush for
president and helped him push some of his own measures through the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Medicaid study ordered by Bullock in 1994, several
months before Bush was elected, that led to the health-care
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics also question the Bush administration's belated
decision in the federal approval process to change the state's
original plan and remove adults from the proposed coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal could have made as many as 570,000 poor Texas
children eligible for health coverage two or three years earlier
than the new children's health-insurance program, or CHIP, which
started enrolling applicants in the spring. CHIP was established by
the Legislature in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Left uncovered by Medicaid, children of lower-income parents
often don't get preventive or routine medical care. The result is
that they may not see a doctor until they are seriously ill and
taken to an emergency room _ care that ultimately costs more in tax
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature's 1995 proposal also would have offered Medicaid
coverage, including prescription drugs, to 255,000 of the state's
poorest adults. Then and now, relatively few adults are eligible
for Medicaid coverage in Texas. Those who are covered are mainly
welfare recipients or are elderly, blind or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, as authorized by the Legislature and submitted by
Bush to the federal Health Care Financing Administration in August
1995, was a request for a waiver changing eligibility requirements
for Medicaid. It would have eased income requirements to make
Medicaid more widely available.
</P>
<P>
   For most age groups, the previous income cutoff was much lower
then than it is now. The original waiver proposal would have
expanded Medicaid coverage to all children from families with
incomes as high as 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or
$20,748 a year for a family of four in 1995. The adult portion of
the proposal would have covered individuals earning $3,360 a year
or less.
</P>
<P>
   The HCFA never rejected the waiver outright. But Texas let its
application die two years later after the federal agency demanded
that Texas provide two sources of health-care providers for new
Medicaid recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Texas proposed only one provider network through county hospital
districts. The districts also would have provided the state's share
of matching funds through their local tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McKinney, a Bush appointee who then was Texas' health and
human services commissioner, said Texas didn't add private
insurance companies and HMOs as a second provider network because
the hospital districts opposed that alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital districts feared that private HMOs would have taken
the less expensive cases to treat and left local taxpayers holding
the bag for the most costly Medicaid care, other sources said.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney, a physician and former state legislator who now is
president of a managed-care company based in Indianapolis, said
Bush aggressively tried to get the waiver approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great deal for Texas,'' McKinney said. ``He was on
this program big-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards blamed the federal government for
the failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government's insistence to dictate from Washington
with bureaucrats and mandates instead of letting Texas decide how
best to expand health-care coverage resulted in the people going
without health-care coverage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But state Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, who co-sponsored the
1995 law authorizing the waiver proposal, said the Bush
administration didn't try hard enough to negotiate a compromise
with federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want something, you push. If not, you let it
passively go away. They (the Bush administration) didn't push,''
said Coleman, who criticized Bush's budgetary priorities earlier
this summer and has assisted the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Another person involved in the waiver process, who didn't want
to be identified, added, ``It was foot-dragging and no concerted
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   A lobbyist with a Republican background who also was familiar
with the waiver application said that if there was foot-dragging,
some legislators were to blame as well. He said that negotiations
with the federal government were affected by a reluctance by the
governor's office and a number of lawmakers to do anything that
could be perceived as expanding welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, 1995 was the `Contract with America' era, when
welfare reform was a big issue,'' he said, asking not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   The same source said Coleman and other legislative sponsors, not
Bush, were the driving force behind the waiver application. ``The
governor was not involved in the details of the legislation that
HCFA objected to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The HCFA first responded to Texas' initial waiver request in
early November 1995, about two months after the waiver application
was filed.

<P>
   In a letter to McKinney, the HCFA said it had several
``significant'' concerns, including whether the county hospitals'
role as health-care providers would constitute a conflict of
interest because they also would monitor the treatment plans and
set payment rates.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 18, 1995, the HCFA sent a follow-up letter to McKinney,
listing 18 pages of detailed questions for the state to answer
about the proposed Medicaid expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Records indicate the state never answered those questions, at
least not in writing. But almost a year later, Texas submitted a
revised waiver application that removed adults from the expanded
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The state later answered another detailed set of questions from
the HCFA about the revised waiver request. But Texas officials
never satisfactorily addressed the federal agency's requirement
that a second system of providers be established.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said primary-care physicians, outside of an HMO, could
have been recruited by the state to screen the health-care needs of
new Medicaid recipients. He said that arrangement, which already is
used for some Medicaid cases, may have met the HCFA's requirement
for a system of providers outside hospital districts.
</P>
<P>
   But McKinney said that alternative would have been too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman and others who were either directly involved in
negotiations over the waiver or closely monitored them said they
were surprised when the Bush administration removed adults from the
waiver application.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just sort of pulled the rug out from everybody when the
governor came up and said, `We're just doing kids,''' said Lisa
McGiffert, a senior policy analyst for Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   McGiffert said that change probably slowed the application
process because ``any time you change the plan, HCFA has to go back
and look at it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said the Bush administration excluded adults from the
revised waiver request believing that the move would make it easier
to win federal approval.
</P>
<P>
   She said the federal government required programs for adults to
be ``budget-neutral.'' In other words, they couldn't cost
additional federal money. The adult proposal in Texas' original
application, Edwards said, didn't meet that requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman questioned her explanation because, he said, nine other
states operate similar waiver programs that cover adults.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has criticized Bush over both children's health care and
prescription drugs for the elderly. Last week, the governor
addressed the prescription issue by offering a plan to help pay
Medicare insurance premiums for coverage that also provides drug
benefits for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gore's running mate came to Bush's home turf, making
an appearance in Houston. Sen. Joseph Lieberman said Texas ranks
second to last in the number of children nationwide with health
insurance. ``That says to me that Governor Bush has just not made
children's health coverage and care a priority here in his home
state,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Bush was blindsided when U.S. District Judge William
Wayne Justice ruled that Texas had failed to honor an agreement to
provide adequate health care to children eligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked the federal government several times for waivers to
make it easier to sign up people. Those waivers were denied,'' Bush
said upon learning of Justice's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said Bush wasn't referring to the 1995 waiver request
but to a later attempt to consolidate and privatize a system for
screening Texas applicants for welfare, Medicaid and other social
services.
</P>
<P>
   Bush criticized the federal government in 1997 for failing ``to
give us a clear answer for almost a year'' on the &UR;  &LR; screening
proposal. That same year, however, the Legislature killed the plan,
which drew opposition from both Republican and Democratic
lawmakers, Coleman said.

IN LONDON, AN AGONIZING DECISION OVER JOINED TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Under his powdered wig, behind his big black glasses,
Lord Justice Alan Ward's weary eyes looked very red.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting behind the grand bench at the Court of Appeal in the
Royal Courts of Justice last week, Ward acknowledged he had not
been getting much sleep lately. He and two other judges must decide
whether to authorize an operation to separate Siamese twins,
knowing that to do so may save the life of one and will certainly
kill the other, while not doing so will guarantee that both
5-week-old girls die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we murder Mary to save Jodie?'' a sleep-deprived Ward
asked, summarizing in one stark, chilling question the harsh choice
facing him, Lord Justice Clive Brooke, and Lord Justice Robert
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   It is a question that torments the judges, who are being asked
to play God for the first time in their long legal careers, and
will no doubt torment many more before this legal, ethical, and
moral quandary is resolved. The night before the hearing was
adjourned last week, Ward was up until 3 a.m., restless and unable
to sleep, he said. Sitting next to Ward in the courtroom, Brooke
nodded in sleepy agreement, saying he had been reading briefs on
the case at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which resumes Wednesday, is unprecedented in English
law. Medical officials said there have been previous cases in which
Siamese twins shared vital organs, forcing doctors to doom one to
save the other. But this case is different because the parents have
adamantly rejected the medical advice. A heart-rending decision
that is normally taken in the privacy of hushed hospital corridors
has been thrust into the august chambers of the Royal Courts of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Medical ethicist George J. Annas of Boston University said the
case is unprecedented not just in England, but anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can tell, this is the first case in which anyone
has tried to force a separation where the parents don't want one,''
said Annas, chairman of BU's health law department. ``Ethically,
the general practice has always been that the parents have a right
to make medical decisions for their kids unless there is evidence
that they are abusing their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Annas said that, from an ethical standpoint, parents and doctors
are on equally solid ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an impossible decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If he had to decide, Annas said, he would side with saving
Jodie's life, but quickly added, ``Neither choice is preferable.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 25, a High Court judge, Justice Robert Johnson, made
just that decision, ruling that the twins should be surgically
separated over the objections of the parents, who are described
only as devout Roman Catholics from a country somewhere along the
Mediterranean. Johnson acknowledged that he made his ruling with a
heavy heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Jodie, separation means the expectation of a normal
life,'' he intoned solemnly from the bench. ``For Mary, it means
death.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents, who came to Britain because the treatment their
daughters needed was unavailable in their own country, appealed
Johnson's ruling. Whatever the three-member appeals court rules,
the case seems destined to end up before the Law Lords in the House
of Lords, the highest court in England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
   The parents could also take the case to the European Court of
Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. But if the case drags on until
Oct. 2, which appears likely, that will not be necessary. On that
day the European Convention on Human Rights becomes enshrined in
English law, allowing the parents to cite the convention before
English courts, and that could lead to a whole new round of legal
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching a decision has been agonizingly slow for the appeals
court judges, who had initially hoped to resolve the case quickly.
Once they asked for additional medical opinions and expert advice,
an already complicated case grew even murkier.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at St. Mary's Hospital in Manchester, where the twins
were born joined at the abdomen Aug. 8, say that because the girls
share a heart and lungs, neither will survive longer than three to
six months if they remain attached. If the twins are separated, the
doctors believe that Jodie, whose body contains the heart and
lungs, will survive and have a normal life span. Separation,
however, will mean instantaneous death for Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The judges sought a second medical opinion from doctors at Great
Ormond Street Hospital in London, who agreed with the Manchester
team.
</P>
<P>
   But while there appears to be a consensus on the medical
prognosis, there is nothing approaching a legal and moral consensus
among the myriad lawyers representing the twins, the parents, the
doctors, and the British government.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read to the court by their lawyer, Simon Taylor,
the parents said they want God, not doctors, to decide how long
their daughters live.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot kill one of our daughters to allow the other to
survive,'' they wrote. ``We believe nature should take its course.
If it's God's will that both of our children should not survive,
then so be it. It's not something we believe we have the right to
interfere with.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said that in their homeland, his clients live four hours
from the nearest hospital, and that even if Jodie survives the
hardship on the family will be extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have been at pains to keep secret the identities not
just of the parents and children _ Jodie and Mary are pseudonyms
adopted by the court _ but of medical personnel, too. St. Mary's
has received many calls, some of them threatening, from people
opposed to the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The parents have powerful allies, including the leader of the
Catholic Church in Britain, Archbishop Cormac Murphy-O'Connor. The
archbishop said a legal ruling authorizing the killing of one child
to save the other would set a dangerous, Orwellian precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents in this case have made clear that they love both
their children equally and cannot consent to one of them being
killed to help the other. I believe this moral instinct is right,''
the archbishop said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, when Taylor suggested it would be illegal for the
court to authorize the killing of Mary, Lord Justice Ward showed
his frustration at being forced into the role of a King Solomon who
might have to do more than threaten to slice a baby in half. The
judge agreed with Taylor that, legally, it would be a crime for
surgeons to use a scalpel to separate the twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment the knife goes into that united body,'' the judge
said, ``it touches the body of unhappy little Mary. It is in that
second an assault. . . . You cannot pretend that is not actively
engaged in assaulting her integrity. For what justification? None
of hers.''
</P>
<P>
   But, underscoring the legal Catch-22 they face, the judges mused
that one could argue that Mary is assaulting Jodie, slowly killing
her by relying on and weakening her organs.
</P>
<P>
   While the judges appear determined to keep the arguments secular
and away from the realm of the spiritual, Ward found himself
pondering the religious dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not God's will that this baby should live because it
was not born with the capacity to live,'' he said of Mary. ``Nobody
in their right mind would hook this child on to a life support
system, given the utter deformity of her heart and lungs.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Parker, the lawyer appointed to represent Jodie, said she
has a 95 percent chance of surviving if the operation is carried
out soon. She said if doctors wait until Mary dies while attached
to Jodie, Jodie's chances of surviving the operation will be less
than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Mary's lawyer, David Harris, argued that Mary is entitled to
full protection under the law. He said it would be illegal to
purposely kill her, even if the intention was to prolong Jodie's
life.
</P>
<P>
   Parker argued that Mary's rights are irrelevant because she
cannot live without the organs in Jodie's body. That argument,
suggesting that Mary was never able to live on her own, seemed to
find some intellectual sympathy with Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is kicking,'' he said of Mary. ``Whether she is alive and
kicking, I don't yet know.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooke agreed that Mary's legal status as a viable human being
was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this creature in the eyes of the law?'' Brooke asked.

 AUSTRALIA HOPING OLYMPIC EXPOSURE CLARIFIES ITS IMAGE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ NBC president Dick Ebersol had a sly warning: The
Olympics are prom night for Australia, and the prettiest girl in
school has a blemish big enough to compete with her corsage.
</P>
<P>
   What Ebersol called a ``pimple'' was a web of power lines
criss-crossing Olympic Park at Homebush Bay, obscuring his dream of
a ``beauty shot'' of central Sydney 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's still beautiful, but she would be even more beautiful
without it,'' Ebersol said, playing on a weakness of
image-conscious Australians.
</P>
<P>
   And so, displaying an eager-to-please Aussie nature as well as a
national fear of being exposed as imposters, government officials
spent $25 million to demolish 47 huge electric towers, and to bury
the lines they carried. Cynics said it was a good thing Ebersol
hadn't asked to relocate the Sydney Opera House, which remains
stubbornly just outside camera range.
</P>
<P>
   When the 2000 Summer Olympics open on Friday, Australia will
command the world's attention as never before. And as the power
line story illustrates, it is a country desperate to make a good
impression, to be seen in the best possible light.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, it is eager to shed its persistent image as a
pleasant but remote nation, strangely rooted in its penal colony
past, filled with bush-hat-wearing, crocodile-wrestling,
shrimp-barbecuing, Foster's-Lager-drinking yobbos.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we're all living under gum trees and slaughtering
kangaroos, if they know anything about us at all,'' said Mel
MacPherson of Canberra, a retired transportation worker riding a
Sydney Harbor ferry. Some foreigners, he said, even confuse
Australia with a landlocked European republic. To prove his point,
he nodded toward a beer-bellied man wearing a T-shirt with the
words: ``There are no kangaroos in Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, revealing a curiously Australian habit of self-blame,
McPherson added: ``In fairness, we might be at fault for not trying
to explain ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics, then, offer an unprecedented opportunity for
Australians to explain themselves, or at least to expose the other
six continents to this iconoclastic yet icon-loving island that in
almost every way is far, far away.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are the basics: They're called prawns here, not
shrimp. And Foster's isn't ``Australian for beer,'' despite the ad
slogan; the brew commands just 1 percent of the market. As for the
Outback hero Crocodile Dundee, actor Paul Hogan is considered
something of a has-been, the subject of facelift rumors as he films
another sequel south of Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
   In a larger sense, Australians hope to show the world the smart,
peaceful, prosperous face of a laid-back, ``no-worries'' society,
complete with cocky grin and ready ``G'day.'' It is a heartwarming
picture, not wholly inaccurate, but simplified to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australians like to think of themselves, justified or not, as
friendly, outgoing, hospitable, egalitarian, and this is the image
we will be trying to project,'' said Clive Kessler, a sociologist
at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, Australians want the world to be
clear about what they are not. That is, British or American.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always think of ourselves in opposition to England, a cold,
nasty country versus our warm, pleasant one,'' Kessler said. As for
America, ``We spend much of our time here at the end of the world
trying not to succumb to the onslaught of Americanism under the
label of globalism.''
</P>
<P>
   That impulse can be seen in countless small ways, such as
letters to the editor complaining that a new restaurant advertises
``carry-out.'' (Aussies prefer ``take-away,'' despite it's being
the British term). It also comes in regular doses from David Dale,
who writes a popular culture column in the Sydney Morning Herald
that seems to be based largely on how much Australians are
knuckling under to American influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past week,'' he wrote triumphantly this year, ``we
have been more different from the Americans than any time this
millennium.'' He then reported breathlessly that an Australian band
had the top-selling album, an Australian television show had the
highest rating, and an Australian movie ``has beaten a bunch of
Hollywood's most commercial products.''
</P>
<P>
   One result of all this effort, of course, is that Yank
(American) visitors here tend to view Australia as vaguely British
_ left-side drivers, fealty to the queen _ while Pommy (British)
visitors hear an American echo, with bronze surfer dudes, a disdain
for social class, and designer coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Distinctions between Australia and the United States seem
particularly important here because of similarities at birth.
</P>
<P>
   Both started as British colonies on the far frontier, blessed
with endless horizons and confronted by often-unwelcoming natives _
aborigines in Australia, Native Americans in North America. In the
1830s, Charles Darwin noticed the similarities and thought
Australia might eventually rival the United States for power and
grandeur, though he later recanted.
</P>
<P>
   The key differences were in both the people and the places.
</P>
<P>
   The American colonies were founded by intense religious freedom
seekers, while Australia was originally home to hooligans, the
refuse of overcrowded British prisons. And while Australia is
roughly the same size as the lower 48 states, it has a barren
heartland, as dry and inhospitable as North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Historians cite those differences to help explain the divergence
of psyches. Americans fell in love with the self-image of the
rugged individual, going it alone to tame a rich, wild land.
Australians embraced an ideal of ``mateship,'' of pulling together
to survive an unforgiving place with egalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to a golf club, you'll find employees playing
against their bosses, and if the worker is a better player, he'll
win,'' said Kessler, the sociologist. ``And far from being upset by
this, both sides feel rewarded by it because it proves this is
still Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   The other side of that coin is what's known as the ``tall-poppy
syndrome.'' Achievers who poke up their heads risk having them cut
off, figuratively speaking.
</P>
<P>
   But that has been changing. ``You used to be ashamed in this
country about being rich. That has stopped being the case,''
Kessler said. Still, a recent poll found that 70 percent of
Australians cling to old sensibilities, saying they would prefer a
narrower gap between rich and poor to a faster growth rate for
national wealth.
</P>
<P>
   There is also hand-wringing about the end of the mythically
class-free, ``fair-go society.'' The blame _ or credit, as the case
may be _ is often placed on 15 years of overhaul and deregulation,
during which the government has sought to heighten productivity,
bolster the service and high-tech sectors, and make the country a
global player. Successes include low unemployment, low inflation,
and a yearly growth rate of about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some of the complaining is attributed to a
fundamentally Australian belief that no matter how good things
might seem, they're really much worse. It is an impulse that seems
at odds with the easygoing Aussie style, but there is much about
Australia that seems in conflict with itself.
</P>
<P>
   For all the swooning about mateship, for instance, it never
included the native Aborigines, who continue to struggle for a
place in society. And despite an anti-British streak, Australians
voted last year to retain Queen Elizabeth II as the figurehead head
of state for their parliamentary democracy. The majority apparently
considered it the lesser of two evils; as the nation approaches its
first centennial next year, mistrust for native politicians is a
pastime second only to cricket.
</P>
<P>
   Some contradictions might be explained by the fact that in many
ways this is two countries, one urban and relatively rich, the
other rural and relatively poor.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three-quarters of the 19 million Australians are on 10
percent of the land, most on the southeastern coastline from
Adelaide to Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is in the middle of that congregation and is home to
nearly one in five Australians, seemingly all of them talking on
cell phones or in chat rooms. Despite a reputation for insularity,
a recent survey found that more than 36 percent of Australians use
the Internet, a higher rate than the United States and most other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the population is spread throughout the mostly
empty expanse of the vast interior, the bush, which 19th-century
poet Henry Lawson called ``the nurse and tutor of eccentric minds,
the home of the weird, and of much that is different from things in
other lands.'' Few city folks visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bush? Never been,'' said Shana Mills, a waitress at a
restaurant near Sydney's Manly Beach. ``I want to go to the States,
though. I've made friends there on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   For rural and urban Australians alike, a notable part of the
native psyche is devotion to a fairly inexplicable list of national
icons. There is a horse (Phar Lap), a hat and coat (the Akubra and
the Drizabone), a cricket player (Donald Bradman), a car (the
Holden), a boat (the aluminum dinghy), a food (meat pies), a
marsupial (the kangaroo), a macho cartoon pitchman (Chesty Bond),
and a yeast spread (Vegemite), among others.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, it is a nation that still stokes the memory of
the 1915 invasion at Gallipoli, a disastrous bid to knock the
Ottoman Empire, Germany's Turkish ally, out of World War I.
Thousands of Australians died, and the battle remains a defining
moment for a country that was just 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Those pillars of old Australia might be losing their hold,
though, as immigrants come ashore in huge numbers. The proportion
of the population born overseas rose from 10 percent in 1947 to 23
percent in 1998, with notable recent increases coming from Vietnam,
China, and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   One result has been occasional uprisings of racist and
xenophobic sentiment, although most observers consider race
relations cordial and perhaps even exemplary compared with
elsewhere. One exception is the historic mistreatment of
aborigines, who until 1967 weren't even counted in the census _
they were on a par with native fauna.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had his misgivings, Darwin in 1836 offered an
assessment that Australians consider relevant still: ``As a means
of making men outwardly honest, of converting vagabonds, most
useless in one hemisphere, into active citizens of another, and
thus giving birth to a new and splendid country _ a grand centre of
civilization _ it has succeeded to a degree perhaps unparalleled in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the impression Australians hope will remain long after
the Olympics have ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want everybody to like us,'' said MacPherson, the retired
transport worker. ``The minute someone arrives at the airport, we
ask, `So, what do you think of the place?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he added, when the visitor says it's wonderful, ``The
Aussie isn't quite sure whether to believe him.''

ON BUSH TAX PLAN, SOCIAL SECURITY, GORE LOOSE WITH FACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARBONDALE, Pa. _ A Pennsylvania company that changed from
making silk 100 years ago to fire-resistant materials now offered
Al Gore a backdrop to make a pitch for adding 10 million high-wage,
high-tech jobs to the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   It also served as the latest venue for Gore to repeat two
statements, one about his rival, George W. Bush, and another about
himself, that stretch the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his opposition to a tax cut proposed by the Texas
governor, Gore said Thursday, ``Let me make it clear: I will not go
along with any plan that takes the entire surplus and squanders it
on a big tax cut for the very wealthy at the expense of the middle
class.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush has not proposed that. His $1.3 trillion tax cut
would consume slightly more than a quarter of the projected $4.56
trillion surplus over 10 years. Since it is an across-the-board
cut, it would apply to all taxpayers, although the rich would
benefit more than the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president told workers at Gentex, a manufacturer
outside Scranton, ``It is also time to secure retirement by making
sure that Social Security and Medicare are put in an off-budget
lockbox with a sign on it that says, `Politicians, hands off.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush also says he wants to put Social Security money in
such a ``lockbox,'' but Gore's vivid imagery suggests that the
money would be placed in some sort of vault. Earlier in the week,
the vice president told one audience the lockbox would be
``ironclad.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that the term does not refer to a bank or an
account, but the commitment to use all unneeded Social Security
taxes in the coming years to pay off part of the nation's $3.4
trillion debt. That way, when Social Security faces insolvency in
2037, the country will have more capacity to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush refers to a lockbox, he often notes that its benefit
would be to reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides defend their candidate's rhetoric, the use of which
since the Democratic National Convention has paralleled Gore's rise
in the polls. Gore also talks about ``fighting for middle-class
families'' and says Bush is ``for the powerful,'' and he is ``for
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign says Gore's statements illustrate the vice
president's tendency to twist the facts for his own purposes. It is
the same charge that former US senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey
leveled against Gore last winter in the Democratic primary
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In January and February, Bradley complained repeatedly about
Gore telling audiences the former senator wanted to eliminate
Medicaid and replace it with a $150-a-month voucher. In truth, that
dollar amount was not a cap, as Gore implied, but an average. And
it was not per family, but per individual. When challenged on the
statement, the vice president modified his language, but only
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   He subsequently said the vouchers were ``capped at $150 a month
or averaged at $150 a month, however you want to say it,'' even
though the statements were contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just shows that Al Gore will say anything to get
elected, no matter how false or phony,'' said a Bush spokesman, Ari
Fleischer. With a bit of sarcasm in his voice, he alluded to Gore's
change of heart over abortion: ``Remember, Al Gore has always been
prochoice.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gore spokesman, Chris Lehane, denied that Gore was stretching
the truth. He said it is Bush who is guilty of political hyperbole.
While Bush talks daily about rebuilding the military, Lehane said,
he budgets only $45 billion for it. Gore, by contrast, proposes
$100 billion in new military spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``On all these issues, you have the Texas two-step, where he
says one thing and does another,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Exaggeration is a fact of life on the campaign trail. Candidates
always present their proposals in the best possible light and their
opponent's in the most unfavorable terms.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, has a long history of making statements that
stretch the truth, such as his claims that he ``took the initiative
in inventing the Internet,'' or that he and wife Tipper served as
the model couple for Erich Segal's novel ``Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   As his standing in the polls has dropped, Bush has hammered away
at the credibility theme, most recently in reference to Gore's
willingness to debate. It is an issue that cuts both ways for the
two campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   After sealing up the Democratic nomination in March, the vice
president challenged Bush to debate ``anytime, anyplace.'' The Bush
team hedged, but a week ago it announced it would participate in
two hourlong debates on CNN and NBC, as well as a 90-minute debate
sanctioned by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president refused to accept those terms, saying he
wanted Bush to agree to three debates proposed by the commission
before they did others. While the Bush team is now reconsidering
its position, Gore's hedge became the subject of a commercial by
the Republicans challenging his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush is susceptible to criticism on the subject because two
weeks ago he said, ``I want as many people to watch our debates as
possible.'' Since then, both ABC and CBS have said they would not
air the first two debates because they are being produced by rival
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statements about tax cuts and the Social Security lockbox
have caught the attention of some of those who have watched both
candidates in action.
</P>
<P>
   After initially conceding the Bush tax cut does not consume all
of the surplus, as the vice president stated, Lehane, Gore's
spokesman, returned to correct himself.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush's $1.3 trillion cut would actually cost about $1.6
trillion, because the nation would incur about $300 billion in
extra interest costs if that portion of the surplus is used not for
debt repayment.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign also says the Bush tax cut costs $300 billion
more than Bush acknowledges _ for a total of $1.9 trillion _
because of the intricacies of its effective date. Aides to the
Texas governor dispute that, but Lehane, like the vice president,
is insistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does spend all the surplus on a tax cut for the wealthy,''
Lehane said.

THE DIAGNOSIS 
By Alan Lightman. Pantheon. 369 pp. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any student of the physical world will testify to a certain
elegance of form, applicable across the entire spectrum of natural
law: that poetry, for instance, can possess an internal structure
similar to that of a fine building or a cloud. What happens, then,
when you go mucking about with time and matter, manipulating them
with industrial progress and split attention and the heretical
demands of 24/7? Does the world, insistently entropic, simply dig
in its heels and refuse to budge? Does human consciousness, taxed
beyond its biological premise or capabilities, scatter into chaos?
If infinity times zero will always equal zero, what does that tell
us about the less quantifiable components of output and desire?
</P>
<P>
   Alan Lightman, to his credit and ours, cares mightily about such
things. A writer and physicist who teaches both subjects at MIT, he
charmed a great number of readers with his 1993 fiction about time
and possibility, ``Einstein's Dreams.'' That fully imagined work
brought the notion of a parallel universe further into the
vernacular: perhaps each one of us was living out a mere fraction
of a larger puzzle, where history went on performing a greater
dance than any of us could see.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Diagnosis'' is neither so eloquent nor as open-ended as
``Einstein's Dreams''; it is instead a darkly allegorical novel
about the human costs of a meaningless, high-tech work world run
amok. Medical specialists (including psychiatrists) communicate
with their patients by cell phone or e-mail; faced with the
clock-breaking labyrinths of voice mail and information-processing
services, time itself has pretty much collapsed. Trying to navigate
this new order is a kind of Route-128 Everyman: Bill Chalmers, who
just turned 40, loves his wife and son and home and who can't seem
to find his way to work one ordinary morning.
</P>
<P>
   Chalmers's story begins with terrifying authenticity, when the
normal stresses of the toiling masses seem to converge into a
chaotic underworld at Alewife Station. Cell phone in hand,
briefcase bulging, Chalmers looks around him at the digitalized
frenzy and just stumbles into circuit overload _ he forgets who he
is and where he's going. By the end of a commuter nightmare in
which the Red Line never looked scarier, he winds up in the ER at
Boston City Hospital (he's headed for the psych wing until he
steals a pair of pants and escapes). With his memory returning in
fragments, Chalmers finds he's losing something else: He has no
feeling beyond an inexplicable tingling in his hands and feet. As
the condition progresses, it takes on the pathology of a carpal
tunnel syndrome of the soul; instead of pain or pleasure, Chalmers
feels nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   So unfolds a hellish little odyssey through modern life, with
poor Chalmers trying valiantly to stay upright as his world
collapses. While he's lost on the Red Line, his wife, Melissa, is
lolling about having a cyber-affair at her laptop computer; Alex,
their son, has long since resorted to reaching both parents by
e-mail, even when they're all at home. Now faced with Chalmers's
deteriorating health and job status, the family hunkers down _
Melissa disappearing into a bottle of Scotch, Alex going on-line to
research his dad's conditions. Doctors and lawyers come and go,
signifying nothing. Paychecks mostly go, Chalmers having blown it
at his high-pressure company (a mysterious place where worthless
information and deals get processed, toward mysterious ends). A
phalanx of medical teams consult, subjecting the patient to
invasive and useless tests. One kind but dotty psychiatrist plays
Chalmers a background CD of waterfalls, then sends him home with
Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what we have here is the breakdown of the modern world,
personified by a wounded anti-hero who never asked for what he got,
deserved it no more or less than anybody else. But this is pretty
much a one-trick pony of a plot: We know the cell phones will get
louder, the corporate response more outlandish, the physical
symptoms worse. Because ``The Diagnosis'' is a black-comic, surreal
descent into the maelstrom, its focus is less on character
development or emotional credibility than it is on dark symbolism;
while Chalmers's alienation is a tale of anguish, its rendering
through the inhuman flotsam of technospeak (e-mail chatter,
nonsensical dialogues) becomes tedious after a while. More
compelling and telling both are the fleeting moments when
Chalmers's memory triumphantly displays its lifetime of treasures:
the sound of Chopin, the pleasures of pizza with a beloved son, the
riveting beauty of a leaf. These are the pastoral exceptions to
Chalmers's present life, and to the absurdist milieu that ``The
Diagnosis'' has chosen to present.
</P>
<P>
   Woven throughout Chalmers's descent is a series of fictionalized
chapters from Plato (downloaded by Alex!), concerning the trial and
death of Socrates and the inner torment of one of his accusers,
Anytus. Bill Chalmers has similarities to both men: Like Socrates,
he has become a martyr to the cause of truth; like Anytus, his
silence and anger may have cost him his son. Or perhaps the point
belongs to Socrates, who, having been condemned in Plato's
``Apology,'' asks his accusers to trouble his sons after he is
gone: ``If they pretend to be something when they are really
nothing, then reprove them, as I have reproved you, for not caring
about that for which they ought to care.''
</P>
<P>
   The intention behind this device seems more commendable than its
execution. The Anytus passages don't really fit in the novel, but
you can sense Lightman's passion for their story, and that makes
them discretely compelling. But their inclusion here points to a
larger problem in ``The Diagnosis'': it's a novel of ideas whose
creator seems more comfortable with the ideas than with the
imaginative elements that surround them. Because Lightman has made
his Chalmers someone who once understood the sorrows of Chopin, his
protagonist is a tragic figure _ a man defeated by life who
nonetheless remembers its beauties. And because Lightman himself
casts his vote with Chopin and Joyce, you can't help wishing he had
given them the background score. Until its final pages, though,
``The Diagnosis'' isn't governed by such melodic laments. Instead,
relentlessly exposing the techno-hell of the modern age, it must
surrender to the squawk of cell phones, the ominous beep of
cyber-cues, and those recorded waterfalls _ falling softly and
softly falling, in stereo.

THE `NAKED GUN' TRILOGY ALL DRESSED UP FOR DVD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ON DVD: ``The Naked Gun,'' ``The Naked Gun 2 1/2,'' and
``The Naked Gun 33 1/3'' _ The folks behind ``Airplane'' give the
same zany comic treatment to the cop picture with this trio of
hilarious hits. One of the most interesting elements in the DVD
home-video format is that filmmakers are more likely to tell the
truth about casting and production. When a film is released
theatrically, there's a tendency for the creators to become
pitchmen. They tend to forget that the star who's perfect for the
role was his or her third choice. The true story is much more
likely to come out after most of the major revenue streams are
running dry and the filmmakers need new revelations to reinvigorate
their films.
</P>
<P>
   Director and screenwriter David Zucker, reached in his Los
Angeles office, was forthcoming about the casting in these films.
``We didn't want to hire comedians,'' he said. ``I think the key to
the success of these films is that we were ruthless in cutting
material and we hired all noncomic actors. It was like in
`Airplane,' we wanted Jack Webb for the Robert Stack role and he
turned us down. We wanted Pete Rose for the part played by Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, but he was playing ball at the time we were
shooting.'' Did he always want O. J. Simpson, who plays a strong
supporting role in all three of the ``Naked Gun'' movies? ``Yes,''
he said, without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Braveheart'' _ Mel Gibson's Oscar-winning spectacle looks and
sounds terrific on DVD. There isn't as much insightful commentary
as fans of the film might like, but it does make a magnificent
transfer from film to DVD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sound of Music'' _ The 35th anniversary edition of the
movie that made Julie Andrews a film star crackles with a
remastered soundtrack. The Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein
III score fills the Austrian Alps with uplifting anthems about
faith and love. Fans of the Oscar-winning musical will love this
version. Unfortunately, they didn't revise the story. It still
needs a solid shot of scotch-bonnet pepper sauce instead of all the
sugar.

COLLEGES SEEK TO REIN IN NETWORK-CLOGGING NAPSTER ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The routine at Amherst College generally went this way: Students
like Chris Fargis woke up, logged on to Napster.com's Internet
library of recorded music, entered a search for a few tunes _ a
little indie rock, a little hip-hop _ and then went off to class.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster activity by Fargis and dozens of other students
burned up the campus computer system through the day, often taking
a stunning 50 percent of Amherst's network capabilities. Some
professors, like biologist Stephen George, became so frustrated
that they gave up using the Internet in class, or started coming in
at 7 a.m. to do research online.
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon, meanwhile, students were itching for their Napster
finds. ``It's just really nice to leave for class and come back and
have them there,'' said Fargis, a senior, of the songs he
automatically received on his computer.
</P>
<P>
   But no more. Starting this fall, Amherst is blocking all access
to the well-known Napster site. Smith and Hampshire colleges are
doing the same, citing rampant overuse of the popular, and
controversial, site. Other schools are trying less direct, and more
unusual, solutions: Mount Holyoke College, for one, has begun
monitoring Internet usage of each student _ and will question those
who are taking up too much bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   While the courts have become the chief battleground over the
legality of Napster _ which accommodates the electronic copying and
distribution of copyright music _ a secondary skirmish is taking
place exactly where the controversial software was invented and
thrived: college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, lawyers for recording artists asked Harvard, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and nine other schools to
join in a nationwide campus ban on Napster.
</P>
<P>
   With countless students downloading music from the Internet site
for free, arguably violating copyrights, colleges have ``a moral,
ethical, and legal obligation'' to block access, according to a
letter the lawyers sent the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is already facing a federal appeals court hearing,
expected in October, over whether its sampling service is
infringing on the rights of artists and record companies. The
outcome could well determine how involved colleges need to become
in the debate _ and for now, they want to avoid it as much as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard and MIT officials said Friday that they would consider
the request to block Napster, but added that they were reluctant to
filter the Internet on campus.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent national survey of 50 colleges, about one-third
reported that they blocked access to Napster's site. For schools
that ban, questions about academic freedom and the free use of the
Internet have inevitably surfaced. Yet, those issues have
ultimately been sidestepped in most cases, as administrators
imposed bans as a way to relieve computing systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't taken a stand on the legal issues,'' said Philip
Fitz, Amherst's director of information technology. ``If the courts
are having trouble deciding that, it doesn't seem we would be able
to make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The costs Napster posed to Amherst exceeded the $25,000 in
estimated bandwidth use, Fitz said. Students paying tuition were
losing out because they couldn't zip around the Web quickly for
research projects or other uses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Smith College, complaints among professors began to mount as
well. ``We weren't thrilled about blocking, but there was great
concern that academic scholarship was being interrupted because of
the congestion,'' said Herbert Nickles, who oversees information
technology at Smith. ``It would take an hour to download the data,
rather than five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mount Holyoke officials also grew irritated about Napster's use
this year, but were loath to adopt a ban. Instead, they are handing
out a memo to students this month saying that activity on the site
``must be curtailed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a computer security official will analyze
online activity _ though not the content of it _ for each student.
Those found using much more bandwidth than others, in turn, will
get a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they work with us, there's not a big deal,'' said Susan
Perry, the college's director of library, information, and
technology services. ``And if they don't, we'll just cut them off
the network.''
</P>
<P>
   But some computer specialists at other colleges took a dim view
of both strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you block Napster, you'll just encourage it to take on a
different form that's harder to block,'' said Scott Conti, the
network operations manager at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst. ``And at public institutions, there's a whole freedom of
speech issue. We don't want to be inspecting traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Conti, among others, predicted that Web-savvy students would
hack their way through colleges' blocking technology and back into
Napster. It was a former Northeastern University student, Shawn
Fanning, who wrote the Napster program; some other undergraduates
are already trading safecracker tips in Internet chat rooms,
recommending using the off-campus computers of friends as Web
portals with which to access Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't found a way around the block yet, but I wouldn't be
surprised if there was a hack out there,'' said Fargis, who buys
music regularly but uses Napster to find live, unreleased, or
especially rare tracks.
</P>
<P>
   But Karen Chau, another Amherst senior, said she thinks the ban
will hurt Napster because many won't inconvenience themselves with
trying to break onto the site. The average student, she said, uses
Napster to procrastinate _ searching for songs to pump them up as
their homework sits on another screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole reason people used Napster was because it was
easy,'' Chau said. ``Everyone felt kind of guilty about using it. .
. . But now, they're annoyed.''

ON COLLEGE AID, BUSH, GORE ARE SWITCHING ROLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to higher education, George W. Bush is thinking
big. Very big.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the pledge _ stunning for a Republican who advocates
limited government _ that he delivered last month in Hampton, N.H.:
``College is every parent's dream for their children,'' the GOP
presidential nominee said, ``and we should make this opportunity
available to all students.''
</P>
<P>
   We should? All students?
</P>
<P>
   Americans, including many in the Republican Party, have long
debated whether all high school seniors should go on to college. Or
whether, in a meritocracy, taxpayers should subsidize big public
universities for students who didn't shine in high school. Or
whether parents should go into debt for freshmen who might lack the
maturity to know when to stop partying and start studying.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the Texas governor wants to give all poor students
a boost, regardless of their academic ability. He would increase
the need-based Pell Grant to $5,100 for freshmen, up from $3,300.
</P>
<P>
   What does Al Gore say? While the Democratic nominee backs
upticks in Pell Grants (although not on the scale Bush has
proposed), he is reserving his rhetorical muscle for the Clinton
administration's favored policy to help college students: Tax
credits for tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Which renders the 2000 political calculus for students and their
parents thusly: The Republican is embracing a $5 billion new
federal subsidy for the poor, and the Democrat is touting tax cuts,
primarily for the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Brecht play _ no one's playing their assigned
parts,'' said Terry Hartle, vice president for government and
public affairs at the American Council on Education. ``The
Republicans want to help the lower income, and the Democrats want
tax relief to help middle- and upper-income families.''
</P>
<P>
   Why have the rivals seemingly traded places on easing the
college tuition burden, an issue that scores highly in the polls?
And whose plan would work better?
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: The candidates forsee a squeaker on
Election Day and want to make inroads with swing voters and each
other's core constituencies. Pell Grants are a very popular brand
name with low-income and minority families who tend to vote
Democratic, but who may be open to Bush's appeals. Vice President
Gore's tax-relief proposal _ which would provide up to $2,800 a
year for tuition _ is especially geared to benefit the middle
class, where Bush's stronghold lies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would spend an additional $1 billion on $1,000 scholarships
for Pell recipients who pass advanced placement science and math
exams, as a reward for aiming high. Taken together, the Republican
plan would shower more money on Pell Grants than on most other
education commitments he has made this year.
</P>
<P>
   Enlarging the Pell Grant program is a good issue for Bush: It
appeals to so-called ``compassionate conservatives'' by helping the
poor, and it also has luster for the school-choice wing, since the
Pell, in some respects, is higher education's version of vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pell plan has some drawbacks. If, under a President
Bush, recipients of larger grants dropped out of college at steady
rates, the beefed-up program could easily be tarred as a waste of
money.
</P>
<P>
   A better reward might be a bigger Pell Grant for college juniors
and seniors, instead of just freshmen, since the upperclassmen
would have an academic track record and could probably use the same
relief from debt or part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Owen Schapiro, a student-aid analyst who recently became
president of Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. said a larger
Pell program would help ``the people who are most in peril.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Schapiro's research, only 44 percent of poor
students go to college, compared with 86 percent of the affluent.
And it isn't that richer children are smarter: Among students with
top test scores, 19 out of 20 who are wealthy go to college,
compared with 3 out of 4 from low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Just the attention Bush is paying to financial aid is
impressive, if surprising. Last year, New York state spent almost
10 times as much on student aid as did Texas ($634 million and $67
million), and only recently did he approve a broad-based aid
program for Texas college students.
</P>
<P>
   Texas ranks 45th nationally in the percentage of 19-year-olds
attending a US college, according to a study by financial-aid
expert Tom Mortenson. For low-income students, the state is 46th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Bush has been in power in Texas, he hasn't done anything
for higher education opportunity,'' Mortenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mortenson, a champion of Pell Grants, has cottoned to the
Bush proposals in spite of his traditional Democratic sympathies.
``For whatever Mr. Gore has invested in trying to understand K-12
education, he hasn't even cracked a book on higher education,''
Mortenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's silence on Pell Grants is interesting, given its
resonance with his political base. Mortenson argues it's because
Gore is a Southerner, from a region where politicians tend to favor
merit scholarships over need-based aid like Pell Grants. Bush's
proposed $1,000 Pell scholarships in math and science reflect that
same spirit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, however, is that Gore and his advisers think swing
voters will see a greater personal payoff from tuition tax relief
than from Pell Grants
</P>
<P>
   Tax credits for tuition and fees are now worth up to $1,500,
which Gore would expand to a maximum of $2,800. A Clinton plan to
do just that is now stalled in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the nomination last month in Los Angeles, Gore framed
his tuition tax plan as a a modern-day GI Bill, which transformed
both American colleges and the economy by helping about 8 million
veterans enroll after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will fight for a targeted, affordable tax cut to help
working families save and pay for college,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, though, the middle class and the wealthy are the
winners so far under the Clinton-Gore strategy. They make up
roughly half of the 5 million Americans who claimed the tax credits
in 1999; only one-third had incomes under $30,000. And the average
dollar amount claimed was about $945 for wage-earners between
$50,000 and $75,000, compared to $670 for those between $20,000 and
$30,000. In other words, lower income people generally benefitted
less.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore's tax plan would do little for the poor _ some of
whom don't owe enough in taxes to even claim the credit _ his
strategy does tap the pulse of the college world's ``silent
majority'': Families that are neither rich nor poor, who qualify
for loans but not outright grants, and therefore have to shoulder
debt to cover tuition, housing, and other fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have to give middle-class families help in paying for
college,'' Gore said during his convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, of course, promises made on the campaign trail often
hit the skids once they reach Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's a Pell expansion or a tax credit for tuition,''
Schapiro noted, ``by the time it goes through committee, you find
all sorts of people who might be helped or not helped that might
surprise you.''

LIEBERMAN, CHENEY GOT VIETNAM DEFERMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Cheney and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman have something in
common beyond their hope to become vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cheney, Lieberman received a deferment from the draft
during the Vietnam War, because he was a father. And like Cheney,
Lieberman, under rules in effect at the time, received the
deferment before the child was born.
</P>
<P>
   According to Selective Service records, Lieberman held a student
deferment from 1961, when he was a freshman at Yale, until May 24,
1967, as he was preparing to graduate from Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   On that date, Lieberman was granted a 3-A deferment, meaning he
could not be drafted because he was a father. His first child,
Matthew, by his first wife, was born Aug. 16, 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who was also a graduate student in the 1960s, was
granted the same kind of deferment in January 1966, about 10 weeks
after his wife, Lynne, became pregnant, and just after the
Selective Service made childless married men as vulnerable to the
draft as single men.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney would have remained protected from the draft even without
the fatherhood deferment, because he remained in school until after
he turned 26, when men became exempt from conscription.
</P>
<P>
   But because Lieberman was finishing law school, he would have
been subject to the draft almost immediately without the 3-A
deferment, according to a Selective Service spokesman, Richard
Flahaven.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman did not turn 26 until Feb. 24, 1968. Flahaven said
that under Selective Service rules, the oldest eligible men were
drafted first.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and Cheney were more typical of their generation than
those who ended up in Vietnam, according to government data: The
number of men who were exempt from the draft because they had
children exceeded, by nearly a million, the 2.6 million men and
women who served in Vietnam from 1964 to 1973.

CHENEY'S LOW-KEY STYLE WORRYING SOME IN GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAYNE, Pa. _ Traveling up the winding, wooded road, Dick
Cheney's motorcade emerged into a sunlit field, where the guests
stood waiting, in a neatly ordered double line.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less would have been in violation of command. This was,
after all, the Valley Forge Military Academy. It was, also, one of
the safest venues for the former secretary of defense to give a
speech calling for more defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a low-key reiteration of Cheney's well-honed
views. They were warmly received by the cadets in Eisenhower Hall;
they are mostly ignored elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, in New England, was little different. The first
stop was at a Maine defense subcontractor that makes submarine
valves. Then there were visits to a New Hampshire maker of military
night-vision equipment, and to a Vermont veterans' group.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it was an agenda that seemed more designed for a
Pentagon chief than for a vice presidential candidate. And that
appears to be the way the Bush campaign wants it.
</P>
<P>
   When Cheney was picked as George W. Bush's running mate, the
campaign said he wouldn't be relegated to minor markets, but that
is where he often appears. Cheney was heralded by Bush as a
relatively nonpolitical choice when the Texas governor was sky-high
in the polls, and when, perhaps, he thught he might easily be
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Bush is in a tight race with Vice President Al Gore,
the limitations of Cheney the campaigner have become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The question is not whether Cheney, 59, has the makings of an
excellent vice president. Many Republicans and Democrats say that
the former Wyoming congressman, and the former chief of staff to
President Gerald R. Ford, might be the most valuable asset for Bush
_ as president.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, there is scant evidence that Cheney is helping Bush
to get the top job. GOP grumblings continue that he may be hurting
the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime Republicans voice particular concern about
Cheney's role, given the evident campaign chemistry between Gore
and his running mate, Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut senator.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's zest on the stump is obvious. Cheney can seem
impatient with the give and take, and the occasional indignities,
of life on the trail.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser Friday in Vermont, a contributor, Fred
Bertrand, former chief executive officer of the National Life
Insurance Co., asked Cheney whether the campaign would change
strategy. Cheney brushed aside the question by saying he always
felt the race would be close.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, Bertrand said later, ``was not a spectacular choice,''
but a ``safe'' one. He added that the campaign ``was not helped''
by the controversy over reports that Cheney was in line to receive
$17.2 million in stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Some leading Republicans, who spoke privately, voiced irritation
that the campaign had been prepared neither for questions about
Cheney's wealth nor for his record as one of the most conservative
members of the US House.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the start, his choice has raised eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Bush announced that Cheney was his choice, Cheney
appeared on Larry King Live and talked about the money he would
lose by leaving Halliburton Co., the worldwide oil conglomerate
that he headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens financially, obviously, is I take a bath, in one
sense,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cheney was in line for millions of dollars in stock
options. After weeks of press accounts about the windfall, Cheney
announced that, if elected, he would forgo the options that are not
vested.
</P>
<P>
   A Cheney spokesman, Dirk Vande Beek, said  &UR; yesterday &LR;  that this
would amount to $3.6 million of Cheney's retirement package. The
remaining $13.6 million he would keep, no matter what happened on
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said through his spokesman that he had no second thoughts
about the logic behind his choice as a running mate. Cheney
initially had the job of vetting vice presidential candidates
before taking the position himself. Some of the candidates who were
bypassed might have secured a significant electoral state for Bush,
such as Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Ridge or former Missouri
Senator John Danforth.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Cheney is that his strengths may be inconsistent
with Bush's political needs.
</P>
<P>
   Thus:
</P>
<P>
   --Some polls have found that the state of the military is not a
key issue.
</P>
<P>
   --yoming is a reliable Republican state with only three
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   --Cheney's tenure as head of an oil conglomerate may further
irritate voters upset at rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Jude Wanniski, a Republican economic specialist who has known
him for 30 years, said Cheney was ``the perfect pick'' for vice
president, but added that that people around Bush ``are now telling
him he made a great mistake in picking Cheney.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanniski said the same thing happened after Bob Dole picked Jack
Kemp in 1996: ``The process begins by which the establishment
blames Cheney for losing the election. Cheney will be kept off TV
and relegated to backwater spots, as Jack was in 1996. Then they
will tie Cheney's hands in talking about things he may disagree
with Bush on, a la our overseas commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanniski said: ``The more Cheney appears on Sunday talk shows
talking about issues, the better he will look, because he is great
on issues and unflappable.''
</P>
<P>
   A hint of Cheney's discomfort at strongly stating some of his
own views was evident on Wednesday. Asked whether he backed
President Clinton's decision to use force in Kosovo, which was
supported by Bush, Cheney hedged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had reservations about it,'' Cheney said. ``It was a tough
call, a close call. Once the president made the decision to use
force, then I think there clearly was an obligation to support
him.''
</P>
<P>
   So what would Cheney have done? Again, he hedged: ``If I was
commander-in-chief, I don't know that I would have made exactly the
same decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has also weathered several smaller issues including
reports that he has given only 1 percent of his income to charity
in the past 10 years, and that he skipped voting in 14 of 16
elections in five years as a Dallas resident.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign advisers say that in the end, voters will
appreciate that Bush chose a man not for political calculation, but
for competence. For all the complaints about Cheney, there has been
little talk about whether he is qualified to take over the
presidency in a heartbeat. And that is the most important question
about a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't think of a person more qualified and capable as Dick
Cheney,'' said a friend and former Reagan White House chief of
staff, Ken Duberstein. ``Dick Cheney should be reassuring to the
American people. After all, the campaign is one thing, but the goal
of a campaign is to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's top issue is his assertion that the military is not
sufficiently prepared to fight wars of the future. That has
prompted Democrats to report that military spending began to
decline under Cheney, who, under a budget agreement in 1990,
authorized a 25 percent reduction in manpower over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is in many ways an antithesis to the modern campaigner,
as epitomized by President Clinton. Where Clinton's campaign
appearances were symbolized by his comment that he ``feels your
pain,'' Cheney's sometimes make listeners aware of his own
discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   This should not be a surprise: Cheney has always been a low-key,
somewhat taciturn politician, valued for intellect rather than for
charisma or people skills.
</P>
<P>
   Life on the road for Cheney is designed to be safe, predictable,
and relatively news-free. On a swing through the Northeast last
week, Cheney made a series of appearances that seemed designed to
avoid controversy.
</P>
<P>
   He visited Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and
Connecticut, which have a combined 22 electoral votes, as well as
the stop at Valley Forge in the crucial state of Pennsylvania, with
23 electoral votes. Most were invitation-only events, closed to the
voting public, although a few protesters showed up at a Vermont
rally waving signs that criticized Cheney for backing billions of
dollars for the military and for opposing Head Start as a US House
member.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst, Charles E. Cook Jr., editor of the Cook Political
Report, a Washington journal, said Cheney would have little
positive or negative impact on the election, ``which is the norm''
for a running mate. ``Lieberman is the exception,'' Cook said.
``That was an outside-the-box selection that triggered Gore's
comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, despite all of his years dealing with the press in
Washington, does not appear comfortable with reporters. That seemed
especially the case last week, which began when a microphone caught
Cheney agreeing with Bush's vulgar condemnation of a New York Times
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cheney had just 10 journalists with him on his
chartered 727 jet last week, aides said they could not persuade
Cheney on Wednesday or Thursday to chat with the press in the back
of the plane, either on or off the record, as Bush often does.
</P>
<P>
   He held a brief press conference at Valley Forge and canceled a
tentatively scheduled interview. The schedule did not seem heavy,
with two or three daily public events, along with some
fund-raisers. Nothing was public after 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Cheney leaves no doubt that he is in command of
his facts. To those who remember the way Dan Quayle struggled
through such appearances when he was picked for the vice
presidential slot in 1988, Cheney is the un-Quayle. No question is
too obscure, and like a good professor, he rephrases many questions
that the general audience may not understand.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney shows little interest in trying to win points for
style. A Cheney address is just that _ an address. The head is
cocked at a 45 degree angle, the lip is curled, the tone is flat
and stern. He typically begins his speeches by saying that ``life
was good'' this summer before Bush ``put the arm on me'' to be his
running mate, leaving the suggestion, perhaps unintended, that he
doesn't really want to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Westerner, a man of few words,'' Cheney says. Asked
about his religious belief, he contrasts himself to the way
Lieberman injects Orthodox Judaism into political discourse. He
says he is a Protestant and has never talked publicly about his
private beliefs _ and he is true to his word.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney made perhaps his most revealing comment on Thursday in
Manchester, N.H., when he told a roomful of veterans and employees
of a military subcontractor how much he loves to be alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an avid fisherman and hunter,'' Cheney said. ``I like to
get out all by myself with a fly rod; there's no one else around.
That's one of the more enjoyable parts of life.''

A MAN, A SPECIAL DOG, AND HOW THEY THRIVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
COLTER 
By Rick Bass. Houghton Mifflin. 160 pp. $22. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late in ``Colter,'' Rick Bass's heartfelt book about his German
shorthaired pointer, Colter mysteriously disappears one winter
evening. Bass feels grief closing in on him like the night itself,
having lost a dog that has been at his side for years, bird hunting
on the vast Montana prairie east of the Continental Divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dog like Colter sharpens your joy of all the seasons, and
for a while, sometimes a long while, such a dog seems capable, by
himself alone, of holding time in place _ of pinning it, and
holding it taut,'' Bass writes, drawing to a close his 16th book in
nearly as many years. ``And then when he is gone, it is as if the
world is taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Colter is indeed gone. Bass finds his remains about a year later
on a logging road near his Yaak Valley home with a bullet hole
through his spine. Bass buries him near his writing cabin, ``in
that sunken, blissful spot where he had napped, always waiting for
the next hunt.'' And to this day, ``even after burying his bones, I
have the feeling, every day, that I'm going to see him again _ am
going to hunt with him again, at least once more.''
</P>
<P>
   A poignant end to an eloquent book, one oriented about the
relationship between a man and his dog, through which Bass explores
such deeper themes as the transformation of the American West, the
imperative of environmentalism, the wonders of hunting, even man's
fate. Much is set against Montana's glorious grasslands and
mountains in autumn, making for the most impressive work from Bass
in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun's slant, early into September, still had enough bite
to burn off frost quickly the next day,'' Bass writes at the start
of an especially difficult hunt, occurring one month after one of
his other dogs, Ann, was accidentally killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove out into the country, found the vast ranch, parked on
the side of the road, and I waited for a few minutes, savoring the
blue sky, and freedom, and the health and vigor of my dog, and the
scent of sage. A distant line of willows snaked through the distant
prairie, beyond which lay the foothills. Colter was raring to go,
but I wanted to sit a moment longer, soaking in the autumn, and
this new place, new pursuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass should thank Colter for this book. Hunting with a dog, he
writes, takes one ``into new country, new territory: some
unexplored land, still in this life, but so sensate and crisp as to
seem beyond this life; everything is felt more sharply, more
intimately, and at a smoother, more supple pace. Even when things
are happening fast in the field there is a slowed down, or
timeless, quality.''
</P>
<P>
   That quality is just what Bass, who turned 40 while writing
``Colter,'' has needed. His relentless productivity, and aching
ambivalence over art versus activism, have taken their toll on his
recent work. Besides his books, he has written seemingly countless
pieces for publications as diverse as The Paris Review and Sports
Afield. After dazzling early work, much of what followed was
disappointing, including ``The Book of Yaak'' (1996), ``The New
Wolves'' (1999), and his first novel, ``Where the Sea Used to Be''
(1998).
</P>
<P>
   But with ``Colter,'' Bass seems to have indeed slowed down,
taking the time to draw upon his considerable talent, especially in
describing the natural landscape and its influence on those who
live on and with it. In so doing, he has crafted a narrative as
artful as it is activist, a weave he has sought as furiously as
Colter once stalked grouse.
</P>
<P>
   Through anecdotal chapters, Bass recalls when he got Colter as a
pup, when he sent him to a friend in Texas to be trained as a
pointer, how years earlier he had found two of his other dogs,
Homer and Ann, as pups on a Mississippi road, how as a child he had
an unwavering affinity with the natural world, especially turtles
and, oddly, dirt. There are early moments when Bass has not yet
established Colter as a character and his exultation over the dog
seems excessive. ``Oh, the wretched excess of the heart!'' he
writes, when missing Colter in Texas. At one point, Bass actually
apologizes for this excess.
</P>
<P>
   But as time passes and the hunts begin, Colter comes alive,
taking on qualities that are endearing, revealing as much about
Bass as about the dog because of the oneness between them that Bass
stresses throughout the book. Bass makes his societal critiques _
about true hunters versus road hunters, the loss of wilderness, the
false dichotomy between environmentalists and hunters, among
others. But he never leaves the story of man and dog, enabling him
to offer such commentary without artistic sacrifice; indeed,
enhancing that commentary by having it emanate from the story,
rather than become the story.
</P>
<P>
   Bass grieves. ``Colter was probably the greatest pointer who
ever ran,'' he writes. ``There will always be a hollow spot in me,
a burnt circle in the bottom of my stomach, whenever I think of
him: as if I am carrying a bucket of hot, hot ashes in the bottom
of my stomach _ the memory of how he ran, the memory of how he
was.'' But Bass should take heart in this simple, elegant book, one
as clean and clear as the human and natural landscapes it explores,
one that suggests an emerging return to form for an environmental
writer who has been among America's most important.

BORN OF THE CIVIL WAR AND BRED ON A WEB SITE

VALLEY OF THE SHADOW 
Two Communities in the American Civil War: The Eve of War 
By Edward L. Ayers and Anne S. Rubin 
Norton, 130 pp., accompanied by CD-ROM, $49.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considering the inexhaustible (if exhausting) stream of books
about the Civil War that appear in a year's time, it is not
surprising that numerous Web sites have sprung up to cover the same
territory. Now, with ``Valley of the Shadow,'' we have a book and
CD-ROM that have grown out of a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The valley in question is the ``Great Valley,'' lying between
the Allegheny Mountains and the Blue Ridge, running roughly
northeast-southwest from Pennsylvania through a corner of Maryland
and into western Virginia and thus down to Georgia _ thus crossing
the Mason-Dixon line, the traditional dividing line between North
and South. It was the scene of some of the major events and some of
the fiercest fighting of the Civil War. Harpers Ferry lies in the
valley, where the Shenandoah meets the Potomac; Stonewall Jackson
campaigned up and down the Shenandoah section of the valley in the
spring of 1862, and Philip Sheridan in 1864; Gettysburg lies some
25 miles east of the Pennsylvania section.
</P>
<P>
   For the past eight years, two communities in the valley _
Chambersburg, in Franklin County, Pa., and Staunton, in Augusta
County, Va. _ have been the focus of a digital history project at
the University of Virginia headed by historian Edward L. Ayers.
Co-author Anne S. Rubin is project manager of the Valley Project.
</P>
<P>
   The project's Web site, on-line since 1995, has been
well-received. The present package of book and CD-ROM, ``The Eve of
War,'' is to be the first of three covering the impact of the Civil
War on the two communities, which, the authors write, occupied
``strategic locations in the war'' as recruiting posts, hospital
bases, and supply depots.
</P>
<P>
   The package consists of a pleasantly written book (which could
stand as an introduction to the Civil War for the general reader)
and the CD-ROM. The latter contains hundreds of articles from
newspapers in the two communities, excerpts from diaries and
letters, census data, tax records, photographs of sites in the
communities, maps, and even four tunes played in period style by a
regionally based string band.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the assembled material is impressive (though
the reader/user will have to go to an atlas to figure out how far
it is from Chambersburg to Staunton, or from either to Harpers
Ferry, because there is no scale of miles on the map provided in
both the book and on the CD-ROM). But after the initial impression
of documentary riches, the question arises of just how useful all
this material is. Much of it could, of course, have been
incorporated into a traditional book _ and probably will be, in the
book Ayers is reported to be writing. But unless reader/users are
planning books of their own, knowing how many slaves were owned by
a particular Staunton resident _ as opposed to knowing what part
slavery played in the community as a whole, say _ is a superfluous
detail. (And not all that easy to decipher: A random search of the
slaveowning data for one of the leaders of the Confederate infantry
regiment formed in Augusta County turned up somewhat confusing
data.)
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Ayers and Rubin write that with the material
assembled on the CD-ROM, ``you can find your own answers to the
questions about the Civil War that have haunted Americans since
1861.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But a bit further on they rephrase that promise,
suggesting that by using the material assembled in the Valley
Project ``you can test the consensus view'' of the causes of the
Civil War ``and accept, reject, or modify it.'' That ``consensus
view,'' as they describe it, ``is that serious conflict between
North and South was bound to occur because the two societies were
organized on different principles, that the North gradually
awakened to the inhumanity of slavery over the course of the war,
and that Abraham Lincoln both embodied and led the moral growth of
the Union.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for ``Valley of the Shadow'' is that the data does
not clearly uphold this consensus view, nor does it entirely
discredit it. It is most likely to leave the would-be historian
confused.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta County, the southern one, ``had been a stronghold of
Unionism'' and was home to some 500 free blacks as well as 4,000
slaves. In the presidential election of 1860, it voted for John
Bell, the candidate of the compromise-seeking Constitutional Union
Party. In Franklin County, the northern one, a leading newspaper
was the southern-leaning Valley Spirit. The county went for Lincoln
in 1860, but John Breckinridge, who carried the solid South, was a
strong second. Franklin County, which sits on the Mason-Dixon line,
is no more a typical northern community than Augusta County is a
typical southern one. And in any case, the matter needs more
interpretation than is given here.
</P>
<P>
   But qualifications aside, there is no question that it is an
enjoyable experience to surf through the data on the CD-ROM,
clicking back and forth between tax records and city street maps _
and then indulge in the ``Daughter of the Stars'' waltz, a
period-sounding piece composed for the Valley Project. And at the
very least, the exercise might inspire a young reader/user into
some archival research of his or her own.

   Finally!
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of hype, the 2000 Summer Olympics kick off in
Sydney, on NBC at 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually they kicked off hours and hours ago, because
depending on where you live, it's, like, breakfast time on Saturday
over there. And that huge tape delay is going to be NBC's big
challenge in getting people to tune in for 441.5 hours of coverage
on NBC, CNBC, MSNBC and any other cable channels the peacock picks
up this week.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Costas and Katie Couric host tonight's celebration, which
features Australian stars such as ... Olivia Newton-John. (You were
expecting Midnight Oil, maybe?)
</P>
<P>
   Costas has the challenge of hosting the other nights of the
Games, through Oct. 1. He'll have to sell the competition via NBC's
patented storytelling techniques _ when we already know who's won
thanks to every other media outlet and the Internet. NBC has sold
millions and millions of dollars of ads betting they can pull it
off.
</P>
<P>
   But all those issues will fade away tonight, temporarily, with
the grandeur of the parade of nations and the excitement of the
Olympic torch coming into the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you're not an Olympics fan, and you're wondering where
all the new shows are on the other networks, we have some bad news
for you. The start of the fall TV season has been delayed till the
first week of October, so those new shows don't have to compete
with track and field.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' CBS at 8: The second B is for the boredom from
which we're all suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose Line Is It, Anyway?'' marathon, ABC at 8: Four episodes
of the improv comedy show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Blues,'' WB at 8: A night out for Daddy and Zoey. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor,'' CBS at 9: The network has scheduled two weeks of
reruns opposite NBC's ``Olympics.'' The tape delay is only slightly
longer. This was the most-watched summer series since Nielsen has
been keeping the statistic, and CBS is betting you'd rather watch
it again than, say, pole-vaulting when you already know the winner.
It may turn out to be a brilliant strategy, or it may be that we've
all had our fill of the castaways due to their relentless media
appearances since the show's finale on Aug. 23. But in any case,
the rats are paid for.
</P>
<P>
   ''20/20,'' ABC at 10: Part two of Peter Jennings' examination of
the early lives of George W. Bush and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Music Mania 2000,'' Fox at 8: Jacksonville concert features 'N
Sync, 98 Degrees, Sisqo, Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore, Destiny's
Child and several other people who are not Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CABLE CAST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie Brown,'' FX at 7:30: Quentin Tarantino's 1997
adaptation of Elmore Leonard's thriller stars Pam Grier, Samuel L.
Jackson and Robert Forster. Grier's the flight attendant who's

Fonda, Michael Keaton, Robert DeNiro, Michael Bowen and Chris
Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charley Varrick,'' AMC at 8: The late Walter Matthau stars as
a guy who robs a bank and finds out it holds a bunch of Mob money.
This is gonna be tricky. Don Siegel directed the 1973 film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix,'' HBO at 9:30: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne,
the crazy concept and some wild special effects. And no Olivia
Newton-John!
</P>
<P>
   ``Invisible Man,'' Sci-Fi at 8: Vincent Ventresca stars as the
subject of a government experiment with the Quicksilver gland.
Tonight, the Chinese government tries to steal him. Rerun.
</P>

</P>

ENTERTAINING OUR CRAVINGS FOR FATTY FOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Item: Women who watch ``Oprah Winfrey'' are seven times less
likely to crave fattening foods than women who watch other daytime
talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   This amazing factoid comes to us courtesy of DietSmart, an
online nutrition and fitness service (www.dietsmart.com) that
recently conducted a survey of Americans' food cravings in which
562 men and women were interviewed about which emotions,
situations, and types of entertainment make them crave certain
foods.
</P>
<P>
   The survey came about because, according to CEO Tamara Totah,
``we wanted to highlight some of the everyday life situations that
effect people's food cravings so we can help individuals recognize
the way emotions impact unhealthy food and diet choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Pass the doughnuts, please. Which reminds me, the survey also
found that 77 percent of Americans crave doughnuts most between 10
p.m. and midnight. That seems a little odd, even to one who craves
them at every waking moment. But so much about this survey seems
odd.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful as I am to know that women who watch Oprah are less
likely to crave fattening foods than those who watch Montel or
Rikki or Sally, I can't help but wonder about the researchers'
methods. What was their line of questioning? And how do they manage
to find the sort of person who comes up with these responses? It
can't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello. Do you have time to answer a few questions about your
fattening food cravings and how they relate to your entertainment
choices?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure. I'm just sitting here watching `Jerry Springer' and
eating a six-pack of Mounds bars.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd also like to know if the women they interviewed were less
likely to crave merely for the duration of Oprah's show? Or is
there something about watching Oprah that made them less likely to
want to pig out all the time?
</P>
<P>
   Could we solve the nation's obesity nightmare if we all sat down
to watch Oprah once a day? Is it possible? It seems too much to
hope, but Oprah is, after all, an amazing cultural force.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the DietSmart survey's other findings are a tad hard to
fathom too. For instance, ``Men who wear briefs were seven times
more likely to crave vegetables than men who wear boxers.''
</P>
<P>
   And this: ``71 percent of Republicans said that their craving
for fattening foods increased the week following the announcement
that Joe Lieberman would be Al Gore's running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other results are easier to understand, for example, ``84
percent of women surveyed who have children said that they crave
fattening foods.'' (And the other 16 percent were lying.)
</P>
<P>
   And this: ``88 percent of men craved fattening foods when their
in-laws visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly stress is a threat to the best of diet intentions. No
wonder we're a nation with so much to lose.
</P>
<P>
   But what are we to make of the fact that 62 percent of women
said they crave fattening foods after sex, as compared with only 6
percent of men? Maybe it has to be seen in relation to another
finding, that the emotion that most drove men to crave fattening
foods was feeling randy, while for women it was feeling sad.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that in the interest of fitness, women should watch
more Oprah and have less sex, while men should see less of their
in-laws and have more sex. Maybe DietSmart's next survey will be
about diet and divorce.

NEW MUSIC AND OLD, FROM DION TO THE BACKSTREET BOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether you're a troubled soul who swoons to the dark musings of
PJ Harvey or the good-natured type who prefers your ear candy light
as air a la Barenaked Ladies, it's going to be a blockbuster fall
for pop and rock CDs. Hotly anticipated new releases from such
titans as U2 and Madonna will arrive in the coming months, as will
fare for hungry devotees of cult icons Bjork and J Mascis. Major
collections from the archives of Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles will
also be in store racks in time for the giving season. Remember to
include yourself on the list of deserving recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The sweetest music to our ears is news that on Oct. 3 Brit
rockers Radiohead will release ``Kid A,'' their first album since
1997's brilliant ``OK Computer.'' Early word is that the album is
all about atmosphere, losing hooks and choruses in the wake of
dreamy moods and a soaring, prog-rock feel.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities, however, begin immediately. It's been five long
years waiting for the follow-up to Joan Osborne's delicious
``Relish,'' but ``Righteous Love'' will finally arrive Tuesday, a
massive release day that includes teen star Christina Aguilera's
Spanish-language album ``Mi Reflejo'' (featuring new songs and
translated versions of five tracks from last year's eponymous
debut), Barenaked Ladies' ``Maroon,'' Rickie Lee Jones's ``It's
Like This,'' Tom Tom Club's ``The Good, the Bad, and the Funky''
(ex-Talking Heads Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth's first new album
in eight years), Irish quartet the Corrs's ``In Blue,'' Boyz II
Men's ``Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya,'' Underworld's ``Live,'' and
Emmylou Harris's ``Red Dirt Girl.'' Also in stores Tuesday is ``The
Jimi Hendrix Experience'' _ a four-CD boxed set of 56 rare and
previously unreleased songs packaged (of course) in purple velvet
with an 80-page booklet _ and remastered and repackaged editions of
the late, great Nick Drake's three full-length albums.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna continues mining electronic pop on ``Music,'' her eighth
album of new material, due out Sept. 19. Recorded in London, the
album trains a spotlight on French house/dance pioneer Mirwais
Ahmadzai, who co-wrote 6 of 10 tracks and co-produced the album.
(Madonna is also recording English-language versions of some of the
best-known Brazilian soccer songs for ``The Passion for Football,''
an upcoming movie about the sport.) Also out that week: Icelandic
art-pop goddess Bjork's ``Selma Songs,'' frat-boy-rap-rocker Limp
Bizkit's ``Chocolate Starfish and Hot Dog Flavored Water,'' and
Fastball's ``Harsh Light of Day.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
And that's not all &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler returns Sept. 26 with
``Sailing to Philadelphia,'' his first album of new solo material
since 1996's ``Golden Heart,'' with guest vocalists James Taylor,
Van Morrison, and members of Squeeze. Also that day: Paul Simon's
``You're the One,'' the bard's first non-world-music-oriented album
since 1983's ``Hearts and Bones,'' and Morphine's ``Bootleg:
Detroit,'' recorded by a fan on March 7, 1994 at St. Andrew's Hall
in the Motor City and edited and mixed under the supervision of the
late Mark Sandman; collectors have been shelling out big time for
promotional-only copies of Sting's ``Brand New Day Tour: Live From
the Universal Amphitheatre,'' which is finally being released
commercially. The soundtrack to ``Girlfight'' features the first
new track from Santana since last year's smash album ``Smooth,''
and ``Bowie at the Beeb,'' a limited edition three-CD set features
live BBC radio show performances. Two discs are culled from shows
taped between 1968 and 1972, and the third is a live album of his
recent performances this past summer.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 3: punk rockers Green Day return with ``Warning.'' Oct. 10:
the Wallflowers finally issue their third CD, ``Breach,'' after a
four-year wait (which reportedly involved a bad case of
sudden-fame-induced writer's block for frontman Jakob Dylan)
following the breakthrough album ``Bringing Down the Horse.'' On
that day, the ever-unpredictable Van Morrison releases ``You Win
Again,'' a collection of duets with Linda Gail Lewis, sister of
Jerry Lee Lewis. They sing rockabilly, blues, and country covers
including three Hank Williams tunes.
</P>
<P>
   South African vocal group Ladysmith Black Mambazo's body of work
is condensed into a 17-track compilation, ``Ladysmith Black
Mambazo: The Warner Brothers Collection,'' with liner notes by Paul
Simon (whose album ``Graceland'' introduced the group to a world of
listeners), out Oct. 17. Also that day, alt-rapper Everlast
releases ``Eat at Whitey's,'' a followup to 1998's triple-platinum
``Whitey Ford Sings the Blues,'' with guest performances from
Santana and N'Dea Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   The following week (Oct. 24) sees the release of British fringe
icon Polly Jean Harvey's sixth album, ``Stories From the City,
Stories From the Sea.'' Word is that the disc merges the punk
aesthetic of her early albums with the melancholy air of her recent
work. Also on Oct. 24: former Dinosaur Jr. frontman and influential
indie hero J. Mascis and his new band the Fog issue ``More Light,''
Southern rappers Outkast release ``Stankonia,'' and
folk/rock/doo-wop legend Dion is immortalized in the three-disc
collection ``Dion: King of the Streets,'' which spans his 40-year
career. The set features liner notes by Dave Marsh, and written
tributes from Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, Paul Simon,
and Waylon Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   On Halloween, U2 releases its 10th studio album, ``All That You
Can't Leave Behind,'' produced by longtime associates Brian Eno and
Daniel Lanois. In the works for two years, the album reportedly
still plays with technology but also revives the elemental surge of
early U2. Marilyn Manson returns to his Goth roots on an
as-yet-untitled album, newly minted Boston rock stars Godsmack
release ``Awake,'' notorious rap-rockers Insane Clown Posse release
the well-titled double CD ``Bizzar Bazaar,'' and Erykah Badu
releases ``Mama's Gun,'' all on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   November 7: The Dave Matthews Band and Ricky Martin release
studio efforts (no titles for either yet), and Jennifer Lopez
wisely goes for the fast follow-up to ``On the Six'' with
``Passionate Journey.'' The Beatles legacy continues to bloat with
the Nov. 14 release of ``Beatles Ones,'' a 27-track CD containing
all of the band's singles that reached No. 1 in the States or in
the UK. And finally, teenage girls will want to start lining up for
the Nov. 21 release date of the next Backstreet Boys disc.

WHAT BUSH COULD LEARN FROM SHAHEEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- At its most recent gathering, the National
Governors Association was explicit on the question of prescription
drug insurance coverage for severely squeezed elderly Americans _ a
national problem if ever the adjective applied.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the solution, the National Governors Association said
in a policy resolution (remember, well over half its 50 members are
Republicans), aimed at both Congress and the current and any
potential replacement administration, do not construct it in a way
that places administrative burdens or costs on the individual
states.
</P>
<P>
   It's a recipe for chaos, went the reasoning, as well as the
worst kind of unfunded mandate (to use the governors' favorite
pejorative) to impose on the states at a time when drug prices are
exploding with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   So what does George W. Bush do? Ignoring his colleagues, and
instead juggling special-interest group political interests, he
comes up with a plan aimed like a dagger right at the states' vital
interests, as well as dependent on them.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of mistake that could only have been made by a
governor from one of the minority of states that under his
``leadership'' has done absolutely nothing to help in this area.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, plodding and boring Al Gore _ so plodding and
boring that he actually enjoys talking policy with people who know
their subject _ listens and responds with a proposal to give the
elderly a way of getting desperately needed coverage through an
old, reliable friend called Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   To understand, consider a fairly typical chunk of real estate
called northern New England, and in particular a battleground state
called New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   As the national politicos were striking their primary sets last
winter, Governor Jeanne Shaheen had the typically good sense to
convene a planning session in Concord with her two upcountry
brothers, Governors Howard Dean of Vermont and Angus King of Maine.
Their mission _ instead of some silly notion of ``solving'' a
problem that knows no borders _ was to figure out how to at least
pool their populations to enhance their negotiating clout with drug
companies to at least make a difference at the margin on the price
front.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Shaheen told me last week, the new group will begin
soliciting formal proposals from insurers. The thinking is that in
an initial phase those in the Medicaid program, which includes
those in nursing homes and other assisted living arrangements,
would form a natural pool. Subsequently, the hope is to be able to
add other populations on a voluntary basis _ retired state
employees, for example.
</P>
<P>
   It can make a difference, but there is no claim that it can make
the difference. Shaheen, again with typical diligence, has already
learned the lesson by helping the elderly in her state get
discounts on their drug purchases from public-spirited pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Almost at once, she said, fully 75,000 people signed up _ a
dramatic indication of how big this problem is, given that the
total number of seniors without drug coverage in New Hampshire is
83,000, or about a third the total medicare population.
</P>
<P>
   Such a program, laudable though it is, can hardly do more than
make a dent in the problem, since the problem is the drug
companies, not the drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign was flat wrong in claiming that a national
program _ either for the poor or the nonpoor _ can build on 23
existing state programs. As in northern New England, the real
picture is quite different.
</P>
<P>
   For the 28,000 New Hampshire elderly who live on less than
$13,000 a year, there are no details about proposed benefits or
restrictions. For everybody else, there is just the vague, unfunded
promise of life on the desparate lookout for an insurance company
willing to cover drug costs as part of a managed care alternative
to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are none, a hint of how meaningless private
insurance ``choice'' for those in need.
</P>
<P>
   From Gore, there is Medicare and choice, with specific benefits
and affordable costs (none for the poor). Simple as that.

A SEASON OF DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Between now and the end of the year, something like 150 new
movies will open. That's too many. We wouldn't dream of avalanching
them all down on your head. Instead, we've compiled a list of the
golden dozen. Well, OK, make that the 30 or so new movies we're
most curious to see. (If I could count, I'd have been a banker.)
Don't look for any unifying theme or concept to cover these films
like an umbrella. They're all over the place, the way a movie
season's offerings should be _ adaptations, remakes, sequels, even
a handful of original works. If nothing else, they'll at least
raise the moviegoing year above its far from stratospheric current
level. If, if, if. As my father used to say, if we had some ham, we
could have ham and eggs, if we had some eggs. At any rate, here are
most of the films we'll be clucking about.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington probably won't be Oscar-nominated for it, but
``Remember the Titans,'' in which he plays an unpopular choice as
the football &UR;  &LR; coach of a reluctantly desegregated Virginia high
school in 1971, promises to put new spin on the pigskin genre.
``Almost Famous,'' Cameron Crowe's look back at his
peach-fuzz-cheeked beginnings as a rock journalist, smells like a
winner, boosted by heads-up performances from Billy Crudup's
mixed-up rocker and Kate Hudson's even more mixed-up groupie.
``Nurse Betty,'' Neil LaBute's carnival of criminality starring
Renee Zellweger as a traumatized innocent who emigrates to the
world of her favorite soap opera, is already showing strong legs.
Bjork, Iceland's gift to the A-list, and Danish director Lars von
Trier break new ground in their musical that wowed Cannes, ``Dancer
in the Dark.'' And who'd want to miss Christopher Guest? He's back
in ``Spinal Tap,'' and surfaces again with his ``Waiting for
Guffman'' follow-up, ``Best in Show,'' taking on the world of dog
shows.
</P>
<P>
   We'll be seeing a lot of Helen Hunt between now and Christmas.
She'll star opposite Richard Gere in Robert Altman's new ``Dr. T
and the Women.'' She'll be seen briefly as Tom Hanks's girlfriend,
waiting for him to be rescued from a desert island in Robert
Zemeckis's ``Cast Away'' _ the big holiday buzz movie, partly
because Hanks interrupted filming for a year so he could lose 50
pounds to look right in the enforced slimming mode. She'll be the
other half of Mel Gibson's first romantic comedy, ``What Women
Want.'' First, though, Hunt stars opposite Kevin Spacey and Haley
Joel Osment in ``Pay It Forward,'' as the alcoholic mom of Osment's
kid bent on improving the world, starting with her.
</P>
<P>
   Robert De Niro is another luminary who won't restrict himself to
one film next month. First he plays a guy who's unreceptive to the
idea of getting Ben Stiller as a son-in-law, in ``Meet the
Parents.'' Then he plays the hard-nosed Navy instructor of Cuba
Gooding Jr.'s first black master diver, in ``Men of Honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Damon carves out a nice chunk of multiplex turf in two
films that promise quality. He plays the role Robert Redford once
eyed in ``The Legend of Bagger Vance,'' combining golf and
mysticism, aided by a gifted caddy played by Will Smith. Redford
directs. Damon also will be seen opposite Henry Thomas in Billy Bob
Thornton's long-gestating film of Cormac McCarthy's novel ``All the
Pretty Horses,'' about young bucks chasing adventure in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow arrive in ``Bounce,''
about a man who gives up his air ticket to another man, then falls
in love with the guy's widow after the plane crashes. Paltrow's out
there with a second film, ``Duets,'' about the world of karaoke;
it's directed by her father, Bruce Paltrow. Most prominent among
the seasonal teamings are Jim Carrey and Dr. Seuss, in Ron Howard's
``Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas.'' This one looks
huge, what with Carrey's green makeup and the season's
never-to-be-underestimated Bah, humbug! factor. Then there's Bruce
Willis and his ``Sixth Sense'' director, M. Night Shamalayan, back
with another supernatural thriller, ``Unbreakable,'' in which
Willis inexplicably survives a train crash. Perhaps co-star Samuel
L. Jackson has something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Having no connection at all to ``The Sixth Sense'' is ``The 6th
Day,'' in which Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a helicopter pilot who
gets cloned. Michael Douglas and his fiance, Catherine Zeta-Jones,
appear not, as you might expect, in a ``Honeymooners'' remake, but
in ``Traffic,'' refashioning a British TV series about the drug
trade. Another high-impact teaming figures to be that of Cameron
Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu in ``Charlie's Angels.'' Their
mission: to stop an evil plot to poison Charlie, no matter how many
explosions it takes or how many wet suits they have to go through.
</P>
<P>
   Among the remakes is ``Get Carter,'' with Sylvester Stallone
top-cast in a Seattle-based version of the 1971 British gangland
revenge drama that starred Michael Caine, who gives his imprimatur
to the new version via a bartender's role. Also joining the remake
parade is the Dudley Moore-Peter Cook ``Bedazzled,'' with Elizabeth
Hurley climbing into the devil suit this time. Speaking of the
devil, Adam Sandler stars as his good son, going up against his
hellraising brothers Rhys Ifans and ex-wrestler Tiny Lister Jr. in
``Little Nicky.'' Don't confuse ``Bedazzled'' with ``Bamboozled,''
the new Spike Lee movie in which Damon Wayans's writer rubs the
white media establishment's nose in its racism by penning a
contemporary minstrel show.
</P>
<P>
   And the sequels: Glenn Close once again teases her hair
outrageously and climbs into any number of politically incorrect
costumes as Cruella De Vil in ``102 Dalmatians,'' in which reminds
anyone who needs reminding that she just can't leave those spotted
dogs alone. The big noise among the sequels, either smashing or
crashing, will come from ``Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,'' filmed
in what will seem like lavish color compared to the original.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the witch hunters will be asked to provide all the
year-end creepy panache. In Philip Kaufman's ``Quills,'' Geoffrey
Rush's Marquis de Sade finds his style cramped by Michael Caine's
serious asylum keeper. Then there's ``Shadow of the Vampire,''
which attempts to do for F.W. Murnau's 1922 silent ``Nosferatu''
what ``Gods and Monsters'' did for ``Frankenstein.'' Expect kiddie
vampires, too _ specifically Jonathan Lipnicki in ``The Little
Vampire,'' based on the popular children's book.
</P>
<P>
   History, the gift that keeps on giving, steps up to the plate
resonantly with ``Thirteen Days,'' in which Bruce Greenwood's JFK,
Steven Culp's RFK, and Kevin Costner's Kenny O'Donnell sweat out
the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. The Merchant-Ivory team offers
another of Henry James's opulent upper-crust soap operas, ``The
Golden Bowl,'' in which an American father and daughter (Nick Nolte
and Kate Beckinsale) are faced with the fact that the daughter's
husband (Jeremy Northam) is having an affair.
</P>
<P>
   Film buffs will recognize the historical echo in the new Coen
brothers comedy, ``O, Brother, Where Art Thou?'' That's the title
of the overblown social-consciousness drama Preston Sturges
satirized in ``Sullivan's Travels.'' In the Coen brothers' take,
three convicts _ George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson _
escape into the Depression-era South. Sturges also seems to be a
guardian angel of David Mamet's showbiz comedy ``State and Main,''
about a movie company on location _ loose morals, cell phones, and
all _ in a Vermont town.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is a handful of films with nothing in common but
the fact that they look irresistible. How, for instance, can you
not want to see a film starring Cate Blanchett and Hilary Swank? In
this case, it's the spooky-sounding ``The Gift,'' in which
Blanchett plays a young Savannah widow who tunes into her
neighbors' secrets, including Swank's abuse at the hands of her
husband, played by Keanu Reeves. Jack Nicholson and Sean Penn,
building on their ``Crossing Guard'' collaboration, team up again
in ``The Pledge,'' with Penn behind the camera as director and
Nicholson up front as a retired cop bulldogging an unsolved
homicide. Then there's Ang Lee, promising Hong Kong Yuletide action
with ``Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'' Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle
Yeoh provide the acrobatics. How many films is that? More than 30,
maybe. But who's counting?

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ What is a gigantic statue of Joseph Hooker doing in
front of the State House next to the likes of Daniel Webster,
Horace Mann, and John F. Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   Hooker, after all, is best remembered by Civil War buffs as the
Union general who led 138,000 troops to bloody defeat by Robert E.
Lee, who had a mere 62,000 men, at Chancellorsville, Va., in the
first week of May 1863.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Hooker was ``a most objectionable fellow in all
kinds of ways,'' says Shelby Foote, the eminent Civil War
historian.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker is commonly thought to be the eponym for a prostitute.
Hooker biographer Walter H. Hebert quotes one observer who examined
Hooker's headquarters at the Army of the Potomac and called it ``a
combination of bar-room and brothel.'' Few doubt the gamy
connection between the man and the red light district in
Washington, known during the war as ``Hooker's Division.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is believed now that the origin of the term predates
him, Hooker's dissolute behavior in uniform has forever tethered
him to the oldest profession.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Francis Adams Jr., brevetted as a brigadier general in
the Civil War, could abide neither man nor monument. ``Never since
it has been placed there have I passed by the front of the State
House without feeling a sense of wrong and insult at the presence,
opposite the head of Park Street, of the equestrian statue of
Hooker,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``That statue,'' he continued, ``I look upon as an opprobrium
cast on every genuine Massachusetts man who served in the Civil
War. Hooker in no way and in no degree represents the typical
soldiership of the Commonwealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, few passers-by know the colorful history of General
Hooker, or the origin of the looming bronze statue in his honor.
But the monument, like the man, has been controversial from the
opening bell.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after its dedication on June 25, 1903, Massachusetts
veterans were fuming over a bronze tablet on it listing the man's
military accomplishments because, incredibly, they considered it
not laudatory enough.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, some 3,000 veterans in the state signed a petition
demanding its removal because they found the inscription, ``A
Soldier In The Army That Kept The Nation Whole,'' demeaning to
Hooker. Unmoved by its simple humility, they were convinced that
the major general warranted grander distinction than a mere
soldier.
</P>
<P>
   To make the case, an organization called the Hooker Brigade
Committee published a pamphlet entered at State House hearings on
the subject titled: ``The Hooker Veterans Are Only Asking For What
Is Right.''
</P>
<P>
   The veterans prevailed. The offending tablet was removed and
over 500 copies of the commemorative book about the Hooker statue
and its dedication were ceremoniously burned in Furnace (NU)3
beneath the State House. But no new tablet replaced the old one.
Wiser heads concluded what was good enough for Webster was also
good enough for Hooker; just the name would do.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of the controversy, termed ``a long and bitter
fight'' by The Boston Journal, speaks to the strength of the
nascent veterans' movement in Massachusetts after the Civil War. It
coalesced in The Grand Army of the Republic, the powerful group
formed in 1866 to represent Northern veterans. (Confederate states
had their own veterans organizations.) It served as a model for the
American Legion, founded in 1919 by American soldiers in France.
</P>
<P>
   That the statue was built with taxpayers' dollars speaks to the
muscle of the veterans lobby. The Legislature approved $50,000 for
the memorial _ large money in those days. This was one of the early
cases in which public, rather than private, money was used for such
memorials.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Massachusetts veterans adored Hooker, who was popular
with his troops if not with President Lincoln, who fired him as
commander of the Army of the Potomac less than two months after
Chancellorsville. Their feelings were shared by thousands of others
who had served under him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soldiers were delighted with Hooker,'' concedes Foote.
``He fed them well and gave them decent clothes and shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooker materialized in bronze from the gifted hands of sculptor
Daniel Chester French, who crafted the Lincoln Memorial. A Hooker
veteran concluded, ``The verdict of the art-loving public of
Massachusetts is that the Hooker statue is the finest equestrian
statue in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooker was also memorialized as a vehicle to honor all
Massachusetts men who fought for the Union. The veterans needed a
symbol, and the pickings were slim.
</P>
<P>
   Augustus St. Gaudens had already completed the exquisite bas
relief across Beacon Street dedicated to the 54th Massachusetts
Regiment _ the first ``colored'' unit raised in the North _ led by
the young Boston patrician Robert Gould Shaw. The memorial was
dedicated on May 31, 1897.
</P>
<P>
   The other Bay State commanders had not bathed themselves in
glory. ``With Butler, Banks, and Hooker, Massachusetts had quite a
remarkable trio,'' drily notes Peter Drummey, librarian of the
Massachusetts Historical Society, which houses a rich trove of
material on Hooker.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Butler, the Union general known as ``Spoons'' while
commanding the Union occupation of New Orleans, lasted one year as
Massachusetts governor before resigning in 1883 amid withering
animosity. Nathaniel Banks, another Bay State general, was known as
``Stonewall Jackson's quartermaster'' because of the amount of
materiel and ordnance captured from his command by the
Confederates, according to Drummey.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker's connections to Massachusetts were thin. While born in
Hadley, the grandson of a veteran of the American Revolution, he
spent the rest of his life outside of the state after graduating
from West Point in 1837. He resigned from the army in 1853 and
bought a farm in Sonoma, Calif., where he lived until the outbreak
of the war. Today, his papers are housed at the Huntington Library
in San Marino, near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a century of harsh judgment, Hooker is enjoying a
comeback among some historians. Author Stephen Sears argued in a
recent book that a head injury Hooker sustained at Chancellorsville
clouded his judgment during much of the three-day battle. James
McPherson, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Battle Cry of
Freedom,'' agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``All evidence points to a severe concussion,'' says McPherson.
``He was really not himself, but the medical director of the Army
of the Potomac refused to certify him as unfit for command.'' But
that allowance, he says, is not enough to rescue Hooker's overall
military reputation as ``one of the failures'' of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Still, says McPherson, ``Lesser men than Hooker have statues
around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   True. Dotting our landscape are monuments that made sense when
they were commissioned but look bizarre today. The Hooker statue,
in contrast, struck some as weird from the start. But then they
misread the growing voice of American veterans.

THE ARROGANCE OF POWER 
The Secret World of Richard Nixon. 
By Anthony Summers. Viking. 544 pp. Illustrated. $29.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great defining question of Watergate (the great defining
scandal of Richard Nixon's career) was ``What did the president
know and when did he know it?'' Anthony Summers's much-publicized
new book about Nixon has a great defining question, too: What
didn't the president do, and when didn't he do it?
</P>
<P>
   Summers, a British investigative reporter who has published
books on the Kennedy assassination, Marilyn Monroe, and J. Edgar
Hoover, presents a Nixon of nearly unrelieved venality, ambition,
and pettiness. Summers's Nixon could as well have been labeled Sick
Dick as Tricky Dick. Summers says he drank too much, abused pills,
secretly relied on psychotherapy, was emotionally unstable, and
beat his wife. Not that there wasn't also trickiness: He took money
from organized crime (he took money from pretty much anyone) and
even stooped to betraying his country (by encouraging South
Vietnam, on the eve of the 1968 election, to refuse to join the
United States in peace talks with North Vietnam).
</P>
<P>
   The astonishing thing about Summers's book is how little it
enlarges _ or, for that matter, diminishes _ the conventional
portrait of Nixon. He was the only president to resign from office,
after all; and despite the two decades he spent assiduously
cultivating his image, no real historical revision of his career
has yet taken hold. More important, almost all Summers's
revelations elaborate on things previously known about Nixon rather
than break new ground. There are relatively few names in his index
that do not appear in that of, say, Stephen Ambrose's three-volume
biography.
</P>
<P>
   It's not news Nixon took sleeping pills, for example, or
occasionally saw a pyschotherapist, Dr. Arnold Hutschnecker. What
is news is Summers's assertion that one of the drugs may have been
the anti-epileptic medication Dilantin and his having spoken at
length with Hutschnecker. And the one thing that hasn't seen print
before, the accusation that Nixon struck his wife on at least one
occasion (and possibly more), is based on a single third-hand
account. Furthermore, it ignores the larger, and arguably more
damning, truth that Pat Nixon was clearly a battered wife
emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, are Summers's many allegations plausible?
Certainly, based on what we know about Nixon and the extensiveness
of Summers's research. He and his wife conducted more than a
thousand interviews for ``The Arrogance of Power''; he is clearly
conversant with the archival record; and the book boasts a copious
bibliography.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in history, as in a court of law, plausibility is not good
enough. Almost all Summers's allegations lie in what one might call
the shadow of the subjunctive. ``May,'' ``might,'' and ``could''
appear far more often than such Nixon standbys as ``lied,''
``bugged,'' and ``resigned.'' Indeed, Summers writes as a
prosecuting attorney under the Napoleonic Code: The accused is
guilty until proven innocent. Whenever there are conflicting
statements about culpability, whenever the evidence is wholly
circumstantial or inferential, the judgment invariably goes against
Nixon. After a while, one begins to wonder. What Summers writes
about a purported attempt by Howard Hughes to bribe Nixon applies
across the board here: ``Yet the question remains: In this gallery
of corrupters and corrupted, men who suffered convenient memory
lapses or simply lied, whose account can be deemed reliable?''
</P>
<P>
   Consider two examples. The man who claims to have introduced
Nixon to Dilantin, Jack Dreyfuss Jr., the founder of Wall Street's
Dreyfuss Fund, was well known as both a proselytizer for the drug
and as a generous contributor to the Republican Party. It is
easier, perhaps, to imagine Nixon placating Dreyfuss by accepting a
bottle of pills and later telling him how helpful they had been,
without ever having used them, than is his having acted as his own
pharmacist. Conversely, Hutschnecker's comments are nearly all
self-serving in the extreme (of the ``Then I told the president . .
.'' and ``If only he'd listened to me . . .'' variety). Nor does
their having come from a 97-year-old increase the reader's faith in
them.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, a certain numbness sets in, so unrelenting is
Summers's litany of illegality, immorality, and irrationality. The
obvious literary parallel is with Seymour Hersh's ``The Dark Side
of Camelot,'' about John F. Kennedy. Summers's book is the more
impressive of the two, but also the less alive. Maybe it's owing to
the fundamentally differing characters of Nixon and Kennedy, but
Hersh's book at least had an occasional juice and excitement to it
that ``The Arrogance of Power'' utterly lacks. Tabloid readers are
even less likely to be reading Summers's book than historians are.
</P>
<P>
   Massive as his research is, Summers's imaginativeness is almost
nonexistent: ``imaginativeness'' not in any Edmund Morris sense of
making things up but rather that of reaching out to another human
being and trying to imagine how he or she lived and thought and
felt. The enduring fascination of Richard Nixon has as much to do
with who and why as with what and how. The what and how of
Summers's book can, and will, be argued over for some time to come.
The who and why are hardly there.

2 Takes By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL _ It has all the makings of a messy urban-suburban
brouhaha, the kind that splits mammoth cities such as Houston and
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown boosters propose an expensive project to ignite lagging
revitalization efforts. But those plans attract opposition from the
hinterlands, where penny-pinching taxpayers balk at forking out
more money.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston and Dallas, referendums for downtown sports
facilities have broken down over regional lines in recent years,
with those living far from the central business district opposing
them.
</P>
<P>
   But a similar rift in Harrison County, a sleepy East Texas
community of about 60,000?
</P>
<P>
   You bet your Santa Claus boots.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, county residents narrowly defeated a $5 million
referendum to repair the courthouse, which has hit hard times since
county offices left it in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   On one side _ rural residents wary of government spending. On
the other _ city dwellers who benefit from 750,000 visitors
flocking here between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve for a
Christmas light show anchored by the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Now, local business leaders are trying to reassure the region's
tourism industry that the annual Wonderland of Lights will continue
this Christmas despite rumors to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, opponents who led the taxpayer revolt are scrambling
to raise private funds to pay for what they don't think taxpayers
should.
</P>
<P>
   And stuck in the middle is the courthouse, boarded-up and closed
a week after the referendum failed by the narrowest of margins _ 47
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe the people here would let this happen to the
courthouse,'' said Jim Nash, who owns a golf store just off the
courthouse square.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're supposed to take care of one of the few precious things
you have left.''
</P>
<P>
   Each Christmas since 1987, Marshall has decorated itself for
Christmas, the brainchild of a local newspaperman who claimed a
revelation about the courthouse bathed in lights. Other cities in
the region now emulate the Marshall celebration, which has become
one of the largest lighting displays in the country. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In the festival's early years, volunteers adorned the
Renaissance Revival courthouse's pediments, porticos and &UR;  &LR; giant
columns with lights.
</P>
<P>
   Lights were later bolted to the courthouse, remaining there
year-round.
</P>
<P>
   As the festival attracted more observers, the Chamber of
Commerce hired a small staff to assist the volunteer effort. The
lights spread to other buildings and houses throughout town.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, there were roughly 9 million lights, strung along
1,000 miles of wiring around town. Locals estimate that 750,000
people visited the event last year, with most coming from outside
the county of 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up the morning after the referendum and saw that
it lost, I cried,'' said chamber president Connie Ware. ``I was sad
not just because it is such a wonderful building that should be
preserved but because the Wonderland of Lights is so important to
our community.''
</P>
<P>
   The courthouse, built on one of the seven hills around Marshall,
was completed in 1901 to replace the one destroyed in an 1888 fire
that killed the courthouse cat that could not be persuaded to
abandon her home.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Marshall had become a booming railroad city after
New York railroad tycoon Jay Gould abandoned nearby Jefferson when
city fathers said they preferred being a port for steam engines.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with money, county officials hired architect James Riely
Gordon, who helped build 15 other courthouses from 1889 to 1902,
including 12 that still stand.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an imposing yellow-brick and limestone courthouse
that include pink limestone from the Hill Country quarry that
supplied the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon went on to design the Arizona Capitol before moving to
New York City, where he was president of the New York Society of
Architects.
</P>
<P>
   What he left in Texas _ stellar designs in Harrison, Bexar,
Ellis and McLennan counties _ are considered the best of the
state's courthouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``His courthouses capture the essence of the spirit of the
golden age of architecture,'' said museum consultant Conover Hunt.
``They speak to the high aspirations of the people who tamed the
frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   But preserving beauty was not a major concern in the early
1960s, when county officials needed space. So in 1964, they opened
a bland-but-functional courthouse across the street. Over time, the
old courthouse, as it is called, came to hold a historical society,
a local museum and a genealogy library.
</P>
<P>
   But the building deteriorated from negligence and lack of use as
Marshall's boom days were over.
</P>
<P>
   No one thought about tearing the building down, largely because
it meant so much to the small city of about 30,000. It is a piece
of their history and lore.
</P>
<P>
   One can still see where the granddaughter of Judge Sam Hall, the
daughter of former Congressman Sam Hall Jr., carved her
grandfather's name into the black enamel lining the cast iron
staircase outside his courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s, a hobo once lived in the crawl space where the
clock was kept. To reach his home, the hobo had to crawl up two
steel ladders outside the dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than a courthouse. It has been the center of this
town for 100 years,'' said County Judge Rodney Gilstrap.

   2nd Take COURTHOUSE: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, local government and business leaders agreed
that the courthouse needed attention, he said.
</P>
<P>
   They hired Hunt, who helped prepare the Sixth Floor Exhibit at
Dallas' Texas School Book Depository.
</P>
<P>
   After studying the various problems _ a leaky dome,
moisture-soaked bricks, decaying walls and floors _ the cost to
update the building was at least $6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the estimate was removing ancillary walls and floors
added to a two-story courtroomthat Gilstrap said once resembled the
one in the movie To Kill a Mockingbird.
</P>
<P>
   The most pressing need was the roof. So using $1.5 million in
local, city and county funds, the roof was restored to its full
golden glory. The other $5 million has been hard to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   Gilstrap said the county approached the Texas Historic
Commission for a portion of the $50 million the 1999 Legislature
appropriated for courthouse repairs throughout Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But facing a high demand for that money, the historic commission
decided to allocate for courthouses built before 1900, a near miss
for the Harrison County building, Gilstrap said.
</P>
<P>
   That left the county looking within for the money, ultimately
deciding to ask voter approval for a 1-cent property tax hike to
pay for the $5 million project.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tax increase meant just $5 extra for owners of a
$50,000 house, an anti-tax group in Harrison County used the
proposal to generate steam for its organization.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Citizens for Better Government, is headed by local
real estate agent Fuzzy Harmon, who was overwhelmingly defeated by
Gilstrap for the judge's position in 1998. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Using a campaign based on the idea that repairing the
courthouse was a waste of taxpayers' money, Harmon was able to
appeal to rural voters who don't benefit as much from the annual
Christmas tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bad business, you know what I mean?'' Harmon said. ``I
mean, you can build a house for $70 a square foot, and it would
have cost $338 a square foot to repair the courthouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside Marshall, the referendum passed in all but one precinct.
</P>
<P>
   But in rural Harrison County, where more than half the voters
live, the referendum failed in 17 of 19 rural voting precincts.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant was the 5-1 margin of defeat on the county's
western edge, where neighboring Longview has spilled over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The residents there work in Longview, and they are tied to
Longview,'' Gilstrap said. ``They don't really care what happens to
Marshall, or the courthouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the election, Gilstrap persuaded the
county commissioners to close the courthouse, kicking out the
library, museum and historic society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't argue all over the county that the courthouse
wasn't safe, and it's not, and keep it open,'' Gilstrap said.
</P>
<P>
   The closing caused alarm from those in the tourism industry, who
began calling with worries that it would mean no Christmas tour. As
a result, the chamber is spending extra dollars in advertising to
counter those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still can't believe he (Harmon) did this,'' Ware said.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that most business leaders are rankled with him, Harmon,
who intends to run for judge again, has pledged to work with
Gilstrap and other courthouse supporters to find additional private
money.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon has proposed charity golf tournaments, an Internet Web
site and taping a documentary about the courthouse that could be
used like an informercial soliciting donations. Or perhaps, the
courthouse could be sold to a private developer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And despite being cast as a pariah after the referendum _ having
a rock thrown through his business window and being threatened _
Harmon said he will not give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I knew how to do events that raised money when I was in
the Jaycees,'' Harmon said. ``You have to make these things fun,
you know what I mean? I know we can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilstrap isn't so sure there is enough private money available
for such a mammoth project. ``He hasn't proposed a bake sale but
maybe that's next,'' Gilstrap said sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   So the judge intends to seek additional state funds if the
Legislature allocates more courthouse restoration money.
</P>
<P>
   And he will examine other ways to finance the building with
local tax dollars, though he doesn't intend to seek another bond
referendum such as the one that failed.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the courthouse will be renovated, he said. Time is
on their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``This courthouse has been here a long time, and it will be here
a long time to come,'' Gilstrap said while climbing a ladder that
led to the room where the hobo once lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not get to it this year, or next,'' he said. ``But in
time, we will find ways to return this courthouse to its glory.
That's the way it should be.''

   Will this week's largest-ever conclave of world leaders at the
United Nations' ``millennium summit'' in New York make a bit of
difference to the billions of victims of poverty, cruelty or war?
The United Nations is determined that it should, says Kofi Annan,
the U.N. secretary-general, who wrote the report that became the
basis for an ambitious declaration signed by the summiteers on
Sept. 8. If the summiteers actually succeed in making the rich
world a little less selfish in its dealings with the poor world,
all the puff and flummery will have been worthwhile. &QL;

   Suffering from a touch of deja vu? Oil prices have more than
tripled since the end of 1998; political leaders, including Bill
Clinton, are appealing to OPEC countries _ whose oil ministers are
meeting this weekend _ to increase production; France has seen the
return of long queues at gas stations, as truckers protesting fuel
prices block supplies. Such news flogs scary memories of the three
previous big oil-price shocks, in the early and late 1970s, and in
1990. Yet, oddly, hardly anybody seems worried about such a
prospect today. Nonetheless, at such times it is always prudent to
ask: ``what might go wrong?'' Will OPEC _ and our insatiable oil
consumption _ soon have us over a barrel? &QL;

   Few cities are as gloomy as Yangon, the rot-blackened capital of
Myanmar, known in better days as Rangoon and Burma respectively.
The one bright light amid the murk is Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader
of the National League for Democracy (NLD). Her nine-day protest,
trapped in a car on the outskirts of Yangon, and her subsequent
detention under house arrest, remind her countrymen, and the wider
world, both of the intransigence of the military junta and of the
fact that an alternative still exists, despite years of
oppression. &QL;

tried to organize itself on the assumption that human beings do not
need sleep. There are 24-hour news channels, 24-hour wedding

Gore, the protege of the man who invented the ``permanent

   WASHINGTON _ America's presidential election has been
transformed. For much of the past year, it had seemed George W.
Bush's to lose. Now, however, it is Al Gore who is surging ahead in
the polls, with an average lead of three percentage points in most
and ten points in one. Suddenly, it is Gore who is forcefully
setting the agenda, while Bush stumbles on the hustings, getting
his billions and trillions muddled (twice) and blurting vulgar
things into open microphones. The phoney campaign is over, folks.
Election 2000 now promises to be the closest race in decades. &QL;

   PARIS, TEXAS _ What would Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson make of
Paris, Texas? This barren town in the state's northeastern corner
has long been the Mecca of Democratic Texas _ a place (pre-Gov.
George W. Bush) where an elected Republican was a contradiction in
terms. It was the stomping ground of Rayburn, the powerful speaker
of the House, who shepherded the New Deal laws through Congress;
Johnson, his protege, could always count on it. Yet in many ways,
Texas Democrats can longer say, ``we'll always have Paris.'' As in
hundreds of rural towns throughout the state, they have lost their
stranglehold, and watch grimly as Texas increasingly becomes a
one-party state for the Republicans. &QL;

360 million Internet users around the world, only 3.1 million are
thought to be in Africa, and most of them are either in South
Africa or north of the Sahara. But access is spreading fast,
perhaps even tripling over the course of last year. For the first

   MEXICO CITY _ Last Friday, when President Ernesto Zedillo gave
his final state-of-the-union address to Mexico's Congress, he had
much to be proud of. Back in 1994, he took over a country teetering
on the brink of economic disaster, and scarred by political
violence and guerrilla rebellion. On Dec. 1, he will hand over to
Vicente Fox a country that differs for the better. Whatever
Zedillo's shortcomings, Mexicans will have grounds for satisfaction
if their new president turns out to be as successful as his
predecessor. &QL;

poster proclaiming ``vendo mis pelotas,'' or ``I sell my balls.''
The veto was predictable; when it comes to public morality, Chile
has long been more straitlaced than its Latin neighbors. &QL;

70,000 of them, are evidently thriving. &QL;

   BEIJING _ Garrison Keillor was not quite right when he said that
only Americans pulled down old houses because they were too
difficult to clean. In the past few years, Beijing's municipal
authorities have been systematically tearing down centuries-old
neighborhoods of narrow alleyways to make way for souless six-lane
avenues and commercial buildings. Beijing, desperate to win the
contest to hold the 2008 Olympic Games, boasts about the
``greening'' and ``modernizing'' of the capital. In reality,
China's quest for modernity destroys much of the old in favor of
the ugly. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Last week, when the American press and broadcasters
were on a feeding frenzy over the recall of Firestone tires fitted
to Ford Explorers, Ford's pugnacious chief executive, Jac Nasser,
appeared in prime-time TV ads professing the company's commitment
to customers and their safety, and promising to do everything to
replace suspect tires as quickly as possible. Days later, a
defensive Nasser tried to duck his way out of appearing before a
congressional subcommittee investigating the recall. Was it
cowardice or arrogance? Whichever, unless somebody at Ford soon
gets this consumer-safety issue under control, it will not just be
Firestone tires that are shredded _ it may well be Jac Nasser's
mercurial career as well. &QL;

quantities of data, and are willing to fork out tidy sums for the
privilege. The obvious beneficiaries of such windfalls should be
the local telecoms firms that already have customers in the grip of
their copper tenacles. &QL;

   PARIS, TEXAS _ What would Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson make of
Paris, Texas? This barren town in the state's northeastern corner
has long been the Mecca of Democratic Texas _ a place (pre-Gov.
George W. Bush) where an elected Republican was a contradiction in
terms. It was the stomping ground of Rayburn, the powerful speaker
of the House, who shepherded the New Deal laws through Congress;
Johnson, his protege, could always count on it. Yet in many ways,
Texas Democrats can longer say, ``we'll always have Paris.'' As in
hundreds of rural towns throughout the state, they have lost their
stranglehold, and watch grimly as Texas increasingly becomes a
one-party state for the Republicans. &QL;

360 million Internet users around the world, only 3.1 million are

Africa or north of the Sahara. But access is spreading fast,

   MEXICO CITY _ Last Friday, when President Ernesto Zedillo gave
his final state-of-the-union address to Mexico's Congress, he had
much to be proud of. Back in 1994, he took over a country teetering
on the brink of economic disaster, and scarred by political
violence and guerrilla rebellion. On Dec. 1, he will hand over to
Vicente Fox a country that differs for the better. Whatever
Zedillo's shortcomings, Mexicans will have grounds for satisfaction
if their new president turns out to be as successful as his
predecessor. &QL;

only Americans pulled down old houses because they were too

authorities have been systematically tearing down centuries-old
neighborhoods of narrow alleyways to make way for souless six-lane
avenues and commercial buildings. Beijing, desperate to win the
contest to hold the 2008 Olympic Games, boasts about the
``greening'' and ``modernizing'' of the capital. In reality,
China's quest for modernity destroys much of the old in favor of
the ugly. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Last week, when the American press and broadcasters
were on a feeding frenzy over the recall of Firestone tires fitted
to Ford Explorers, Ford's pugnacious chief executive, Jac Nasser,
appeared in prime-time TV ads professing the company's commitment
to customers and their safety, and promising to do everything to
replace suspect tires as quickly as possible. Days later, a
defensive Nasser tried to duck his way out of appearing before a
congressional subcommittee investigating the recall. Was it
cowardice or arrogance? Whichever, unless somebody at Ford soon
gets this consumer-safety issue under control, it will not just be
Firestone tires that are shredded _ it may well be Jac Nasser's
mercurial career as well. &QL;

lawyer's motion to release Pope on bail, or release him from jail
to a hospital, pending trial. Pope's wife, Cheri, and congressman
John Peterson have argued that Pope needs constant medical
attention because he has a rare form of bone cancer that is in

   SELMA-ELECTION _ SELMA, Ala._Everything's changed and nothing's

where the famous voting rights march led by Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. took place in 1965 now has its first black police chief and
blacks now make up a majority of the registered voters. That's a
far cry from the days when blacks had to demand their right to
vote. One thing hasn't changed. Joe T. Smitherman, the mayor in
1965 when state troopers beat and trampled protestors on the Edmund
Pettus Bridge, still holds office. But there's hope among the black
community that's tried to unseat him for 36 years. Smitherman, a
former washing machine salesman, is in a runoff for the first time.
He's challenged by a black businessman who's tried twice before to

training in end-of life care, particularly the pain-relief and

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Texas' progress on clean air undeniable; serious
work lies ahead
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Houston, Dallas and El Paso, dog days have come to mean smog
days.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Houston again chased down and passed Los Angeles as
the nation's ozone alert capital, with soaring temperatures and
stagnant air patterns contributing.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's two years running. Houston air quality has never
been worse, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. In fact, Houston's ozone levels at their present-day
worst are only half as bad as they were in the early 1970s. That's
when the United States started doing something about its air and
created the Environmental Protection Agency to do it.
</P>
<P>
   So if the air is cleaner, why is the EPA dogging Texas?
</P>
<P>
   It's because ozone readings in key areas of the state are sorely
out of attainment. Under EPA standards, Houston's status is ranked
``severe.'' Dallas got bumped up from ``moderate'' to ``serious''
under the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Several other cities including San Antonio, Austin, Longview,
Tyler, and Marshall are targeted for air cleanups by the Texas
Natural Resource Conservation Commission. However, the TNRCC has
given them an ``unclassifiable'' status, meaning there's not enough
data yet to justify an EPA crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   As for Houston falling behind Los Angeles on air quality, though
Texas has taken some key steps to improve air quality in the last
20 years, California has been more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Some will say that Texas is victimized by its wealth _ of
refineries and petrochemical industries _ and the heat, which cooks
nitrogen oxides to ozone.
</P>
<P>
   But observers like Lone Star Sierra Club air expert Neal Carman
point out that Southern California has the same ingredients.
California has bitten the bullet.
</P>
<P>
   He points out, for instance, that refineries in the Houston area
put out far more ozone-producing emissions than similar-sized
plants in the Los Angeles basin.
</P>
<P>
   With refineries and petrochemical plants, said Carman, Texas'
major problem is grandfathered operations _ in place or in
construction before the Texas Clean Air Act of 1971 and therefore
not subject to the same pollution controls as those built
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Texas took an important step in the last session of the
Legislature when it incorporated a major cleanup of nitrogen oxides
from grandfathered power plants as a part of electric deregulation.
But that leaves all other grandfathered industrial sites largely
untouched, with only a voluntary cleanup plan promoted by Gov.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the EPA steps in _ at least for Houston and
Dallas-Fort Worth. It's not that Texas had not been warned over and
over. In fact the state has been receiving warnings from the EPA
for five years over non-attainment in Dallas and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the EPA threatened Texas with the loss of highway
dollars if it didn't come up with air plans for the two metro
areas. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Committee responded
with plans that would dramatically curb emissions at power plants
and grandfathered industries. Also included are lower speed limits
and curbs on the use of some heavy equipment in mornings.
</P>
<P>
   TNRCC, Texas' environmental watchdog, is in the middle of all
this. On one hand, critics assert that it is a snoozing agent of
lassitude under the George W. Bush administration. On the other
hand it is assailed by critics who see the proposals now on the
table for the Houston and D-FW areas as overly draconian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do something,'' said TNRCC executive director
Jeff Saitas. ``To not do something would not have been a
responsible discharge of our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In an Austin interview, Saitas disputed the notion that the Bush
administration has influenced his agency to go easy on industry.
</P>
<P>
   The message from the governor has been ``very clear,'' said
Saitas: ``We want clean air, clean water'' and a balance struck
between environmental protection and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Foster, state air implementation coordinator for the
agency, said that except in comparison to California, Texas has
taken a back seat to no one in addressing EPA requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years Texas has made major strides in curbing
ozone and other air pollution, he said. But Texas' growth _ all
those automobiles, all that power generated _ has caused gains to
level off.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, Texas' record on air pollution is decidedly
mixed.
</P>
<P>
   With grandfathered plants doing too little to clean up their
acts; with the state's auto emissions testing program having
started, stopped and started again; with alarming levels of mercury
unchecked in exhaust from coal-fired plants; with pollution getting
shared between regions (a problem compounded by snoot-fulls of bad
air from Mexico), Texas has incredible challenges.
</P>
<P>
   It will not meet those challenges in a prone position.

<P>
   Suffering from a touch of deja vu?
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have more than tripled since the end of 1998;
political leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, are
appealing to OPEC countries, whose oil ministers met this weekend,
to increase production; France has seen the return of long queues
at gas stations, as truckers protesting about fuel prices block
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Such news brings back scary memories of the three previous big
oil-price shocks, in the early and late 1970s, and in 1990. On each
of those occasions, when oil prices also roughly tripled, inflation
duly rose and the world economy slipped into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, oddly, hardly anybody seems worried about such a prospect
today _ not least investors, who have been pushing share prices
towards new highs in many stock markets around the world. Oil no
longer matters, they seem to believe: the new economy runs on
information and silicon chips.
</P>
<P>
   But, although there is no cause for panic about oil prices, this
view looks terribly complacent.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the complacency seems understandable. The world
economy has rarely looked in better shape. This year it is likely
to enjoy the heady combination of the fastest growth for 16 years
and the lowest inflation for 30.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, at such times it is always prudent to ask: ``what
might go wrong?'' One answer is sticky and black, and hit a
ten-year high this week of nearly $35 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   At this weekend's meeting, OPEC ministers were likely to agree
to raise production quotas, but this is unlikely to have much
short-term effect on prices.
</P>
<P>
   American oil stocks are at a 24-year low, there is a lack of
spare refining capacity, the world economy _ and hence demand for
oil _ is booming, and the northern hemisphere is heading towards
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is a risk that, no matter what OPEC does, oil
prices could spike above $40 a barrel, especially if the winter
proves severe.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, oil prices are likely to fall: high prices and
new technology will reduce demand and encourage exploration. But in
the short term, oil prices may well stay high _ and that could be
enough to do serious damage to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   There are, admittedly, good reasons to expect the impact of this
oil-price ``shock'' to be less severe than its predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the recent tripling of oil prices followed a
sharp drop. In real terms, prices are still one-third below their
level in 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, and half their level in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are also right to believe that oil now plays a smaller
role in the economy. Thanks to energy conservation, a switch to
other fuels and a shift in the composition of output from heavy
industries to services, rich economies use only about half as much
oil for every dollar of GDP (in constant prices) as they did in the
early 1970s. A higher oil price has a correspondingly smaller
impact on inflation and output in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, in comparison with previous oil-price shocks, when
economies were already overheating, inflation is currently more
subdued. The Economist's non-oil commodity price index has barely
budged over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   But even if oil is less important in the new ``weightless
economy,'' that is a far cry from saying that it does not matter at
all. If they last for long enough, higher oil prices will certainly
hurt oil-importing countries.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule of thumb, the OECD reckons that a $10 increase in the
oil price, sustained for a year, lifts inflation in rich economies
by half a percentage point after a year, and reduces growth by a
quarter point.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although rich countries may be less dependent on oil
than they were, many oil-importing emerging economies now use more
oil per dollar of GDP than in the 1970s, thanks to rapid
industrialization and rising car ownership.
</P>
<P>
   A sustained rise in oil prices could set back the recovery in
emerging Asian economies, in particular. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The full impact of higher oil prices depends in part on how
policymakers respond. There seem to be striking differences in
attitudes towards higher oil prices between America's Federal
Reserve and the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The ECB has raised interest rates as oil prices have pushed
headline inflation above its medium-term target of 2 percent. In
contrast, the Fed has held rates unchanged for the past four
months, even as its headline inflation rate has jumped to 3.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Central banks have to weigh two opposing forces. On the one
hand, higher oil prices push up inflation; on the other, they act
as a tax that squeezes real incomes (and hence consumer spending),
thereby muting underlying inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The more serious the risk that higher inflation will feed into
wages and trigger a wage-price spiral, the more urgent it is that a
central bank raises interest rates. That is why the ECB was right
to raise rates last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, however, seems to fret less about headline inflation,
and focuses instead on core inflation, which excludes energy prices
and has accordingly risen by much less. The Fed believes that wages
are less responsive to headline inflation in America than in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   If the jump in oil prices proves temporary and inflation comes
down next year, this may well turn out to be correct. But it is
adding to the risks it is already taking. In not raising nominal
interest rates, it has allowed real interest rates to fall, which
seems hardly suitable for America's steaming economy.
</P>
<P>
   America's labor market is already squeaky tight, so wage demands
could start to follow headline inflation more closely than in the
past. The cost of holding rates down now may be higher rates _ and
a sharper economic slowdown _ next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It is worth recalling that economists have repeatedly
underestimated the impact of previous oil shocks.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in December 1990, after oil prices had soared, the
OECD forecast growth in rich economies for 1991 of 2 percent; in
the end growth turned out to be only 0.8 percent, as America and
other countries dipped into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmingly, some economists are now arguing that higher oil
prices may even be good news for the American economy (and for Wall
Street), because they will help to slow consumer spending and so
reduce the need for higher interest rates. This may partly explain
why share prices are rising yet again.
</P>
<P>
   And here lies the biggest risk of all. Even if the direct impact
of higher oil prices is more muted than it once was, they may
prompt even the most fervently bullish investors to notice such
things as America's gaping current-account deficit and dismally low
saving rate _ and to realize that there is still such a thing as
bad news.
</P>
<P>
   That might just be the trigger for a long-overdue slide in share
prices. The effects of that would be far more widespread than
higher gasoline prices. &QL;

   PARIS, TEXAS _ What would Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson make of
Paris, Texas? This barren town in the state's northeastern corner
has long been the center of Democratic Texas _ a place where an
elected Republican was a contradiction in terms.
</P>

who shepherded the New Deal laws through Congress; Johnson,
Rayburn's protege, counted on it as a matter of course.

   Yet in many ways, Texas Democrats no longer have Paris. As in
hundreds of rural towns throughout the state, they have lost their
stranglehold there, and now face fierce Republican competition.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in Texas's first congressional district, which also
includes Texarkana (a straddle-town that is half in Arkansas),
Paris is still represented in Congress by a Democrat, Max Sandlin.
But Republicans have hopes of winning Sandlin's seat in November.
</P>
<P>
   Rural Texas's turn to the right is an ominous sign for state
Democrats, who are grimly watching as their sinecure slowly becomes
a one-party state for the Republicans. There are currently more
Libertarians than Democrats on the ballot for statewide office in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   So demoralized is the once-almighty Texas Democratic Party that
it is not even putting up a fight for several important offices,
including the state Supreme Court posts, choosing instead to devote
its limited resources to battle in a handful of closely contested
races for seats in Congress and the Texas legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans currently hold all 29 statewide elected offices and
both United States Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is the first governor in state history to have
been elected to two consecutive four-year terms, and Rick Perry,
the lieutenant-governor, is the first Republican to hold that
position since Reconstruction in the 1860s, after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lower house of the Texas legislature and most of
the state's congressional districts remain in Democratic hands,
this is largely thanks to a crafty redistricting scheme devised by
Democrats in the legislature after the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   With the Republicans now holding the reins of power in Austin,
it is unlikely that the state's electoral map will be so friendly
to Democrats after the next redistricting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other states of the old Confederacy, Texas began
turning towards the Republicans as a reaction against the
civil-rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Southern Democrats, alienated by the growing
influence in their party of minorities and Northern liberals, began
to cast ballots for Republicans throughout the South.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Johnson, as the vice-presidential nominee, just managed
to deliver the state to John F. Kennedy; but after he himself
signed civil-rights legislation into law in 1964 and 1965, the fate
of Lone Star Democrats was sealed.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of the South the Democrats, by dint of alliances
between blacks and moderate whites, began to recover a little
ground in the 1990s, electing governors in Alabama, Georgia and the
Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, with a relatively small black population of 12 percent,
could not follow that lead. And Texas Democrats have been less
successful than their California counterparts at turning the
state's Latino population (nearly 30 percent) into a solid
Democratic voting block.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won roughly 40 percent of the Latino vote when he was
reelected in 1998, and he and other Republicans are careful to
pander to Latinos by speaking Spanish, enjoying Tejano culture and
being friendly to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   As a Democratic political consultant, George Christian, puts it,
``Republicans in Texas knew that if they didn't develop long-term
appeal to Latinos, they would have a short life in Texas
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Another unhelpful trend for the Democrats has been the drift
from the rural counties, LBJ's heartland, to the more Republican
big cities and suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the votes in Texas are cast in the Dallas and
Houston metropolitan areas, and Republican presidential candidates
carried these regions easily all through the 1990s. But nowadays
even the rural parts of Texas are wavering.
</P>
<P>
   These failures have started to affect the sort of people the
Democrats put forward for statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   Although a throng of young, ambitious Republicans currently hold
statewide offices, the Democratic Party has tended to field
politically inexperienced trial lawyers _ a breed not much loved in
Texas, or indeed, anywhere (save possibly New York). In fact, the
Democrats seem to be concentrating most of their puny firepower on
local races, especially the Texas Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, though, the Democrats are biding their time until
Bush leaves the stage.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats in the state, the ultimate humiliation came when
the last great Democratic power broker, the former
lieutenant-governor Bob Bullock, who had dominated Texas politics
for four decades, threw his support behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bush visited him on his deathbed and Bullock wished
the presidential candidate good luck in the coming fight. He died
the next day. &QL;

   PARIS, TEXAS _ What would Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson make of
Paris, Texas? This barren town in the state's northeastern corner
has long been the center of Democratic Texas _ a place where an
elected Republican was a contradiction in terms.
</P>

who shepherded the New Deal laws through Congress; Johnson,
Rayburn's protege, counted on it as a matter of course.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It's six in the morning on Labor Day and Al Gore is
addressing an overflowing crowd at a fire station in Tampa, Fla. He
warms them up with a few firefighting anecdotes _ it turns out that
his uncle Everett was a fireman _ before reverting to his usual
catalogue of policies and promises.
</P>
<P>
   He will reduce prescription-drug prices for old folk (a forest
of crutches is raised aloft in approval), raise the minimum wage by
a dollar an hour (loud cheers), and provide tax credits for
university education (even louder cheers).
</P>
<P>
   By the time the first rays of dawn can be seen on the horizon,
he has promised something to almost everyone present (with the
notable exception of the man holding a huge sign demanding the
appointment of a special prosecutor), and the crowd marches off
happily into the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that a swot like Gore should want to get
an early start on Labor Day, the traditional kickoff point for the
home stretch of the campaign. But this is actually the fifth event
in what the Gore team is billing as a 28-hour workathon.
</P>
<P>
   So far the vice president's audiences have included building
workers in Philadelphia (at 6 p.m.), hospital workers in Flint,
Mich. (at close to midnight), shop-floor workers at a truck factory
(at just before 1 a.m.), and twelve customers at Pop and Son's Cafe
in Tampa (at 5 a.m.).
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Joe Lieberman, who tagged along as far as Tampa, jokes
that running mates should start demanding collective-bargaining
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore packed in two Labor Day rallies later that day _ a huge
event in Pittsburgh and a smaller one at a speedway in Louisville,
Ky. _ and even managed an unexpected visit to a high-tech factory
on his way to bed.
</P>
<P>
   America is the first society in the world that has tried to
organize itself on the assumption that human beings do not need to
sleep. There are 24-hour news channels, 24-hour wedding chapels,
and, of course, 24-hour lap-dancing emporiums.
</P>
<P>
   So it was only a matter of time before someone invented the
24-hour political campaign; and it is only right that that someone
should be Al Gore, the protege of the man who invented the
``permanent campaign.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Today's presidential campaigns are untrammeled by the
constraints of time and money that bring sanity to politics in
other countries. It is more than a year since the unofficial start
of the campaign _ the Iowa straw poll _ and there are still two
months to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and Gore campaigns have already spent more than a
quarter of a billion dollars collectively, and this could well turn
out to be America's first billion-dollar presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to think of a better way to satirize all this excess
than for the world's best-known environmentalist to fly from
Pennsylvania to Florida and back again in the space of a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Gore not only hurtles around in a giant Boeing 757, Airforce
Two. He has another giant aircraft full of journalists following
behind. (This week W. finally closed the ``jet gap'' by getting a
757 of his own, handing his old Boeing 727 to Dick Cheney.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Even the mundane business of eating is over the top. Gore
started his tour with a cheese-steak sandwich with the building
workers, followed shortly afterwards by pizza. He started the next
day with some country ham and biscuits at Pop's place at 5 a.m.
before eating a mushroom omelette with the local firefighters. On
the way to Louisville he stopped to pick up 20 boxes of pizza.
</P>
<P>
   There are two powerful defenses of this extraordinary way of
doing politics. The first is that the United States is a darn big
place. The only way to prevent politicians from becoming completely
cut off from the people is to force them to spend years on the
stump.
</P>
<P>
   America's way of democracy thus obliges politicians to spend
weeks hanging around diners in Iowa and New Hampshire (thanks to
the caucuses and primaries) and then later to get to know some of
the dullest parts of the Midwest (thanks to the concentration of
swing states in the Rust Belt).
</P>
<P>
   The second defense is that being president is a hard job, and
voters need to make sure that the candidates are up to it. How
better to test their ability to take the punishing pace of the 24x7
global economy than to force them to ricochet from coast to coast
and north to south?
</P>
<P>
   And how better to test their ability to stand up to tub-thumping
fanatics than to force them to discuss prescription-drug charges
with Florida pensioners?
</P>
<P>
   There is also a more subtle defense of the American political
system: the hazing defense.
</P>
<P>
   The electorate is bent on subjecting politicians to all sorts of
humiliating rituals before handing them power. Politicians not only
have to prove that they can stuff themselves all day long with junk
food while remaining telegenic. They have to prove that they can
endure in-your-face rudeness without batting an eyelid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Al Gore,'' the smiling vice president said to one man in a
Florida diner. ``When Clinton leaves,'' the man replied, ``why
don't you go with him.''
</P>
<P>
   There is even something to be said for this four-state,
five-city extravaganza. Gore and Lieberman made a great fuss about
the fact that, unlike W., they understand people who have to work
at odd hours of the day and night. (Gore's mother put herself
through college by waitressing in an all-night coffee shop;
Lieberman's father drove a bakery truck before dawn.)
</P>
<P>
   But the real point of the exercise is to raise doubts about
Bush's capacity for hard work.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore is the Energizer Bunny of this campaign, Bush is the
napster, taking his favorite feather pillow wherever he goes _ an
aide carries it in a special bag _ and pining if he has to spend
too many nights away from home.
</P>
<P>
   For all its symbolic virtues, however, Gore should hesitate
before organizing another workathon, if only to keep the press from
staging a revolt. Listening to one speech by Gore is hardly a

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It's six in the morning on Labor Day and Al Gore is
addressing an overflowing crowd at a fire station in Tampa, Fla. He
warms them up with a few firefighting anecdotes _ it turns out that
his uncle Everett was a fireman _ before reverting to his usual
catalogue of policies and promises.
</P>
<P>
   He will reduce prescription-drug prices for old folk (a forest
of crutches is raised aloft in approval), raise the minimum wage by
a dollar an hour (loud cheers), and provide tax credits for
university education (even louder cheers).
</P>
<P>
   By the time the first rays of dawn can be seen on the horizon,
he has promised something to almost everyone present (with the
notable exception of the man holding a huge sign demanding the
appointment of a special prosecutor), and the crowd marches off
happily into the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that a swot like Gore should want to get
an early start on Labor Day, the traditional kickoff point for the
home stretch of the campaign. But this is actually the fifth event
in what the Gore team is billing as a 28-hour workathon.
</P>
<P>
   So far the vice president's audiences have included building
workers in Philadelphia (at 6 p.m.), hospital workers in Flint,
Mich. (at close to midnight), shop-floor workers at a truck factory
(at just before 1 a.m.), and twelve customers at Pop and Son's Cafe
in Tampa (at 5 a.m.).
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Joe Lieberman, who tagged along as far as Tampa, jokes
that running mates should start demanding collective-bargaining
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore packed in two Labor Day rallies later that day _ a huge
event in Pittsburgh and a smaller one at a speedway in Louisville,
Ky. _ and even managed an unexpected visit to a high-tech factory
on his way to bed.
</P>
<P>
   America is the first society in the world that has tried to
organize itself on the assumption that human beings do not need to
sleep. There are 24-hour news channels, 24-hour wedding chapels,
and, of course, 24-hour lap-dancing emporiums.
</P>
<P>
   So it was only a matter of time before someone invented the
24-hour political campaign; and it is only right that that someone
should be Al Gore, the protege of the man who invented the
``permanent campaign.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Today's presidential campaigns are untrammeled by the
constraints of time and money that bring sanity to politics in
other countries. It is more than a year since the unofficial start
of the campaign _ the Iowa straw poll _ and there are still two
months to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and Gore campaigns have already spent more than a
quarter of a billion dollars collectively, and this could well turn
out to be America's first billion-dollar presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to think of a better way to satirize all this excess
than for the world's best-known environmentalist to fly from
Pennsylvania to Florida and back again in the space of a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Gore not only hurtles around in a giant Boeing 757, Airforce
Two. He has another giant aircraft full of journalists following
behind. (This week W. finally closed the ``jet gap'' by getting a
757 of his own, handing his old Boeing 727 to Dick Cheney.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Even the mundane business of eating is over the top. Gore
started his tour with a cheese-steak sandwich with the building
workers, followed shortly afterwards by pizza. He started the next
day with some country ham and biscuits at Pop's place at 5 a.m.
before eating a mushroom omelette with the local firefighters. On
the way to Louisville he stopped to pick up 20 boxes of pizza.
</P>
<P>
   There are two powerful defenses of this extraordinary way of
doing politics. The first is that the United States is a darn big
place. The only way to prevent politicians from becoming completely
cut off from the people is to force them to spend years on the
stump.
</P>
<P>
   America's way of democracy thus obliges politicians to spend
weeks hanging around diners in Iowa and New Hampshire (thanks to
the caucuses and primaries) and then later to get to know some of
the dullest parts of the Midwest (thanks to the concentration of
swing states in the Rust Belt).
</P>
<P>
   The second defense is that being president is a hard job, and
voters need to make sure that the candidates are up to it. How
better to test their ability to take the punishing pace of the 24x7
global economy than to force them to ricochet from coast to coast
and north to south?
</P>
<P>
   And how better to test their ability to stand up to tub-thumping
fanatics than to force them to discuss prescription-drug charges
with Florida pensioners?
</P>
<P>
   There is also a more subtle defense of the American political
system: the hazing defense.
</P>
<P>
   The electorate is bent on subjecting politicians to all sorts of
humiliating rituals before handing them power. Politicians not only
have to prove that they can stuff themselves all day long with junk
food while remaining telegenic. They have to prove that they can
endure in-your-face rudeness without batting an eyelid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Al Gore,'' the smiling vice president said to one man in a
Florida diner. ``When Clinton leaves,'' the man replied, ``why
don't you go with him.''
</P>
<P>
   There is even something to be said for this four-state,
five-city extravaganza. Gore and Lieberman made a great fuss about
the fact that, unlike W., they understand people who have to work
at odd hours of the day and night. (Gore's mother put herself
through college by waitressing in an all-night coffee shop;
Lieberman's father drove a bakery truck before dawn.)
</P>
<P>
   But the real point of the exercise is to raise doubts about
Bush's capacity for hard work.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore is the Energizer Bunny of this campaign, Bush is the
napster, taking his favorite feather pillow wherever he goes _ an
aide carries it in a special bag _ and pining if he has to spend
too many nights away from home.
</P>
<P>
   For all its symbolic virtues, however, Gore should hesitate
before organizing another workathon, if only to keep the press from
staging a revolt. Listening to one speech by Gore is hardly a
rousing experience. Listening to several speeches in a row,
including one just before dawn, verges on torture.
</P>
<P>
   Bush started the week with yet another faux pas: calling a New
York Times journalist a ``major-league (vulgarity)'' in the range
of a live microphone. (A hint: it's an anatomical part in the human
southern hemisphere; site of hemorrhoids.)
</P>
<P>
   That word was mild compared with the ones being bandied around
by some members of the press as they completed their 28th
consecutive hour of following the vice president. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Who better deserves a prominent memorial: the
singer whose ``My Way'' launched a thousand karaoke bars, or his 16
million contemporaries who fought in the Second World War?
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, it looks as if New York City will erect a statue
of Frank Sinatra before Washington gets around to building a
tribute to the troops whose ranks Sinatra joined only on celluloid.
</P>
<P>
   But neither is proving particularly easy work. The Sinatra
statue would stand on a small pedestrian island in the heart of
Times Square (ironically, just a few feet from the city's most
prominent Army recruiting office, and close to the spot where
wartime sailors once pelted his image with tomatoes).
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say that the statue will only make the square's
appalling traffic problems worse; a few also gripe that Broadway is
an inappropriate spot for a memorial to a man who seldom trod the
boards, at least in a theatrical sense.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the first time, Sinatra might be saved by having friends
in the right places. The city's mayor, Rudy Giuliani, has vowed to
put up a memorial to the local hero.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that he actually came from New Jersey, a place with
nothing else to recommend it in New Yorkers' eyes. But Sinatra not
only sang ``New York, New York''; he was also one of the first
Italian-Americans to become a national idol.
</P>
<P>
   Turn now to Washington. The most bizarre thing about the
memorial to those who fought in the Second World War is that it
does not already exist.
</P>
<P>
   The capital is full of physical appreciations of one sort or
another (including one to Franklin Roosevelt's dog, Fala).
Memorials have already been built to those who fought in Vietnam
and Korea, and one has been eagerly proposed for Ronald Reagan,
even though he is still alive and therefore, by law, is not
eligible to get a Washington monument for at least 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even more bizarrely, the campaign for the Second World War
memorial seems to have gotten off the ground only because of the
involvement of actor Tom Hanks (of ``Saving Private Ryan'' fame),
though it now enjoys wide political support.
</P>
<P>
   The monument will stand on the National Mall, the strip of
parkland between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial.
But before ground-breaking in November, two federal agencies must
make final reviews of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complained that the first rather hulking design looked
inappropriately fascist.
</P>
<P>
   The revised seven-acre plaza, which would feature two massive
archways, 56 free-standing pillars, fountains and waterfalls,
several bronze eagles and a nine-foot wall emblazoned with over
4,000 gold stars, would still not shame ancient Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial's chief architect, Friedrich St. Florian, says the
design celebrates America's ``unprecedented unity'' during the war.
The National Coalition to Save Our Mall bemoans the design's
``institutional and corporate abstraction and anonymity'' in
contrast to, for example, the Vietnam Memorial, which lists every
fallen soldier by name.
</P>
<P>
   And there is even dissent among ex-servicemen's groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing there that tells you anything about World War
11,'' says John Graves, an ex-serviceman who has starred in a
television spot opposing the current design. ``A memorial that
needs explaining is not a memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   These complaints have not gone unheard. This week, an
independent federal agency urged Bruce Babbitt, the secretary of
the interior, to reconsider the plans before approving them.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's report contends that, as proposed, the memorial
would clash with its subdued surroundings and ``intrude upon the
uncluttered historic vistas of the Mall.''
</P>
<P>
   That's always a problem with memorials: they tend to obscure as
much history as they commemorate. &QL;

Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Sept. 12:

<P>
   SCI-REPRODUCING-ROBOTS (Undated) _ Bees do it. Birds do it.
Bacteria do it. Robots can't. When computer scientists at Brandeis
University two weeks ago unveiled a robotic system that designs and
builds other robots, that set off speculation that
self-reproducing, evolving robots could someday explore the galaxy,
or push humans to extinction. But it looks like the hardest
obstacle in building an intelligent, evolving, self-reproducing
robot may turn out to be the self-reproducing part. By Kenneth
Chang.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BUTTERFLIES (Undated) _ Over the past 20 years, biologists
have voiced increasing concern about the monarch butterfly's most
threatened and critical habitat, a single stretch of Mexican forest
to which hundreds of millions of these butterflies migrate from the
United States each year to spend the winter. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon.
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT5.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RARE-INSECTS (Edgartown, Mass.) _ Ask people on Martha's
Vineyard about insects and they are likely to talk about
mosquitoes, no-see-ums and green-headed flies, all of which can
make life miserable here. But the island's insect population
comprises far more than pests. Entomologists hope to use it to
re-establish rare and endangered insect populations wiped out
elsewhere in New England years ago. By Cornelia Dean. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FIRES-NUKES (Undated) _ Fires in and around nuclear
facilities understandably make people nervous, and so this has been
an unnerving summer in the American West, where the wildfires that
ravaged millions of acres edged into several major complexes.
Scientists outside the Energy Department who reviewed the air
monitoring data from the fires at Los Alamos and Hanford agreed
that there did not seem to be any cause for alarm. But the risks of
radiation releases during and after wildfires at contaminated
nuclear sites are still not very well understood by scientists, let
alone the public. By Jon Christensen. (1700 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT6.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENETICS-SOCIETY (New York) _ Just before the Fourth of July
holiday, an international scientific consortium announced at a
White House celebration that it had largely deciphered the DNA
instructions encoded in the human chromosomes. Once the hoopla died
down, we who are involved in the work have turned to preparing a
scientific paper to be submitted later this year describing the
findings. But while scientific revolutions may start with dry,
objective data, but ultimate impact depends on human interpretation
in a societal context. So, I was glad to visit the Exit Art Gallery
in Soho for the opening of a different kind of genome annotation
project, a show entitled ``Paradise Now: Picturing the Genetic
Revolution'' by 39 artists probing the social meaning of genetics.
By Eric S. Lander. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DRUGS-CHILDREN (Undated) _ Starting this December, a new
Food and Drug Administration rule mandates that any new adult drug
that the FDA decides could be used by children with the same
disease must undergo pediatric study, and its manufacturers must
list doses for children on the label. We have a conversation with
Dr. Dianne Murphy, associate director of the FDA's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research. By Alexis Jetter. (2100 words)
</P>
<P>
   With
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DRUGS-TESTS (Washington) _ In a hearing today, the FDA tries
to hammer out details of how ethically to test drugs on children.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undted) _ The Personal Health column: The
Sugar Association is trying to convince Americans that consuming
large quantities of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and snacks does not
harm one's nutritional status, body weight or long-term health. But
the research the association cites to support its contentions shows
how statistics can often be misleading if they present only part of
the story. Here is what you should know about the appalling
increase in sugar consumption by Americans _ especially children _
and the effects this increase is having on health. By Jane E.
Brody. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SCOOTER-SAFETY (Undated) _ Those shiny, foot-propelled
scooters are everywhere, but so are injuries, according to a report
issued last week by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. By
Linda Villarosa. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT7.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ A three-year survey indicates that many high school and
college football players who suffer concussions are allowed to
return to competition too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   _ An Arab village in Israel with unusually high rates of
Alzheimer's disease suggests that a recessive gene plays a role in
the condition, one that must be carried by both parents to take
effect, according to a new study in the journal Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   _ When men and women think about their extra poundage, they see
it in different terms, a new survey suggests: to women, the fat
embodies character flaws; to men, it's not their fault, it's those
darn business lunches.
</P>
<P>
   _ Saving the pacifier for when a baby is trying to fall asleep
may cut down on ear infections, a new study from Finland has
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   _ People who injure their knees as young adults may suffer for
it twice: once at the time, and later on through substantially
higher rates of arthritis, a study finds.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHRONIC-DISEASES (Undated) _ The Pew Environmental Health
Commission and 13 top public health groups in the nation have
proposed that the nation establish a system to count and monitor
chronic diseases from birth defects to asthma to Alzheimer's. By
Philip J. Hilts. (550 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: Why are Rocky
Mountain summers so rainy? By C. Claiborne Ray.

ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY CRITICIZED FOR USING VIOLENCE TO ATTRACT

   WASHINGTON _ Producers of movies, video games and music
aggressively try to attract children and teen-agers to
entertainment that contains violent themes, federal regulators said
on Monday.

<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission said people in the entertainment
industries use advertising to promote products that they themselves
acknowledge warrant parental caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``And are these advertisements intended to attract children and
teen-agers?'' the trade commission asked in a statement issued on
Monday. The report found that ``for all three segments of the
entertainment industry, the answers are plainly `yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   The report was undertaken in response to a request made by
President Clinton on June 1, 1999, barely five weeks after the
school massacre in Littleton, Colo. Several members of Congress
made similar requests.
</P>
<P>
   The agency does not recommend legislation on the violence in
marketing to children issue. ``Self-regulation is especially
critical in this area, given the First Amendment protections that
prohibit government regulation of these products' content,'' the
trade commission said.
</P>
<P>
   The report, endorsed in a 5-0 commission vote, drew its
conclusions in part from marketing plans and other material
submitted by the industry itself. The agency found evidence of
marketing and media strategies that expressly focus on children
under 17 and promote and advertise goods in outlets most likely to
reach young children.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders, anticipating the conclusions in the report,
questioned the validity of the findings. ``If we are causing moral
decay in this country, we ought to have an explosion of crime,''
Jack Valenti, the head of the Motion Picture Association of
America, said on Sunday. ``The exact opposite is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti went on to praise Hollywood's self-rating system. ``For
almost 32 years, this industry has been the only segment of our
national marketplace that voluntarily turns away revenues at the
box office to redeem the pledge that we have made to parents,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The text of the report is available on the agency's web site,
www.ftc.gov. A more complete response from Valenti's organization
may been seen at www.mpaa.org.
</P>
<P>
   While the 104-page report reached some harsh conclusions, it did
acknowledge that the entertainment industry has made efforts to
identify content that may be inappropriate for children. But the
commission chairman, Robert Pitofsky, said: ``Companies in the
entertainment industry routinely undercut their own rating
restrictions by target-marketing violent films, records and video
games to young audiences. These industries can and should do better
than this report illustrates.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is a perennial debate over whether violent material that
is marketed to children spawns violence by children, and what can
be done about it without violating the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, have said they would propose legislation or regulatory
authority against the entertainment industry if it does not stop
marketing violent material to children.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, Gore's Republican opponent in the
presidential race, said through a spokesman that the entertainment
industry and parents must play stronger roles in protecting
children. ``We're all in this together,'' said Ari Fleischer, a
spokesman for the governor's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce Committee plans to hold a hearing Wednesday
on the commission's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wisc., said on Monday that one of his aides
accompanied two seventh-grade boys to several retail stores in the
Washington area over the weekend, where the boys were able to buy
``ultra-violent video games'' despite ratings that labeled the
games as suitable for adults only.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has long focused on what can be done about violent video
games. On Monday, he accused retailers of deliberately skirting
their own ratings for profit. ``The video and computer game
industry failed to act in good faith,'' he said, ``and shouldn't be
surprised that Congress is ready to step in if it does not do
better.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America's presidential election has been
transformed. For much of the past year, it had seemed George W.
Bush's to lose. Streets ahead in most polls, he had been able to
set the policy agenda and stamp his authority on his party.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, meanwhile, written off by many as the president's
apologist-in-chief, lurched from one public persona to another
while his fractious party squabbled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after an inspired choice of running mate, a lingering
uxorial kiss and a policy-laden speech at his party's nominating
convention, it is Gore who is surging ahead in the polls, with an
average lead of three percentage points in most and ten points in
one.
</P>
<P>
   On some measures Bush, whose troubles began with his own
lacklustre choice of running mate and were compounded by a
convention speech that, in retrospect, looks vacuous on policy, is
scoring lower than the generic Republican vote _ a remarkable
setback for someone who has built his campaign on not being one of
those awful partisan congressional Republicans whom voters loathe.
</P>
<P>
   So now it is an animated and forceful Gore who is setting the
agenda, forcing Bush into spelling out his prescription-drug plan
last week by challenging him to ``put up or shut up'' about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   And it is Bush who is stumbling on the hustings, getting his
billions and his trillions muddled up (twice) and blurting unsavory
things into open microphones.
</P>
<P>
   The event mainly responsible for this turnaround was Gore's
acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention. Criticized at the
time as a catalogue of pandering to special-interest groups, his
policy promises are now seen to have cemented his reputation as the
candidate talking most about the bread-and-butter concerns of
America's middle class: i.e., most voters.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with Joe Lieberman's harping on religion and morality,
this has given the Gore ticket a double appeal to the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   It has also revealed the weak points of Bush's appeal. When he
was ahead in the polls, he tended to stress his policy proposals:
partial privatization of Social Security, tax cuts, school vouchers
and the like.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention he changed tack, stressing instead the
failures of leadership and character of Clinton and Gore and
promising to ``change the tone in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   This seemed like a good idea at the time. Gore looked vulnerable
to some kinds of personal attack, especially for the fund-raising
scandals that bedevilled his and Clinton's re-election campaign in
1996. Conversely, the policy debate seems less promising for the
unwonkish Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But the shift in strategy ran two hidden risks. First, the
character thrusts were made in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Before the convention, voter ignorance about Gore had been
profound, even though he had been in the public eye for years. As
it turned out, they liked what they saw in Los Angeles, and the
``leadership gap'' (in which Bush was deemed by poll respondents to
be the more decisive leader) disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   That undermined the force of Bush's first big anti-Gore
televised advertising campaign. He ended up attacking
pre-convention views about Gore while the candidate and voters had
moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Second, by attacking at all, he was not doing much to change the
tone in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these travails, some of Gore's more enthusiastic
supporters now think the vice president has done more than merely
erase the early Republican lead. They think he has put himself in a
position to romp home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There are two bits of evidence to support this. First, it is
possible that voters may be making up their minds a little earlier
than usual. Historically, around two-thirds of voters have made
their decision by this point in the campaign cycle, a share that
has fallen slightly over the years (to 55 percent in 1992).
</P>
<P>
   This time, some pollsters have found that as many as nine-tenths
of voters say they have made up their minds, which, if true, makes
Gore's current poll lead the more significant. (Since 1960, the man
ahead at this point has gone on to win in November.)
</P>
<P>
   Second, some of Gore's backers think that the state of the
economy is the most reliable guide to any presidential race, and
that this should be enough to see their man home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A rule of thumb says that assuming there is peace abroad and
neither candidate is affected by personal scandal (the outgoing
president's disrepute does not count), the incumbent will win if
the economy is growing by more than 4 percent at an annual rate in
the first half of the election year.
</P>
<P>
   It has been growing by far more than that (rising 5.8 percent in
the first six months of 2000 compared with the second half of
1999).
</P>
<P>
   It is true that voters split the credit for this, giving some to
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, some to the
Republican Congress, and some to America's entrepreneurial spirit.
But, argues Tom Mann of the Brookings Institution, that has always
been true. And if this election is like any other, then Gore should
benefit from the growth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the final years of the Reagan boom helped George W.
Bush's father erase a 17-point gap in the summer and destroy
Michael Dukakis. The 2000 election has started to follow that
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would be foolish to think it is all over. For one thing,
around a fifth of voters have changed their minds in the past
month. That suggests considerable volatility.
</P>
<P>
   For another, if you take the polling evidence state by state,
rather than nationally, the race looks like a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is ahead in three polls, Gore in three others. Based on the
most recent state polls, Bush has 223 Electoral College votes to
Gore's 228, which means neither has the 270 needed to win. Since
America chooses its president through the Electoral College, not by
direct popular vote, this is the relevant measure.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the character of the policy debate points to a
close contest. The race is turning into a debate about how to react
to growth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Partly, that means it is about how much of the forecast budget
surplus to hand back in tax cuts and how much to spend in
government programs or for paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, it is a debate over the virtues of consolidation
versus radicalism.
</P>
<P>
   Gore essentially says that after eight years of growth, America
should now concentrate on consolidating its gains. That means
paying down the national debt by 2012, shoring up the finances of
Social Security and Medicare (rather than changing the programs
fundamentally), and spending more money on education. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gore unveiled a plan to set aside $300 billion as a
contingency fund in case the forecast budget surpluses do not
materialize, and grouped all his various economic programs into a
prototype budget document, which he describes as ``specific,
detailed and _ above all _ prudent.''
</P>
<P>
   If the campaign were a military one, Gore would be the general
ringing conquered territory with solid defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Bush essentially argues that the eight years of growth provide a
chance for America to expand market mechanisms into new areas,
notably the big government entitlement programs.
</P>
<P>
   In Social Security he proposes to allow workers to set aside a
share of their payroll taxes for private retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In Medicare he has proposed letting private companies offer a
range of competing services, rather than the single,
government-financed one. He proposes education vouchers for failing
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a military operation, he would be the admiral
saying ``Damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,350) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Looked at this way, the race seems too close to call. On the one
hand, America is friendlier to market solutions than almost any
other country; and this election is taking place at a time when
half of all households own shares, which may mean that people are
more willing to take risks.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, consolidating your gains is a natural
reaction, especially among older people who vote in larger
numbers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,450) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the race is no longer Bush's to lose. Equally, it would
be too much to say it has become Gore's to lose. But the changes
mean it is now up to Bush to shift the momentum back in his favor. &QL;

be too much to say it has become Gore's to lose. But the changes
mean it is now up to Bush to shift the momentum back in his favor. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America's presidential election has been
transformed. For much of the past year, it had seemed George W.
Bush's to lose. Streets ahead in most polls, he had been able to
set the policy agenda and stamp his authority on his party.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, meanwhile, written off by many as the president's
apologist-in-chief, lurched from one public persona to another
while his fractious party squabbled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after an inspired choice of running mate, a lingering
uxorial kiss and a policy-laden speech at his party's nominating
convention, it is Gore who is surging ahead in the polls, with an
average lead of three percentage points in most and ten points in
one.
</P>
<P>
   On some measures Bush, whose troubles began with his own
lacklustre choice of running mate and were compounded by a
convention speech that, in retrospect, looks vacuous on policy, is
scoring lower than the generic Republican vote _ a remarkable
setback for someone who has built his campaign on not being one of
those awful partisan congressional Republicans whom voters loathe.
</P>
<P>
   So now it is an animated and forceful Gore who is setting the
agenda, forcing Bush into spelling out his prescription-drug plan
last week by challenging him to ``put up or shut up'' about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   And it is Bush who is stumbling on the hustings, getting his
billions and his trillions muddled up (twice) and blurting unsavory
things into open microphones.
</P>
<P>
   The event mainly responsible for this turnaround was Gore's
acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention. Criticized at the
time as a catalogue of pandering to special-interest groups, his
policy promises are now seen to have cemented his reputation as the
candidate talking most about the bread-and-butter concerns of
America's middle class: i.e., most voters.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with Joe Lieberman's harping on religion and morality,
this has given the Gore ticket a double appeal to the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   It has also revealed the weak points of Bush's appeal. When he
was ahead in the polls, he tended to stress his policy proposals:
partial privatization of Social Security, tax cuts, school vouchers
and the like.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention he changed tack, stressing instead the
failures of leadership and character of Clinton and Gore and
promising to ``change the tone in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   This seemed like a good idea at the time. Gore looked vulnerable
to some kinds of personal attack, especially for the fund-raising
scandals that bedevilled his and Clinton's re-election campaign in
1996. Conversely, the policy debate seems less promising for the
unwonkish Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But the shift in strategy ran two hidden risks. First, the
character thrusts were made in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Before the convention, voter ignorance about Gore had been
profound, even though he had been in the public eye for years. As
it turned out, they liked what they saw in Los Angeles, and the
``leadership gap'' (in which Bush was deemed by poll respondents to
be the more decisive leader) disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   That undermined the force of Bush's first big anti-Gore
televised advertising campaign. He ended up attacking
pre-convention views about Gore while the candidate and voters had
moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Second, by attacking at all, he was not doing much to change the
tone in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these travails, some of Gore's more enthusiastic
supporters now think the vice president has done more than merely
erase the early Republican lead. They think he has put himself in a
position to romp home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There are two bits of evidence to support this. First, it is
possible that voters may be making up their minds a little earlier
than usual. Historically, around two-thirds of voters have made
their decision by this point in the campaign cycle, a share that
has fallen slightly over the years (to 55 percent in 1992).
</P>
<P>
   This time, some pollsters have found that as many as nine-tenths
of voters say they have made up their minds, which, if true, makes
Gore's current poll lead the more significant. (Since 1960, the man
ahead at this point has gone on to win in November.)
</P>
<P>
   Second, some of Gore's backers think that the state of the
economy is the most reliable guide to any presidential race, and
that this should be enough to see their man home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A rule of thumb says that assuming there is peace abroad and
neither candidate is affected by personal scandal (the outgoing
president's disrepute does not count), the incumbent will win if
the economy is growing by more than 4 percent at an annual rate in
the first half of the election year.
</P>
<P>
   It has been growing by far more than that (rising 5.8 percent in
the first six months of 2000 compared with the second half of
1999).
</P>
<P>
   It is true that voters split the credit for this, giving some to
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, some to the
Republican Congress, and some to America's entrepreneurial spirit.
But, argues Tom Mann of the Brookings Institution, that has always
been true. And if this election is like any other, then Gore should
benefit from the growth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the final years of the Reagan boom helped George W.
Bush's father erase a 17-point gap in the summer and destroy
Michael Dukakis. The 2000 election has started to follow that
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would be foolish to think it is all over. For one thing,
around a fifth of voters have changed their minds in the past
month. That suggests considerable volatility.
</P>
<P>
   For another, if you take the polling evidence state by state,
rather than nationally, the race looks like a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is ahead in three polls, Gore in three others. Based on the
most recent state polls, Bush has 223 Electoral College votes to
Gore's 228, which means neither has the 270 needed to win. Since
America chooses its president through the Electoral College, not by
direct popular vote, this is the relevant measure.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the character of the policy debate points to a
close contest. The race is turning into a debate about how to react
to growth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Partly, that means it is about how much of the forecast budget
surplus to hand back in tax cuts and how much to spend in
government programs or for paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, it is a debate over the virtues of consolidation
versus radicalism.
</P>
<P>
   Gore essentially says that after eight years of growth, America
should now concentrate on consolidating its gains. That means
paying down the national debt by 2012, shoring up the finances of
Social Security and Medicare (rather than changing the programs
fundamentally), and spending more money on education. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gore unveiled a plan to set aside $300 billion as a
contingency fund in case the forecast budget surpluses do not
materialize, and grouped all his various economic programs into a
prototype budget document, which he describes as ``specific,
detailed and _ above all _ prudent.''
</P>
<P>
   If the campaign were a military one, Gore would be the general
ringing conquered territory with solid defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Bush essentially argues that the eight years of growth provide a
chance for America to expand market mechanisms into new areas,
notably the big government entitlement programs.
</P>
<P>
   In Social Security he proposes to allow workers to set aside a
share of their payroll taxes for private retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In Medicare he has proposed letting private companies offer a
range of competing services, rather than the single,
government-financed one. He proposes education vouchers for failing
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a military operation, he would be the admiral
saying ``Damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,350) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Looked at this way, the race seems too close to call. On the one
hand, America is friendlier to market solutions than almost any
other country; and this election is taking place at a time when
half of all households own shares, which may mean that people are
more willing to take risks.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, consolidating your gains is a natural
reaction, especially among older people who vote in larger
numbers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,450) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the race is no longer Bush's to lose. Equally, it would
be too much to say it has become Gore's to lose. But the changes
mean it is now up to Bush to shift the momentum back in his favor. &QL;

<P>
   PARIS, TEXAS _ What would Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson make of
Paris, Texas? This barren town in the state's northeastern corner
has long been the center of Democratic Texas _ a place where an
elected Republican was a contradiction in terms.
</P>
<P>
   It was the stomping ground of Rayburn, the speaker of the House,
who shepherded the New Deal laws through Congress; Johnson,
Rayburn's protege, counted on it as a matter of course.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in many ways, Texas Democrats no longer have Paris. As in
hundreds of rural towns throughout the state, they have lost their
stranglehold there, and now face fierce Republican competition.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in Texas's first congressional district, which also
includes Texarkana (a straddle-town that is half in Arkansas),
Paris is still represented in Congress by a Democrat, Max Sandlin.
But Republicans have hopes of winning Sandlin's seat in November.
</P>
<P>
   Rural Texas's turn to the right is an ominous sign for state
Democrats, who are grimly watching as their sinecure slowly becomes
a one-party state for the Republicans. There are currently more
Libertarians than Democrats on the ballot for statewide office in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   So demoralized is the once-almighty Texas Democratic Party that
it is not even putting up a fight for several important offices,
including the state Supreme Court posts, choosing instead to devote
its limited resources to battle in a handful of closely contested
races for seats in Congress and the Texas legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans currently hold all 29 statewide elected offices and
both United States Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is the first governor in state history to have
been elected to two consecutive four-year terms, and Rick Perry,
the lieutenant-governor, is the first Republican to hold that
position since Reconstruction in the 1860s, after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lower house of the Texas legislature and most of
the state's congressional districts remain in Democratic hands,
this is largely thanks to a crafty redistricting scheme devised by
Democrats in the legislature after the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   With the Republicans now holding the reins of power in Austin,
it is unlikely that the state's electoral map will be so friendly
to Democrats after the next redistricting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other states of the old Confederacy, Texas began
turning towards the Republicans as a reaction against the
civil-rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Southern Democrats, alienated by the growing
influence in their party of minorities and Northern liberals, began
to cast ballots for Republicans throughout the South.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Johnson, as the vice-presidential nominee, just managed
to deliver the state to John F. Kennedy; but after he himself
signed civil-rights legislation into law in 1964 and 1965, the fate
of Lone Star Democrats was sealed.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of the South the Democrats, by dint of alliances
between blacks and moderate whites, began to recover a little
ground in the 1990s, electing governors in Alabama, Georgia and the
Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, with a relatively small black population of 12 percent,
could not follow that lead. And Texas Democrats have been less
successful than their California counterparts at turning the
state's Latino population (nearly 30 percent) into a solid
Democratic voting block.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won roughly 40 percent of the Latino vote when he was
reelected in 1998, and he and other Republicans are careful to
pander to Latinos by speaking Spanish, enjoying Tejano culture and
being friendly to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   As a Democratic political consultant, George Christian, puts it,
``Republicans in Texas knew that if they didn't develop long-term
appeal to Latinos, they would have a short life in Texas
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Another unhelpful trend for the Democrats has been the drift
from the rural counties, LBJ's heartland, to the more Republican
big cities and suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the votes in Texas are cast in the Dallas and
Houston metropolitan areas, and Republican presidential candidates
carried these regions easily all through the 1990s. But nowadays
even the rural parts of Texas are wavering.
</P>
<P>
   These failures have started to affect the sort of people the
Democrats put forward for statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   Although a throng of young, ambitious Republicans currently hold
statewide offices, the Democratic Party has tended to field
politically inexperienced trial lawyers _ a breed not much loved in
Texas, or indeed, anywhere (save possibly New York). In fact, the
Democrats seem to be concentrating most of their puny firepower on
local races, especially the Texas Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, though, the Democrats are biding their time until
Bush leaves the stage.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats in the state, the ultimate humiliation came when
the last great Democratic power broker, the former
lieutenant-governor Bob Bullock, who had dominated Texas politics
for four decades, threw his support behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bush visited him on his deathbed and Bullock wished
the presidential candidate good luck in the coming fight. He died
the next day. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It's six in the morning on Labor Day and Al Gore is
addressing an overflowing crowd at a fire station in Tampa, Fla. He
warms them up with a few firefighting anecdotes _ it turns out that
his uncle Everett was a fireman _ before reverting to his usual
catalogue of policies and promises.
</P>
<P>
   He will reduce prescription-drug prices for old folk (a forest
of crutches is raised aloft in approval), raise the minimum wage by
a dollar an hour (loud cheers), and provide tax credits for
university education (even louder cheers).
</P>
<P>
   By the time the first rays of dawn can be seen on the horizon,
he has promised something to almost everyone present (with the
notable exception of the man holding a huge sign demanding the
appointment of a special prosecutor), and the crowd marches off
happily into the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that a swot like Gore should want to get
an early start on Labor Day, the traditional kickoff point for the
home stretch of the campaign. But this is actually the fifth event
in what the Gore team is billing as a 28-hour workathon.
</P>
<P>
   So far the vice president's audiences have included building
workers in Philadelphia (at 6 p.m.), hospital workers in Flint,
Mich. (at close to midnight), shop-floor workers at a truck factory
(at just before 1 a.m.), and twelve customers at Pop and Son's Cafe
in Tampa (at 5 a.m.).
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Joe Lieberman, who tagged along as far as Tampa, jokes
that running mates should start demanding collective-bargaining
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore packed in two Labor Day rallies later that day _ a huge
event in Pittsburgh and a smaller one at a speedway in Louisville,
Ky. _ and even managed an unexpected visit to a high-tech factory
on his way to bed.
</P>
<P>
   America is the first society in the world that has tried to
organize itself on the assumption that human beings do not need to
sleep. There are 24-hour news channels, 24-hour wedding chapels,
and, of course, 24-hour lap-dancing emporiums.
</P>
<P>
   So it was only a matter of time before someone invented the
24-hour political campaign; and it is only right that that someone
should be Al Gore, the protege of the man who invented the
``permanent campaign.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Today's presidential campaigns are untrammeled by the
constraints of time and money that bring sanity to politics in
other countries. It is more than a year since the unofficial start
of the campaign _ the Iowa straw poll _ and there are still two
months to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush and Gore campaigns have already spent more than a
quarter of a billion dollars collectively, and this could well turn
out to be America's first billion-dollar presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to think of a better way to satirize all this excess
than for the world's best-known environmentalist to fly from
Pennsylvania to Florida and back again in the space of a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Gore not only hurtles around in a giant Boeing 757, Airforce
Two. He has another giant aircraft full of journalists following
behind. (This week W. finally closed the ``jet gap'' by getting a
757 of his own, handing his old Boeing 727 to Dick Cheney.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Even the mundane business of eating is over the top. Gore
started his tour with a cheese-steak sandwich with the building
workers, followed shortly afterwards by pizza. He started the next
day with some country ham and biscuits at Pop's place at 5 a.m.
before eating a mushroom omelette with the local firefighters. On
the way to Louisville he stopped to pick up 20 boxes of pizza.
</P>
<P>
   There are two powerful defenses of this extraordinary way of
doing politics. The first is that the United States is a darn big
place. The only way to prevent politicians from becoming completely
cut off from the people is to force them to spend years on the
stump.
</P>
<P>
   America's way of democracy thus obliges politicians to spend
weeks hanging around diners in Iowa and New Hampshire (thanks to
the caucuses and primaries) and then later to get to know some of
the dullest parts of the Midwest (thanks to the concentration of
swing states in the Rust Belt).
</P>
<P>
   The second defense is that being president is a hard job, and
voters need to make sure that the candidates are up to it. How
better to test their ability to take the punishing pace of the 24x7
global economy than to force them to ricochet from coast to coast
and north to south?
</P>
<P>
   And how better to test their ability to stand up to tub-thumping
fanatics than to force them to discuss prescription-drug charges
with Florida pensioners?
</P>
<P>
   There is also a more subtle defense of the American political
system: the hazing defense.
</P>
<P>
   The electorate is bent on subjecting politicians to all sorts of
humiliating rituals before handing them power. Politicians not only
have to prove that they can stuff themselves all day long with junk
food while remaining telegenic. They have to prove that they can
endure in-your-face rudeness without batting an eyelid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Al Gore,'' the smiling vice president said to one man in a
Florida diner. ``When Clinton leaves,'' the man replied, ``why
don't you go with him.''
</P>
<P>
   There is even something to be said for this four-state,
five-city extravaganza. Gore and Lieberman made a great fuss about
the fact that, unlike W., they understand people who have to work
at odd hours of the day and night. (Gore's mother put herself
through college by waitressing in an all-night coffee shop;
Lieberman's father drove a bakery truck before dawn.)
</P>
<P>
   But the real point of the exercise is to raise doubts about
Bush's capacity for hard work.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore is the Energizer Bunny of this campaign, Bush is the
napster, taking his favorite feather pillow wherever he goes _ an
aide carries it in a special bag _ and pining if he has to spend
too many nights away from home.
</P>
<P>
   For all its symbolic virtues, however, Gore should hesitate
before organizing another workathon, if only to keep the press from
staging a revolt. Listening to one speech by Gore is hardly a
rousing experience. Listening to several speeches in a row,
including one just before dawn, verges on torture.
</P>
<P>
   Bush started the week with yet another faux pas: calling a New
York Times journalist a ``major-league (vulgarity)'' in the range
of a live microphone. (A hint: it's an anatomical part in the human
southern hemisphere; site of hemorrhoids.)
</P>
<P>
   That word was mild compared with the ones being bandied around
by some members of the press as they completed their 28th
consecutive hour of following the vice president. &QL;

   Is Africa getting online? Not really: of some 360 million
Internet users around the world, only 3.1 million are thought to be
in Africa, and most of them are either in South Africa or north of
the Sahara.

   Nigeria probably has 100,000 users; Kenya, a relatively

perhaps even tripling over the course of last year.

   The United Nations has put its faith in the Internet as a means
for poor countries to leapfrog stages of development. The

   The United Nation's own plans for bridge-building include a
corps of volunteers to teach people in developing countries how to
use computers, and a health network to provide hospitals and
clinics with up-to-date medical information.

<P>
   The Internet could also be a way around one of Africa's greatest
weaknesses, its feeble infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Poor roads, uncertain power supplies, an unreliable postal
system and bad telephone lines (there are as many telephones in
Tokyo as in all of Africa, says the U.N. report), add to Africa's
economic and political woes.
</P>
<P>
   Without easy access to information, farmers cannot know what
price is fair for their goods, traders have no alternative to
buying imports from local sources, doctors rely on ancient
technology, voters can make no informed choices.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet could change things. Just as battery-powered and
windup radios brought much of Africa into contact with the outside
world, so can computers make that contact richer.
</P>
<P>
   And cheaper: e-mailing a 40-page document from Madagascar to
Cote d'Ivoire costs 20 cents, faxing it about $45, and sending it
by courier $75.
</P>
<P>
   More and more African newspapers now post online editions, and
use foreign news found on the Internet. Most of the initiative, and
investment, is expected to come from private companies and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   A new 32,000-km (20,000-mile) undersea fiber-optic cable system,
which will form a ring of connections around the continent, is due
to open in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Internet cafes have been springing up in African cities wherever
people have the money to use them.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of a cyber cafe in Zanzibar provides Web sites for
government officials, hotels and banks, and collects payments from
drop-in users. He also wants to change people's lives by putting
the Internet, free, in local schools.
</P>
<P>
   On a larger scale, an East African company, Africa Online, based
in Nairobi, works in eight countries. One of its aims is to provide
Internet connections for people without their own telephones or
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Using e-touch technology (a simple way to operate e-mail), it
wants to put terminals in post offices throughout the region. Last
month the company announced a deal with Barclays Africa to open a
string of Internet centers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet cannot help the truly poor, who look for
pencils, not computers, it may well speed the pace of change. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ On Wednesday, Sept. 6 Jac Nasser, chief executive of
Ford Motor Company, appeared before a congressional subcommittee
investigating the recall of at least 6.5 million Firestone tires
fitted to Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicles (SUVs).
</P>
<P>
   Before he even took the stand, he was on the defensive.
Disintegration of the tires is already blamed for causing 89 deaths
in America and a further 46 in Venezuela, and both Firestone and
Ford have been accused of being, at the least, slow to react to
growing evidence that there was a dangerous problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser was up in front of the congressmen with Masatoshi Ono,
the boss of Firestone in America (Firestone is part of Japan's
Bridgestone Corporation).
</P>
<P>
   The contrast was sharp. Nasser was, as usual, the Australian
tough guy. Ono was all contrition. ``I come before you to apologize
to you, the American people, and especially to the families who
have lost loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Also giving evidence was Joan Claybrook, president of Public
Citizen, a consumer group, and a former National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA) official. She said that Ford and
Firestone officials should be charged with second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Nasser had tried to avoid giving evidence to Congress
at all, offering to send two technical people in his place, and
pleading that he needed to stay in Detroit to manage the company's
response to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Ono, meanwhile, had agreed readily to the request to appear,
despite having poor English and a harder case to plead.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone also had a huge tire recall in the late 1970s and was
reprieved only when the Reagan administration relaxed safety rules.
</P>
<P>
   Either Nasser was cowardly, or he was arrogantly jockeying to
get a more favorable slot before the committee, avoiding being
sandwiched between his critics from consumer and safety groups.
</P>
<P>
   Since nobody could accuse the engaging but pugnacious Nasser of
ducking a fight on his battle through the ranks to the top of the
world's second-biggest car company, ill-judged arrogance seems the
more likely answer.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when the American press and broadcasters were on a
feeding frenzy over the recall of Firestone tires fitted to Ford
Explorers, Nasser appeared on prime-time television advertising
slots professing the company's commitment to customers and their
safety, and promising to do everything to replace suspect tires as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But the great thing about going on TV ads is that nobody can
answer back _ unlike during a congressional hearing. Nasser must
have been made very quickly aware of what a mistake he had made in
at first refusing to appear.
</P>
<P>
   The tough-talking Australian is probably the most wired manager
in Detroit. His top-floor office has a dozen screens around its
high-tech walls, with CNBC murmuring in the background and
motor-industry Web sites flicking on and off all the time. He says
he needs all this to keep up-to-the-minute with information.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, his multi-screen office-cum-TV-studio must
have told him how far the value of his stock options had shrunk
when Ford's share price started diving as the crisis grew, and
management began to look like rabbits caught in the headlights of
an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the reaction to his planned no-show was coming across the
ether. The committee chairman, a Republican from Louisiana named
Billy Tauzin, promptly attacked Nasser's reluctance to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a man whose vision of Ford's future success is to get
close to customers to satisfy their needs and sell them not just
cars but all sorts of other services as well, shrinking from a
public discussion of the biggest customer and safety problem to hit
Ford since the early 1970s (when its little Pinto cars started
bursting into flames in accidents because of a badly placed fuel
tank).
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, was a man who wants to create lifelong customer
relationships, holding back from the eyeball-to-eyeball exposure
that is what any worried Ford customer wants right now.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was cowardice or arrogance does not much matter. It
looked simply awful.
</P>
<P>
   The car industry in Detroit has an old saw about getting down to
basics, ``where the rubber meets the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of Nasser's ambitious attempt to transform Ford
from a low-rated car-making stock into a glamorous service and
consumer company, with a higher share price, along comes the most
basic problem _ literally where the rubber meets the road.
</P>
<P>
   Inquiries under way by the NHTSA and by Congress will attempt to
discover what went wrong with the tires and whether Ford and
Firestone were to blame for not responding more quickly. Some are
in no doubt already where the blame lies.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Claybrook of Public Citizen maintains that Ford and
Firestone knew about the tire problem with the Explorer (such
vehicles account for as much as 25 percent of Ford's profits) as
long ago as the early 1990s, as a result of lawsuits following
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   She alleges that there was a cover-up, with gagging orders
imposed as part of the settlements of these suits.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser is not responsible directly for what Ford was doing all
those years ago, but his initial response to the crisis brings
echoes of earlier complacency.
</P>
<P>
   If he continues to stumble, the most likely outcome is that his
chairman Bill Ford (an earnest environmentalist as well as a Ford
heir) will take over the front-line position of defending the
company, which is usually what chairmen of the board are for
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Unless somebody at Ford gets this consumer-safety issue under
control, it will not just be Firestone tires that are shredded _ it
could be Jac Nasser's career as well. &QL;

management began to look like rabbits caught in the headlights of
an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the reaction to his planned no-show was coming across the
ether. The committee chairman, a Republican from Louisiana named
Billy Tauzin, promptly attacked Nasser's reluctance to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a man whose vision of Ford's future success is to get
close to customers to satisfy their needs and sell them not just
cars but all sorts of other services as well, shrinking from a
public discussion of the biggest customer and safety problem to hit
Ford since the early 1970s (when its little Pinto cars started
bursting into flames in accidents because of a badly placed fuel
tank).
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, was a man who wants to create lifelong customer
relationships, holding back from the eyeball-to-eyeball exposure
that is what any worried Ford customer wants right now.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was cowardice or arrogance does not much matter. It
looked simply awful.
</P>
<P>
   The car industry in Detroit has an old saw about getting down to
basics, ``where the rubber meets the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of Nasser's ambitious attempt to transform Ford
from a low-rated car-making stock into a glamorous service and
consumer company, with a higher share price, along comes the most
basic problem _ literally where the rubber meets the road.
</P>
<P>
   Inquiries under way by the NHTSA and by Congress will attempt to
discover what went wrong with the tires and whether Ford and
Firestone were to blame for not responding more quickly. Some are
in no doubt already where the blame lies.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Claybrook of Public Citizen maintains that Ford and
Firestone knew about the tire problem with the Explorer (such
vehicles account for as much as 25 percent of Ford's profits) as
long ago as the early 1990s, as a result of lawsuits following
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   She alleges that there was a cover-up, with gagging orders
imposed as part of the settlements of these suits.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser is not responsible directly for what Ford was doing all
those years ago, but his initial response to the crisis brings
echoes of earlier complacency.
</P>
<P>
   If he continues to stumble, the most likely outcome is that his
chairman Bill Ford (an earnest environmentalist as well as a Ford
heir) will take over the front-line position of defending the
company, which is usually what chairmen of the board are for
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Unless somebody at Ford gets this consumer-safety issue under
control, it will not just be Firestone tires that are shredded _ it
could be Jac Nasser's career as well. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Last Friday, when President Ernesto Zedillo gave
his final state-of-the-union address to Mexico's Congress, he had
much to be proud of. Back in 1994, he took over a country teetering
on the brink of economic crisis, and scarred by political violence
and guerrilla rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, he will hand over to Vicente Fox a country that
differs for the better, in two fundamental ways.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Zedillo overseen Mexico's peaceful transition to
democracy, with power passing to the opposition in the form of Fox
after seven decades of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
   But Zedillo also passes on a booming economy: this year GDP is
set to grow by 7 percent, its highest rate since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Zedillo, a dry, bookish man devoid of charisma, will
bow out on a wave of popular esteem: his popularity rating stands
close to 70 percent, compared with just 30 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, too, that his speech was largely uninterrupted by the
angry protests that have punctuated these occasions over the past
decade, nor that it was cheered by the opposition, while the PRI's
congressmen sat stony-faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no applause, because he didn't deserve it,'' said
Senator Manuel Bartlett, a leader of the PRI's diehard faction.
That is a backhanded compliment to Zedillo's statesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   He has done much to smooth what might have been a bumpy
transition to Fox. In particular, Zedillo has sought with almost
obsessive zeal to break the cycle of economic crises that have
accompanied the past four presidential handovers.
</P>
<P>
   In this, he appears likely to succeed: such is the confidence of
the financial markets that Mexico last week felt able to pay back
its outstanding loans to the IMF, totalling $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Zedillo is also bequeathing some problems to Fox.
One is that the economy looks too strong for its own good, yet
growth is only just starting to benefit the poor majority of
Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Another set of difficulties has been dramatized by the
corruption scandals that are marring Zedillo's final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Take the economy first. After plunging in Zedillo's first year,
in the wake of a bungled devaluation, Mexico's GDP has grown at an
annual average rate of 5 percent since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Behind that growth lie Mexico's close economic links with the
booming United States through NAFTA, free-market reforms enacted by
Zedillo's predecessors, and sound economic management: Zedillo has
often acted as if he were finance minister, rather than president.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that growth is underpinned by increased
investment, the current-account deficit is manageable at around 3
percent of GDP this year, and a floating exchange rate has worked
well as a shock-absorber.
</P>
<P>
   But unfortunately for Fox, who has promised still-higher growth,
the economy needs to be cooled. Recorded unemployment has fallen to
just 2 percent; skilled labor is in especially short supply, and
some of the export growth reflects high but volatile oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The (independent) central bank has nudged up interest rates; but
relying on a monetary squeeze alone risks strengthening the
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   As Alfredo Thorne of J.P. Morgan, an American bank, notes, to
sustain growth, Fox will have to tighten fiscal policy while
pushing through structural reforms to boost productivity. In doing
so, Fox will be handicapped by his legacy, and by his own seeming
reluctance to take unpopular stands.
</P>
<P>
   Fox wants to increase public spending, while needing to cut the
fiscal deficit. Under Zedillo, Mexico's tax revenues have amounted
to no more than 11 percent of GDP; to attack poverty and improve
education, Fox has said he wants the figure to rise to 17 percent.
But he has also backed away from specific tax reforms, such as
introducing VAT on food.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo failed to persuade his own party to accept structural
reforms; lacking a congressional majority, Fox may struggle to gain
approval for his modest proposals to allow private investment in
electricity and oil.
</P>
<P>
   A second set of tasks for Fox is the reform of Mexico's
institutions. The depth of the rot under the PRI has been
highlighted by a string of setbacks and embarrassments that have
hit Zedillo's government since the presidential election in July. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   First, Oscar Espinosa, Zedillo's treasurer in the 1994
presidential campaign, resigned as tourism minister and disappeared
_ seemingly to escape prosecution on charges of embezzling $45
million while mayor of Mexico City from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a drama at Cancun airport, when police boarded an
aircraft to arrest Ricardo Cavallo, the head of Mexico's national
car registry, as a suspected Argentine war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Five former prisoners have identified him as Miguel Angel
Cavallo, a naval officer and torturer during Argentina's ``dirty
war'' of the 1970s. In Mexico, he had abused his position to
traffic in stolen cars.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, two army generals were last week arrested on
suspicion of helping drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Mexico's Supreme Court ruled last month that
Zedillo should hand over to congressional investigators documents
relating to Banco Union, a failed bank formerly run by Carlos Cabal
Peniche, a fugitive financier.
</P>
<P>
   Cabal lost an appeal on Aug. 30 against extradition from
Australia to face charges of fraudulently pocketing $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   He claims that he was pressed by aides, including Espinosa, to
make an illegal donation of $4 million from Banco Union's funds to
Zedillo's 1994 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the cost of that alleged donation would
have been passed on to taxpayers, since Banco Union was one of
several banks that later collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the government's flawed bailout of the financial system
after the 1994 devaluation is costing $100 billion. It was the
first time that the normally supine court had ruled against a
Mexican president.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, too, the PRI has blocked attempts in Congress to
investigate Cabal's claims, citing banking secrecy laws. But now
the courts and the new Congress may dig more deeply into the bank
bailout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The end of the PRI's rule, and the emergence of a plural
democracy in Mexico, were always likely to prompt an outpouring of
revelations of corruption and other wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   That process, if well-directed by Fox, should lead to a salutary
cleansing of public institutions. But it could yet prove to be
politically explosive.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that such scandals will damage Zedillo's personal
reputation for scrupulous honesty, though they may blight his
administration's record.
</P>
<P>
   With more pesos in their pockets, many Mexicans will no doubt
forgive Zedillo, if not some of his officials, regardless of what
the investigators turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his government's shortcomings, Mexicans will have
grounds for satisfaction if their new president turns out to be as
successful as his predecessor. &QL;

   In all, the government's flawed bailout of the financial system
after the 1994 devaluation is costing $100 billion. It was the
first time that the normally supine court had ruled against a
Mexican president.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, too, the PRI has blocked attempts in Congress to
investigate Cabal's claims, citing banking secrecy laws. But now
the courts and the new Congress may dig more deeply into the bank
bailout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The end of the PRI's rule, and the emergence of a plural
democracy in Mexico, were always likely to prompt an outpouring of
revelations of corruption and other wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   That process, if well-directed by Fox, should lead to a salutary
cleansing of public institutions. But it could yet prove to be
politically explosive.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that such scandals will damage Zedillo's personal
reputation for scrupulous honesty, though they may blight his
administration's record.
</P>
<P>
   With more pesos in their pockets, many Mexicans will no doubt
forgive Zedillo, if not some of his officials, regardless of what
the investigators turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his government's shortcomings, Mexicans will have
grounds for satisfaction if their new president turns out to be as
successful as his predecessor. &QL;

<P>
   SCI-REPRODUCING-ROBOTS (Undated) _ Bees do it. Birds do it.
Bacteria do it. Robots can't. When computer scientists at Brandeis
University two weeks ago unveiled a robotic system that designs and
builds other robots, that set off speculation that
self-reproducing, evolving robots could someday explore the galaxy,
or push humans to extinction. But it looks like the hardest
obstacle in building an intelligent, evolving, self-reproducing
robot may turn out to be the self-reproducing part. By Kenneth
Chang.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BUTTERFLIES (Undated) _ Over the past 20 years, biologists
have voiced increasing concern about the monarch butterfly's most
threatened and critical habitat, a single stretch of Mexican forest
to which hundreds of millions of these butterflies migrate from the
United States each year to spend the winter. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-RARE-INSECTS (Edgartown, Mass.) _ Ask people on Martha's
Vineyard about insects and they are likely to talk about
mosquitoes, no-see-ums and green-headed flies, all of which can
make life miserable here. But the island's insect population
comprises far more than pests. Entomologists hope to use it to
re-establish rare and endangered insect populations wiped out
elsewhere in New England years ago. By Cornelia Dean. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FIRES-NUKES (Undated) _ Fires in and around nuclear
facilities understandably make people nervous, and so this has been
an unnerving summer in the American West, where the wildfires that
ravaged millions of acres edged into several major complexes.
Scientists outside the Energy Department who reviewed the air
monitoring data from the fires at Los Alamos and Hanford agreed
that there did not seem to be any cause for alarm. But the risks of
radiation releases during and after wildfires at contaminated
nuclear sites are still not very well understood by scientists, let
alone the public. By Jon Christensen. (1700 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT6.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENETICS-SOCIETY (New York) _ Just before the Fourth of July
holiday, an international scientific consortium announced at a
White House celebration that it had largely deciphered the DNA
instructions encoded in the human chromosomes. Once the hoopla died
down, we who are involved in the work have turned to preparing a
scientific paper to be submitted later this year describing the
findings. But while scientific revolutions may start with dry,
objective data, but ultimate impact depends on human interpretation
in a societal context. So, I was glad to visit the Exit Art Gallery
in Soho for the opening of a different kind of genome annotation
project, a show entitled ``Paradise Now: Picturing the Genetic
Revolution'' by 39 artists probing the social meaning of genetics.
By Eric S. Lander. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DRUGS-CHILDREN (Undated) _ Starting this December, a new
Food and Drug Administration rule mandates that any new adult drug
that the FDA decides could be used by children with the same
disease must undergo pediatric study, and its manufacturers must
list doses for children on the label. We have a conversation with
Dr. Dianne Murphy, associate director of the FDA's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research. By Alexis Jetter. (2100 words)

</P>
<P>
   SCI-DRUGS-TESTS (Washington) _ In a hearing today, the FDA tries
to hammer out details of how ethically to test drugs on children.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undted) _ The Personal Health column: The
Sugar Association is trying to convince Americans that consuming
large quantities of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and snacks does not
harm one's nutritional status, body weight or long-term health. But
the research the association cites to support its contentions shows
how statistics can often be misleading if they present only part of
the story. Here is what you should know about the appalling
increase in sugar consumption by Americans _ especially children _
and the effects this increase is having on health. By Jane E.
Brody. (1400 words)

   SCI-SCOOTER-SAFETY (Undated) _ Those shiny, foot-propelled
scooters are everywhere, but so are injuries, according to a report

</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ A three-year survey indicates that many high school and
college football players who suffer concussions are allowed to
return to competition too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   _ An Arab village in Israel with unusually high rates of
Alzheimer's disease suggests that a recessive gene plays a role in
the condition, one that must be carried by both parents to take
effect, according to a new study in the journal Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   _ When men and women think about their extra poundage, they see
it in different terms, a new survey suggests: to women, the fat
embodies character flaws; to men, it's not their fault, it's those
darn business lunches.
</P>
<P>
   _ Saving the pacifier for when a baby is trying to fall asleep
may cut down on ear infections, a new study from Finland has
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   _ People who injure their knees as young adults may suffer for
it twice: once at the time, and later on through substantially
higher rates of arthritis, a study finds.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHRONIC-DISEASES (Undated) _ The Pew Environmental Health

`FLY' VIDEOS MAKE FITTING HALLOWEEN FARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOB STEPHENS  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fox Home Entertainment has released three
extraordinary, double-feature DVDs that are especially fitting for
Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Two if them contain Kurt Neumann's ``The Fly'' (1958/widescreen)
and Edward Bernd's ``Return of the Fly'' (1959/widescreen/b&AMP;w) and
David Cronenberg's ``The Fly'' (1986/widescreen) and Chris Walas'
``The Fly 2'' (1989/widescreen). The third offers Irwin Allen's
``Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'' (1961/widescreen) and Richard
Fleischer's ``Fantastic Voyage'' (1966/widescreen).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fly'' is about a scientist who, while working on
experiments, accidentally merges with one of the tiny insects on a
molecular level. The mishap leaves the man with a head of a fly,
and the fly with the head of a man.
</P>
<P>
   At the film's climax, we experience one of the most disturbing
images of mortality in cinema history when the fly, trapped in a
web, screams with a human voice as a spider approaches. The utter
helplessness of a bug made anthropomorphic is horrifying. (Such
hideous blendings of life forms may reinforce our suspicions that
the universe is ultimately senseless.)
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Price, David Hedison, Herbert Marshall and the excellent
Patricia Owens, whose reactions to the monstrosity are more
believable and affecting than those of her co-stars, are featured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return'' deals with the son who foolishly repeats his father's
disastrous experiments. There are a couple of grotesque hybrids in
this picture, and it's in glorious black-and-white. Price repeats
his earlier role of the original scientist's brother and is joined
by Brett Halsey as his troubled nephew. This time, the researcher
is not destroyed by hubris and chance, but by industrial espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the mid-century ``Flies'' are recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Cronenberg saw the 1958 ``Fly'' when he was a child and, having
been extremely literal-minded at the time, complained to the
manager about the fallacious science in the picture and demanded a
refund. The future director didn't like the alteration of the size
of the switched heads in relation to their new bodies _ the fly's
gets bigger and the human one shrinks. Cronenberg was too
inexperienced to understand that Neumann's film served an
allegorical purpose, not a scientific one.
</P>
<P>
   So Cronenberg's ``Fly'' is, in some ways, a response to the
theoretical sloppiness of the first version. But it also continues
the exploration of his own strange visions, troubling stories in
which the human race is a victim of inevitable disease and/or is
displaced by the evolution of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Goldblum plays the scientist who is seduced by the
possibilities of his work and Geena Davis is the woman who tries to
prevent his self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Walas, the creator of Cronenberg's monster models, directed
``Fly 2,'' in which the mutation is latent, inherited _ borne
silently within a young man's body. Eric Stoltz and Daphne Zuniga
are featured in this sequel.
</P>
<P>
   The two ``Voyages'' are enjoyable. In Allen's picture, a
nuclear-powered submarine descends to the darkness of the ocean
floor, a place with eerie creatures and unforeseeable hazards, in
an effort to rescue the Earth from lethal radiation. In Fleischer's
mysterious journey, human beings are miniaturized and they travel
through a scientist's body to save him from a blood clot in the
brain. The art direction of ``Fantastic'' is marvelous and portrays
the human interior, from the diminished perspective, as a vast
cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Pidgeon, Joan Fontaine and Peter Lorre star in ``Sea,''
and Raquel Welch, Stephen Boyd and Donald Pleasence are featured in
``Fantastic.''

THREATENED FROG TO GET EXTRA PROTECTION IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The threatened red-legged frog, which is
believed to be the inspiration for Mark Twain's short story ``The
Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,'' is about to get
extra protection from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to an order from U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San
Francisco, the agency on Friday proposed that 5.4 million acres in
31 California counties be designated as a critical habitat for the
frog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest area that we've ever designated in
California,'' said Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Patricia
Foulk.
</P>
<P>
   The red-legged frog reaches 5 inches in length and is the
largest native frog in the West. It breeds in wetlands, streams,
ponds and stock ponds, but its historic range has diminished by 70
percent. Just four areas in the state harbor more than 350 adult
red-legged frogs.
</P>
<P>
   The entire San Mateo County coast and most of West Marin, where
some of the largest populations of red-legged frogs live, are
designated as a critical habitat in the Fish and Wildlife Service
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Critical habitat designation affects developers who need federal
permits _ usually from the Army Corps of Engineers _ for their
projects. The Fish and Wildlife Service has to sign off on those
permits, attesting that the development will not have an adverse
effect on the threatened species, as defined by the Endangered
Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Miller, a spokesman for the Center for Biological Diversity
in Berkeley, said that a major pressure point where development and
the red-legged frog may collide is in Contra Costa County where
several big subdivisions along Danville and Tassajara creeks are in
the works.
</P>
<P>
   Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Foulk said that
designating a critical habitat for a threatened or endangered
species isn't the same as establishing a preserve for it. The
agency can fine developers who knowingly trash a critical habitat,
but as a practical matter, she said, mitigation measures such as
altering the footprint of a development, or the land on which a
building will be constructed, usually satisfy the agency's
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it is less of a protective measure than
environmentalists would like, ``it's a positive step and might
bring about the recovery of a listed species,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The red-legged frog was listed as threatened in 1996 under the
Endangered Species Act. At that time, the Fish and Wildlife Service
concluded that designating a critical habitat was ``not prudent,''
because it would not benefit the species and might make it more
vulnerable to habitat vandalism and unauthorized collection. Alsup
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Center for Biological Diversity as a plaintiff in
the complaint against the Fish and Wildlife Service were the
Jumping Frog Research Institute of Calaveras County and the Center
for Sierra Nevada Conservation.

CONSERVATION PITS PARK SERVICE AGAINST INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the high sandstone desert of northeastern
Arizona, two Hopi men traveled to a sacred ancestral spot last year
in search of nests of golden eagle chicks.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of years, young men in initiation ceremonies have
scaled mesas near the Little Colorado River and the Painted Desert
to capture the eaglets. The birds are later killed in holy rites
for the very existence of the Hopi and the world.
</P>
<P>
   But on that day in May 1999, the National Park Service turned
away the two men.
</P>
<P>
   Park managers for the 35,000-acre Wupatki National Monument near
Flagstaff told them their permit to capture 40 golden eaglets in
three Arizona counties might be valid on private property or land
owned by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. But
not Park Service land.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming a loss of religious freedom, the Hopi tribe complained
to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, a former governor of Arizona.
They wanted a change in the Organic Act of 1916, which created the
National Park Service and protects for future generations the
scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife. Babbitt has
directed his agency's Solicitor's Office to decide the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is expected to reverberate throughout the country _
perhaps opening parks to hunting of caribou in Alaska, desert
bighorn sheep in Arizona and elk in California, Washington and New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult,'' said Sam Henderson, superintendent of
the Wupatki, Walnut Canyon and Sunset Crater monuments in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at Hopi who were friends were suddenly pointing the
fingers at us, the bad guys, and we pride ourselves in our
relationships with Native American groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these monuments are islands of wildness in America saved
for future generations. In another 200 years, maybe these islands
will be there in their original shape as primitive as they are
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Other park superintendents await the decision. The Hualapai have
talked about hunting bighorn sheep and deer in the Grand Canyon
National Park. Shoshone and other groups have wanted to open
buffalo hunting in Yellowstone National Park. In California's
Redwood National Park, the Yurok have asked about hunting elk and
deer, and the Quinault wish to hunt in the Olympic National Park in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past years, the National Park Service has interpreted
the Organic Act to mean prohibiting hunting, killing, wounding,
frightening, capturing or attempting to capture animals in national
parks. There are few exceptions, one of them Grand Teton National
Park in Wyoming. When it expanded by two-thirds to 305,000 acres in
1950, park advocates had to compromise by allowing cattle grazing,
private property and an airport in the park, and hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Department spokeswoman Stephanie Hanna said the
decision from the Solicitor's Office could come in weeks and
certainly before the end of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The decision might involve only the Wupatki case. But Interior
Department officials indicate that they may recommend broader
regulations, driven by Babbitt, affecting many other parks and
monuments.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough issue, because the Park Service's policy nationwide
``has been no take of animals from national parks,'' Hanna said.
``The role is generally to provide an unthreatened environment for
wildlife so they're behaving the way they would in the wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Wupatki situation presents an agonizing choice, Hanna
said. Interior may have to look at the different language in the
legislation that formed each park and at Indian treaties, which may
open a greater range of activities.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of talk disturbs environmental groups that hold the
parks inviolate as the last haven for nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new policy coming down from the Solicitor's Office of the
Interior Department has the potential to change nearly 85 years of
precedent,'' said Frank Buono, a former Park Service employee and a
member of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a
nonprofit group in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The group cites 13 parks where American Indians seek to take or
hunt animals, and 12 parks where it found that such requests could
be reasonably anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are places that people go with their families to see
wildlife in their natural state,'' Buono said. ``They don't expect
to encounter people with guns, traps and bows and arrows killing
animals. If we say that the Organic Act that made the Park Service
didn't have to strictly protect all the animals, and we can permit

fundamental character that distinguishes our parks and monuments

   Eugene Kaye, chief of staff for Hopi Chairman Wayne Taylor, said
the eagle, the red-tailed hawk and other birds played an essential
role in religious and cultural activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should recognize that just as for any other peoples'
religion, this is our religion,'' Kaye said. ``We have a strong
system of religious beliefs, and the survival of our existence
depends on these beliefs. Our survival depends on these birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``First it was the Spanish that came here, then the churches.
Then the federal government tried to stop our religious practices.
Now people are continuing trying to stop us by saying Hopi
shouldn't gather eagles. It's just another way of driving Indians
out.''

   David Simon, Southwest regional director of the nonprofit
National Parks Conservation Association in Albuquerque, said a
change in Park Service policy would be so important, so enormous
and so precedent-setting that Congress, rather than the Interior
Department, should consider it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is too big and carries too much significance to
be made solely by an administration, particularly with as little
time left that there is in this one,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard from our members on this topic. They are very
sympathetic to the Native American issues,'' he said. ``But by and
large, the response has been nearly unanimous that they are
concerned about killing of the animals in highly protected places
like national parks. They are concerned that it might mean similar
activities in parks near and dear to them.''

DOW JONES TO PROVIDE BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES' PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Talk about an ironic sight: A room packed with
gay journalists, leaping to their feet to applaud an organization
not noted for its sexual radicalism _ Dow Jones &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones, publisher of the conservative Wall Street Journal,
will award domestic partner benefits to its employees regardless of
sexual orientation, the newspaper's managing editor, Paul Steiger,
told the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association meeting
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits allow the companions of homosexual employees to
receive or be beneficiaries of benefits that would normally be
accorded to a spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing numbers of companies are offering such benefits to
all unmarried partners of employees, straight or homosexual, who
can provide some proof of a lasting relationship, such as a joint
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco audience hissed when informed that the NBC
television network and its owner, the General Electric Co., are
dragging their feet on the domestic partners issue. NBC is the last
of the four major networks not to provide such benefits to its
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Madison, NBC's vice president of diversity, sharply
questioned its domestic partners policy during her speech at the
conference, which ended Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Madison said that she already has appealed to NBC to extend
domestic partner benefits to all employees, and that she plans
further meetings with corporate executives. She drew a big laugh
when she added caustically that she wasn't satisfied with their
responses to date: ``I'm not sure I believe they're rational.''
</P>
<P>
   The first report about Dow Jones' decision was broken by a
Columbia University graduate student journalist, Alex Cerniglia,
31. He reported it in a newsletter, Digital Reporter Print Edition.
On Saturday, when the Wall Street Journal's Steiger, addressing the
conference, confirmed Cerniglia's story, he won a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``How often have you seen so many gays and lesbians stand up and
applaud the Wall Street Journal?'' said the moderator, CBS News
national correspondent Jeffrey Kofman.

   TRAVEL-LONDON-THEATER (London) _ Want a big theatrical success?
Hire yourself a celebrity, preferably a film star. This blunt
wisdom has recently brought Kevin Spacey, Cate Blanchett, Nicole
Kidman and others to London, and, with Jerry Hall replacing
Kathleen Turner as the seductive Mrs. Robinson, is currently
ensuring that an adaptation of ``The Graduate'' is packing the

   TRAVEL-AMSTERDAM (Undated) _ As Dutch as tulips and considerably
more fun, bicycles _ or fietsen, as they're called in Amsterdam _
are ideally suited to the brick-paved canal streets of the old
central city and to the flat landscape surrounding the urban area.
They're everywhere: chained to bridges, parked by the hundreds
outside Central Station, rolling steadily by (often with one or two
small passengers aboard) as you sit in outdoor cafes. By Judith

   TRAVEL-EUROPE-AIRPORTS (Paris) _ The fatal crash of a supersonic
Concorde northeast of Paris on July 25 has renewed debate over the
construction of a third major airport to serve the French capital.
The fact that the Concorde could easily have come down on top of a
small town, with even more than the four deaths that resulted among
people on the ground, is also raising questions about the safety of
existing airports in or near cities, about their further
development and about the location of future airports elsewhere in

GAP LOSES SOME OF ITS LUSTER AS SALES DIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When everyone wants to be in vests, as in last
year's ubiquitous ``Everybody in Vests'' campaign, it looks great
on Gap Inc.'s bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   But when everyone doesn't, it can get ugly.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Gap's sales have tumbled, and the stock has
taken a nosedive, closing at $23.88 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's sales drop at Gap's Old Navy franchise was
especially disturbing since the chain has been Gap's main growth
vehicle and was responsible for 35 percent of the San
Francisco-based retailer's sales of $11.6 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Why in this strong economy and during the back-to-school season
is Gap, once a darling of retail stocks, faltering?
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers have decided maybe everybody doesn't want to be in
leather. Or cargo pants. Or polar fleece.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sanghera, 23, and her sister, Sharon, 19, of London were
shopping at a Gap in San Francisco but did not buy anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make clothes for casual, everyday wear. But the sort of
prices they have aren't everyday,'' Jay Sanghera said.
</P>
<P>
   August sales at Gap stores opened at least a year dropped 14
percent, compared to an 8 percent increase for the same month a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking that down by its three divisions, Gap's namesake stores
dropped about 5 percent; its higher end Banana Republic brand
dipped 3 percent, and 6-year-old Old Navy skidded 25 percent,
according to analysts at Thomas Weisel Partners and company
reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Gap store figures compare with a 3 percent drop in sales in
August 1999. Banana Republic and Old Navy numbers were pitted
against tough comparisons of 15 and 18 percent increases,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The more recent results followed the release of Gap's
second-quarter earnings report, which showed a 6 percent decline in
earnings to $184 million compared to $194 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Gap wasn't the only retailer to hit a rough patch last month.
J.C. Penney Co., trendy Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch Co. and Dillard's Inc.
all reported sales declines.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the retailers who fumbled this season were busy trying
to come up with outside explanations for why the season suffered _
the weather, decreased consumer confidence and increased debt, and
the greater number of year-round schools and schools that require
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Gap executives have blamed the problems on
weaker-than-anticipated back-to-school traffic, heavy markdowns,
inventory problems at Old Navy and an unsuccessful campaign that
concentrated on in-store promotions rather than television ads.
</P>
<P>
   While some of those excuses may be valid, David Szymanski,
director of the Center for Retailing Studies at Texas A&AMP;M
University, said they are just that _ excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too hot, too cold. It rained, it didn't rain. It's
always the Lord's working that keeps us from being successful,''
Szymanski said. ``Unfortunately, the Gap's numbers are really down,
but some of the other retailers aren't doing so badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those retailers who did well happened to be Gap
competitors. Same-store sales at the Limited Inc. rose 6 percent,
buoyed by an impressive 15 percent leap at its Express division.
American Eagle Outfitters Inc. beat analysts' expectations with a
9.1 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean Millard ``Mickey'' Drexler, Gap's chief
executive, has lost the Midas touch that has made Gap one of the
most widely recognized and respected specialty retailers?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gap is in a period of adjustment. Mickey Drexler is too
smart, too good. The organization is too strong,'' said Abbey
Doneger, president of the Doneger Group, a New York-based
merchandise consultancy. ``They will fix their business in short
order.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail consultants and analysts attribute the company's
performance to problems with its fashions. Shoppers apparently
don't want Gap's hot pink Capri pants or, on the other extreme,
many of the company's monochromatic offerings.
</P>
<P>
   On the Old Navy side, the company may have skewed so far in
favor of its youthful audience with its techno/rave-like styles
that it alienated older shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a time when the economy is good and people are spending
money. But they're only going to spend it on things they're excited
about,'' Doneger said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Gap executives did not comment for this story.
</P>
<P>
   But in a presentation to investors at the Goldman Sachs Seventh
Annual Global Retailing Conference in New York on Thursday, Drexler
was pretty blunt about his company's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our recent performance has been bad. We're unhappy about it .
. . and we're not making any excuses about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he reassured investors by saying that despite the sale
slump, ``We still have three incredibly strong, powerful brands we
feel have exciting long-term opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Drexler said the brands, especially Old Navy, had grown so fast
that the company's infrastructure could not keep up. That led to
inventory and marketing problems as well as fashion mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be better disciplined in our businesses, and we
need to continue to take the appropriate risks,'' Drexler told
investors.

OLYMPIC CITY GETS A GOLD MEDAL FOR FOOD

<P>
   Here are some of the hot dining spots in Sydney:
</P>
<P>
   Sailors Thai: Fabulous Thai food in a Spartan setting (stone
walls and bare floors make for loud dining). Spicy? You betcha. Try
the duck soup with pickled limes; red peanuts curry of beef shank
and Thai basil; or stir-fried crispy pork with Chinese broccoli.
Reservations are recommended; also open for lunch Monday through
Friday. The restaurant is on the Rocks within the Sailors Home,
below the stairs of the Sydney Visitor's Center. $$$
</P>
<P>
   Bel Mondo: Another favorite for locals at the Rocks, this fine
Italian restaurant features fresh produce and Australian and
imported wines. A few Sydney samplers include spinach and ricotta
gnocchi with yabbies (shrimplike shellfish), burned butter and
Parmesan; quail and borlotti bean soup with mushroom crotini; and
fritto misto of Yamba king prawns with eggplant and zucchini with
garlic mayonnaise. The Manfredi family, chefs Stefano and his
mother, Franca, have taken Italian to new heights. $$$$
</P>
<P>
   MG Garage: They don't have a drive-in window, but four classic
MGs are for sale on the restaurant's floor. The food here is over
the top and defies categorizing. Maybe crazy Continental _ how else
could you explain galantine and leg ham of suckling pig cooked in
hay; bacon and herb-crumbed fillet of rabbit with liver faggots; or
braised grilled octopus with Spanish onions and potato gnocchi?
$$$$
</P>
<P>
   Ettamogah Bar &AMP; Restaurant at Darling Harbour: Tired of all the
high-dollar food that our Sydney hosts were serving up, we opted
for steak and chips one night at this chain eatery based on a
popular Australian cartoon strip. Located in the Harbourside
Festival Marketplace, the Ettamogah had cheap steaks _ $8 (U.S.)
for a T-bone with salad and fries and gravy. Other menu items
included Neber Neber Nachos for less than $5; seafood basket
featuring crab, calamari, fish and prawns for $8; and burgers. $$
</P>
<P>
   Nick's Seafood Restaurant: Overlooking Darling Harbor, this
waterside eatery offered up the true seafood lovers platter with
lobster, king prawns, crabs, fresh oysters, catch of the day
(baramundi is a favorite), calamari and steamed mussels. Menu price
is $85 Australian for two or about $50 U.S. _ and it is a feast of
the freshest seafood Sydney can offer. Nick's also has steak, lamb,
pasta and a children's menu. $$$$
</P>
<P>
   Harry's Cafe de Wheels, Cowper Wharf Roadway: Woolloomooloo is
home to this famous pie cart. Since 1945, Harry's has been renown
for its mushy peas and meat pies. Mushy peas are as bright green as
guacamole _ diners get a scoop on top of a flaky meat pie. This
local favorite is served on paper plates along the roadside near
the Australian fleet base. $

SHOPPING FOR BARGAINS IN KANGAROO LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE COOPER  
 c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The Saturday market in Paddington has a
distinctive feel, part flea market, part craft fair, with tables
and tents set up around St. John's Church offering all sorts of
crafts, jewelry, secondhand clothing and imports. Many products
bear the ``Australian Made'' tag with a kangaroo.
</P>
<P>
   On Oxford Street, the shops and cafes are doing booming
business. This is the high street of fashion for Sydney, with every
kind of clothing store you can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian fashion industry has a rising star in Collette
Dinnigan, who has a shop just a few blocks off Oxford Street. The
thirtysomething designer has dressed such stars as Sandra Bullock,
Cameron Diaz, Cate Blanchette, Nicole Kidman and Elle McPherson.
Dinnigan has shops in Sydney, Melbourne and London. A little beaded
dress at $2,599 (Australian) is gauzy and fun and just might be
what Kidman is wearing for a night out on the town with husband Tom
Cruise in the next People magazine.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best places for shoppers to explore, but especially
good on Saturday and Sunday, is the market at the Rocks,
practically in the shadow of the Harbour Bridge. Booths along
George Street stretch for what seems like miles under white-topped
canopies. At the Rocks Square, a jazz group plays catchy tunes
while families dine al fresco on take-out that includes Thai food
and McDonald's (the most obvious American fast-food franchise in
Sydney).
</P>
<P>
   For a thrifty traveler, there are some wonderful souvenirs at
the market: bargain opals (but know your stuff first), kangaroo and
koala images in every shape and kind of product from jewelry to
Christmas ornaments; boomerangs; Australian coins (pennies are
collectors' items since they don't use or make them anymore) and
stamps; posters of Sydney sites; and antiques. The little shops
around the market aren't forgotten by the shoppers. The festive
atmosphere is contagious.
</P>
<P>
   Other markets in Sydney include Balmain Market (Saturdays on
Darling Street), Glebe's market at Glebe Public School (Saturdays)
and the Bondi Beach Market on Bondi Public Beach at the northern
end of Campbell Parade (Sundays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Sydney has a number of shopping arcades, from the 200 shops in
the Queen Victoria Building, which dates from 1897, to the modern
SkyGarden, a retail and office complex with more than 60 shops and
cafes. The area around Pitt Street is home to the Pitt Street Mall,
Mid City Centre, the Strand Arcade (opened in 1892) with 85 shops,
and Piccadilly on Pitt with salons, accessories, cafes and fashion
wear.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ The kangaroo question is always jumping up.
So let's get that out the way. No, I didn't see any live ones but
there were lots of stuffed kangaroos, packaged kangaroo jerky and
more than a few pelts for sale.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't spot Mel Gibson, pet a koala, drink any Foster's beer
(not a popular brew on its home continent), play a didgeridoo (an
Aboriginal musical instrument), dive into a billabong (waterhole)
or experience a willy-willy (sudden gust of wind).
</P>
<P>
   What I did get in less than a week in the harbor city of Sydney
is a sample of what must be the friendliest host city for the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism people are banking that TV viewers will see the joys
of Sydney and eventually give in to urges to head Down Under. The
Sydney Olympic Games are just the thing to whet the appetite of
travelers. While the city will look good when the cameras are
rolling for the Olympians, the sparkle won't stop when the athletes
and news media go home.
</P>
<P>
   This beautiful city was ``founded'' by convicts from British
prison ships in the 18th century. If it hadn't been for that nasty
revolution in the Colonies, the Brits would have had all of North
America to keep shipping convicts to. But in 1788, the British
government chose to use New South Wales and the fleet landed with a
motley group of petty burglars and debtors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were people inhabiting this vast land. The
Aboriginal presence in Australia goes back thousands of years. It
is only in recent years that the European descendants have
attempted reconciliation with the Aboriginal people and it wasn't
until the 1960s that Aborigines began to receive full rights of
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, the people of Sydney and Melbourne held separate
marches to show support for a national apology. Hundreds of
thousands of people walked across the Harbour Bridge in Sydney _ a
great big ``I'm sorry'' for many years of mistreatment.
</P>

<P>
   GORGEOUS CITY
</P>
<P>
   Modern Sydney sparkles. In the words of Steve Irwin, Australia's
famous ``Crocodile Hunter,'' ``Sydney is gorgeous.'' The city of
4.5 million is perhaps the cleanest metropolis I've ever visited _
no graffiti and very little trash on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   And it's very friendly. The people in the service industry,
clerks in the stores and waiters/waitresses are very polite and
knowledgeable. Tipping is appreciated, but the system is not
entirely entrenched in Australia. Good service in upscale eateries
can be rewarded by ``rounding up'' (to the next dollar) when it
comes to paying the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Prices on my visit in early June were very reasonable, with
dining out a wonderful value for Americans. The Australian dollar
is worth about 58 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping in mind that the seasons are reversed south of the
Equator, early June in Sydney is cool _ mid 50s _ and it is winter.
September is spring in Australia, said to be one of the best times
to visit. Sydney is blessed with a temperate climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sydney lives along the beaches,'' said Robert West,
owner/operator of Sydney Greeters and Guides. From the airport we
take a winding tour through the streets of the city; we could have
taken the new train that serves the airport, but West is a terrific
guide and points out sights along the motor route.
</P>
<P>
   A former government worker, West has turned his knowledge of
Sydney and tourism to good use.
</P>
<P>
   A friendly waterfront park custodian offers the first advice in
Sydney _ skip the $20 guided harbor tour and stick to the ferries
for $4 ($2.55 U.S.) each way. Taxis are abundant, but you can't
beat the ferry on a blue-sky day for a great view of the famous
Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Ferries, part of the public transportation system,
make regular runs among Circular Quay (pronounced key), Darling
Point, Double Bay, Rose Bay and Watsons Bay. Working people use the
ferries for their daily commute.
</P>
<P>
   The locals have dubbed Double Bay ``Double Pay'' because of the
upscale shops and homes. This is where you'll find the Ritz Carlton
and the newly rich. A short stay in Sydney is not enough time to
explore each section. Each suburb of Sydney has its own personality
_ from Darling Harbor to Woolloomooloo.
</P>
<P>
   Darlinghurst, which has been compared to New York's SoHo, began
as home to Sydney's gentry. Hard times came and it fell into
disrepute. Now guidebooks call Darlinghurst ``Sydney's all night
heartbeat.'' Boutique hotels such as the Kirketon and the Medusa
help mark its renaissance. The 40-room Kirketon was built in the
1920s as a hotel while the 18-room Medusa dates from the 1880s and
was a private home.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocks _ houses and structures built near the water's edge _
was the first white settlement in Sydney, built in 1788 after the
First Fleet landed with 1,400 men, women and children from Britain.
The Sydney Visitor Center is here at 106 George St., a good stop
for a walking tour map ($1 U.S.). The center is housed in the 1864
Sailors Home, a refuge for visiting sailors in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   DAY AND NIGHT LIFE
</P>
<P>
   The imposing Museum of Contemporary Art is housed in a 1930s Art
Deco building that faces the harbor. Near Circular Quay visitors
will find the Museum of Sydney _ on the site of the first
government house _ with a collection of items from Sydney's unusual
history.

SLURVIAN: YAGODDAPROLLEMWIDDAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 17)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What students of the New York accent now categorize as
``first-stage Slurvian'' was reported in the 1938 Federal Writers
Project ``Almanac for New Yorkers.'' An example given was
 &UR; onnafyah &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The definition of  &UR; onnafyah &LR; , as consumers of hurried meals in
Manhattan know, is ``a short order is being prepared.'' The
metaphor of a burger sizzling on the grill has since been extended
to a more general ``it'll be ready in a minute,'' whether or not
applied to food. This brings to mind another first-stage Slurvian
expression,  &UR; jeet &LR; ?, a quick way of asking someone if he has eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Slurvian is not limited to New York City. The most famous
example of slurred speech embodied in dialect is the Southern
 &UR; y'all &LR; , which has its equivalent in New York Slurvian  &UR; alluhyuz &LR; .
(That's if the emphasis is on the  &UR; all &LR; ; if the speaker wishes to
stress the plural  &UR; you &LR; , the phrase becomes  &UR; alluhyooz &LR; .) And in
California,  &UR; g'yonit &LR;  signifies ``get on it,'' meaning ``get
moving.''
</P>
<P>
   These amalgams and other familiar interrogatory compressions _
 &UR; tsamatta &LR; ?,  &UR; hootoadjadat &LR; ?,  &UR; whaddyanutz &LR; ? _ have no meaning
other than the phrases when separated: ``What's the matter? Who
told you that? What are you, nuts?'' Of greater semantic interest
are the phrases that gain a separate sense when deliberately
slurred. We will now consider ``second-stage Slurvian.''
</P>
<P>
   Linguists will not soon forget  &UR; fuggedaboudit &LR; . Although the
transliteration of the New Yorkese phrase has appeared on T-shirts
around the country, the expression is not being dropped by Noo
Yawkiz, which so often happens when a dialect phrase becomes
adopted by outsiders. That is because the slurred words do not mean
only the literal ``forget about it''; rather, the phrase is
second-stage Slurvian for ``don't bother me with that'' or a more
figurative ``it'll be a cold day in hell before I buy that
cockamamie notion.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest Slurvian synonym to  &UR; fuggedaboudit &LR;  is
 &UR; gedaddaheeuh &LR; , which long ago lost its initial meaning of ``leave
the premises'' and now conveys disbelief shot through with an
abiding disdain. Standing alone,  &UR; gedaddaheeuh &LR;  means ``I don't
believe you'' or the more vivid ``don't give me that baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   But when used in the start of a sentence like `` &UR; Gedaddaheeuh &LR; 
wid yer fancy talk,'' the disbelief turns to vehement rejection, in
the sense of ``I vigorously reject your highfalutin language.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of the compressed phrase is no longer the sum of its
individual words; the compressed phrase conveys a meaning all its
own. Another example of the semantic change called ``figurative
extension'' that grew out of New York speedspeech is  &UR; noprollem &LR; ,
which originally meant ``I can do it easily'' but now can be a
modest response to gratitude with the primary sense of ``you're
welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Derision at such elision is misplaced. The University of
Pennsylvania's William Labov, whose classic 1966 study, ``The
Social Stratification of English in New York City,'' demonstrated
that the city is a melting pot of various dialects, should be
delighted. (I have been unable to pinpoint the locale of
 &UR; gerareheeuh &LR; , a variant of  &UR; gedaddaheeuh &LR; ; fresh street research
is needed.)
</P>
<P>
   The lexicographer Sol Steinmetz notes that the Brooklyn accent
differs from Noo Yawkese: `` &UR; Oily boid &LR;  is Brooklynese,'' he says,
``as any Manhattanite or Bronxite will inform you in no unsoyten
toyms. There is no standard New York pronunciation of words like
 &UR; car &LR; ,  &UR; bad &LR;  and  &UR; off &LR; . What we think of as `New Yorkese' is the
least prestigious of the various social dialects, or the one that
differs or deviates most from standard American English. That is
why New York speech has a low prestige even among its own
speakers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Off &LR; . I just pronounced that as I wrote it, and it sounded like
``awf,'' as in  &UR; awful &LR; , not like ``off'' as in  &UR; offal &LR; . For help on
this, I turned to the pronunciation maven Charles Harrington
Elster, author of ``Is There a Cow in Moscow?'' (Yes, but there is
no  &UR; zoo &LR;  in zo-ology.)
</P>
<P>
   ``New York tawk features a diphthongal  &UR; aw &LR;  sound,'' Elster
observes, ``that in heavy New Yorkese sounds almost disyllabic.''
(Before a Parisian reader of this column in The International
Herald Tribune expostulates,  &UR; Gedaddaheeuh &LR;   &UR; avec ton baratin &LR; ,''
let me translate. A  &UR; diphthong &LR;  is the gliding sound of combining
vowels, as in the  &UR; oy &LR;  in the head-smacking Yiddish  &UR; oy veh &LR; .
 &UR; Disyllabic &LR;  means ``having two syllables.'') ``It's impossible for
me to transliterate this elongated  &UR; aw &LR;  here, but ask a
dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker to pronounce  &UR; dog &LR;  and  &UR; coffee &LR;  and
you'll come close.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers are also renowned  &UR; r &LR; -droppers,'' Elster says.
``Day eat wid a  &UR; fawk &LR; , day walk onna  &UR; flaw &LR; , an day drink adda
 &UR; bah &LR; . The superintendent of their apartment building is  &UR; da
soopuh &LR; , and The New York Times is  &UR; da paypuh &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   He agrees that ``their propensity for slurvy pronunciation can
sometimes be nothing short of miraculous. When I lived in New York,
I remember how conductors on the Long Island Rail Road managed to
slur the name of a certain station, Woodside, into the
unintelligible  &UR; wuss-eye &LR;  (the eye of a wuss?).''
</P>
<P>
   BIG APPLESOURCE
</P>
<P>
   Controversy rages over who coined ``the Big Apple'' as a moniker
for New York.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest citation is in Edward Martin's 1909 book, ``The
Wayfarer in New York.'' Martin, a founder of the Harvard Lampoon
and first editor of the humor magazine Life, was writing about the
attitude of the Midwest toward the metropolis: ``Kansas is apt to
see in New York a greedy city .... It inclines to think that the
big apple gets a disproportionate share of the national sap.''
</P>
<P>
   The Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang notes
an absence of capitalization or quotation marks in this citation
and thinks it ``probable that the 1909 quotation represents a
metaphorical or perhaps proverbial usage, rather than a concrete
example of the later slang term.'' I dunno about that;
capitalization is not necessary in coinage, and quotation marks
only would suggest an earlier use.
</P>
<P>
   The etymologist Barry Popik, with fresh support from the phrase
detectives Fred Shapiro and Gerald Cohen, has long been campaigning
to give coinage honors to John J. Fitzgerald, a turf writer. He
wrote in The New York Morning Telegraph on Feb. 18, 1924: ``There's
only one  &UR; Big Apple &LR; . That's New York.''
</P>
<P>
   After Fitzgerald popularized the term, crediting it to
African-American stable hands in New Orleans in 1920, the columnist
Walter Winchell picked it up in 1927. A decade later it became the
name of a Harlem nightclub and a dance.
</P>
<P>
   Popik makes a strong case, but I'd credit Martin with coinage
and Fitzgerald with independent recoinage and early popularization.
But you pays yer money and you takes yer cherce (from an 1846
cartoon in the British magazine Punch).

 SYDNEY: Australia: x x x unusual history.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1840 Customs House is now home to the (free) Object
Galleries, a showcase for Australian craft and design; (free) City
Exhibition Space; and a 1:500 scale model of the city (growing
daily), plus cafes, bars and a restaurant. Outside Customs House,
in a plaza smack dab in the middle of central Sydney, you might be
entertained by street performers plying their craft _ from fire
eaters to acrobats.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Darling Harbor, the free evening laser show (Wednesday
through Sunday), ``A Fish Opera,'' vies for visitor attention with
street performers such as a young woman who throws a flaming baton.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish Opera audience is rewarded with a wonderful show mixing
whimsy of laser-light fish singing opera classics with the voices
of famous opera legends such as Luciano Pavarotti.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas came to Sydney in 1997 with the opening of the Star
City casino, a 24-hour gambling operation at Darling Harbor. Run by
the government, Star City seems more Disney (the art looks like a
spillover from ``The Little Mermaid'') than Vegas (and no tipping
allowed in the casino) _ funky neon and fake palm trees, Aboriginal
art, huge fish tanks and wandering costumed dancers performing on
stilts. You won't hear the bells, clanging and loud slot machines
heard at Vegas or Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   If the lure of the sea is strong, or maybe if sailing is in your
blood, there are a number of ways to enjoy the waters around
Sydney. EastSail offers ``drive-yourself'' and skippered boats.
Daylong excursions around the harbor include a sumptuous seafood
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Our group of American and Canadian journalists set sail on one
of the coldest days in June with winds up to 38 knots _ not the
best introduction to sailing Australian waters, but skipper Steve
``Smiley'' Pyne kept his good humor. Pyne, a 40ish dead ringer for
ex-Monty Pythonite Michael Palin, pointed out sites such as Pinch
Cut Island and Fort Dennison, built during the Crimean War.
</P>
<P>
   We sailed the 40-foot Madeline, protected from the rain and wind
with full rubber sailing suits. Despite the choppy waters and the
chill, we enjoyed the platters of seafood (shrimp, prawns, squid),
meat, bread, cheese and fruit. The cost of the three-hour cruise
for eight with lunch was about $500 (U.S.). EastSail is located at
Rushcutters Bay at D'Albora Marina, five minutes from the city
center.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Bounty'' sailed by as we cruised the harbor. Built for the
1978 movie starring Gibson, Australia's favorite son, the replica
sets sail twice daily for lunch and dinner Monday through Friday
and three times a day on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $31 (no meal) to $58 for a dinner cruise, per
person, with children 12 and younger charged 40 percent off adult
prices (all U.S.). Passengers are allowed to help the crew hoist
the sail and steer the ship, just as Capt. William Bligh's crew did
more than 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other cruises around Sydney, operating from Circular Quay,
include Capt. Cook Cruises, Vagabond Cruises and Matilda Cruises.
Each operates 1 1/2-to-2 1/2-hour cruises with tea, lunch or
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to enjoy Sydney Harbour is from the top of the
Harbour Bridge. Begun in 1923 and completed in 1931, the bridge
connects Kirribilli with the city.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years it has been all the rage to walk to the top of
the bridge, some 442 feet above sea level, and look out over the
harbor (and eight lanes of traffic on the bridge below). The walk
takes three hours from the start at Bridge Climb headquarters, 5
Cumberland in the Rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Climbers wear a special ``BridgeSuit'' (let's not call them jump
suits) and are attached to a static line. They walk to the top of
the arch and get a photo taken by a member of the company's staff
(climbers may not carry anything, even a camera) before returning
to base the same way. Cost of the day climb is about $68 (U.S.) for
adults and $56 for children 12-16.
</P>
<P>
   Night climbs are available Thursday through Saturday and
reservations are necessary. Check the Web at www.bridgeclimb.com.

<P>
   THE OPERA HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney Opera House, home to opera, ballet and dance, is one
of the most recognizable landmarks in Australia. Jutting on
Bennelong Point like white shells on the water, the opera house was
completed in 1973 after 14 years at a cost of $59 million (U.S.).
</P>
<P>
   Guided tours are conducted daily Monday through Friday for $7.50
for adults and $5 for students. On Sunday a market selling
Australian-made arts and crafts is held near the front entrance.
</P>
<P>
   I may not have spotted the real Mel Gibson, but the reel Gibson
may be just the ticket at the newly opened (fall '99) Fox Studios
Australia. His name is on the marquee and a larger-than-life poster
of Mel stands near the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Studios Australia combines theme park fun with a working
movie studio on the edge of Sydney's Central Business District. In
scale, though, this is no Disney/MGM.
</P>
<P>
   Bent Street, the area around the studio, is a free pedestrian
mall with shopping, movie theaters, cafes, bars and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The Backlot comprises eight experiences and attractions _ the
best of which is James Cameron's ``Titanic: the Experience.''
Visitors line up to be ``extras'' on the movie, but that's where
fact and fiction meld. The special effects are outstanding and the
movie memorabilia is a treat for fans of the blockbuster film.
</P>
<P>
   An insider's secret: There are two lines at the entrance, one
group will ``sink'' and one will ``survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at Fox, visitors are entertained by roaming bands of
costumed actors, can walk through the ``Babe'' set, enjoy a goofy
show called ``Lights! Camera! Chaos!,'' experience a cartoon
adventure with ``The Simpsons Down Under'' and see a showcase of
film costumes and props. Backlot admission ranges from $13 (U.S.)
for kids 6 to 15 to $22 for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is hopping, that's for sure. You don't have to see a
kangaroo to know that.

 &HT;    PERSONABLE EX-GOVERNOR RAISES GOP SENATE HOPES IN VIRGINIA
 &HT;    830&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Va. _ ``My daughter likes 'N Sync, too,'' declared
George Allen, recognizing the faces on the T-shirt of 11-year-old
Caitlin Mooney.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a political heartbeat, the Republican senatorial
candidate steered a conversation with Caitlin's parents through
teen music to soccer to horseback riding to public education to why
they should vote for him in the race against the Commonwealth's
incumbent Democrat, Chuck Robb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically Republicans anyway,'' Caitlin's dad, Rob
Mooney, said afterwards. ``And he did a lot for the schools (as
governor).''
</P>
<P>
   The personable Allen, 48, is the father of three pre-teen
children and connected easily with the young families awaiting
turns on the Tilt-a-Whirl and Ferris wheel at the town carnival in
this suburb of the nation's capital. But populous and affluent
Northern Virginia is the only region of the state where Robb, 61,
leads in his quest for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   The race features two popular former governors _ Virginia's
dominant political figures in recent years _ and has national
implications in the struggle over control of the Senate. Losing
Robb's seat would hurt the Democrats' chances of winning back a
majority. However, Republicans need an Allen victory to offset
their likely loss of the Georgia seat that was held by the late
Sen. Paul Coverdell, and now is filled by Sen. Zell Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Washington Post poll showed Allen leading Robb by 53
percent to 45 percent among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, Virginia has become perhaps the most
Republican of Southern states. The last presidential candidate to
carry the Commonwealth was Robb's father-in-law, Lyndon Baines
Johnson, in 1964. The Post poll showed George W. Bush with a
nine-point lead over Al Gore in this year's presidential race.
Republicans hold all statewide offices and a majority in both
houses of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robb is the last Democrat left standing in Virginia,'' said
Robert Holsworth, a political science professor and director of
Center for Public Policy at Virginia Commonwealth University in
Richmond. ``In all of the '90s, there was only one race where the
Democrat got more than 50 percent of the statewide vote'' _ Don
Beyer for lieutenant governor in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Robb won re-election in 1994 with only 46 percent of the
vote. Republicans were bitterly divided over the party's nomination
of Oliver North, the Iran-contra figure who became a conservative
radio and TV commentator. Republican Sen. John Warner refused to
back North and instead campaigned for Marshall Coleman, a longtime
Republican who ran as an independent. Nancy Reagan also spoke out
against North, who ended up with 43 percent of the vote. Coleman
got 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oliver North was the ultimate polarizer,'' recalled Larry
Sabato, a University of Virginia professor and expert on Virginia
politics. ``But nearly 55 percent of the vote was anti-Robb.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Robb has stubbornly survived in a GOP state for 20
years since he was elected lieutenant governor in 1981 and governor
four years later. By law, Virginia's governors cannot serve
successive terms, but Robb easily won the 1988 Senate race. A
former Marine captain who served in Vietnam and married a
presidential daughter, Lynda Bird Johnson, he has served notice
that Allen is in for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me assure you, no warrior I ever met at Quantico was
frightened by big talk, big-heeled boots or a big chew of tobacco _
and neither am I,'' promised Robb at his campaign kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``With your help, and a little luck, maybe right after the
campaign is over, we can get George a TV talk show in the time slot
right next to Ollie North,'' Robb told supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Allen _ who is fond of cowboy boots and an occasional pinch
of snuff, and loves country music as well _ also has an engaging
personal history. He is the son of the late George Allen, who
coached the Washington Redskins, among other NFL teams, and he
played quarterback for the University of Virginia Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allen is a better campaigner,'' said Holsworth. ``He's more
engaging and connects better with people than Robb does.''
</P>
<P>
   Political handicappers say Allen has the easier road to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is going to carry Virginia, and ``given the Republican
strength in the legislature, you have to make him the favorite,''
said Merle Black, an Emory University professor and expert on
Southern politics. ``But Robb's not out of it by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Running in a Republican state against ``a popular, well-known
recent governor, Robb is already behind the eight ball,'' said
Sabato. ``But is it possible that he can win? Sure, if there's a
record turnout of African Americans and Gore wins nationally by a
margin so large as to make even Virginia close. Otherwise, I can't
see Robb winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Holsworth sees three possible outcomes: An Allen landslide. A
narrow Allen win. Or Robb eking out a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very little margin for error in the Robb campaign,''
said Holsworth.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, as nationally, education is a key issue.
</P>
<P>
   Robb is running a TV spot featuring Kathryn Scruggs, a teacher
in Arlington, sitting in what appears to be a classroom and
questioning Allen's commitment to education. ``As governor, he
vetoed class size reduction,'' she warns.
</P>
<P>
   However, Allen quickly responded with a spot showing him sitting
casually with his wife and kids. ``Isn't it absurd what some people
say just to stay in Washington?'' he says. ``Heck, our own children
attend public schools. Just like you, Susan and I want them to get
a quality education.''
</P>
<P>
   Robb wants to portray Allen as being too conservative for
Virginia, but it won't be as easy as it was with North.
</P>
<P>
   Allen has proposed a $1,000-per-child federal tax credit for
school expenses such as computers and tutoring, but not private
school tuition. Robb called it a ``back-door voucher'' that would
divert federal funds from classrooms, but the Washington Post poll
showed the proposal is popular with voters.
</P>
<P>
   More TV spots attacking Allen are likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once voters focus on the issues on the campaign, they will
clearly see Allen's effort to re-invent himself as a fuzzy, cuddly
moderate is a complete sham,'' said Craig Bieber, a spokesman for
the Virginia Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But wearing his trademark cowboy boots and casual clothes, Allen
mingled comfortably with the families at the carnival. Vienna is
the birthplace of America Online, and many residents work in the
Internet industries located nearby. Successive Republican
administrations, Allen said, have helped the state become ``the
Silicon Dominion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just tired of Senator Robb,'' said Anders Warga, a
computer programmer, holding the leash of her pug Freya, who wore a
doggy jacket saying ``Repuglicans for Allen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's associated with a lot of the stances of the Clinton-Gore
administration and that's not something we view favorably,'' he
said. ``And Allen had a solid record as governor.''

ADDED SUGARS ARE TAKING A TOLL ON HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Sugar Association is trying to convince Americans that
consuming large quantities of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and
snacks does not harm one's nutritional status, body weight or
long-term health. But the research the association cites to support
its contentions shows how statistics can often be misleading if
they present only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what you should know about the appalling increase in
sugar consumption by Americans _ especially children _ and the
effects this increase is having on health.
</P>
<P>
   Per capita consumption of sugars rose a whopping 28 percent in
just 15 years, to 53 teaspoons a day by 1997. Manufacturers are
quick to point out that not all that sugar is actually eaten (some
is wasted), but the relative increase is real. And it does not take
a rocket scientist to recognize the sources of that rise. Just walk
through any supermarket or survey the menu in a fast-food
establishment and you'll find sugar _ large quantities of added
sugar _ at every turn, from super-sized soft drinks to breakfast
cereals. Tempting sweets dominate the ends of aisles and surround
the checkout counters of nearly every American market.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to low-fat worsened the problem; when food producers
cut the fat they often added sugars to improve the flavor. If you
compare the nutrition label on a fat-free cake with its full-fat
version, you're likely to find only a small caloric difference,
with sweeteners making up for many of the lost fat calories. The
surge in artificial sweeteners seems only to have fostered the
American sweet tooth. Even with the widespread availability of diet
soft drinks, 80 percent of the carbonated sodas Americans consume
are sweetened with real, caloric sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the Sugar Association ballyhooed the results of two
studies it financed. One, by researchers at Georgetown Center for
Food and Nutrition Policy, showed that overweight children consume
only about 2 ounces more of soft drinks a day than normal weight
children. The second study, by Dr. Won Song, a food science
professor at Michigan State University, found little change in
children's consumption of milk and carbonated soft drinks in the
decade from 1987-88 to 1997-98. Song said the data did not support
claims that, at least in the decade she studied, soft drinks were
replacing milk in the diets of children.
</P>
<P>
   However, milk was not very popular in the beginning of the
decade nor at the end.
</P>
<P>
   A fuller review of Song's data shows that by the end of the
decade, milk barely led the pack, accounting for 32 percent of
beverages consumed as against 29 percent for carbonated soft drinks
and 21 percent for fruit juices and drinks. And that edge
disappears when sugary carbonated and noncarbonated drinks are
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Even more disturbing is when one looks at milk consumption by
age groups. Milk is least popular at ages when it is most needed
for healthy bones.
</P>
<P>
   With each five-year period from ages 1 through 19, milk
consumption dropped considerably and carbonated soft drinks soared.
By ages 15 through 19, a critical time in bone formation, the
amount of carbonated soft drinks was nearly double that of milk,
the best source of bone-building calcium and vitamin D in the
American diet.
</P>
<P>
   Several other studies have shown that teen-agers, especially
girls, do not consume enough calcium to maximize bone development,
which is completed in the 20s. Thus, they could enter the long
period of gradual bone loss, which begins in the early 30s, with a
flimsy skeleton that can ill afford to lose anything.
</P>
<P>
   Further compromising bone development is the fact that colas,
which contain phosphorus, are by far the leading soft drinks
consumed by children and adults. Phosphorus can impede the body's
ability to make use of dietary calcium when calcium intake is low.
A series of studies by Dr. Grace Wyshak at the Harvard School of
Public Health has found about a fivefold higher rate of bone
fractures among physically active teen-agers who consume the most
colas.
</P>
<P>
   And calcium is by no means the only nutrient compromised by
heavy consumption of added sugars. A most telling report last year
by Shanty A. Bowman of the federal Agricultural Research Service
said that since the late 1980s, as consumption of sugary foods and
drinks has risen, caloric intake has increased steadily. Bowman
analyzed the diets of nearly 15,000 Americans, dividing them into
three groups based on the amounts of added sugars they regularly
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman showed that the more calories from added sugars people
consumed, the greater the number of total calories they took in but
the poorer their intake of essential nutrients, including vitamins
A, E, C, all the B vitamins, magnesium, iron, zinc and calcium. Not
surprisingly, high consumers of added sugars also had the lowest
intake of the five food groups (grains, fruits, vegetables, protein
foods and dairy products), which are critical to normal growth and
health maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The caloric difference between the lowest and highest consumers
of added sugars _ 190 calories a day _ can add up to a weight
difference of about 20 pounds in a year's time. The Sugar
Association would have a hard time convincing me that, soft drinks
aside, calorie-rich sweets are not contributing to the inexorable
expansion of the American waistline. Children and adults in this
country are now fatter than ever. And as the weight of Americans
has risen, so has the incidence of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The highest consumers of added sugars in Bowman's study consumed
more than 10 times as many sugar-sweetened carbonated soft drinks
and fruit drinks and punches as did the lowest consumers. The
highest consumers of added sugars consumed the least milk, even
though they also consumed the least amount of fruit juices
containing natural sugars. Children, Bowman found, were more likely
than adults to have a diet high in added sugars. About one-third of
children ages 2 to 5 and one-half of children ages 6 to 11 were in
the highest sugar-consuming group.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting a total avoidance of added sugars. It is
the amount and frequency of their consumption that need curbing.
But because most added sugars enter foods in the course of
processing, not at the table or home kitchen, cutting back requires
some knowledge of where they lurk.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer
organization in Washington, last year petitioned the Food and Drug
Administration to make it possible for consumers to know how much
added sugars they are consuming in processed foods. On food labels,
all sugars _ both those naturally present in foods and those added
in processing _ are lumped together. So it would not be possible,
when eating canned peaches packed in syrup for instance, to know
how much of the sugar came from the peaches and how much was added
by the canner. Furthermore, in listing ingredients, food processors
can disguise the importance of added sugars by using several
different sweeteners in a single product, each listed separately,
making it appear that sugar was not a major ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   In its petition, the center asked the Food and Drug
Administration to establish a ``daily value'' for added sugars, an
amount that would be considered reasonable for a healthy person,
and to indicate on food labels how much added sugar a serving of
the food contains and what percentage of the daily value that
represents.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, you can make some adjustments in your own diet
by becoming more aware of the added sweets you consume. Keep a
diary for a week, recording the kinds and amounts of all the foods
and beverages you consume that contain added sugars. Then make an
effort to reduce that amount, substituting fresh fruits for some of
the sugary desserts and snacks and low-fat or skim milk, fruit
juices, seltzer or water for the sugar-sweetened beverages. If you
make the adjustments gradually, they will feel less painful and be
more likely to stick as you discover that life can be sweet without
a lot of added sugar.

   TANGIER ISLAND, Va. _ On pleasant evenings, teenaged islanders
congregate on the steps of the weathered post office and converse
in a lilting parlance that traces to their Elizabethan forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Ofttimes the talk is of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to do'' on the mainland, explains Sandy Dise, 15,
a 10th grader whose roots run generations deep in the scant island
soil. ``And you don't have to take a boat when you want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing the young people,'' laments Mayor Dewey Crockett,
who is also assistant principal of the school, music director and
organist at Swain Memorial United Methodist Church, and the
undertaker. ``With television and VCRs and the Internet, we're not
as isolated as we once were.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the remote island has changed more in recent decades
than it did during several centuries following its discovery in
1608 by Capt. John Smith, the leader of Jamestown.
</P>
<P>
   Homes that didn't have phones until 1966 now have cable TV and
computers. As its watermen suffer dwindling crab catches and
tightening environmental regulation, the Tangier economy is turning
toward tourism. But opportunity is still limited. Since 1950, the
population has fallen by more than half to about 650.
</P>
<P>
   A precious culture is endangered, many islanders fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other place like this,'' allows 94-year-old Ruth
Wallace Clark as she drives her golf cart down King Street. Her
voice confirms the claim. Centuries of isolation have left a
linguistic cadence and some pronunciations that are closer to
Shakespearean English than to a Virginia drawl. ``Tide,'' for
example, sounds more like ``toyed'' hereabouts. The beach on the
northern end of the island is located ``up'ards''.
</P>
<P>
   Tangier sits in the Chesapeake Bay, about 18 miles from the
western banks of Virginia and about 12 miles from Maryland's
eastern shore. The island is about five miles long and less than
two miles wide. Only a fourth of the 850 acres qualify as dry land.
Its 250 or so houses are squeezed onto three ridges separated by
marshes and tidal canals called ``guts'' and connected by several
hump-backed bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The streets are not much wider than sidewalks and most travel is
by bicycle, electric golf cart, motor scooter or on foot. There are
a few compact pick-up trucks for hauling stuff. As the dead and
living vie for scarce space, tiny lawns are filling up with
gravestones. The family names in the epitaphs are largely the same
as those in the current phone directory: Crockett, Pruitt, Parks,
Dise, Thomas, Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   The first documented settlers were Joseph Crockett, his sons,
and their wives and children. They came in 1778 to farm and to herd
sheep and cattle. The founding families were fruitful, though, and
there were few acres to cultivate. So islanders soon turned to the
bounty of the bay _ fish, oysters and crabs.
</P>
<P>
   While the waters have long provided sustenance, Methodism has
been the island's spiritual rock since Joshua Thomas converted
during a trip to the mainland in 1805. The husband of one of Joseph
Crockett's granddaughters, Thomas returned with enough fire and
brimstone to ignite a religious movement that still guides
practically every aspect of island life.
</P>
<P>
   No alcoholic beverages or lottery tickets are sold legally on
Tangier. In 1998, the town council rejected Hollywood offers to
film ``Message in a Bottle'' on the island. The movie starred Paul
Newman, Kevin Costner and Robin Penn Wright but the council read
the script and rejected it because it featured scenes of sex and
beer drinking.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, worship begins with a frank and open ``Class
Meeting'' in which the congregation shares personal and communal
joys and concerns. Led by lay members, the tradition was begun by a
denominational pioneer, John Wesley, but has long since been
dropped by most Methodist churches. This hour-long session is
followed by Sunday School, and by morning and evening services.
There is another sermon and more hymns on Wednesday nights.
Islanders wear T-shirts commemorating past revival meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have strong family values, but this is not utopia,''
cautions Jean Crockett, the wife of the mayor, as well as one of
the island's two nurses and an upper-grades English teacher. There
are some illegal drugs, she said, and a couple of bootleggers who
sell booze and beer.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it's a good place for kids to grow up,'' said Edward
Landon, the island policeman, basketball coach and church youth
director.

<P>
   ``Crabs are scarce. That's for sure. But it's not the watermen's
doing,'' declares Kim Parks. ``And we've been accused of raping the
bay. That's plain and simple not the truth. We're just out to make
a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his father and his father's father and his grandfather's
father and now like his son, Parks is a Tangier waterman. He is up
at 3 a.m. and out on the bay setting crab pots hours before dawn.
Evenings find him at the shedding tanks in his crab shanty, which
sits on pilings near the end of his dock. The island economy relies
heavily on soft-shelled blue crabs _ delicacies that can fetch $2
apiece, several times the price of the hard-shelled crustaceans.
</P>
<P>
   As they mature, crabs shed their shells but quickly harden new
ones. Crabs that are about to molt are called peelers _ pronounced
``pailers'' on Tangier. Watermen catch peelers and keep them in
tanks until they reach their soft-shelled stage. Then they are iced
down and shipped live. Except on the Sabbath, the tasks are
continuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a waterman has always meant long hours, hard work and
uncertain results,'' said the 44-year-old Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, a thriving Chesapeake oyster industry was destroyed
by shoreline run-off and other pollutants . Now environmental
officials in Virginia and Maryland are concerned about a declining
crab population. Strict catch limits are enforced and a huge
no-crabbing zone has been established in a part of the bay near
Tangier. There is a freeze on issuing crabbing licences.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, increases in imported crab meat from Asia keep
prices down for the watermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 95 percent of our living comes from the water,'' said
Mayor Crockett. So the island economy is being squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, wives and daughters of watermen are cultivating
tourism. From April through October, two cruise ships dock daily.
The ``Chesapeake Breeze'' makes a one and a half hour trip from
Buzzards Point, near Reedville, Va. The ``Steven Thomas'' takes 45
minutes to reach the island from Crisfield, Md. About 25,000 people
visited last year _ mostly on day trips.
</P>
<P>
   Local folk have opened several seafood restaurants, a couple of
gift shops and three bed and breakfasts. After living near
Onancock, Va., Wallace and Shirley Pruitt returned to open
Shirley's Bayview Inn on West Ridge in a house built by his
maternal grandfather in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother spent her whole life here and I was born in this
house,'' said Pruitt, 60. When his siblings moved away, he couldn't
bear selling it. ``This house brought me back. I couldn't see
somebody outside the family living here.''
</P>
<P>
   Business has been so brisk that he has built guest cottages in
the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   As tourists wander the narrow streets, they see wooden boxes
nailed to power poles and containing recipes for crab cakes, corn
pudding and other island specialities. They can drop in a quarter
and take one home.
</P>
<P>
   When the cruise boats dock, the visitors are greeted by several
women who conduct 15-minute tours in golf carts. Charging $3 per
rider, Gina Crockett said she gets 20 or so customers per day in
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of a waterman, Crockett, 35, said she loved growing up
on Tangier and visits the mainland only once or so a month. She
believes that the close-knit community, where every neighbor keeps
a caring and attentive eye on every child, is a blessed place to
rear her three offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But she doubts that her children will stay as she has.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll probably want to go to college,'' said Gina Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, enrollment has ranged from about 100 to 110 at
the Combined School, which goes from kindergarten through 12th
grade. There were nine graduates in June, recalled Jean Crockett,
50, the English teacher. Three are going to college. Three joined
the navy. Two girls stayed to marry islanders. One boy ``went on
the water'' with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who leave for college won't return. ``This is not
an easy place to make a living,'' said Jean Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Landon, the 16-year-old son of the island policeman,
figures he will join the air force after graduating from the
Combined School in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Like other teens, he likes the island but admits to occasional
boredom. For fun, they swim off the docks and at the beach; go
fishing, crabbing and cruising in small skiffs with outboard
motors; play video games, watch TV and videotaped movies; and play
basketball. And they drive around and around the island on motor
scooters or in golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about it,'' said Justin Landon.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, island families keep a car on the mainland for
activities there. For better or worse, horizons are broadening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still sheltered growing up here,'' said Edward Landon.
``So it's a shock'' for the kids ``when they leave at 18 for the
mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows from experience. After military service and living off
the island for several years, he returned to raise his family.
There's not as much for teenagers to do here, he says, ``and that's
a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of small groceries on Main Ridge and an air
strip for small planes. A doctor and dentist make regular visits.
Except when the bay freezes over, a mail boat comes every day _
taking passengers at $12 apiece for a round-trip to the Maryland
shore. So a family trip to the mainland can be an expensive outing.
</P>
<P>
   There is a rhythm to island life. The crab boats leave in
pre-dawn darkness and return in late afternoon. The cruise boats
arrive in late morning and tourists abound for a few hours and then
the boats depart and the populace returns to normal levels and
activities. The mail boat docks at 1:15 p.m. and the post office
closes while the mail is sorted. At 2:30 p.m., much of the town is
gathered and chatting when the post office reopens and mail is
picked up. Then folks ride off on their bikes and golf carts.
Teenagers gather in the evenings and the policeman makes his
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Crimes are rare. Indeed, islanders can recall only four
homicides in over two centuries. The most recent was the result of
an altercation between two watermen in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But now the population temporarily swells daily with outsiders
bringing notions as well as needed dollars. A new visitor's center
is in the works, said Mayor Crockett. ``But we don't want to get
too commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, islanders would like to keep things the way they
always have been.

   No alcoholic beverages or lottery tickets are sold legally on
Tangier. In 1998, the town council rejected Hollywood offers to
film ``Message in a Bottle'' on the island. The movie starred Paul
Newman, Kevin Costner and Robin Pe But ``it's a good place for kids
to grow up,'' said Edward Landon, the island policeman, basketball
coach and church youth director.

   ``Crabs are scarce. That's for sure. But it's not the watermen's
doing,'' declares Kim Parks. ``And we've been accused of raping the
bay. That's plain and simple not the truth. We're just out to make
a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his father and his father's father and his grandfather's
father and now like his son, Parks is a Tangier waterman. He is up
at 3 a.m. and out on the bay setting crab pots hours before dawn.
Evenings find him at the shedding tanks in his crab shanty, which
sits on pilings near the end of his dock. The island economy relies
heavily on soft-shelled blue crabs _ delicacies that can fetch $2
apiece, several times the price of the hard-shelled crustaceans.
</P>
<P>
   As they mature, crabs shed their shells but quickly harden new
ones. Crabs that are about to molt are called peelers _ pronounced
``pailers'' on Tangier. Watermen catch peelers and keep them in
tanks until they reach their soft-shelled stage. Then they are iced
down and shipped live. Except on the Sabbath, the tasks are
continuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a waterman has always meant long hours, hard work and
uncertain results,'' said the 44-year-old Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, a thriving Chesapeake oyster industry was destroyed
by shoreline run-off and other pollutants . Now environmental
officials in Virginia and Maryland are concerned about a declining
crab population. Strict catch limits are enforced and a huge
no-crabbing zone has been established in a part of the bay near
Tangier. There is a freeze on issuing crabbing licences.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, increases in imported crab meat from Asia keep
prices down for the watermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 95 percent of our living comes from the water,'' said
Mayor Crockett. So the island economy is being squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, wives and daughters of watermen are cultivating
tourism. From April through October, two cruise ships dock daily.
The ``Chesapeake Breeze'' makes a one and a half hour trip from
Buzzards Point, near Reedville, Va. The ``Steven Thomas'' takes 45
minutes to reach the island from Crisfield, Md. About 25,000 people
visited last year _ mostly on day trips.
</P>
<P>
   Local folk have opened several seafood restaurants, a couple of
gift shops and three bed and breakfasts. After living near
Onancock, Va., Wallace and Shirley Pruitt returned to open
Shirley's Bayview Inn on West Ridge in a house built by his
maternal grandfather in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother spent her whole life here and I was born in this
house,'' said Pruitt, 60. When his siblings moved away, he couldn't
bear selling it. ``This house brought me back. I couldn't see
somebody outside the family living here.''
</P>
<P>
   Business has been so brisk that he has built guest cottages in
the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   As tourists wander the narrow streets, they see wooden boxes
nailed to power poles and containing recipes for crab cakes, corn
pudding and other island specialities. They can drop in a quarter
and take one home.
</P>
<P>
   When the cruise boats dock, the visitors are greeted by several
women who conduct 15-minute tours in golf carts. Charging $3 per
rider, Gina Crockett said she gets 20 or so customers per day in
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of a waterman, Crockett, 35, said she loved growing up
on Tangier and visits the mainland only once or so a month. She
believes that the close-knit community, where every neighbor keeps
a caring and attentive eye on every child, is a blessed place to
rear her three offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But she doubts that her children will stay as she has.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll probably want to go to college,'' said Gina Crockett.

   In recent years, enrollment has ranged from about 100 to 110 at
the Combined School, which goes from kindergarten through 12th
grade. There were nine graduates in June, recalled Jean Crockett,
50, the English teacher. Three are going to college. Three joined
the navy. Two girls stayed to marry islanders. One boy ``went on
the water'' with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who leave for college won't return. ``This is not
an easy place to make a living,'' said Jean Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Landon, the 16-year-old son of the island policeman,
figures he will join the air force after graduating from the
Combined School in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Like other teens, he likes the island but admits to occasional
boredom. For fun, they swim off the docks and at the beach; go
fishing, crabbing and cruising in small skiffs with outboard
motors; play video games, watch TV and videotaped movies; and play
basketball. And they drive around and around the island on motor
scooters or in golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about it,'' said Justin Landon.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, island families keep a car on the mainland for
activities there. For better or worse, horizons are broadening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still sheltered growing up here,'' said Edward Landon.
``So it's a shock'' for the kids ``when they leave at 18 for the
mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows from experience. After military service and living off
the island for several years, he returned to raise his family.
There's not as much for teenagers to do here, he says, ``and that's
a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of small groceries on Main Ridge and an air
strip for small planes. A doctor and dentist make regular visits.
Except when the bay freezes over, a mail boat comes every day _
taking passengers at $12 apiece for a round-trip to the Maryland
shore. So a family trip to the mainland can be an expensive outing.
</P>
<P>
   There is a rhythm to island life. The crab boats leave in
pre-dawn darkness and return in late afternoon. The cruise boats
arrive in late morning and tourists abound for a few hours and then
the boats depart and the populace returns to normal levels and
activities. The mail boat docks at 1:15 p.m. and the post office
closes while the mail is sorted. At 2:30 p.m., much of the town is
gathered and chatting when the post office reopens and mail is
picked up. Then folks ride off on their bikes and golf carts.
Teenagers gather in the evenings and the policeman makes his
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Crimes are rare. Indeed, islanders can recall only four
homicides in over two centuries. The most recent was the result of
an altercation between two watermen in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But now the population temporarily swells daily with outsiders
bringing notions as well as needed dollars. A new visitor's center
is in the works, said Mayor Crockett. ``But we don't want to get
too commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, islanders would like to keep things the way they
always have been.

   It still seems like summer. Everything is in that same
slow-motion cadence that the market adopted in June. Usually, at
this time, the phone would be ringing and people would be
highlighting merchandise and research calls. Instead, it's dead.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's beginning to dawn on people that the slowdown in
our business isn't going away as fast as it came. The lack of
enthusiasm for the markets lingers like a bad baseball team
suffering through the conclusion of an awful campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? What went wrong? I think people are beginning to
figure out that this is a hard game. The free money from the IPOs
is gone. The mindless buying of Nasdaq stocks no longer makes you
any money. Many of our favorites _ Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and
Applied Materials _ have stopped making you money. For now. While
the stench of the dot-com world refuses to go away.
</P>
<P>
   I hear it when I spend time with folks I don't know well. The
conversation rarely gets steered to the market anymore. Because
people aren't making any money in the market. So what happens? How
does the ennui end?
</P>
<P>
   I have bad news on that score. It was the euphoria that was
misplaced, not the ennui. Before the dot-com revolution, the stock
market often lacked excitement or enthusiasm. It was often a place
where people understood that there was limited opportunity and lots
of danger.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of putting stock scores up at the ballpark would have
seemed silly in those times. The notion of watching the tape would
turn on only the biggest geeks and those with much too much time on
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, we would have bursts of excitement and enthusiasm
and profits would be made. But for the most part, the game was,
well, boring. It's boring right now. We can't hope it gets
interesting. We need some leadership, some strength in a couple of
groups to make the stock market intriguing again.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, it will keep feeling like summer. Which is how it
used to be all year round.

HISTORIAN GIVES THE WARTIME EMPEROR OF JAPAN NEW CLOTHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Also moving in `i' category code.) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ For anyone who has read his new biography of the
Japanese emperor Hirohito, Herbert P. Bix cuts an almost jarringly
unassuming figure.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unheard of for historians to praise the work of others
or to insist that they deserve only a modest portion of the credit
for casting light on their chosen periods. But over lunch here the
other day, Bix went a step further, insisting that he did not want
anyone to think that with ``Hirohito and the Making of Modern
Japan'' (HarperCollins) he had uncovered any deep, dark secrets
about a leader who always lived scrupulously shrouded behind a
heavy veil throughout his 62 years on the throne.
</P>
<P>
   As the author eagerly acknowledges, much of the information in
his book was uncovered and carefully researched by Japanese
colleagues, only to be almost completely ignored by the public as
the country's newspapers and major publishers shrank from taking on
such a project.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of Bix, 61, is that of a tailor able to assemble
disparate scraps of material and sew them into a seamless whole.
Relying heavily on the diaries and letters of the emperor's
advisers and contemporaries, he has produced a picture of a
militarily aggressive leader who was minutely informed, often
literally down to the minute, about Japan's war efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on Japan in the United States have rushed to declare
that the new biography definitively changes the widely accepted
view of Hirohito, who died in 1989, as a virtual hostage of a
clique of militarists during World War II and a peace-loving,
avuncular symbol of the nation afterward.
</P>
<P>
   With the search for a Japanese publisher still under way, the
more interesting question for Bix, a Harvard historian who has
devoted his life to Japanese studies and currently teaches at the
elite Hitotsubashi University here, is whether the Japanese will
begin to reappraise the emperor now that Bix's book has so
thoroughly decked him out in new clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Given Japan's willingness to avert its eyes from the most
troubling chapters of its history and to resist critical
self-evaluation and discussion of the country's atrocities in China
and Korea and the militarism that led to the Pacific war, Bix says
he considers it unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you face restrictions like I was given, I'm skeptical,''
he said, citing among other experiences the refusal of a major
newspaper publisher here to allow him to view a 67-year-old
war-propaganda film featuring Hirohito. ``The right wing is
constantly recycling myths about the lost war, and the mind-set
here hasn't changed much. Before it does, there will have to be
laws that will protect companies that publish or broadcast critical
things on this subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishing houses have been attacked in the past for producing
works critical of the emperor. Right-wing sound trucks, which blare
high-decibel denunciations to enforce a kind of nationalist
political correctness, are still common here.
</P>
<P>
   In his distinct Boston accent, which pervades his fluent
Japanese, Bix said almost plaintively that he did not want to see
his book used by people to browbeat Japan over its past. ``I don't
want the Japanese people to wallow in this,'' he said. ``I want
them to put it behind them. I don't have an ax to grind. I want
something positive to come out of it. That would start with an
excavation of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bix's description of the origins of his fascination with Japan
sounds almost like a fateful epiphany. ``I read a book about the
place when I was in high school, about the Imperial Way,'' he said.
``It got me interested in Japan, and after I finished my studies in
officer candidate school I was stationed there.''
</P>
<P>
   After a stint in the country as a Navy officer, he went to
Harvard University, where he earned his doctorate in Japanese
history, studying there at the same time as John Dower, the author
of ``Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II'' (W.W.
Norton), a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of Japan's postwar
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Bix's book had been in gestation for many years, during which he
said the two men sometimes shared materials. Strangely, though,
what would become a defining book about the emperor started out as
a much broader project, a portrait of Japan's elites as they
struggled to come to terms with modernization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even interested in Hirohito when this began,'' Bix
said. ``But little by little his story grew on me. He became the
center. I wasn't even preoccupied with the question of war guilt. I
was trying to tell the story of Japan's 20th-century trajectory,
but what I found was like looking through a kaleidoscope; you turn
things and make a teeny little change. Suddenly the key person, the
man who has been removed from the picture, is at the center where
he belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end Hirohito cannot escape responsibility for the war,
Bix said, because ``he was the only free man in all of Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Free in a double sense: He was never until the very end
lacking in options,'' he said. ``And he was free in the sense that
there was no person above him to whom his will was subject, except
his ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Hirohito had been removed from the center of
the picture, as Bix tells it, is as interesting as the details of
the emperor's transition from the unsteady hand on the throne to
the true war leader: the transition of a man always acquiescing
after the fact in decisions taken by his military chiefs, as he did
during Japan's Manchurian expansionism, to the outright hawk urging
his generals to fight on when even they knew the cause was lost in
the war with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Here, though, the unexamined lessons are shared equally between
vanquished and victor. After the war the United States was in a
hurry to fill the vacuum left by Japan's collapse and to face the
new strategic challenges posed by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, Bix says, Gen. Douglas MacArthur arrived in Japan
as the country's supreme commander under the occupation with
ready-made plans to use the emperor to establish a pro-American
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese people may have thirsted briefly for a justice that
included judgment of the emperor. Even his brothers were apparently
ready to jettison Hirohito, considering him an unworthy failure.
The Americans would have none of it, though, and MacArthur,
enjoying extraordinary leeway over Japan policy, worked closely
with Hirohito to set up suitable fall guys for the Tokyo War
Tribunal and keep the throne out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Critical was the famous letter MacArthur wrote to his superiors
in Washington claiming that his best efforts to look into the
matter had turned up no evidence of imperial culpability for the
war, and saying that it would take a million troops to keep the
peace in Japan if the emperor were removed.

<P>
   The emperor's handlers, almost dumbstruck by their good fortune,
wasted no time taking advantage of the situation, touring the
nation almost triumphantly and encouraging the repetition of their
old justifications for the Pacific war, which held that Washington
had forced Tokyo to attack.

<P>
   ``When he gets to Japan, MacArthur is in a rush, and he is on a
roll,'' Bix said. ``That is to say that he wants to get in there
quickly and do it quickly. Putting war criminals on trial is
distasteful, but it is one of his duties under the Potsdam
Declaration. So he wants to get it over quickly and make a name for
himself so that he can run in the general election in the United
States.

given a chance to reflect on the issue of war responsibility and on
the role that the monarchy had planned and the emperor had
played.''

responsibility was his original objective, he said with a sigh,
``Maybe my book will help.''

HISTORIAN GIVES THE WARTIME EMPEROR OF JAPAN NEW CLOTHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Also moving in `e' category code.) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ For anyone who has read his new biography of the
Japanese emperor Hirohito, Herbert P. Bix cuts an almost jarringly
unassuming figure.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unheard of for historians to praise the work of others
or to insist that they deserve only a modest portion of the credit
for casting light on their chosen periods. But over lunch here the
other day, Bix went a step further, insisting that he did not want
anyone to think that with ``Hirohito and the Making of Modern
Japan'' (HarperCollins) he had uncovered any deep, dark secrets
about a leader who always lived scrupulously shrouded behind a
heavy veil throughout his 62 years on the throne.
</P>
<P>
   As the author eagerly acknowledges, much of the information in
his book was uncovered and carefully researched by Japanese
colleagues, only to be almost completely ignored by the public as
the country's newspapers and major publishers shrank from taking on
such a project.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of Bix, 61, is that of a tailor able to assemble
disparate scraps of material and sew them into a seamless whole.
Relying heavily on the diaries and letters of the emperor's
advisers and contemporaries, he has produced a picture of a
militarily aggressive leader who was minutely informed, often
literally down to the minute, about Japan's war efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on Japan in the United States have rushed to declare
that the new biography definitively changes the widely accepted
view of Hirohito, who died in 1989, as a virtual hostage of a
clique of militarists during World War II and a peace-loving,
avuncular symbol of the nation afterward.
</P>
<P>
   With the search for a Japanese publisher still under way, the
more interesting question for Bix, a Harvard historian who has
devoted his life to Japanese studies and currently teaches at the
elite Hitotsubashi University here, is whether the Japanese will
begin to reappraise the emperor now that Bix's book has so
thoroughly decked him out in new clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Given Japan's willingness to avert its eyes from the most
troubling chapters of its history and to resist critical
self-evaluation and discussion of the country's atrocities in China
and Korea and the militarism that led to the Pacific war, Bix says
he considers it unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you face restrictions like I was given, I'm skeptical,''
he said, citing among other experiences the refusal of a major
newspaper publisher here to allow him to view a 67-year-old
war-propaganda film featuring Hirohito. ``The right wing is
constantly recycling myths about the lost war, and the mind-set
here hasn't changed much. Before it does, there will have to be
laws that will protect companies that publish or broadcast critical
things on this subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishing houses have been attacked in the past for producing
works critical of the emperor. Right-wing sound trucks, which blare
high-decibel denunciations to enforce a kind of nationalist
political correctness, are still common here.
</P>
<P>
   In his distinct Boston accent, which pervades his fluent
Japanese, Bix said almost plaintively that he did not want to see
his book used by people to browbeat Japan over its past. ``I don't
want the Japanese people to wallow in this,'' he said. ``I want
them to put it behind them. I don't have an ax to grind. I want
something positive to come out of it. That would start with an
excavation of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bix's description of the origins of his fascination with Japan
sounds almost like a fateful epiphany. ``I read a book about the
place when I was in high school, about the Imperial Way,'' he said.
``It got me interested in Japan, and after I finished my studies in
officer candidate school I was stationed there.''
</P>
<P>
   After a stint in the country as a Navy officer, he went to
Harvard University, where he earned his doctorate in Japanese
history, studying there at the same time as John Dower, the author
of ``Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II'' (W.W.
Norton), a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of Japan's postwar
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Bix's book had been in gestation for many years, during which he
said the two men sometimes shared materials. Strangely, though,
what would become a defining book about the emperor started out as
a much broader project, a portrait of Japan's elites as they
struggled to come to terms with modernization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even interested in Hirohito when this began,'' Bix
said. ``But little by little his story grew on me. He became the
center. I wasn't even preoccupied with the question of war guilt. I
was trying to tell the story of Japan's 20th-century trajectory,
but what I found was like looking through a kaleidoscope; you turn
things and make a teeny little change. Suddenly the key person, the
man who has been removed from the picture, is at the center where
he belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end Hirohito cannot escape responsibility for the war,
Bix said, because ``he was the only free man in all of Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Free in a double sense: He was never until the very end
lacking in options,'' he said. ``And he was free in the sense that
there was no person above him to whom his will was subject, except
his ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Hirohito had been removed from the center of
the picture, as Bix tells it, is as interesting as the details of
the emperor's transition from the unsteady hand on the throne to
the true war leader: the transition of a man always acquiescing
after the fact in decisions taken by his military chiefs, as he did
during Japan's Manchurian expansionism, to the outright hawk urging
his generals to fight on when even they knew the cause was lost in
the war with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Here, though, the unexamined lessons are shared equally between
vanquished and victor. After the war the United States was in a
hurry to fill the vacuum left by Japan's collapse and to face the
new strategic challenges posed by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, Bix says, Gen. Douglas MacArthur arrived in Japan
as the country's supreme commander under the occupation with
ready-made plans to use the emperor to establish a pro-American
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese people may have thirsted briefly for a justice that
included judgment of the emperor. Even his brothers were apparently
ready to jettison Hirohito, considering him an unworthy failure.
The Americans would have none of it, though, and MacArthur,
enjoying extraordinary leeway over Japan policy, worked closely
with Hirohito to set up suitable fall guys for the Tokyo War
Tribunal and keep the throne out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Critical was the famous letter MacArthur wrote to his superiors
in Washington claiming that his best efforts to look into the
matter had turned up no evidence of imperial culpability for the
war, and saying that it would take a million troops to keep the
peace in Japan if the emperor were removed.
</P>
<P>
   The emperor's handlers, almost dumbstruck by their good fortune,
wasted no time taking advantage of the situation, touring the
nation almost triumphantly and encouraging the repetition of their
old justifications for the Pacific war, which held that Washington
had forced Tokyo to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gets to Japan, MacArthur is in a rush, and he is on a
roll,'' Bix said. ``That is to say that he wants to get in there
quickly and do it quickly. Putting war criminals on trial is
distasteful, but it is one of his duties under the Potsdam
Declaration. So he wants to get it over quickly and make a name for
himself so that he can run in the general election in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens so fast, and Japanese people are never
given a chance to reflect on the issue of war responsibility and on
the role that the monarchy had planned and the emperor had
played.''
</P>
<P>
   However much Bix insisted that the question of war
responsibility was his original objective, he said with a sigh,
``Maybe my book will help.''

TEXAS CRAFTSMAN CREATES BICYCLES FOR RIDERS OF ALL SIZES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JOHN AUSTIN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Boyd Atherton knew he was building a better
bicycle when he went to work on Tina McMillan's $900 custom job,
but the little rig turned out to be more than just a set of wheels
for her.
</P>
<P>
   At 27, McMillan, a Fort Worth stockbroker with dwarfism and an
inseam of only 13 inches, had never ridden a bicycle that she could
operate safely or comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan, who cannot make a fist because of joint problems
related to her dwarfism, could not work conventional hand brakes,
straddle a child's bike properly, or find one that rolled on
anything but hard rubber tires. Then Atherton made her a mountain
bike with a frame she could mount, a curb-high crankshaft,
adjustable hand brakes and a seven-speed hub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every challenge that we ran into, he figured out a way to get
around it,'' McMillan said, describing her custom bike, which
Atherton powder-coated and painted purple for the Texas Christian
University alumna. ``It was great. I can't even describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Atherton has become a big wheel in the small world of custom
bike building by catering to little people, many of whom have
physical and medical conditions that make access to cycling hard to
come by.
</P>
<P>
   His niche hasn't made him rich, but the 31-year-old Arlington
craftsman is on a roll that shows no sign of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy this,'' said Atherton, a muscular 5-foot-7-inch former
Fort Worth Country Day School wrestler who began racing and
tinkering with bikes when he was a child. ``You wouldn't believe
the satisfaction I get from doing the small bikes.''
</P>
<P>
   McMillan isn't the only dwarf _ a term accepted by many members
of the Little People of America to refer to people who inherit one
or more of more than 200 bone disorders _ who is a happy Atherton
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Grade-school friend Verne Troyer, who played ``Mini-Me'' in the
second ``Austin Powers'' movie, was his first client. Atherton
crafted a bantam 13-pounder for his buddy, who stands about 32
inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``His other bike, he could only go 8 or 9 miles per hour,''
Atherton said. ``He's done 18 or 19 on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Troyer explained that many dwarfs avoid jogging because of joint
problems, and, consequently, have difficulty getting a good
cardiovascular workout.
</P>
<P>
   Troyer is having his bicycle shipped to California after a new
paint job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall quality is just enormous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was during a visit with Troyer at a Little People of America
convention in Dallas in 1991 that Atherton gained not only many new
customers but also a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Atherton, a Texas Wesleyan University marketing student, was
wondering how best to combine his skills and interests in a
satisfying post-college job when the light bulb went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little people were asking me where I could get a bike for
them,'' said Atherton, who spends his off-time racing bikes at
meets across the country. ``I told them to go to the guy who makes
bikes for little people.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that there was no such guy. But the market was
there. Little People spokeswoman Cara Egan said that while her
organization lists about 7,000 members, including some average-size
people, there may well be 10 times that many Americans with some
form of dwarfism.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with dwarfism come in all shapes and sizes,'' Egan
said. ``There are a lot of mobility issues with dwarfism.''
</P>
<P>
   A conventional bicycle crank is too long for Atherton's typical
4-foot-tall customer, and little people often have problems even
finding a frame that they can straddle. Many also need custom
features, such as the crutch hangers that Atherton built into a
bike for a Florida customer who cannot walk far without support. He
can also install a beer opener like the one on his own bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Working out of his garage beginning in 1996, Atherton has moved
the business to a south Arlington industrial warehouse, where he
runs a one-man operation.
</P>
<P>
   The walls are lined with tools, light-weight aluminum frames and
photos of smiling customers, including McMillan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely difficult to buy a bike off the rack,'' said
McMillan, who is now 30 years old. ``They're not proportioned
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs are so short that I had to lean from side to side'' on
her old bike, which was a child's model Huffy, McMillan said. ``I'd
never had a bicycle that didn't have hard rubber tires before.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, a custom bicycle is more expensive than a standard
model.
</P>
<P>
   Atherton's hand-built creations start at $735 for a steel-frame
cruiser. For a cruiser/mountain bike in steel with a seven-speed
internal hub and easy-to-use thumb shifter, the price is $885.
Aluminum frames add $300, and metallic paint can add $100.
</P>
<P>
   Atherton welds the steel frames himself. He farms out the
scandium-aluminum welding to Grand Prairie experts who build jet
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   To customize the cranks, Atherton trims a conventional model,
cuts new threads and re-mills the metal to fit the pedals. It seems
that there is always a convention to travel to, a customer to fit
or a race to make. Atherton figures he will crank out about 80
bikes this year, and he wearily acknowledges that he needs a
helper.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, who lives near Washington, D.C., has an order in for an
Atherton bicycle but knows it will be next year before she gets it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just line up because he'll take measurements and
videos,'' Egan said. ``He's been very good to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Atherton, who also makes bikes for average-size
folks, isn't backpedaling in his commitment to his clients, large
or small, or on finding challenges. He aspires to craft a
hand-powered cycle and also wants to make a tandem model for a pair
of little people. Then there's the 6-foot-7-inch, 425-pound
prospective customer who called recently.
</P>
<P>
   Large or small, Atherton tries to fit them all. Atherton
particularly likes to work on cycles for children whose dwarfism
leaves them unable to enjoy the kind of childhood that he had, full
of biking with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about helping somebody,'' Atherton said. ``Every kid
wants to get on a bike.''

   Bouncing Buckyball
</P>
<P>
   To the list of remarkable properties of those single-molecule
spheres of carbon atoms known as buckyballs can be added another:
They bounce.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley and the
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have controlled the movement
of a buckyball by making it the centerpiece of a tiny transistor.
(Buckyballs consist of 60 carbon atoms and are more formally called
buckminsterfullerenes, in honor of the inventor of the geodesic
dome, which has the same kind of structure.)
</P>
<P>
   In a typical transistor, like those found by the millions on a
computer chip, a voltage from a gate electrode controls the current
that flows between two other electrodes, known as the source and
drain, across a semiconducting material. In the Berkeley
transistor, a buckyball sits between the source and drain
electrodes, and the current flows one electron at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the energy of the electron, it will either be
reflected from the buckyball (thus, the transistor is ``off'') or
it will hop across to the other electrode (the transistor is
``on,'' allowing current to flow). And at certain energies, the
researchers report in Nature, when the electron hops across, it
starts the buckyball bouncing between the electrodes.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggest that this coupling between the
electron's energy and the movement of the buckyball may have
eventual applications in very precise control of electron flow in
molecular-scale devices. In the meantime, bouncing buckyballs may
be a curiosity, but perhaps not a surprising one. After all, a
buckyball's structure of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons is just like
that of a classic soccer ball.
</P>
<P>
   Tiniest Fullerene
</P>
<P>
   A sphere of 60 carbon atoms is not the smallest fullerene
possible. That distinction belongs to one made up of 20 atoms
arranged in 12 pentagons, with no hexagons. (Those who paid
attention in school know that this structure is called a
dodecahedron.)
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this fullerene was that no one had ever seen
it. There were even doubts that it could exist, given the strain
caused by the high degree of curvature of such a sphere.
</P>
<P>
   Those doubts have now disappeared, thanks to work by chemists in
Germany and the United States, who report in Nature that they have
produced the smallest fullerene, although only in its gas phase and
only fleetingly.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers made the molecule using dodecahedrane, which has
the right 20-carbon structure as its core but comes with hydrogen
atoms attached. By gently stripping off the hydrogen atoms in a
two-step process, they were able to produce the fullerene.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino's Child: Cholera
</P>
<P>
   El Nino has been blamed for a many things, from destruction of
million-dollar hillside homes in California to shrinking marine
iguanas on the Galapagos Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers from Cornell and the universities of Maryland,
Barcelona and London have come up with a new reason to curse El
Nino: They have linked it to cholera outbreaks in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Using mathematical models and data on cholera cases collected
over 18 years at a hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the researchers
analyzed the role of climate and previous levels of the disease on
outbreak patterns. They found that cholera reached a peak every 3.7
years over the 18-year period, the same frequency as El Nino
events, in which warming waters in the eastern Pacific disrupt
weather patterns worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Cholera is caused by a bacterium that thrives in plankton in
brackish water and in estuaries. The researchers, in a report in
Science, suggest that warming of these waters caused by El
Nino-related atmospheric changes increases bacteria levels and the
risks of human contamination. They note there is an 11-month lag
between an El Nino and a rise in cholera cases, which makes sense
given that it takes time for the ocean warming in the eastern
Pacific to bring about climate changes in South Asia.

   Safety: Quick Returns to the Game and Hospital
</P>
<P>
   A three-year survey indicates that many high school and college
football players who suffer concussions are allowed to return to
competition too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, published last Wednesday in The American Journal of
Sports Medicine, also found that players who suffered concussions
raised their risk of repeating the injury.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, wrote that they thought those two findings were related. ``We
believe recurrences are more likely because injured players are
returning to practice and to games too quickly after blows to the
head,'' said Dr. Kevin Guskiewicz, the study's leader.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers regularly surveyed a randomly chosen sample of
242 athletic trainers, representing 17,500 football players, and
conducted phone interviews with a smaller group of trainers. From
this data they concluded that about 5 percent of players suffer a
concussion every year, with those numbers higher among high school
and small college athletes. The rates of concussions were roughly
equal on natural and artificial turf, but the injuries sustained on
artificial turf were more serious.
</P>
<P>
   They also reported that 31 percent of those who suffered
concussions began playing again the same day they were injured,
averaging only 13 minutes of rest. The researchers speculated that
this could reflect outdated practices of treating only those
concussions with the most severe symptoms seriously: Only 9 percent
of those injured lost consciousness, although 86 percent reported
headaches. ``This didn't surprise us, but it does worry us,'' said
Guskiewicz. ``You should never return to play with a headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists believe that until the brain has fully recovered
from the trauma of a concussion it is more vulnerable to new,
possibly more severe injury, and Guskiewicz said the survey showed
that 15 percent of the players who suffered one concussion suffered
another one in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   AT RISK: A Village Visited Often by Alzheimer's
</P>
<P>
   An Arab village in Israel with unusually high rates of
Alzheimer's disease suggests that a recessive gene plays a role in
the condition, one that must be carried by both parents to take
effect, according to a new study in the journal Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers screened all elderly residents of the village, Wadi
Ara, a rural community in northern Israel. They found that 20
percent of villagers over 65 had Alzheimer's, twice the usual rate,
and 60 percent over 85 had the disease, compared to 40 percent
generally.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage between people related in some way is common among
Israeli Arabs; previous research had found that 44 percent of such
couples are fairly closely related.
</P>
<P>
   All the other genes that have been found to be related to
Alzheimer's are dominant, meaning that only one parent must carry
the gene for it to be activated. But in Wadi Ara, one of the genes
considered to be a prime risk factor for the condition was found in
the lowest levels on record, suggesting a new route for research,
according to the article, which was published Monday.
</P>
<P>
   BEHAVIOR: Men, Women and Battles of the Bulges
</P>
<P>
   When men and women think about their extra poundage, they see it
in different terms, a new survey suggests: To women, the fat
embodies character flaws; to men, it's not their fault, it's those
darn business lunches.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by the Calorie Control Council, an
association of manufacturers of low-fat or low-calorie foods, found
that 41 percent of women blamed the failure of a diet on their own
lack of self-discipline, compared with 28 percent of men, and were
twice as likely to link their eating to emotional needs.
</P>
<P>
   The motivation for going on diets differed as well: Almost half
of women cited their appearance as a reason to use low-calorie or
reduced-fat products, compared with about a third of men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using appearance as a long-term motivation for weight loss is
not a good idea,'' said Dr. John Foreyt, director of the Nutrition
Research Clinic at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and an
author of the survey. Putting the focus on a subjective factor that
may be beyond a woman's control can cause ``feelings of guilt and
frustration'' that may lead a woman to give up, he said. On the
other hand, he said, men need to stop denying personal
responsibility for being overweight, and to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   PREVENTION: Less Pacifier Use, Fewer Ear Infections
</P>
<P>
   Saving the pacifier for when a baby is trying to fall asleep may
cut down on ear infections, a new study from Finland has concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies had found an association between more continuous
pacifier use and ear infections in children older than 6 months.
(Pacifiers are encouraged for babies younger than 6 months when
falling asleep, to decrease risk of sudden infant death syndrome.)
</P>
<P>
   In the new study, published last Tuesday in the journal
Pediatrics, the researchers followed 484 children after counseling
some parents about the possible harmful side effects of
overreliance on pacifiers.
</P>
<P>
   What they found, first of all, was that the counseling was
effective enough to lead to a 21 percent decrease in estimated
pacifier use.
</P>
<P>
   More important, they found that the incidence of ear infections
was 29 percent lower among children between the ages of 7 and 18
months whose pacifier use had been restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Why do pacifiers appear to lead to more ear infections? The
researchers admitted that they did not know, but speculated that
``the effect may lie in an alteration in the pressure equilibrium''
within the ear.
</P>
<P>
   CONSEQUENCES: Knee Injury in Youth and Arthritis in Age
</P>
<P>
   People who injure their knees as young adults may suffer for it
twice: Once at the time, and later on through substantially higher
rates of arthritis, according to a study that tracked more than
1,000 doctors for almost 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published Sept. 5 in The Annals of Internal Medicine,
drew on data collected from the Johns Hopkins Precursor Study
between 1948 and 1995. The lead author of the article, Dr. Allan
Gelber, said that while ``most people intuitively believe you're
more prone to arthritis if you've had a joint injury,'' proof of
this ``has been fairly slow in coming''; most earlier studies
relied on surveys asking older people with adults to recall
injuries from decades past.
</P>
<P>
   Of the subjects tracked in the Precursor study, 47 had early
knee injuries. Half of them were taking drugs for arthritis by the
end of the tracking period, a rate five times higher than among
those who had not been hurt. ``This suggests that we should
probably intervene before people develop arthritis, before symptoms
appear,'' said Gelber, ``perhaps by making greater use of braces or
giving up a certain activity altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also found a link between early hip injuries and more
moderate increases in arthritis of the hip in later life.

   Mountain Storms
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why does there seem to be a thunderstorm in the Rocky
Mountains every time I try to have a summer picnic?
</P>
<P>
   A. Summertime conditions in the Rockies constitute a recipe for
thunderstorms, said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania
State University.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients are strong sunshine coming at a direct angle to
warm the land below; sharp differences in temperature between air
warmed by the mountains and cooler air over adjacent plains, and
enough water in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms owe their existence to thermals, or localized
pockets of warm air that rise, and the topography of the Rockies is
predisposed to create intense thermals, Miner said. The sun heats a
mountain chain averaging 8,000 feet in elevation much more than it
heats the low-lying plains, and the mountains in turn heat the air.
The magnitude of the updraft is directly proportional to the
intensity of the heating, and the summer sun is the hottest.
</P>
<P>
   When the resulting warm bubble of air accelerates upward because
of its pressure difference, Miner continued, it can cool to the
point that the water vapor within it condenses, and if there is
enough, precipitation occurs.
</P>
<P>
   It so happens, Miner said, that summer airstream patterns bring
in plenty of moist air from both the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of
California; at other times of year there is more dry air from the
continent. The outcome is a cloud, rain and a ruined picnic.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate) &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   You've probably heard of comfort foods. But how about tortilla
chips that put you in a good mood, coffee that helps you lose
weight or chewing gum that improves concentration?
</P>
<P>
   Products that promise to improve your health beyond standard
nutrition or just plain make you feel better are called
nutraceuticals or ``functional foods,'' and they're one of the
hottest trends in the food and beverage industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, functional foods were a $5.5 billion market, up 54
percent from 1988, according to Kalorama Information, a market
research company. By 2004, functional foods are expected to grow to
a $7.8 billion industry.
</P>
<P>
   The products contain herbal additives, along with vitamins,
minerals or other nutrients _ from tortilla chips containing St.
John's wort, which some studies have shown relieves depression, to
coffee with chromium picolinate, which is claimed to speed
metabolism, to chewing gum with phospholipids, a type of fat that
plays a role in nervous-system function.
</P>
<P>
   But can corn puffs with ginseng or hard candy with fiber
actually be good for you? This latest food fad is raising concerns
among scientists and consumer advocates who say consumers don't
really know what they're eating.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly what dosage of herbs provides health
benefits, says Dr. Lawrence Kedes, executive director of the
Institute for Genetic Medicine at the University of Southern
California in Los Angeles. Similarly, the long-term effects of many
herbs are still not known.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't good data or scientific evidence that
nutraceuticals are beneficial,'' Kedes says. ``There are some
highly public people saying there is good evidence, but there is
really not.''
</P>
<P>
   Another area of concern, critics say, is that nutraceuticals
aren't regulated as strictly as pharmaceuticals. The U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) does not have a definition for what
constitutes a nutraceutical. In 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health
and Education Act exempted dietary supplements from having to prove
their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   And many nutraceuticals avoid FDA scrutiny by claiming to be
dietary supplements. Unless a product makes a claim that it can
treat disease _ which would put it into the category of a drug _
many products can largely escape having to prove their
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has put these products in a regulatory gray area,'' says an
FDA spokeswoman. ``Many of the ingredients are not approved as food
additives. It's a confusing issue that we are looking at now.''
</P>
<P>
   HUNGRY FOR HERBS
</P>
<P>
   Low-fat, non-fat, organic and sugar-free products have been sold
for years as more healthful alternatives to ordinary food.
</P>
<P>
   But about 10 years ago, the popularity of herbal remedies
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy marketers have since been adding supplements to foods
ranging from fortified breakfast cereals, to corn chips laced with
the pulverized roots of kava, a South Pacific pepper plant that
purports to have a relaxing effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic concern is that the dietary supplements may not be
safe,'' says Ilene Ringel Heller, senior staff attorney at the
Center for Science in the Public Interest. ``We don't know if
they're going to do anything at all, so there may be some consumer
fraud here. On the other hand, if they are potent, there could be
some toxicity to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Given those concerns, the center has asked the FDA to ban more
than 75 functional foods that contain herbs because the ingredients
haven't been proven safe.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the nutraceutical industry defend their products.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ehrlich is president of Robert's Gourmet Foods, the
Roslyn, N.Y.-based maker of St. John's Wort Tortilla Chips and
other snack foods with herbal additives.
</P>
<P>
   While Ehrlich acknowledges the small amount of St. John's wort
you'll ingest from munching a few chips isn't enough to relieve
depression, he says his products can have a ``placebo effect'' _
people feel better because they think they're doing something good
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no health risk in any of these snacks,'' Ehrlich
says. ``The consumer is demanding this. As baby boomers age, they
are looking for things to enhance their lives. They want longer,
healthier lives. Twenty-five years ago, people wanted their Doritos
and McDonald's. Now they want products that help them with their
skin, hair, eyes, cardiovascular health, memory and longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   But many doctors aren't buying into the industry line. Humans
are physiologically programmed to extract everything we need from
regular food and that's why we've evolved so successfully, Kedes
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the vast majority of people, a normal, balanced diet of
fat, protein and carbohydrates will give you all the vitamins,
minerals and dietary requirements that you need,'' Kedes says. ``We
are not lacking anything.''

PHARMACOGENETICS LOOKS TO PINPOINT SAFER DRUG THERAPY

<P>
   The old saying about how we're all the same on the inside
doesn't apply when it comes to how our bodies deal with
medications.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is in our genes: While a drug may act a certain
way in your body, the biochemical processes in someone else's body
could cause it to behave quite differently.
</P>
<P>
   The field of pharmacogenetics is trying to decipher that
relationship between our genes and the effect medicine has on our
bodies. It's research that could result in individualized drug
therapy, which in turn could lead to more directed treatment with
fewer drug-related complications and deaths.
</P>
<P>
   For example, based on a simple blood test, a doctor could
determine a patient's genetic profile and predict which drug, at
what dose, would be most effective for that particular patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most clinicians ... use a standard approach for dealing with
the average patient who comes into their office. The problem is
that we're not average. We have a lot of variability and that
variability is reflected in our genetic makeup,'' says Peter
Wedlund, associate professor at the College of Pharmacy, division
of pharmaceutical sciences, at the University of Kentucky,
Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   One person will take an antihistamine and sleep for a long time,
while another person can take the same medication and it will stop
his runny nose without making him sleepy, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Wedlund was one of the speakers talking about pharmacogenetics
at the 52nd annual meeting of the American Association for Clinical
Chemistry, held recently in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential benefits (of pharmacogenetics) come in two
areas. One is prescribing the right drug for the right patient at
the right time. And the other is avoiding the wrong drug for the
wrong patient at the right time,'' says Jerry Goldsmith, the
association's vice president of marketing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a revolution in the way drugs are prescribed
and used,'' Goldsmith adds. ``It really is getting into the area of
medicine that is tailored for the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith notes that bad drug reactions are a huge part of the
country's medical bill and pharmacogenetics could drastically alter
that.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 Americans die each year because of drug errors,
according to the National Academy of Science's Institute of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacogenetics dates back about 50 years, but only recently
has new technology brought it to the forefront. Molecular
diagnostic techniques can give important clues as to how a drug is
metabolized within the body and a patient's genetic information can
be obtained much faster. This could make drugs more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those tools are working faster and faster and that's elevated
pharmacogenetics to a higher level,'' Wedlund says.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacogenetics shows great promise in particular areas,
including avoiding toxicity in the use of some anticancer drugs and
better targeting of psychiatric medications.
</P>
<P>
   But Wedlund cautions that it's still not clear how effective or
useful pharmacogenetics will be in hospitals or clinics where
patients might be receiving many kinds of medications and are
subject to a variety of other factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the wish of those who work in pharmacogenetics is to get
more effective, directed treatment for patients, the reality is one
must be able to demonstrate it can be done practically,'' Wedlund
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not cheap tools to utilize,'' he adds. ``So the
question is, can you test for these deficiencies or variations in
the population in an effective way without increasing health-care
costs, but actually trying to diminish health-care costs?''
</P>
<P>
   So while there's no question about the potential of
pharmacogenetics, Wedlund says much more investigation is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that genetic variation does influence peoples'
response and handling of drugs and can influence therapeutic
outcomes. It's not as clear at this point how we're going to use
that information to the biggest effect,'' he says.

COURT TV SERIES THAT AIRS KILLERS' CONFESSIONS DISTURBS IN
UNEXPECTED WAYS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Videotape of a criminal's confession is part of the public
domain after his or her trial, no matter how gruesome or
disturbing, and that makes possible a new Court TV series called
``Confessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as it should be called, America's Creepiest Videos.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which premiered Sunday as an ongoing series, takes
videotapes shot by police or prosecutors and presents them, edited
for intelligibility and succinctness but without narration,
analysis or commentary. Just real criminals explaining, in
sometimes brutal, frightening and even humorous terms, how they
raped, shot or stabbed their victims to death. Three confessions,
with each segment running eight to 10 minutes, each episode a
half-hour in length, all crimes based in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   First up in the premiere episode was Steven Smith, who described
how he and another man robbed, strangled and raped a female doctor
in her office at Bellevue Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I goes for the finger,'' Steven says, ``took one ring off.
Then took the watch, which I did not keep. John, all a sudden, he
wants to get sexual. So he immediately starts to take the woman's
clothes off. My motives was just to get the money and leave. John
had made love to the lady. I eventually grabbed the coat and
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously irritated, even personally offended by the line of
questioning from police officials we can hear but not see, Steven,
who fidgets uncontrollably and repeatedly bangs his fists on the
table, finally asks, ``Is that enough for you?''
</P>
<P>
   It was more than enough for me, but after Smith's confession is
over, we're given a bonus for sticking with it to the end: terse
text on the screen telling us that he was convicted and is serving
a sentence _ and that there's never been any proof of an accomplice
named John. This update, one supposes, is to make us feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Two separate interviews are needed for the next criminal, Daniel
Rakowitz. In the first interview, he says he knows nothing about
the disappearance of his female roommate, but in the second, he
admits to killing her, dismembering the body, then boiling the
parts in a stewpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I punched her one time to send her back,'' says Daniel, whose
shoulder-length hair, messy beard and stories of pot-smoking put
you in mind of a burned-out hippie. He sounds exactly like Sean
Penn's character in ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High.'' ``And I hit
her in the throat. And then she fell down and started to gurgle.
And wasn't moving after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, returning from ``a pot run,'' Daniel says he
found her in the same place, still not moving. ``I touched her and
she was cold,'' Daniel tells police. ``That's when I realized she
was dead. I dissected her body totally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How'd you do that?'' a female voice asks, off camera.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel: ``I just started choppin' her up, cookin' her meat.''
</P>
<P>
   The third is a homeless male prostitute who stabs to death his
wheelchair-bound client.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confessions'' is the creation of Richard Kroehling and Eric
Nadler, who came up with the idea after a brainstorming meeting
about possible Court TV programs with Robert M. Morgenthau, a
Manhattan district attorney. Simply making conversation, Morgenthau
had mentioned that he'd compiled dozens of videotaped confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Kroehling and Nadler knew right away what their venture would
be. Since videotapes are publicly available when the trial is
complete and the confession has been entered into court records,
they're up for grabs. Fourteen such confessions were obtained for
the program, the criteria being coherent story lines and compelling
testimony _ this is, after all, ``entertainment.'' Ten were edited
for airing.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing they have a hit on their hands, the producers have
already made arrangements for other taped confessions to be
collected from district attorney's offices in other parts of the
country. Might as well share the wealth.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more disturbing aspects of ``Confessions'' is, of
course, its exploitive nature and disrespect for the families of
all victims of crime. Another is its dishonesty. The producers use
a split screen to show images as the criminal talks, at times
setting the confession beside pictures that evoke the scene of the
crime. As the male prostitute, David Garcia, sets up for police
(and viewers) the first sexual encounter with his victim, the
screen shows two men taking a late-night stroll through the park.
Of course, this isn't the victim and perpetrator.

<P>
   Lots of youngsters are darting through the streets and sidewalks
on shiny, foot-propelled scooters, the must-have sports item for
the under 15 set.
</P>
<P>
   They are everywhere, said Reyne Rice, director of the toy
services division of the NPD Group, a marketing information company
in Port Washington, N.Y., that tracks buying trends. Last year,
scooter volume was negligible. For the first half of this year, it
is already a $20 million business. Scooter sales are off the
charts.
</P>
<P>
   But so are injuries, according to a report issued last week by
the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The federal regulatory
agency notes that emergency-room visits for injuries related to
scooters have increased 700 percent since May. Data from the
commission show 9,400 scooter-related injuries treated in emergency
rooms so far this year, and 4,000 last month alone. These are not
your grandmother's clunky scooters from the 1950s, said Ann Brown,
the chairwoman of the commission. These models are slick,
lightweight and fast. But they are not easy to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold W. Kohl, director of the physical activity and
nutrition program at the International Life Sciences Institute,
Center for Health Promotion in Atlanta, is not surprised by the
high injury rate. This is the same thing that happened when in-line
skates were new. ``When Rollerblades first caught on,'' he said,
``you saw a spike in injuries. But once people became more skilled
and also started wearing protective gear, the injury rate was
lower. I expect the same thing to happen with the scooters.''
</P>
<P>
   Children, the primary consumers of scooters, are sustaining the
most injuries, although some intrepid adults have also climbed
aboard. The new report notes that 90 percent of injuries are to
children under 15 and nearly one-third occur in children under 8.
</P>
<P>
   The commission warns that children under 8 should not use
scooters without close adult supervision. Younger children do not
have the balance, stability or motor coordination of older
teen-agers, said Dr. Craig C. McKirgan, an orthopedic surgeon at
the Center of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine in Indiana, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 5-year-old that wants one,'' McKirgan said. ``I hate
to be the mean old dad, but I'm going to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Most injuries occur when children fall off the scooters. They
have a very narrow base, and with only two wheels, they can be
unstable, said Brown of the product safety commission. Her agency
suggests riding scooters only on smooth, paved surfaces without any
traffic and avoiding streets or surfaces with water, sand, gravel
or dirt. It is also best not to ride at night, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   The most important safety precaution, however, is to wear plenty
of protective gear, which, according to the agency, would reduce
the injury rate by 60 percent. Begin with a helmet, Brown said.
``You're already going to spend around $100 for a scooter, why not
throw in another $35 for a helmet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also recommend knee and elbow pads and wrist guards.
``In my practice, I've seen several fractured wrists from
youngsters' falling off scooters,'' McKirgan said. ``When kids
fall, they fall forward on outstretched hands. That can definitely
produce fractures and dislocations.''
</P>
<P>
   But will scooter riders really suit up, stiff as cyborgs, in
head-to-toe protective wear?
</P>
<P>
   Riley Hedin, 13, of Providence, Utah, said that he and his
friends did. ``I always wear pads and a helmet,'' said Riley, who
received his scooter a few months ago as a birthday present.``Where
I live, there's a big hill,'' he said. ``If you get going too fast
and lose control, you can get in a crash. I've fallen off a couple
of times, so now I'm extra careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Cautious children like Riley should not have any problems with
scooters, McKirgan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any kind of activity, there's risk, so you always have to
take precautions,'' McKirgan he said. ``But while you don't want a
high-risk product out there, I would hate to see a child not get to
have fun. Ultimately, we have to let kids be kids.''

 UNDATED: and perpetrator. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the beginning of the series and between confessions, there
are images suggesting a victim, a knife, a corridor and detectives
interrogating a suspect in a windowless room with a light bulb
dangling from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confessions'' is a very high-tech setting for some low-tech
video. The images viewers will see comes from a stationary camera
and includes a criminal sitting at a table, answering questions, as
if in a home video. It ``looks'' unsettling, and that's the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Court TV insists that the program neatly accomplishes the show's
primary goal, which is to shed light not only on part of the
criminal justice system _ Court TV's mandate _ but also on the
criminal mind.
</P>
<P>
   As for capitalizing on the tragedies of others, Kroehling says,
``the irony is that some of the victims' advocates who have lost
children in violent situations like this have come to totally
support the program and see it as a kind of, again, understanding,
even closure.'' I'd like to meet those people.
</P>
<P>
   Court TV hopes that this is its ``Survivor,'' or more
appropriately, its ``South Park.'' Comedy Central was a small
struggling cable network looking for attention, any attention,
before the animated series earned respectable ratings but, more
importantly, became a fixture in the debate over vulgarity in
television. ``South Park'' ignited discussion and controversy, but
the important thing is that it created instant publicity, which
Comedy Central used to sell its other programming, like ``Talk
Soup'' and ``The Daily Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Since rising in prominence during the trial of O.J. Simpson in
1995, Court TV, which began in 1991 and was known for airing
trials, saw the bottom fall out as soon as the Simpson case
disappeared from daily view. Ratings dropped quickly, its
high-profile anchors and reporters who'd gain stature working the
Simpson story jumped ship, hired by the big networks.
</P>
<P>
   Though ratings have climbed somewhat since then, thanks to some
shrewd, uncharacteristic programming, like the addition of
``Homicide: Life on the Street'' reruns, the network struggled to
find a runaway hit that would thrust it back into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   This could very well be Court TV's identity piece. While some
viewers will be repulsed, others will find it fascinating. We
cannot deny that we are a people who search for the extraordinary,
anything that's outside what we see in our daily lives. We watch
violent movies _ people getting their heads blown off, people being
slashed and dismembered _ because we'd like to have an idea what it
looks like. How it's done.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Confessions'' it is, in some ways, explained. And these
aren't actors.
</P>
<P>
   What's most intriguing about ``Confessions,'' though, is how I
had to keep reminding myself that these were real criminals and
real police officials discussing real people who died real,
horrible deaths. Thinking about it now, Daniel was actually
hilarious, what with his obsession with pot, the ``dudes'' and
``aw, man,'' that peppered his speech, and this cavalier, live now,
die later attitude he seemed to have.
</P>
<P>
   But I wasn't thinking that Daniel was giving me valued insight
into a criminal's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   What stayed with me after watching the first episode was that
after all of the hours of watching actors pretending to kill other
actors, only to pop up on another show and die again, it takes
awhile to actually ``feel'' an emotion, something that's actually
real rather than imitated, pre-packaged reality.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sad, scary part, and ``Confessions'' has nothing to
do with that.

over the Internet in 1996, but it was a halfhearted effort because
many airline officials viewed it as little more than the latest

as forming partnerships with online retailers better known for
selling electronic products or sporting goods than airline tickets.

 c.2000 The New York Times

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Everyone's a cousin in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Scan a week's worth of dot-com headlines, and you'll probably
find at least a dozen partnership agreements or corporate alliances
between Internet companies or traditional companies doing business
on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the partnerships involve industry behemoths such as
Sun Microsystems and Netscape. Usually they are more modest, as in
the recent alliance between Phone.com, a provider of wireless
Internet technology, and MyWay.com, which builds custom business
portals.
</P>
<P>
   Taken as a whole, however, e-commerce partnership announcements
have come so often recently that they have become the white noise
of Internet business, the hum of the industry's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these are really good,'' says Steven Johnson, a
partner with Andersen Consulting, ``but some are just companies
breathing their own exhaust _ more hype than reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer sites have been among the most aggressive in their
partnership efforts, analysts say, because of pressure to broaden
the products they offer. Amazon.com, for instance, has joined
Drugstore.com, Ashford.com and, more recently, Wineshopper.com to
sell as wide a variety of goods as possible.
</P>
<P>
   With these partnerships, sites achieve two critical e-commerce
objectives: They increase the chances of shoppers' spending more on
each order, while preventing customers from straying to other
retailers. And portal sites join with companies that provide
bill-payment or group-buying technologies to give users more
reasons to stay _ ``stickiness,'' in industry terms.
</P>
<P>
   But stickiness is only part of the story. Industry analysts say
that, 20 years ago, companies were more inclined to build their own
divisions or buy other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '70s and '80s, people bought into diversification,''
says William Battino, who heads the e-business division of
PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``Now they don't want to be the jack of all
trades.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, Battino and others say, Web start-ups spring from a shred
of technology or involve a marketplace niche that simply cannot
serve customers without plugging in pieces of other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``With partnerships,'' Battino says, ``it makes your speed to
evolve and radically reinvent much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   In an industry in which an idea can turn into an initial public
offering in months, and in which first-mover advantage is the holy
grail, Internet executives say that stopping to develop expertise
in any given area is tantamount to suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a crowd of start-ups, no one can do everything,'' says
Cornelius Willis, vice president for marketing at QPass, which
allows shoppers to buy lower-priced goods on several Web sites and
have the purchases put onto one bill. ``So companies like mine are
trying to string together a value proposition by creating a
coalition of value.''
</P>
<P>
   QPass recently made an alliance with American Express, whereby
American Express customers would be able to redeem their awards
points or shop at Web sites that use the QPass payment system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have that Amex customer list of 27 million people,''
Willis says, ``and they don't have the partnerships with digital
publishers and others that we have. It makes sense for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives predict that similar deals will become a mainstay of
the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't slow down,'' says Warren V. Musser, the chief
executive of Safeguard Scientifics Inc., an incubator of Internet
companies. ``Collaboration makes things work. There's no one group
that can have all the perspective, so the trick is to collaborate,
to make sure you don't miss anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The new information technologies allow for better coordination
between firms,'' says Charles Conn, the chairman of Ticketmaster
Online-CitySearch Inc., which sells tickets and has more than 40
city sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Conn says, conglomerates such as ITT ``just
acquired everything, because it was difficult to coordinate
partnerships through the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we can communicate fluidly,'' he says, ``even with
companies that have a completely different structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Small Internet companies, he adds, are also much happier to
pursue partnerships because that allows them to maintain a small
workforce ``where people can feel the impact of their labor, and
frankly feel their impact on the company's stock price.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies also choose partnerships over deeper equity
relationships, he says, because of the uncertain nature of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at a firm you might want to own, but they have a
cash-burn rate that's very high,'' he says, ``you might make less
than a controlling investment to get a seat on the board and get
some insight from the company without having to consolidate their
losses.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he says, Ticketmaster Online recently formed a
partnership with Active.com, which helps users find sporting events
in which they can participate, rather than buy the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still losing a significant amount of money, so it
wouldn't make sense to own them now,'' Conn says. ``But this way we
still develop a strong relationship with them.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to track the Internet's infatuation with alliances is to
watch the fad du jour within e-commerce. When business-to-consumer
e-commerce held the public's _ and Wall Street's _ attention, the
pace of alliances matched the investor frenzy. When the focus
shifted to the business-to-business category, partnerships
involving online industry marketplaces and software providers
proliferated.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, wireless e-commerce, sometimes referred to as
``m-commerce'' _ the ``m'' stands for ``mobile'' _ is emerging as
another battlefront. For wireless providers, that means it is time
to find partners. Kathy Simpson, director of developer marketing
for Phone.com, says the company has created alliances with about
200 companies who want to put their Web content into a format that
could be viewed by people with cellular phones and other hand-held
devices.
</P>
<P>
   These companies have little time to devote to wireless
technology, she says, particularly because many are scrambling to
remain in business, so they rely on Phone.com to help.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Phone.com can help such a vast list of partners
develop wireless programs, Simpson laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have other partners to help with that,'' she says. ``None
of us can exist alone. It's like people are supplying various
pieces of the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce executives says that, in cobbling together that
puzzle, not every piece fit nicely _ especially, Conn says, when
the partnerships are thrown together primarily for the publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been fortunate with our own alliances,'' he says. ``But
it's absolutely true that many of the ones you read about are
ill-thought-through, and are done for the P.R. value. If there's
one great thing about alliances, though, it's that they can be
undone quickly.''

big online travel companies such as Travelocity, Expedia and
Priceline. These were quick off the mark and sell about the same
percentage of online travel as the airlines do.
</P>
<P>
   An example of their power became obvious when Delta Airlines
made its unsold seats available to Priceline.com last summer. Until
then, the major airlines had balked at doing so, but after Delta's
move, they followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably seeking to reduce the power of the online travel
companies, an alliance of 27 domestic and international airlines,
tentatively called T2, had planned to open a ``one-stop shopping''
site this summer, allowing customers to book what the carriers said
would be the biggest selection of low fares available on the
Internet. But in mid-May, the Justice Department said it would
investigate whether T2 would violate antitrust regulations _
causing plans for the site to be put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the American Society of Travel Agents, which asked
the Justice Department to investigate T2, amended its original
complaint to include the newly announced Web site of 11 European
carriers. That as-yet-unnamed alliance, whose Web site was expected
to be up later this year, includes British Airways, Alitalia, Aer
Lingus, KLM and Lufthansa.
</P>
<P>
   These new alliances, if they ever get going, will provide
Internet users access to a far greater range of fares and flight
information.
</P>
<P>
   Buying tickets online has certainly taken off. Last year,
according to Jupiter Communications, the e-commerce research
company, online travel spending reached $6.5 billion, or 4.5
percent of all travel spending, and is projected by Jupiter to soar
to $28.2 billion in 2005, or 14.2 percent. More to the point,
Jupiter said that airline tickets accounted for a whopping 77
percent of online travel purchases last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the online ticket buyers are passengers who could not
resist the rock-bottom fares offered on the Internet by airlines
that would rather give deep discounts than fly with empty seats;
who fly rather than drive or take the bus; and who know a good
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Anne A. Cheng, a professor of English at the University of
California at Berkeley, belongs to the last group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been buying all my tickets online for about a year,''
Cheng said, adding that first she had to allay her fears about
paying by credit card over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   She is partial to United's web site, where she and her husband
have found bargains on United flights as well as listings of low
fares on rival carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of such enthusiasts, online bookings are soaring this
year. Southwest Airlines booked more than $300 million on its Web
site (www.southwest.com) in the first three months of this year,
double its Web site sales during the same period in 1999. With
online sales accounting for more than 25 percent of total passenger
revenue in the quarter, Southwest says it is on its way to earning
more than $1 billion in e-commerce revenue by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, United sold more than $500 million of tickets over the
Internet, more than double its 1998 Internet sales. In the first
three months of this year, it sold $153 million in tickets through
the Internet, 150 percent above the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold 5 percent of our tickets over the Internet last
year,'' said Kurt Ebenhoch, a United spokesman. ``But we expect
that to rise to 20 percent by 2003.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry average is 4.3 percent, according to Jupiter
Communications, which estimates that the percentage will rise to
11.1 percent in three years.
</P>
<P>
   A big Internet surprise to airlines, and a big source of
incremental revenue (revenue beyond expectations), is the sales of
tickets booked by e-mail that offer steep discounts for weekend
travel on routes that the planes would otherwise fly with many
empty seats. Examples of such fares include Miami to San Francisco
for $289 and Newark to Rio de Janeiro, $339
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started the e-fares in March 1996, we offered
them in our hub airports,'' said John Hotard, an American Airlines
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion proved so popular that it was expanded to other
cities. It now has 2.2 million weekly subscribers (people who sign
up to receive weekly information by e-mail for weekend traveling)
and enough passengers willing to fly at the last minute to add at
least $12 million a year in incremental revenue to American's
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines make no secret of their wish to drive passengers to
their web sites, to eliminate commissions paid to travel agents, to
lower the cost of maintaining their reservations systems and, if
possible, lower or to eliminate the cost of bookings made through
global reservations systems like Sabre and Worldspan.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they succeed, airlines say they have every
intention of expanding their presence online. With customers like
Cheng, there does not seem to be much standing in their way.

`GHOSTWRITTEN': WHEN LIVES, AND WORLDS, CONVERGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)

<P>
   How to describe David Mitchell's first novel, ``Ghostwritten''?
</P>
<P>
   You could say the book resembles a musical composition for
multiple instruments whose parts converge around a single theme.
You could say it blends the nonlinear techniques of movies like
Quentin Tarantino's ``Pulp Fiction'' and Krzysztof Kieslowski's
``Red'' with the narrative strategies of Alex Garland's 1999 novel,
``The Tesseract.''
</P>
<P>
   More simply, you could say that ``Ghostwritten'' relates the
intersecting stories of a dozen people all connected to one another
by six (or fewer) degrees of separation. Those individuals _ who
tell us their stories directly in looping, stream-of-consciousness
monologues _ include a member of the Japanese cult responsible for
a deadly nerve-gas attack in a Tokyo subway, an Irish physicist on
the run from the CIA, a late-night radio talk show host in New York
City, a courtesan turned art thief in St. Petersburg, a lovesick
slacker who works in a used-record store in Tokyo and an old woman
who runs a tea and noodle stand in a remote area of China.
</P>
<P>
   Though this concept of crisscrossing parallel lives seems like
an intriguing postmodern formula for examining the randomness of
life in today's global village, Mitchell is only partly successful
in pulling it off. Some of his narrators showcase his remarkable
talents as a ventriloquist, but others sound like phony
talent-contest impersonations. His aging nymphomaniac in St.
Petersburg seems more British or American than Russian; and his
Chinese tea-stand owner comes across as a paper-doll composite: we
are actually asked to believe that this woman has witnessed all the
vicissitudes of Maoist and post-Mao history from her isolated
mountainside vista.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the addition of another voice, meant to represent that of
a disembodied spirit who can move from host to host, century to
century, continent to continent, glosses the entire story with a
pompous, New Agey tone. Instead of lending credibility to the
novel's apocalyptic ending, this voice undermines it, suggesting
that all that has transpired in the story thus far is part of an
elaborate Shirley MacLaine-esque fantasy, or perhaps a coy
authorial joke.
</P>
<P>
   When Mitchell stays away from the philosophical mumbo jumbo and
sticks more closely to the here and now, he is decidedly more
successful. His portrait of a Tokyo teen-ager named Satoru who
works part time in a record shop and falls in love with a pretty
customer is finely observed: tender without being sentimental,
funny without being snide. Equally convincing is his depiction of a
London musician named Marco, who is heavily in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell proves just as adept at limning less ordinary lives as
well. In one chapter he takes a Hong Kong trader involved in
dubious financial manipulations _ reminiscent, in some respects, of
Nicholas W. Leeson, who made headlines in 1995 for his role in the
collapse of Britain's oldest investment bank _ and makes his state
of mind entirely palpable.
</P>
<P>
   In another chapter he does the same for a world-renowned
physicist named Mo, who has returned home to visit her husband and
son on a remote island off the coast of Ireland. Though her plight
_ hiding out from her former employers and mysterious American
agents intent on persuading her to help develop some sort of Star
Wars missile defense _ is ludicrous in outline, it is made
frighteningly real, thanks to Mitchell's attention to emotional
detail and his ease in conjuring up the disparate worlds (in
Ireland, Hong Kong and Switzerland) that Mo has traversed in the
course of her career.
</P>
<P>
   These characters' lives are tied together through shared motifs
that recur, like musical refrains, throughout the book. Jazz tunes
weave in and out of many of the chapters, and an assortment of
ghosts inhabit the subplots. In one case it's a real ghost who
haunts a Hong Kong apartment; in another it's a ghostly, Jamesian
doppelganger who haunts an aging man's reminiscences. One character
works as a ghostwriter; another has a strange encounter with a
ghostly voice from outer space.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these leitmotifs, Mitchell orchestrates chance
encounters between his characters that tangentially link his
multiple story lines together. Satoru, the Japanese teen-ager,
receives a mysterious phone call _ probably a wrong number _ from
the cult member responsible for the gas attack in the Tokyo subway,
and Satoru later crosses paths in Hong Kong with the renegade
trader whose financial schemes are coming unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Russian tart's accomplices in an art theft scheme
turns out to be friends with the former British Intelligence
officer whose story is being ghostwritten by Marco, the sometime
musician and womanizer who just happens to have an affair with the
Hong Kong trader's estranged wife and who happens, as well, to save
the Irish physicist from being run over by a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   These glancing meetings are not as contrived as they sound;
rather, as rendered by Mitchell, they serve to illustrate the
strange interconnectivity of the modern world and the improvisatory
nature of fate. It is when Mitchell tries to explain these random
events with portentous allusions to ghosts and never-dying spirits
that his otherwise gripping and innovative novel stumbles into the
realm of the hokey.

`SOUND OF MUSIC,' THE EVERGREEN THAT NEVER DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``The Sound of Music'': It has always suited our
entertainment needs. In the post-war '50s, when it debuted on
Broadway, it helped us find a cheery silver lining to the carnage
that was the Nazi invasion of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, in the film version that won five Oscars, it provided
the wholesome, glossy escapism that a country in the throes of
social change seemed to crave.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thirty-five years after it was made, the film still fills a
need _ this time, in our 24/7, work-mad society _ for cathartic,
unapologetic, nostalgic/kitschy FUN. You see, over in London, it
has a whole new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight for your man, girl!'' shouts an audience member at the
Prince Charles Cinema, as _ up on the screen _ Maria the governess
meets Captain Von Trapp's sultry girlfriend for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Another shouts, as Maria strolls through an empty ballroom,
``Time to go to Ikea!''
</P>
<P>
   This is the ``Singalong Sound of Music,'' a wacky incarnation of
the world's most popular screen musical (it's the third most
popular film in history, behind ``Gone with the Wind'' and ``Star
Wars''). The mass-karaoke festival of exuberant, interactive
weirdness has become a cult phenomenon in its 13 months at the
Prince Charles. And it's now in New York, running through September
at the Zeigfeld Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   On the occasion of the film's 35th anniversary, 20th Century Fox
is re-releasing a special VHS version of the movie, as well as a
new DVD version. And RCA Records, which has sold 7 million
soundtrack albums, thus far, has put together a digitally
remastered version, including a two-CD ``collectors' edition,''
with unreleased musical material, including preludes and
interludes. It's the musical that just won't die.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some might be stunned at ``Singalong Sound of Music's''
explosive popularity _ but not San Francisco's own high-camp movie
Svengali, Marc Huestis.
</P>
<P>
   The producer of local tribute screenings of cult fare like
``Valley of the Dolls,'' ``The Bad Seed'' and
dress-as-your-favorite-character ``Poseidon Adventure'' nights,
Huestis says the world is hungering for nostalgia in these
increasingly impersonal times.
</P>
<P>
   ``People revel in that `What were we thinking?' kind of thing,''
he says. He adds that playful homages ``answer a primal need to
revisit more innocent times. And to have fun, which we don't have
nearly enough of these days.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Prince Charles Cinema, it's nothing but fun aided and
abetted by the fact that attendees can bring in liquor or buy it at
the popcorn stand, where they can also purchase ``Sound of Music''
kits including foam-rubber nuns, triangle babushkas (which the Von
Trapp daughters wore), plastic edelweiss, party poppers for the big
``So Long, Farewell'' scene.
</P>
<P>
   The audience members come as their favorite characters (there
are many nuns, of course, plus lonely goatherds and baronesses), or
as reference points in songs. One man, all in egg-yolk yellow, said
he was ``Ray, a drop of golden sun.''
</P>
<P>
   A drag queen called Candy Floss, wearing a dress of drapery
material (with the curtain rod attached) similar to that which
Maria used to make clothes for the children, is host of a fierce
costume competition at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the screening, the audience gets into the interactive
spirit, hurling remarks and taunts at the screen (baroness: hiss;
Maria: cheer), and waiting for songs to erupt so they can sing
along with the subtitles provided.
</P>
<P>
   And we're not talking about humming. This is full-out belting,
howling and gesticulating. (The acting-out of songs gets
particularly manic during ``Do-Re-Mi,'' with the audience
frantically sticking fingers in their ears to portray antlers for
``doe a deer.'') It's participatory art at its finest.

`FLY' VIDEOS MAKE FITTING HALLOWEEN FARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOB STEPHENS  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fox Home Entertainment has released three
extraordinary, double-feature DVDs that are especially fitting for
Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Two if them contain Kurt Neumann's ``The Fly'' (1958/widescreen)
and Edward Bernd's ``Return of the Fly'' (1959/widescreen/b&AMP;w) and
David Cronenberg's ``The Fly'' (1986/widescreen) and Chris Walas'
``The Fly 2'' (1989/widescreen). The third offers Irwin Allen's
``Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'' (1961/widescreen) and Richard
Fleischer's ``Fantastic Voyage'' (1966/widescreen).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fly'' is about a scientist who, while working on
experiments, accidentally merges with one of the tiny insects on a
molecular level. The mishap leaves the man with a head of a fly,
and the fly with the head of a man.
</P>
<P>
   At the film's climax, we experience one of the most disturbing
images of mortality in cinema history when the fly, trapped in a
web, screams with a human voice as a spider approaches. The utter
helplessness of a bug made anthropomorphic is horrifying. (Such
hideous blendings of life forms may reinforce our suspicions that
the universe is ultimately senseless.)
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Price, David Hedison, Herbert Marshall and the excellent
Patricia Owens, whose reactions to the monstrosity are more
believable and affecting than those of her co-stars, are featured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return'' deals with the son who foolishly repeats his father's
disastrous experiments. There are a couple of grotesque hybrids in
this picture, and it's in glorious black-and-white. Price repeats
his earlier role of the original scientist's brother and is joined
by Brett Halsey as his troubled nephew. This time, the researcher
is not destroyed by hubris and chance, but by industrial espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the mid-century ``Flies'' are recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Cronenberg saw the 1958 ``Fly'' when he was a child and, having
been extremely literal-minded at the time, complained to the
manager about the fallacious science in the picture and demanded a
refund. The future director didn't like the alteration of the size
of the switched heads in relation to their new bodies _ the fly's
gets bigger and the human one shrinks. Cronenberg was too
inexperienced to understand that Neumann's film served an
allegorical purpose, not a scientific one.
</P>
<P>
   So Cronenberg's ``Fly'' is, in some ways, a response to the
theoretical sloppiness of the first version. But it also continues
the exploration of his own strange visions, troubling stories in
which the human race is a victim of inevitable disease and/or is
displaced by the evolution of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Goldblum plays the scientist who is seduced by the
possibilities of his work and Geena Davis is the woman who tries to
prevent his self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Walas, the creator of Cronenberg's monster models, directed
``Fly 2,'' in which the mutation is latent, inherited _ borne
silently within a young man's body. Eric Stoltz and Daphne Zuniga
are featured in this sequel.
</P>
<P>
   The two ``Voyages'' are enjoyable. In Allen's picture, a
nuclear-powered submarine descends to the darkness of the ocean
floor, a place with eerie creatures and unforeseeable hazards, in
an effort to rescue the Earth from lethal radiation. In Fleischer's
mysterious journey, human beings are miniaturized and they travel
through a scientist's body to save him from a blood clot in the
brain. The art direction of ``Fantastic'' is marvelous and portrays
the human interior, from the diminished perspective, as a vast
cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Pidgeon, Joan Fontaine and Peter Lorre star in ``Sea,''
and Raquel Welch, Stephen Boyd and Donald Pleasence are featured in
``Fantastic.''

SOME JAPANESE-AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT DECLINE OF ETHNIC GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANNIE NAKAO  
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Once called an ``unassimilable race,''
Japanese-Americans are the very symbol of assimilation. They are
upwardly mobile, marrying outside their ethnic group at high rates
and dispersing throughout suburban America.
</P>
<P>
   There are more children born to couples in which only one parent
is of Japanese descent than to couples in which both are, according
to the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Hawaii, where Japanese-Americans make up nearly a
fifth of the population, most of the nation's 925,000
Japanese-Americans are now so geographically scattered and
assimilated that they are culturally indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   Those transformations since World War II have altered the
cultural fabric of Japanese America and, some say, raised questions
about its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the social glue of the Japanese-American community?
Probably rice,'' mused Bill Watanabe, executive director of the
Little Tokyo Service Center in Los Angeles. ``Beyond that, there's
not a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense that the ethnic group is at a crossroads has been made
more urgent by the steady stream of obituaries of nisei, or
second-generation Japanese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The passing of the nisei _ the children of issei, or the pioneer
generation that emigrated from Japan _ is epochal for an ethnic
largely defined by its immigrant roots and unique wartime
experience.
</P>
<P>
   After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, 120,000 Japanese _
two-thirds of them American-born _ were forcibly removed from the
West Coast and incarcerated in remote inland camps during the war
by their own government, which suspected their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   The camps had a profound influence on Japanese-American
experience, and the passing of the nisei is a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   What that means for their highly assimilated children, the
sansei or third generation, and their children, the yonsei and
gosei _ fourth and fifth generations _ remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder for my son, who's growing up as a yonsei, what does
it mean for him to be Japanese-American?'' said Michael Omi, 49, an
ethnic studies professor at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Award-winning playwright Philip Kan Gotanda suggested that
Japanese-Americans might be ``moving into an obsolescence. We have
a museum. We have a monument going up in (Washington, D.C.). So
much of Japanese America has been institutionalized. As a
consequence, we're sort of losing our steam internally. Sometimes,
I wonder if it's simply the natural course of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Sheridan Tatsuno, 51, of Aptos, whose company gets
upstart Silicon Valley off the ground, have a decidedly different
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community's alive and well and thriving,'' he said.
``What's declining are these historical and geographic icons like
Japantowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatsuno maintains that much like dreamscapeventures.com, the
``virtual'' incubator business that he runs from his home, the
notion of Japantown's being a collection of buildings is in for
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Japantown's the old incubator, what's happening is the
Internet is the new Japantown,'' Tatsuno said. ``It's a virtual
community. We're just scattered all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese-Americans are on the decline as other Asian-American
groups grow.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, there were 588,300 Japanese-Americans in the country,
making them the largest Asian-American group, ahead of 431,600
Chinese-Americans and 330,000 Filipino-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Japanese-Americans lag behind Chinese, Filipinos, Asian
Indians, Vietnamese and Koreans _ all fast-growing immigrant groups
since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese emigration to the United States peaked between 1901 and
1910. So while most of today's Asian-Americans are foreign-born,
the overwhelming majority of Japanese are native-born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese-Americans don't fit the general profile of other
Asian groups,'' Omi said. ``For many Asians, English is a second
language. That's not true for Japanese-Americans. They're older.
They're highly educated. They marry out.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost has been an erosion of a ``shared and distinctive
Japanese-American culture,'' Paul R. Spickard wrote in his 1996
book, ``Japanese-Americans, The Formations and Transformations of
an Ethnic Group.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese-American institutions do not organize people's lives
very much anymore,'' wrote Spickard, adding that ``many
Japanese-Americans are connected to Japanese community institutions
by little more than sporadic ritual behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, then, it was no surprise when the Japanese Community
and Cultural Center in Los Angeles last year published ``Nikkei
Donburi, A Japanese-American Cultural Survival Guide,'' a pictorial
compendium of cultural traditions, values and arts of
Japanese-American life.
</P>
<P>
   The book covers topics such as the Osechi Ryori, or New Year's
feast, and the importance of being chanto, which literally means to
be proper and in good order.
</P>
<P>
   In the forward, center director Gerald Yoshitomi said the guide
was aimed at helping families integrate Japanese-American culture
into daily life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think about my own yonsei children, I realize that,
notwithstanding Panasonic rice cookers and Sony Walkmans, there may
be few elements of Japanese or Japanese-American culture which they
will carry forward,'' Yoshitomi wrote.

   NUTRACEUTICALS SERVE HERBAL ADDITIVES WITH YOUR SNACK, BUT ARE
THEY SAFE? by Jennifer Thomas
</P>
<P>
   You've probably heard of comfort foods. But how about tortilla
chips that put you in a good mood, coffee that helps you lose
weight or chewing gum that improves concentration?
</P>
<P>
   Products that promise to improve your health beyond standard
nutrition or just plain make you feel better are called
nutraceuticals or ``functional foods,'' and they're one of the
hottest trends in the food and beverage industry.
</P>
<P>
   But can corn puffs with ginseng or hard candy with fiber
actually be good for you? This latest food fad is raising concerns
among scientists and consumer advocates who say consumers don't
really know what they're eating.

   STUDY SHOWS SENIOR SELF-ESTEEM GETS A BOOST FROM EXERCISE, by
Robert Preidt
</P>
<P>
   If you're an older adult, exercise will help you pump up not
only your physical health, but your self-esteem as well. And it
doesn't seem to make much difference how you go about it.
</P>
<P>
   A new American study shows that whether you choose
stretching/toning or walking , both regimens offer similar value in
increasing the self-esteem of older adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, as we age, our sense of physical self-worth
degenerates. We lose our strength, we lose our ability to do things
over longer periods of time. Certainly, there's evidence to suggest
that as our bodies change, so does our self-perception of what
we're like,'' says lead author Edward McAuley, a professor at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
</P>
<P>
   The study was published in the July issue of Annals of
Behavioral Medicine journal.

   HOSPITALS DISPOSE OF FABRIC-COVERED FURNITURE, by E'Louise
Ondash
</P>
<P>
   Naugahyde may not be your notion of tasteful interior design,
but it may be one way to prevent bacteria from spreading in
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Fabric-covered furniture helps transmit vancomycin-resistant
enterococci (VRE) _ culprits notorious for causing infections in
hospital patients, according to new research. The bacteria's
capsule-like coating apparently helps them survive a long time
within fabrics, which become breeding grounds for the critters.
</P>
<P>
   Better to have furniture covered with nonporous material like
vinyl that can be wiped down easily with disinfectant, say the
researchers.

   PHARMACOGENETICS LOOKS TO PINPOINT SAFER DRUG THERAPY, by Robert
Preidt
</P>
<P>
   The old saying about how we're all the same on the inside
doesn't apply when it comes to how our bodies deal with
medications. The difference is in our genes: While a drug may act a
certain way in your body, the biochemical processes in someone
else's body could cause it to behave quite differently.
</P>
<P>
   The field of pharmacogenetics is trying to decipher that
relationship between our genes and the effect medicine has on our
bodies.

 &HT;    AOL MERGER SCRUTINY HERALDS A NEW APPROACH TO ANTITRUST
 &HT;    Eds: Repeating for all needing.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Sept. 17.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This month, antitrust regulators in the United
States and Europe are grilling executives of Time Warner Inc. and
America Online Inc. about their proposed merger.
</P>
<P>
   But the trust-busters' aggressive stance has left merger
supporters scratching their heads. They point out that AOL, an
online service provider, and Time Warner, a media company, aren't
even in the same business.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my view, I don't think there are any regulatory issues,''
Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin said at a conference last month.
``There are no business overlaps'' between the companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given that regulators now routinely approve huge mergers among
nearly identical companies, such as Exxon and Mobil, why pick on
two corporations that operate in different industries?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this isn't a classic antitrust case _ it's really a
New Economy issue,'' said Bill Whyman, president of The Precursor
Group Inc., a Washington-based firm that does research on Internet
companies and strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups and other merger opponents say that if
governments sit back now, large companies will rush forward to
seize control of both the Internet's content _ news, sports, music,
movies and the like _ and the means to deliver it, such as cable
wires.
</P>
<P>
   Their nightmare scenario: a decade from now, one or two global
behemoths will own the wires entering people's homes and use them
to shove proprietary content down consumers' throats at high
prices.
</P>
<P>
   These fears have led regulators to focus on preventing the
``leveraging'' of technologies that could inhibit competition on
the Internet, Whyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the European Commission, the regulatory body that
sets antitrust policy for 15 countries, took up the fight against
techno-leveraging when it summoned executives from AOL and Time
Warner to Brussels for closed-door hearings.
</P>
<P>
   A confidential report, written by the commission and leaked to
several U.S. reporters, was brutal in its assessment of the merger,
saying the companies would combine their strengths to harm
competition in the business of selling movies and music via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, that business does not exist on any significant
scale.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the commission is of the opinion that there is an emerging
market'' for selling movies and music digitally, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the commissioners believe that soon, consumers
won't go to video-rental stores to obtain movies, they will
``download'' them directly into their television sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Warner's vast array of video and film properties (e.g.,
CNN and Warner Bros. Film library) are ideally suited for
distribution via high-speed Internet connections.'' As a combined
company, AOL Time Warner ``could leverage Time Warner broadband
content ... to dominate the emerging high-speed Internet access
market in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Leverage, in this context, means the merged companies could
their technological advantages _ AOL's online service and Time
Warner's content _ to lift itself into a monopolistic position on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Is it fair for regulators to engage in prophylactic
trust-busting in industries not yet launched?
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Levin suggested it wasn't, but consumer groups
applaud the idea of preventing possible monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regulators' position is appropriate,'' said David Butler,
a Consumers Union spokesman in Washington. The new approach is
necessary because ``new ground is being plowed here that may very
well result in consumers receiving fewer choices and potentially
higher prices.''
</P>
<P>
   This preventive trust-busting is very different from the
traditional ways of regulating against monopolies: measuring market
share in an existing industry and discouraging companies from
growing ``horizontally'' by absorbing similar businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the classic antitrust case, Producer A has 20 percent of
the market and Producer B has 30 percent, and the regulators don't
want them to merge to get 50 percent,'' Whyman said.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL Time Warner deal does not fit that pattern. AOL provides
online services for about 24 million subscribers. Time Warner owns
cable TV systems, film companies, record companies, magazines,
Turner Broadcasting and many other media operations.
</P>
<P>
   If AOL were stretching horizontally, it would be buying another
Internet service provider, such as EarthLink Inc. But by joining
with Time Warner, it is creating a new kind of conglomerate. Levin
calls it ``the first Internet-powered media-communications company
of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups call it scary. They want the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to
impose ``safeguards'' on it.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Media
Education, a nonprofit group, said regulators should insist that
AOL Time Warner offer its cable customers an unlimited number
choices among Internet service providers, provide a full array of
content without bias for its own material, and end all joint
ventures with AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest cable operator, to
ensure tough competition.
</P>
<P>
   Since the deal was announced Jan. 10, executives of AOL and Time
Warner have been saying they will operate an ``open'' system that
allows competition, but consumer advocates say such assurances are
worthless without an enforceable consent decree that spells out the
three safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   European regulators are expected to issue their ruling in early
October, while U.S. regulators are not expected to rule until
November.

 By ANDREW J. GOODPASTER  
 c.2000 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With complex issues of national security and foreign affairs on
the horizon, the next president and Congress must replace piecemeal
reactions with a discriminating, forward-looking perspective.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, they need to define national interests, devise
appropriate policy, and build public support for the priorities,
the policies and the actions that flow from them.
</P>
<P>
   A few security concerns, each in need of a fresh infusion of
energy, form the core around which American policy should be
reworked to meet evolving conditions. These priorities are
cooperative relationships with Russia, China and America's allies,
and a sharp reduction in nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Additional interests, likewise carrying with them governmental
responsibility to act, range from prevention of nuclear
proliferation in Iraq or Iran to suppression of genocide in the
Balkans, terrorism from Libya, or traffic in drugs from Colombia
and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond these immediate security issues are still further
interests, such as discouraging human-rights violations abroad,
preventing violent conflict in areas of limited strategic
significance and encouraging democracy for its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   Although viewed as intrinsically desirable, these latter
interests have limited effect on American security and well-being.
It is useful then to ``tier'' U.S. interests according to the
likely need for using force and positioning force in forward areas.
</P>
<P>
   For lesser-tier challenges, the United States needs the
effective collaboration that stems from strong alliances, regional
mechanisms and U.N. forces.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a collaborative network of Cold War institutions,
policies, and commitments retains its value. These all focus U.S.
interests while adapting themselves to new needs and objectives and
drawing in former adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among these are NATO, U.S. treaties with Japan and
South Korea, the United Nations and an array of international
economic institutions. The nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty are essential to reducing nuclear
arsenals to the lowest level that can be reliably verified.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy should aim to stem further proliferation and retain
only enough nuclear weapons to dissuade their use or threatened use
by others.
</P>
<P>
   Able advisers and vigorous, informed debate can help a president
define interests and implement policies. But only the chief
executive can make the decisions and then build the necessary
public and congressional support.
</P>
<P>
   Clarity is important for gaining public backing, and it is best
achieved by matching the right policy concepts to each case
requiring action. Although precise calculations of costs and
benefits are not possible, experience can help policymakers
determine likely outcomes and levels of support.
</P>
<P>
   Past failures in Cuba, Vietnam, Iran, Lebanon and Somalia _ and
the more recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, Senate
rejection of the CTBT and collapse of the Seattle World Trade
Organization meeting _ show the heavy costs of faulty planning,
poor preparation, inept execution or inadequate public support. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Sustaining public support on the issues confronting the United
States is demonstrably more difficult and uncertain now than in the
era of a strategic bipolar contest. Coherent definitions of
interests and clear development of policies may help convey a sense
of priorities. But this may well prove insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   In today's politically charged, special-interest dominated,
sensationalized milieu, the crisis of the moment often pushes aside
more important, longer-term matters.
</P>
<P>
   (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A useful first step is to recognize some of the principal
resistances and obstacles. The public at large has a natural
reluctance to set priorities and pay attention to ill-defined
matters, particularly foreign problems remote in distance or time.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is plagued by widely differing priorities among members
and within the parties, unavoidable concern for members' own
political fortunes, an unrelenting need to raise campaign funds and
constant pressures from influential contributors and special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting agenda too often fails to convey a clear and
coherent focus on matters of longer-term payoff and enduring
importance. Within the executive branch, the same kinds of
pressures emphasize day-to-day issues at the expense of more
fundamental needs.
</P>
<P>
   Modern media, serving as an interpretive (and often distorted)
screen between government and the public, further complicates the
building of trust and support.
</P>
<P>
   The ``CNN syndrome'' _ instant portrayal of horrors and
human-rights violations around the world _ skews perspective from
the distant to the immediate and transforms short-term interests
into priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Surmounting such problems starts with honoring the principle of
``telling it like it is.'' A second step is to draw the
congressional leadership into early policy consultation to see that
it is present at the takeoff as well as the landing. A useful third
technique employed by past presidents is to test through trial
balloons the chances of gaining needed public and congressional
support for a given measure.
</P>
<P>
   Nongovernmental organizations can help mobilize understanding by
encouraging analytical debate and fostering critical evaluation.
Such nongovernmental activity will, of course, be marked by a
degree of organizational self-interest, but the media can provide a
countervailing dose of skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   For the hard issues of the current international era, the United
States requires a rigorous approach to the linked tasks of
prioritizing interests, devising realistic policies and executing
well-thought-out actions.
</P>
<P>
   The next president must provide the leadership to accomplish
these tasks and galvanize public and congressional support for
them. Only then can American security and prosperity in a dangerous
world be more ably served.
</P>
<P>

Europe, was staff secretary to President Eisenhower. He was chair

Institute and the Atlantic Council of the United States.) &LR;

WHEN DID LOWER TAXES BECOME SOMETHING BAD?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BILL THOMPSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's talk about tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't a pitch for George W. Bush's presidential
candidacy _ although I will avail myself of the opportunity to
state my belief that the tax reduction plan proposed by the Texas
governor is far superior to the tax-and-spend shell game favored by
his opponent, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore scam known as ``targeted'' tax cuts _ the only
kind that Gore will consider _ is one of the most disgraceful
frauds ever perpetrated against American taxpayers. Under this
system, only a few politically favored categories of taxpayers get
a tax break _ and the few who get the break must allow the
government to tell them how to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   The targeted tax cut is a subject deserving of an entire column
in its own right, but this isn't the column.
</P>
<P>
   My concern in raising the tax issue is not the unfairness
inherent in Gore's tax plan. My concern isn't even the 2000
election _ not directly, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I am pondering the subject of taxes is my dismay
regarding the anti-tax-cut mind-set that allegedly prevails among
so many voters.
</P>
<P>
   I say ``allegedly'' because it is next to impossible for me to
wrap my feeble mind around the notion that people in this country
have no interest in tax cuts _ or worse, that they actually believe
that tax cuts are ``bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, there was a time in the good ol' U.S. of A. that no
politician worth his salt would attempt to run for elective office
without promising a significant tax cut. It didn't matter if you
were running for the lowliest local office or for president of the
United States; the basic plank in every office-seeker's platform
had to be a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians didn't always deliver the tax cuts they
promised, of course. But deliver or not, they would jump right back
on the tax-cut bandwagon when re-election time rolled around.
</P>
<P>
   But now? Now any politician who makes tax reduction the
cornerstone of his campaign is considered hopelessly out of touch
with voters, not to mention stupid, reckless and irretrievably
retrograde.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for example, has been criticized by his opponents and even
some supporters for vowing to return a sizable portion of the
federal government's projected budget surpluses to the hard-pressed
taxpayers who forked over the money in the first place. Gore
insists that Bush's tax cut is irresponsible; others say that the
proposal is counterproductive because it simply doesn't resonate
with voters.
</P>
<P>
   One of the late-night TV comic/pundit types _ Bill Maher, if
memory serves _ suggested that the main problem with most tax-cut
proposals is that they don't involve enough money to tantalize the
average taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of giving a hundred or a thousand dollars to every
taxpayer, the comedian said, the government ought to hold a lottery
and give a trillion dollars to one taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a tax cut, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Public-opinion polls in recent years have suggested that many
Americans believe that reducing the national debt is a greater
priority than reducing the federal tax burden. Good for them;
that's a commendably selfless view.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem with it. Just because politicians say
they'll use a budget surplus to pay down the debt doesn't mean that
they will actually do it.
</P>
<P>
   Government _ especially the federal government _ has an
insatiable appetite for money. And once the government reaches into
the taxpayers' wallets and grabs those hard-earned bucks, the
politicians and bureaucrats are odds-on to find a way to spend the
money.
</P>
<P>
   So. The choice isn't between tax cuts and debt reduction; the
choice is between tax cuts and more government spending.
</P>
<P>
   A tax cut means you get to spend your own money. No tax cut
means the government gets to spend your money.
</P>
<P>
   Seems like a no-brainer. Tax cut: good. No tax cut: bad.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, some way, someone managed to turn this seemingly
indisputable premise on its head.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cut: bad?
</P>
<P>
   Incredible.

 &HT;    Memories of Munich in 1972 still emblazoned on mind of American
athlete
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Harry Winkler didn't plan to become an
Olympic athlete.
</P>
<P>
   He was talented enough to win a basketball scholarship to the
University of Florida. But Winkler was a realist ``on the back side
of my athletic career'' when he landed in the Army after his draft
deferment finally ran out in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, at Fort Campbell, Ky., some of the other camp jocks
coaxed him into playing team handball, a sport he'd never seen.
It's like basketball, hockey and soccer played all at once. Goals
are scored by throwing the ball past a goalie into a net.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler caught on fast, and at the right time. The Army, hoping

 &HT;    `Good-death' values shouldn't be force-fed to terminally ill
 &HT;    By KEVIN LAMB
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - As much as we need to open our minds and mouths
on the subject of dying, there are dangers when the hospice
movement glamorizes death the same way ``Friends'' makes New York
City look like a charming and affordable place for young adults.
</P>
<P>
   First, of course, we must be careful about asking doctors and
nurses to warmly embrace death when preventing death is, after all,
their primary purpose. Many Americans do not consider it a weakness
that our health-care system lets too many people live for too many
years.
</P>
<P>
   A more subtle risk is the unrealistic expectations we create by
describing dying as a chapter of Kodak moments. No matter how hard
we try to make dying a personal-growth experience, dying is a
disagreeable chore both to do and to watch. Living is stressful
enough without adding pressure at the end to die properly.
</P>
<P>
   It can be wonderful when people can turn a terminal diagnosis
into an opportunity for fulfilling last wishes, reconciling
differences, reclaiming old friendships, reconnecting spiritually.
But what if the dying person doesn't want to make amends with every
antagonist in his life? What if, instead, he really wants to seek
out some heartless scoundrel from his past and tell him all the
things he was afraid to say before?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to say that, if I still hate my enemies at the
end of life, somehow that's a moral failing on my part,'' says
Marshall Kapp, a lawyer and ethicist at Wright State University's
School of Medicine. ``Some people want to die mad, and they should
have that right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do a lot to improve the quality of medicine at the end
of life. But death is still not going to be a welcome event for a
lot of people, and we have to face that reality.''
</P>
<P>
   People do not usually die completely fulfilled. Their loved ones
do not shrug off the pain of grief even when death is relatively
welcome. Death is a painful time of unpleasant sounds and smells
that is almost never accompanied by harp music.
</P>
<P>
   Even Paul Ramsay, one of the first ethicists to say it's
sometimes appropriate to stop fighting death, later argued that
``we don't want to get so positive in our notion of death that we
think death is a good thing,'' said Robert Reece, another Wright
State ethicist. ``He said death is an evil thing. It's to be
avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for hospice and comfort care sometimes forget what it
is that they're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death doesn't have to be bad,'' says a spokeswoman for the
National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization. ``There are such
negative connotations in this society about death, and it can be a
very good time, a very beautiful and rewarding and high-quality
time.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as it's offering alternatives instead of obligations,
though, the ``good death'' movement is valuable. Dying people and
their families should have as much comfort and company as they want
and can be given. The health-care system should do all it can to
relieve physical and emotional distress for the patient and loved
ones.
</P>
<P>
   The movement also has brought patients and families into
decision-making as death nears. It has encouraged dignity for dying
people that comes with such simple tokens of respect as drawing
curtains and looking folks in the eye. It has brought benefits into
dying lives consistent with the advice that we should more often
live each day as though it's our last. Hardly anyone, Kapp
included, disagrees that all of that is good.
</P>
<P>
   So are the social changes of slowly removing the taboo on
discussing a subject that makes many of us so uncomfortable and
afraid.
</P>
<P>
   Increased attention on comforting the dying has led to calls for
referring patients to hospice care earlier and for improving
Medicare reimbursement rates. It has helped pain specialists and
ethicists rally in opposition to the misleadingly named ``pain
relief promotion act`` before Congress that would actually make
pain medications more difficult to administer in the name of
preventing rare doctor-assisted suicides (see www.stopprpa.org for
information).
</P>
<P>
   But bringing good-death values to every deathbed is just as
objectionable as forcing feeding tubes and respirators on every
patient, Kapp wrote earlier this year in his article, ``The Right
to Die Mad,'' in The Pharos, the Alpha Omega Alpha medical
society's publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally defined successful dying may take many forms,''
Kapp wrote, and ``growth, forgiveness and personal fulfillment''
are less universal needs than, say, oxygen. Nobody should have to
feel guilt and shame for resisting `sensitive experts' injunctions
to `Have a nice death.'''

 &HT;    Memories of Munich in 1972 still emblazoned on mind of American
athlete
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Harry Winkler didn't plan to become an
Olympic athlete.
</P>
<P>
   He was talented enough to win a basketball scholarship to the
University of Florida. But Winkler was a realist ``on the back side
of my athletic career'' when he landed in the Army after his draft
deferment finally ran out in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, at Fort Campbell, Ky., some of the other camp jocks
coaxed him into playing team handball, a sport he'd never seen.
It's like basketball, hockey and soccer played all at once. Goals
are scored by throwing the ball past a goalie into a net.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler caught on fast, and at the right time. The Army, hoping
to burnish its image, volunteered to form America's team-handball
team for the sport's indoor Olympics debut at the 1972 Summer Games
in Munich, West Germany. The Fort Campbell team became the starting
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys came for tryouts from Japan, Korea, all over the world,''
says Winkler, now living in Palm Beach Gardens. ``I was lucky
enough to get picked.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 26, Winkler was on his way to the Munich Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had achieved Nirvana,'' he later wrote. ``I was going to
heaven. Everything in the world was good and in its proper place.''
From the time his place on the team was announced, ``the daily
routine from that day on could best be described as pure happiness,
incredible enthusiasm and the highest level of contentment.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the Olympic Village, Winkler was ``amazed at the
magnitude not only of the athletic and housing facilities but also
the magnitude of the hospitality of the German people. They wanted
to make amends to the world for World War II ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Germany's first Olympics since the war presented an opportunity
to erase memories of the 1936 Games in Berlin, where jackboots
outnumbered running shoes and Adolf Hitler's glare loomed over all.
It was an equally important opportunity for Olympics organizers to
make people forget 1968: Days before those Games were to open in
Mexico City, police gunned down a crowd of student demonstrators.
There is still no agreement on how many died; at least dozens,
possibly hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Televised shots of athletes carrying flags were juxtaposed with
shots of Mexican security forces carrying machine guns. But the
most dramatic image of the 1968 Games focused the world's attention
on an angry America, when black runners Tommie Smith and John
Carlos bowed their heads and raised their fists on the awards
stand.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, this time, the ill feelings were supposed to be
subsumed by good will and glory. It nearly happened.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were certainly eager for distraction. The presidential
campaigns of Nixon and McGovern were scraping at old wounds over
Vietnam, as the war dragged on despite repeated predictions of
imminent peace. Few showed interest in the Washington mess the
papers were calling ``the Watergate caper.'' Even nonsports fans
were drawn to ABC's Olympics coverage, hosted by the genial and
familiar Jim McKay.
</P>
<P>
   American competitors finished the first week of the Games tied
with the Russians in medals. There was general agreement among
bartenders and taxi drivers that Bob Seagren got jobbed out of the
pole-vault gold when he was forced to switch poles at the last
minute, but everyone cheered and chuckled as Dave Wottle ran for a
gold medal in the 800-meter race with his hat on.
</P>
<P>
   The whole world marveled at the triumphs of a 22-year-old
Indiana University swimmer named Mark Spitz, who quickly claimed
his record seventh gold medal. The good cheer evaporated before
dawn the next day, Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   With news anchors nowhere to be seen and ABC sports hooked to
the only live satellite feed, McKay solemnly delivered the news
that Arab terrorists had broken into the Olympic compound and were
holding Israeli athletes hostage. Nearly everyone in the States
soon knew more than the Olympians.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler was on his way to breakfast in the commissary at the
center of the dormitory complex when he heard the first rumor.
``For two days, I heard rumors, but no details,'' he says. ``We had
TV, but it was in German. I couldn't understand the commentary. You
guys back home got a lot more. I never saw the guy on the
balcony.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy on the balcony became the most frightening image in
Olympic history: A hooded terrorist moving silently outside the
Israeli quarters. Inside, two Israelis were already dead. Winkler
stood on his own balcony, less than 100 yards away but around the
corner. He watched police and soldiers below. He saw the crowd
press against the chain-link fence surrounding the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe any of this was happening to the most
wonderful dream in the world,'' he says. ``It's like your little
puppy comes running up to you and suddenly a branch falls on it.
How could something that out of place happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Games went on. The hostage drama continued for
nearly 12 hours before the first event cancellations. Even then,
events already in progress were allowed to continue. Negotiations
with the terrorists continued late into the night. They demanded
the release of 200 Arab prisoners in Israel, plus an airplane for
their own escape.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities finally announced an agreement, and the terrorists
and hostages were escorted to a nearby airport. A rescue plan went
terribly wrong. Nine Israeli athletes were killed at the airport,
raising the toll to 11. In addition, five of the eight terrorists
and a German police officer were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorists called themselves Black September. Israeli
authorities linked the group to the Palestinian Liberation
Organization. A former PLO guerrilla wrote a book last year
acknowledging his role in planning the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy immediately drew competitors closer, Winkler says.
It was evident at a memorial service in the Olympic Village. ``When
the Games opened, we walked in as countries,'' he says. ``At the
memorial, we walked in as athletes. I was sitting with a team from
Africa. We were all there to show our grief.''
</P>
<P>
   The delay in the Games lasted just 24 hours. Many commentators
were incensed at what they saw as callousness in allowing the Games
to proceed. Many athletes felt just as strongly that the Olympic
committee did right by going ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always critics,'' Winkler says. ``But the athletes
wanted to go on, to honor those who were killed. We needed to
continue. If we stop it, the terrorists win.''
</P>
<P>
   Winkler, 55 and a health teacher at Forest Hill High School,
didn't get to play that year. ``I didn't have enough experience,''
he says. But he made the Olympic team again in 1976 and played
regularly. Neither of his Olympic teams won a medal. ``I didn't
expect one,'' he says. ``It was an honor just to be on the team.''

 &HT;    Palliative care becoming a specialty
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Miami Valley Hospital makes its palliative care
services available throughout all its specialties. The Dayton VA
Medical Center has a separate hospice floor on site. Grandview
Hospital and Medical Center has an arrangement with Hospice of
Dayton for dying patients' final days, and also plans to create two
hospice beds.
</P>
<P>
   As the medical consensus develops that dying patients need
specific treatments for relieving pain and distress, hospitals are
looking for better ways to tend to the patients who don't leave
their care. ``Palliative care is becoming a specialty almost,''
said Dr. Basel Yanes, the Miami Valley oncologist who chairs its
palliative services committee.
</P>
<P>
   Not all patients want to go home to die. At the VA center's
hospice, the patient is never far from his or her doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many veterans do not have very good family support systems,''
Dr. Geetika Kumar said. ``If they have families in town, the wife
or caregiver is elderly, too, and it's very difficult for them to
manage symptoms at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospice of Dayton's Facility Assisted Care Program began at
Franciscan Medical Center before it closed and has expanded to
Kettering, Sycamore, Grandview and Southview hospitals. It enables
patients and families to get the Hospice's bereavement and other
services even if the patients aren't well enough to be moved from
the hospital. It served about 50 patients last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One family member told me 'I don't want my mother dying in an
ambulance in a parking lot somewhere,''' Hospice spokesman Larry
Kinneer said. ``It's for people who are imminently dying, typically
within 48 or 72 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami Valley's 2-year-old program is more ambitious, usually
with a goal of transferring patients to Hospice while they're still
mobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent the first year doing a lot of research, asking
families what we could have done better,'' said Beth Delaney, the
nurse practitioner who directs the program. One thing they found
out was they were too slow to kick the habit of repeatedly drawing
blood after the goals for a patient had shifted from curing to
comforting.
</P>
<P>
   Although health plans typically cover hospice services provided
by hospices, hospitals have a harder time being paid for them. The
Miami Valley Health Foundation pays Delaney's salary, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to look at our processes and say, 'How can we
best serve the care of the dying?''' Delaney said. ``We like to get
them over to Hospice. But there are still situations where the
patient or the family doesn't want to choose Hospice because of the
connotations that hospice means dying. We have to still be able to
provide for those patients.''

 &UR; (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate) &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   If you're an older adult, exercise will help you pump up not
only your physical health, but your self-esteem as well. And it
doesn't seem to make much difference how you go about it.
</P>
<P>
   A new American study shows that whether you choose
stretching/toning or walking, both regimens offer similar value in
increasing the self-esteem of older adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, as we age, our sense of physical self-worth
degenerates. We lose our strength, we lose our ability to do things
over longer periods of time. Certainly, there's evidence to suggest
that as our bodies change, so does our self-perception of what
we're like,'' says lead author Edward McAuley, a professor at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
</P>
<P>
   His study shows that a backslide of self-esteem can get a boost
from exercise.
</P>
<P>
   McAuley and his colleagues measured self-esteem changes in
adults between the ages of 60 and 75 who participated in a
supervised exercise program for six months. The activities, done
three times a week, included stretching and toning in a gym or
brisk walking in an indoor shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   At the start, the subjects were given a physiological assessment
and completed a questionnaire about their self-esteem and physical
self-perception. Six months after completing the exercise program,
116 of the original 174 participants returned for a physiological
assessment and 152 completed a second questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that during the exercise programs, overall
self-esteem levels increased in both the stretching/toning and
walking groups, with a greater increase in the stretching/toning
group.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups had an increased overall sense of physical
self-worth and self-esteem related to body image, physical
condition and strength. In addition, the physical condition and
strength aspects of their self-esteem increased as the exercise
frequency increased.
</P>
<P>
   McAuley says he and his fellow researchers examined how
different aspects of physical self-esteem are influenced by the two
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, we find no difference. And I think that's a
positive message to be sending _ that different types of physical
activity have similar positive effects. They increase perceptions
of worth relative to physical capabilities,'' McAuley says.
</P>
<P>
   He adds that the stretching/toning and walking are considered
light- to moderate-intensity exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That in itself sends a message that you don't have to get
older people involved in high-intensity running or other similar
types of activity to garner these positive psychological effects,''
McAuley says.
</P>
<P>
   But, his study also shows, it's essential to maintain your
exercise program or your self-esteem could wither away again.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after the exercise programs ended, the self-esteem
levels in both groups dropped as some participants stopped
exercising. While 75 percent of the stretching/toning group
continued exercising at the same levels as during the study
program, only 51 percent of the walkers maintained the same level
of activity.
</P>
<P>
   McAuley and his colleagues suggest that monthly newsletters or
reminders, telephone calls, follow-up exercise prescriptions or
``buddy groups'' may be ways of helping older adults continue
exercising and maintain higher self-esteem levels.
</P>
<P>
   The study was published in the July issue of Annals of
Behavioral Medicine journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the issue of self-esteem being associated with being
able to do things for yourself consistently over time is something
that has been recognized for a long time,'' says Jessie Gruman, the
executive director of the Center for the Advancement of Health in
Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   This study bolsters the understanding of how that works, she
adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning about the nuances of how far-reaching that
finding is,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She agrees it's often difficult for older adults to begin or
continue an exercise program but adds that exercise doesn't have to
be drudgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeking the thing that you like to do, that you can do, and
that you will do, is really the most important thing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you like to dance, you should dance,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And if you can start a buddy system, making exercise an integral
part of your daily routine in a secure setting, that could help you
maintain your commitment to keeping fit, she adds.

Alexandria to plan strategy for the resumption of
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. But after the Palestinian decision
on Sunday to defer a declaration of Palestinian statehood for at
least two months to allow time for a renewed effort to negotiate a
final peace accord with Israel, opinion in the Arab world appeared
to have hardened against the sort of concessions, principally on
Jerusalem, that Israeli and American negotiators have said will be

WILDFIRES ON NUCLEAR SITES RAISE SPECTERS OF RADIATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fires in and around nuclear facilities understandably make
people nervous.
</P>
<P>
   So this has been an unnerving summer in parts of the American
West, where some of the wildfires that ravaged millions of acres
also scorched several major nuclear complexes in New Mexico,
Washington, Colorado and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   When an out-of-control fire swept across the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico, many people fled their homes, and it was
not just the smoke and flames that sent them packing.
</P>
<P>
   Some worried that radioactivity would spread downwind. And some
firefighters even refused to work around the lab, also fearing
contamination, state and federal officials said. Similar concerns
prompted 188 firefighters who battled blazes at the Hanford Nuclear
Reservation in Washington to request tests to see if they had been
exposed to radiation. So far, 35 tests have proven negative.
</P>
<P>
   During all these fires, government scientists monitored
radiation and officials promptly issued statements declaring that
while there were elevated levels of radioactivity _ including
minute amounts of plutonium at Hanford _ most of it was a natural
result of burning vegetation, and there was no cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air and water sampling are the best methods for detecting any
problems, and we have not found levels that would present a health
risk,'' said Ellen Livingston, a senior policy adviser on
environmental management for the federal Energy Department,
speaking after the fires were under control.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists outside the Energy Department who reviewed the air
monitoring data from the fires at Los Alamos and Hanford agreed
that there did not seem to be any cause for alarm regarding
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   But the risks of radiation releases during and after wildfires
at contaminated nuclear sites are still not thoroughly understood
by scientists, let alone the public. And distrust of government
reassurances and a lack of perspective about radiation cause many
people to fear the worst when contaminated sites catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   Such fears are not limited to the United States. When a fire
broke out near Chernobyl in May, the Israeli embassy in Minsk, 200
miles away, was evacuated because of fear that the fire was burning
in an area contaminated during the nuclear reactor meltdown there
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are valid concerns,'' said Ward Whicker, a professor of
radiological health sciences at Colorado State University and a
pioneer in the field or radioecology, the study of how radiation
moves through the environment. ``There is not a lot of research
available to help us quantitatively predict how much material might
be released in a given fire.''
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Los Alamos have been developing a program that
uses supercomputers to predict the complex behavior of wildfires in
different kinds of terrain, vegetation and wind conditions, a
notoriously difficult task.
</P>
<P>
   The program was far enough along that, had it been used, the
program might have alerted the National Park Service that
conditions were not safe for the ``controlled burn'' the service
started in May in nearby Bandelier National Monument, said Rodman
Linn, one of the scientists working on the program.
</P>
<P>
   Such fires are intended to prevent uncontrolled wildfires, but
this one spread out of control, devouring more than 47,000 acres
and destroying more than 200 homes and some structures on the
grounds of the laboratory, where decades of nuclear weapons
research was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The computer modeling program could also have been used to
predict radioactive emissions caused by fires on the laboratory
grounds. But it was not used, and Linn was evacuated along with
other lab workers during the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The project has languished, Linn said, because scientific
research on wildfires has not been a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the western half of the United States is burning
up,'' he said, ``it's hard to get money for any kind of wildfire
research.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   When fire threatens a nuclear facility, the worst case scenario
is if radioactive materials actually catch fire. That did not
happen in any of the recent fires.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, which oversees the nuclear complexes, has
emergency management plans that include analyses of the risks a
fire would pose at each one, Livingston said. Firebreaks are
routinely cleared and area firefighters are trained on the sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos lab completed an environmental impact statement
last year that included a wildfire risk assessment. As a result,
the lab expanded a firebreak around its most vulnerable radioactive
waste site, which protected it from the recent fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were prepared,'' Livingston said. ``And our ability to
extinguish the fires at those sites under difficult weather
conditions demonstrates that we took the right steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the troubled histories of some of the nation's nuclear
facilities, however, it is not simply a matter of safeguarding the
radioactive materials stored on site. The Energy Department has
also evaluated the risk that fire could release radioactive
elements that have contaminated the soil, grass, bushes and trees
at its nuclear sites.
</P>
<P>
   At Hanford, the Energy Department routinely collects what
workers call ``hot tumbleweeds,'' which grow in contaminated soil.
To prevent the tumbleweeds from rolling off site or burning in a
fire and releasing radioactivity, the department buries them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even at contaminated sites, naturally occurring radon and
other decay products of uranium contribute much more radiation to
the atmosphere in wildfires than do manufactured radioactive
elements absorbed by plants from contaminated soil.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Energy Department, none of the fires this year
exposed anyone to more than 1 millirems to 2 millirems of
radiation, and firefighters were the only people likely to be
exposed to that much radiation.
</P>
<P>
   To put that into perspective, the average American is exposed to
about 360 millirems of radiation per year, mostly from natural
sources.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While smoke from a wildfire at a nuclear site seems to cause the
most immediate concern to nearby residents, the most significant
problems may come after the fire is out.
</P>
<P>
   The risks associated with the spread of contaminated soil after
a fire are much greater than the risks associated with radiation
from burning contaminated vegetation, according to government
studies. Radioactive contaminants in the soil can be picked up by
wind or washed into streams and rivers by rain after the fire has
scorched the earth, leaving bare ground vulnerable to erosion.
</P>
<P>
   In studies conducted at Rocky Flats and the Waste Isolation
Pilot Project in Carlsbad, N.M., Whicker found that runoff from
burned plots carried more radioactivity than runoff from unburned
ones. In Los Alamos, crews have built dams to try to keep runoff
from spreading contamination down denuded gullies to the Rio
Grande.
</P>
<P>
   The risk that contamination will spread after a fire affects how
much cleanup nuclear sites need to be made safe, said John Till, a
radioecologist with the Risk Assessment Corp. in Neeses, S.C., a
radiation research and training company.
</P>
<P>
   Till completed a study last year to determine how much uranium
and plutonium can be safely left in the ground at Rocky Flats,
where it leaked from barrels of waste left over from making bombs.
He found that a fire would greatly increase the amount of plutonium
blowing downwind afterward with the dust. The exposure did not
appear to extend beyond the boundaries of the site, or present a
health risk to people living around it. But it did mean a much more
expensive cleanup would have to be done at Rocky Flats if people
began moving onto the grassy plain, about 10 miles west of Denver.
The plutonium will remain radioactive for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Till said it was important to have independent studies and
monitoring, because of public skepticism about the Energy
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Energy makes its statements about there
being no risk, but there's always a question in people's minds,''
he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That is not surprising to Brian Kelly, a health physicist
working for Integrated Environmental Management, a consulting firm
in Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is sort of a knee-jerk response when radiation is
mentioned,'' he said. ``People almost get a visceral fear about
what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's company has a Web site (www.iem-inc.com) on which people
can ask a certified health physicist questions about radiation.
During the fires, Kelly corresponded with numerous concerned
people, including Marie Coburn, who grows organic echinacea, a
medicinal herb, on a 3-acre farm 30 miles northeast and downwind of
the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn was concerned when the fire began sweeping through Los
Alamos, scorching canyons contaminated with radioactive waste, and
the smoke drifted in her direction: The sky turned orange and
fuschia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a hard time breathing,'' Coburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reassurance by the Energy Department and the New Mexico
Department of Health, she fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I packed my truck thinking that I might never come back, that
I might find out this area was like Chernobyl,'' she said. Nine
neighbors evacuated with her.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said turned to the Internet for information because she
distrusted the Energy Department and did not understand the
radiation reports in the media.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly convinced Coburn that not only could she return home
safely, she could also harvest her echinacea without worrying that
she might be putting others at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn washed the dust and ashes off her crop. She borrowed a
radiation detector and walked around her property, detecting
nothing out of the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said she still does not trust the Los Alamos National
Laboratory. But she has come to understand radiation better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radioactivity in itself is not something that is
frightening,'' she said. ``We're in it all the time, and that's
fine, as long as it doesn't soar to really high levels.''

WHEN IT'S HOT, HOT, HOT, PUT ON SOME COOL-WEATHER MUSIC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   As I write this, we have not had any rain for more than 60 days
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   This has gotten biblical here, and, perhaps like you, I had
enough of it about, oh, 58 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's hot at 8 a.m. You walk outside into a steamroom. Go out and
just stand there, and you start to sweat. You don't feel like
moving, much less working. Malaise lies heavy on the land. What to
do?
</P>
<P>
   There's no real relief until the rain shows up and the
temperature falls, but maybe we can think ourselves a little cooler
by listening to the music of fall.
</P>
<P>
   The what? Hear me out. Summer has always been associated with
pop songs, romance, long days at the beach, vacations, a certain
sparkle of ease and sensuous possibilities in the air. And there's
certainly no lack of songs concerned with the joys of summer:
beaches, kicking back, getting a tan and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Fall gets the short shrift. As a season, it's a reality check;
collars are turned up, school is back in session, temperatures
drop, sweaters are pulled out of the bottom drawers.
</P>
<P>
   And there are just some songs, CDs and bands _ lots of 'em _
that have a more wistful, smoky, contemplative (and sometimes
melancholy) air that feels more like October than June.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, ``Puff the Magic Dragon.'' The boy and the
dragon have played, but by the end the boy has grown up and moved
on. That's a fall song.
</P>
<P>
   Or Neil Young's ``Cinnamon Girl.'' The narrator hasn't found his
cinnamon girl; he's dreaming, and he's already looking down the
road at growing old and needing someone to be there with him. Fall
all the way _ as is all of Young's ruminative, mainly acoustic and
wildly popular ``Harvest'' CD.
</P>
<P>
   Same with ``The Band,'' with its intimations of farms going
under, people looking back in regret, a search for security. On
``King Harvest,'' the season comes in the form of a shadowy figure,
a ghost-man, who brings with him cold winds out across the rice
fields. Maybe this is why it's my favorite Band record.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years later, John Mellencamp released ``Scarecrow,'' a
brilliant fall record with some of the same themes as The Band. One
can almost feel the rain turning colder, the days growing shorter,
a world of hope and promise being shut off. The title track, one of
Mellencamp's most affecting moments, is all past-tense (''this land
fed a nation/this land made me so proud''), the glory of a
fruitful, profitable harvest _ and an entire way of life _ gone
forever. The narrator of ``Scarecrow'' and the narrator of ``King
Harvest'' would have had a lot to say to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, R.E.M. and U2 are fall bands; they don't offer easy
answers, and there are conflicted feelings and regret and
melancholy lurking everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, my favorite is U2's ``The Unforgettable Fire,'' the
1984 album known best for ``Pride.'' From the cover artwork to the
tone of almost every song, this is one of the greatest collections
of autumnal music; taut but troubled, full of lengthening shadows
and loneliness, and capped by ``Indian Summer Sky,'' maybe the best
song ever about not giving up.
</P>
<P>
   There are more, of course: The Cure's ``Disintegration,'' Van
Morrison's ``Moondance'' and ``Astral Weeks'' (Van's a fall kinda
guy anyway, always has been), Bob Dylan's ``Blood on the Tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   But you get the idea. There are just some songs that evoke
leaves crunching underfoot, a sharp, tingly bite in the air and
layers of clothing instead of sand between your toes, wiping the
sweat away, and worrying about how you'll look in your bathing
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Me, I'm gonna go back to my apartment _ which I keep cold enough
to hang meat in _ and listen to some of 'em.

MARTHA'S VINEYARD APPEALS NOT ONLY TO VACATIONERS, BUT RARE INSECTS
TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: New England, Ill.)  By CORNELIA DEAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Ask people on Martha's Vineyard about insects
and they are likely to talk about mosquitoes, no-see-ums and
green-headed flies, all of which can make life miserable here. But
the island's insect population comprises far more than pests.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, entomologists hope to use it to re-establish rare and
endangered insect populations wiped out elsewhere in New England
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This year, beach tiger beetles, tiny ivory insects with brown
markings, were gathered on a stretch of private beach here and
transported to Monomoy Island National Wildlife Refuge at the elbow
of Cape Cod, where entomologists hope they have taken hold.
</P>
<P>
   Next on the entomologists' list is the imperial moth, a yellow
and brown insect once abundant throughout New England that was all
but wiped out by the insecticide DDT. Entomologists are studying
the moth now, hoping to determine the best places to reintroduce
it. After that, the scientists hope the Vineyard will provide still
more moth species to repopulate New England habitats.
</P>
<P>
   In all cases, said Tim Simmons, restoration ecologist for the
Massachusetts Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program, the
idea is to identify past insect habitats that remain protected
enough to enable transplants to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The beetle, only half an inch long, but prized by collectors for
its delicate spots and stripes and bright green abdomen, was
eradicated from almost all of its New England range when
four-wheel-drive vehicles began taking to the region's beaches. The
beetle lays its eggs on the beach, and its larvae live in tubes the
beetles dig in the sand _ no match for all-terrain vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, entomologists planned to reintroduce the beetle to
Monomoy last year, by digging larvae and transplanting them to
beaches there. But when they went collecting, they discovered that
the beetle's volatile population had declined, for reasons still
uncertain. This year, the numbers were better, so the project
proceeded.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Goldstein, a biologist at the Field Museum in Chicago who
is studying the state of Vineyard lepidoptera this summer along
with ecologists at the Sheriff's Meadow Foundation, a major
Vineyard conservation organization, said the work on the beetle was
conducted by Phil Nothnagle, an entomologist who is an authority on
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He excavated about two dozen larvae, which is small for an
insect population, but that's all we were comfortable taking,''
Goldstein said. He added: ``Past experience shows introducing
adults doesn't work. Either they don't find each other or they
don't lay eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is too soon to say the effort is a success, Simmons
said in a telephone interview that five adult beetles had already
been spotted on Monomoy.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread spraying of DDT ravaged populations of the imperial
moth, Simmons said. The moth, whose tan-spotted yellow wings
stretch more than 3 inches, once ranged from Canada to Argentina,
but now the only place in New England where it survives is Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   That the moth survives there is partly a legacy of the late
Henry Beetle Hough, the longtime editor of The Vineyard Gazette and
an ardent opponent of the use of insecticides, which he habitually
referred to in editorials as ``poison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The continued widespread use of poisons, particularly through
aerial spraying, will lead to results that cannot be foreseen _
except that life, the indivisible wellspring of all life on earth,
will never be the same again,'' Hough editorialized in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   At his urging, residents of the island banded together to block
widespread spraying, particularly of DDT. A few thousand Vineyard
acres were sprayed, but only once, while elsewhere in New England
hundreds of thousands of acres were routinely subjected to a fog of
DDT and kerosene. As a result, species survive here that have
vanished elsewhere in the Northeast, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Among them are the imperial moth and other moths that live in
highly specialized habitats, like depressions called frost bottoms,
that are also rare everywhere but the Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Frost bottoms are a geological reminder of how Martha's Vineyard
was formed more than 12,000 years ago as glaciers moved across New
England, pushing rocks and soil before them. When they began to
retreat, they left this material piled up in moraines, which
gradually eroded and washed out to form sand plains. Much of
Martha's Vineyard is formed of such sand plains. Glacial meltwater
carved out the frost bottoms as it streamed south from moraines
toward the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Though frost bottoms may be only 20 feet or 30 feet lower than
the surrounding landscape, Goldstein said, they can be much warmer
during the day and colder at night; some can experience frost
year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Because few glacial outwash plains survive elsewhere, Martha's
Vineyard's frost bottoms are extremely unusual.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   The Vineyard is not the only source of endangered insects for
repopulation efforts. For example, entomologists are using a small
population of burying beetles on Block Island, R.I., in efforts to
re-establish the species, whose range was once from Maine to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein concedes that the insects he and others are eager to
re-establish probably have little economic importance. But as
conservation becomes more sophisticated, he said, more attention is
being paid to restoring as many of a conservation area's original
inhabitants as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons put it almost the same way, speaking of the beach tiger
beetle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect there are very few people who have ever experienced
a wild beach that has all of its denizens,'' he said. ``It's sort
of a symbol of what's supposed to be.''

`THIN AIR': IN THE TRADITION OF THE THIN MAN

   Joe Mantegna faces some tough opponents Tuesday night in ``Thin
Air,'' a new A&AMP;E movie based on one of Robert B. Parker's detective
novels. But they're not the many bad guys who wander through the
story. They are Columbo, Kojak, Rockford, Barnaby Jones and all the
other cops and private eyes who ever made an impression in
television.
</P>
<P>
   It's a large fraternity, and Mantegna, a Tony Award winner and
veteran film actor, doesn't really elbow himself a distinctive spot
in it with his portrayal of Spenser, the private detective who has
been Parker's meal ticket in a string of best sellers. In fact, in
``Thin Air,'' an unsettling kidnapping story with a collage of
well-drawn rogues, Mantegna is noteworthy for being the most
forgettable component.
</P>
<P>
   Spenser is called upon to rescue Lisa St. Claire (Yancy Butler),
the wife of an old pal. She has been abducted by a scary former
boyfriend, Luis Deleon (Jon Seda), who has some odd ideas about
romance and a penchant for videotape. (``I want to get everything
on tape,'' he tells his captive creepily as he aims a camera her
way, ``so we can watch it all together when we are old.'')
</P>
<P>
   The delusional Luis, chillingly rendered by Seda, presides over
an urban compound whose members grow their own food in rooftop
gardens and carry a vast array of weaponry. Lisa is every bit his
match, and the interplay between Butler and Seda gives the movie
its best moments. On the good-guy side, Luis Guzman as Chollo, the
sidekick Spenser recruits to help him penetrate the Hispanic
underground, puts a distinctive, enjoyable spin on the
second-banana tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Against these compelling performances, Mantegna seems to be just
treading water. Perhaps fans of the novels will enjoy watching him
to see how he translates the character, and anyone who remembers
the television series ``Spenser for Hire'' from the 1980s may get
some mental exercise by comparing his portrayal with Robert
Urich's. But people who tune in simply looking for a good yarn with
an alluring hero will be puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   The wisecracks that seem spunky in the Parker books are neither
wise nor crackling here. The romantic moments between Spenser and
his longstanding girlfriend, Dr. Susan Silverman (Marcia Gay
Harden), are perfunctory as can be. When this Spenser is laid back,
which is most of the time, he is drab rather than intriguingly
cerebral. On those few occasions when he drops into tough-guy mode,
he is not convincing because, frankly, Mantegna is too old and
unbuff to be acrobatically smacking and kicking large thugs around.
</P>
<P>
   So for the viewer who is used to quirky and/or dynamic
television detectives (A&AMP;E can call this a movie if it wants to,
but this is the small screen and the genre is owned by hourlong
dramas), ``Thin Air'' becomes a bit frustrating. ``Geez!'' you want
to yell at the screen on Mantegna's behalf. ``Give the poor guy
something to work with: a shaved head, an eye patch, a cane, maybe
one of those sidewalk scooters.'' But of course the character is
limited by his written incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   The Spenser franchise may be strong enough that it doesn't
matter. This is Mantegna's second turn in the role; A&AMP;E offered its
first Spenser movie, ``Small Vices,'' last year and apparently was
encouraged enough by the response to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's odd watching a detective story _ even an often
entertaining one like ``Thin Air'' _ with a hole where the hero
ought to be.

EUROPEANS DEBATE   INNER-CITY AIRPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 17)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PARIS _ The fatal crash of a supersonic Concorde northeast of
Paris on July 25 has renewed debate over the construction of a
third major airport to serve the French capital. The fact that the
Concorde could easily have come down on top of a small town, with
even more than the four deaths that resulted among people on the
ground, is also raising questions about the safety of existing
airports in or near cities, about their further development and
about the location of future airports elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Fierce disputes over inner city airports have erupted on the
Continent in recent years, notably in Italy, where a group of
European airlines has taken Alitalia to court over its plans for
Linate airport, a 15-minute drive from downtown Milan. The argument
erupted after Alitalia, backed by the Italian authorities, sought
to capitalize on local resistance to Linate by forcing its European
competitors to use a new airport, Malpensa, a $65 cab ride from
central Milan, while Alitalia reserved Linate for itself.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, controversy is simmering about the future of downtown
Tempelhof Airport, site of the 1949 airlift into Berlin by the
Western Allies. Berlin now relies mainly on tiny Tegel Airport, in
former West Berlin, and proposals to enlarge Schonefeld, the old
East Berlin airport, into a major international hub are hamstrung
by debates among politicians, air traffic planners and
environmentalists opposed to any airport enlargement. Meanwhile,
the former East German city of Leipzig, whose airport was upgraded
after the fall of the Berlin Wall, is booming, attracting travelers
from as far away as Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, the numbers speak for themselves. Last year, Charles
de Gaulle Airport, departure point for the fatal Concorde flight,
registered 490,000 takeoffs and landings, a leap of 100,000 in
three years. The airport, in Roissy on the northeastern outskirts
of the city, handled 44 million passengers, almost 13 percent more
than in 1998. At that rate of growth, a ceiling of 55 million
passengers set by the French government will be reached by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Yves Cousquer, president of Aeroports de Paris, the
government-owned company that operates Charles De Gaulle and Orly,
the smaller Paris airport, said that construction of a third
airport for the Paris region had become unavoidable. After the
Concorde crash near the town of Gonesse, which killed 113 people,
the French minister of transportation, Jean-Claude Gayssot, said a
formal decision to build the third airport would probably come this
month and a site would be chosen by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Such a decision will not be easy. Originally, Aeroports de Paris
favored expanding Charles de Gaulle and Orly, but after the crash,
Cousquer acknowledged that construction of a third airport had
become ``ineluctable.'' In towns like Gonesse that profit from jobs
the airports create, mayors and other politicians are torn between
the benefits and the risks. If the Concorde had crashed in the
center of Gonesse, instead of its thinly populated outskirts, the
number of victims would certainly have been far higher.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of a possible third airport for Paris began in the
mid-1990s, as the saturation of Charles de Gaulle and Orly clashed
increasingly with French ambitions to build Paris into a major
European hub to compete with Frankfurt and London. Initially, the
government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, which took office in
1997 with the backing of Green parties and environmentally
sensitive leftists, shelved the idea, preferring instead to expand
the two existing airports. Generally, the Greens and their leftist
allies oppose hub development, favoring smaller regional airports
and preferring high-speed trains, rather than planes, for trips
shorter than 500 miles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe had
proposed a site at Beauvilliers, near Chartres about 50 miles
southwest of Paris. Mayors in the region objected, suggesting
Vatry, a town east of Paris near a proposed high-speed train line
between Paris and Strasbourg. Whatever the choice, Cousquer of
Aeroports de Paris says the third airport will not be in operation
before 2025. The Juppe government had envisaged an opening in 2015.
</P>
<P>
   These projections have encouraged a bid by Lyon, in the
southeast of France, to turn its airport, Lyon-St.-Exupery, into a
second major port of entry to France at less cost and time than it
would take to build a third Paris airport. Bernard Chaffange,
director of Lyon-St.-Exupery, says that the airport, which has a
high-speed train link to Paris and will connect next year with
Marseille on the Mediterranean coast, could absorb the 40 percent
of international travelers now flying into Paris but ultimately
destined for business or vacations in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Gayssot approved further investment at
Lyon-St.-Exupery, including two additional runways. Local
environmentalists and others opposed to the expansion are already
organizing resistance.

PACKAGES COME WITH ASTERISKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 17) 
 By BETSY WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who found few bargains on travel to Europe last summer,
when flights were full and coach fares to Lisbon, for example, were
running over $900, are likely to welcome fall, when low-cost
packages arrive. For less than the price of a round-trip air ticket
in summer, tour companies in off season sell combinations of
flights, hotels and elements like sightseeing tours or transfers
between the airport and the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is hugely seasonal. As one operator said, the
income from full planes in summer helps to pay for flights in the
winter, when the per-passenger cost is increased by smaller loads
and the occasional need to de-ice planes. So if a plane is flying
30 percent empty, it benefits an airline to sign a contract with an
operator to sell the empty seats for very little.
</P>
<P>
   However the package is composed, the price is printed in big
numbers, and ``double occupancy,'' ``weekday departures'' and
airport ``fees and government taxes'' of $50 to $125 are in smaller
type; hotel taxes and service charges are normally included. These
factors affect the final cost of packages, and potential buyers
should ask about all of them. In addition, when prices are
stunningly low, the packages may be of cometlike duration and
fraught with asterisks and howevers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, because of restrictions on dates, a three-night
London package that British Airways Holidays advertises for Nov. 1
to 30 can be bought at its lowest price, $409, for only three
departure dates: Nov. 5, 12 and 26, all Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Watch the Calendar
</P>
<P>
   This package, which covers air fare from New York, three nights'
hotel in double occupancy, Continental breakfast, service and hotel
tax is being sold only until Sept. 30. Departing on Thursday,
Friday or Saturday raises the cost $25, as does returning on
Friday, Saturday or Sunday. So there goes $50, if you're not
careful. There is a $30 surcharge for Nov. 21 to 24, over
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   At this price _ and there are higher ones _ the hotels are the
Tavistock, with 345 rooms, and the Royal National, with 1,432,
which the company rates at two diamonds: ``Fairly basic''
accommodations that are well-maintained but with limited amenities.
They have private baths and showers. Both are near the Russell
Square Underground station.
</P>
<P>
   John Muller, manager of operations for British Airways Holidays,
describes the $409 package as tactical pricing: ``We are interested
in seeing more people travel at certain times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For November, the least expensive British Airways round trip
from New York would be $352. This must be bought 45 days in
advance, for weekday flights and with a Saturday night stay, a
restriction waived for the package.
</P>
<P>
   For November, the Tavistock said, it would charge each of two
guests in a room $57 a night, with the pound at $1.46, including
Continental breakfast, service charges and tax, for a total of $171
a person for three nights. The Royal National gave its November
rate as the equivalent of $60 a person a night, for $180 for three
nights, including Continental breakfast, tax and service.
</P>
<P>
   So an individual trying to replicate the $409 package would pay
at least $523 at the Tavistock, $532 at the Royal National, and the
days of the week would be constricted.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways Holidays: (800) 359-8722.
</P>
<P>
   A London package with a voucher for a choice of plays in the
West End is offered by Insight Vacations for people who want a
higher-quality hotel. With the theater ticket; air fare on British
Airways from New York; transfers from and to the airport; six
nights, double occupancy, at the Kensington Hilton with Continental
breakfasts; and a half-day sightseeing tour, this comes to $995 for
four Saturday departures in November and Dec. 2 and 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Kensington Hilton said its best rate for a six-night stay in
November, including a full breakfast and hotel tax, would be $106 a
person a night, making six nights worth $636. A West End theater
ticket in the stalls _ the equivalent of the orchestra _ is about
$50; if bought separately from the Applause agency in New York, it
would cost $95.
</P>
<P>
   The British Tourist Authority said that round-trip bus transfers
between Heathrow Airport and a downtown hotel would cost about
$17.50; this would involve stops at many hotels. The half-day
sightseeing tour was put at an average of $40 each.
</P>
<P>
   With a theater ticket bought there, the package components would
cost $1,095 at the hotel rate quoted above. The hotel said rates
for certain days might be as low as $83 a person a night, but with
no breakfast. Continental breakfast costs $14.50, English
breakfast, $22.
</P>

   A Roman Holiday
</P>
<P>
   TourCrafters is resuming a $599 five-night package to Rome, from
Nov. 16 to Dec. 14. The elements are round-trip air fare on
Alitalia from New York, Boston, Chicago or Miami, not including
taxes and airport fees; five nights, double occupancy, at the
three-star Hotel Brasile, 13 Via Palestro, near the railroad
station; and Continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   A New York-Rome round-trip ticket on a weekday from Nov. 1 to
March 18, with a Sunday night stay, was quoted by Alitalia at $398,
plus taxes. On the weekend, it would be $438. The hotel, called
direct, quoted a rate of $57 a person (based on two people in a
room), including buffet breakfast, service charges and taxes. This
would mean that elements in the five-night package, purchased
individually for weekday travel, would cost $683, or for weekend
travel, $723.

<P>
   Paris Visit
</P>
<P>
   ETM Travel Group is offering three nights in double occupancy in
Paris with Continental breakfast and a two-hour Cityrama
sightseeing tour for $499, with departures on Continental Airlines
from Newark on Thursday, Friday or Saturday. The offer starts Nov.
1 and runs to March 31, with a blackout Dec. 12 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest Continental fare to Paris for November is $415. For
its least expensive package, ETM uses a small hotel on the right
bank, Des Victoires at 19, rue Herold, which quotes a rate of $53 a
person a night for a double room, with the franc at 7.3 to the
dollar. Creating the equivalent of the ETM package would thus mean
$415 for air fare and $159 for the hotel, plus $25 for the Cityrama
tour, a total of $599.
</P>
<P>
   Des Victoires, with 58 rooms, has recently been renovated. It
has no restaurant, but provides breakfast in a brick-walled area
with arches; breakfast in the room is also available. On the ETM
package, extra nights there are $57 a person.
</P>
<P>
   ETM: 237 Post Road, Westport, Conn. 06880; (800) 992-7700;
www.etmtravelgroup.com.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of these packages has prices for extra nights, nicer
hotels, choicer days, even travel in blackout periods. Like the
special on laundry detergent that gets you into the market, these
packages put you in the right frame of mind for spending a little
more.

FLAT AMSTERDAM IS A BIKER'S NIRVANA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 17) 
 By JUDITH YARNALL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM _ As Dutch as tulips and considerably more fun,
bicycles _ or fietsen, as they're called in Amsterdam _ are ideally
suited to the brick-paved canal streets of the old central city and
to the flat landscape surrounding the urban area. They're
everywhere: Chained to bridges, parked by the hundreds outside
Centraal Station, rolling steadily by (often with one or two small
passengers aboard) as you sit in outdoor cafes. Because municipal
policy actively promotes bicycle commuting, lanes and paths
reserved for their use abound. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a trip this past July, my companion, Victor, and I decided to
join the locals. We wanted to bike south out of the city along the
Amstel, to the town of Ouderkerk, where the old Portuguese Jewish
cemetery is situated, and also to explore the placid Waterland
region across the IJ harbor (pronounced eye) to the north. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But our first task was to reacquaint ourselves with the Jordaan,
the old working class district that we planned to use as our base.
Situated immediately to the west of the Prinsengracht, the
outermost of the concentric horseshoe canals that are the main
feature of the city's enduring 17th-century plan, the intimately
scaled Jordaan charms you into believing that beauty is compatible
with comfort. Its two diagonal canals, the Bloemgracht and the
Egelantiersgracht, are perhaps the loveliest in the city and also
superb places for listening to the bells of the Westerkerk, the
light-filled church where Rembrandt is buried. Anne Frank, while in
hiding around the corner, regarded its clock tolling each quarter
hour as a ``faithful friend.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our hotel, the Acacia, was almost out of the carillon's range,
though still within the Jordaan. When we saw our room there we
couldn't believe our good fortune: Half of a houseboat, complete
with kitchen facilities, a slant window near the bed for watching
ducks glide by, and a small deck above the prow, perfect for
relaxing after expeditions. We felt like part of the neighborhood,
an illusion that the Acacia's owner, Hans van Vliet, is pleased to
foster among his guests by providing a few houseboat rooms in
addition to those within the hotel's main building. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After settling in we headed for Bike City, a rental and repair
shop on the Bloemgracht with an atmosphere of funk and competence,
quintessentially Amsterdam. About 15 minutes later we emerged with
pleasantly anonymous, one-speed machines, adequately equipped for
terrain where the closest thing to a hill is the arch of a bridge
or the grassy approach to the top of a dike. Rob Olykan, the
manager of Bike City, instructed us in snakes and rear wheel locks,
antitheft devices that our rental included. He also recommended we
drop by Pied a Terre, a shop carrying detailed maps for hiking and
cycling. There we purchased a set of four maps of the districts
outlying Amsterdam, which nicely complemented a huge bicycle map of
the city and its immediate fringe we had bought earlier. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On our ride back to the Acacia we stopped by the Westerkerk to
check posters announcing coming musical events, many of which are
free. (We had heard Bach's Christmas Oratorio and Mozart's Requiem
in this lovely, reverberant church on previous trips.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From there it was a two-minute ride to Cafe 't Smalle. Inside
this small and genial establishment you can find peace for journal
writing; outside, a deck overhangs the waters of the
Egelantiersgracht. We spread our maps on an outdoor table and
talked over the evening's and next day's possibilities. Dinner
would be at Avare, a Turkish restaurant with an abundance of tasty
choices on the Lindengracht, one of the Jordaan's two restaurant
streets. After that we'd go back to the Westerkerk, for a concert
by a visiting organist from Stuttgart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next morning we prepared ourselves for our trip to Ouderkerk
aan de Amstel by first visiting the Portuguese synagogue, about a
15-minute ride from our hotel. Dedicated in 1675, it is still used
for Sabbath services in warm weather. The community that built this
synagogue suffered great hardship: They took refuge in Portugal
after having been expelled from Spain in 1492, only to be expelled
from Portugal four years later or else forcibly baptized beginning
in 1497. A hundred years later, around the turn of the 17th
century, their descendants reached tolerant Amsterdam. Holland was
rebelling against the Spanish Hapsburgs at the time, so the Iberian
newcomers wisely chose to identify themselves as Portuguese. With
its culture and wealth, this community contributed immeasurably to
its host city. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of its members, a merchant named Isaac de Pinto, lived on
St. Antoniebree-straat in an elegant house with painted ceilings
that is now a branch of the Amsterdam public library. Another,
Baruch Spinoza, the 17th-century philosopher (and lensmaker), was
excommunicated for ideas deemed heretical by its rabbis.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To reach the synagogue in the old Jewish quarter, which lies
across the Amstel, we took the long way around, avoiding the
traffic on the direct route through Dam Square and instead
following the stately Herengracht all the way to the river. (If
you're a tourist-biker, it makes sense to stick to the old
waterways: Aesthetics will reward your prudence.) We were impressed
by the building's barrel-vaulted ceiling and tall windows, the rich
woods housing its scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Built roughly four decades after the Westerkerk, the Portuguese
Synagogue has nearly identical brass chandeliers, all orb and curve
and swoop. They contain more than a thousand candles, because the
building has never been electrified. Imagine High Holy evenings by
candlelight, a sight now rarely seen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 17th century members of the synagogue bought land for a
cemetery they named Beth Haim (the House of Life) five and a half
miles south of the city, at Ouderkerk, where the smaller Bullewijk
converges with the Amstel. We headed there, cycling toward the road
that runs along the Amstel dike. At first our view of the river was
blocked by wall-to-wall houseboats, while far-off cranes leaned
like giraffes over half-finished apartment blocks.
</P>
<P>
   But after we passed under the thick ring road that girds the
city, vistas opened out. Here were cattails and parkland, a lazy
river traffic of yachts with their masts down in preparation for
the bridges ahead. The Amstel brims, as if one added cup would make
it tremble over its dikes. And yet that impression ignores the
intricacies of Dutch hydraulics, for the system of pumping and
drainage is so carefully calibrated that as you ride along you can
see simultaneously three different levels of water-fenced fields,
where sheep and cows never encounter barbed wire.  &QL;

   It exists but neither Vice President Al Gore nor Texas Gov.
George W. Bush wishes to claim it. We talk here of the U.S.
Congress, run by an unpopular conservative Republican majority that
Bush ignores and a leftish Democratic minority that pretty much
ignores Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, our worthy legislators have been lying in the weeds,
waiting for this month's confrontation with President Clinton over
key tax and social issues with the potential to dramatize major
party differences. It seems likely, however, that barring some
disaster, this last-minute tussle will be merely a transitory
sideshow of little real election impact.
</P>
<P>
   The battle was joined with the president's vetoes _ both of
which will be sustained _ of GOP-promoted measures to kill estate
and marriage taxes. Budget spending issues are the real test of
political clout, and here too, in the pork-dispensing department,
the president seems to have the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   A victory will look good on his legislative record but will not
do much to help Gore or hurt Bush. It will give the Republicans
another opportunity to complain about big Democratic spenders, an
argument that isn't worth a lot in an era awash in surplus funds.
It may also give Democrats an opportunity to claim they are going
in the direction voters want.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the presidential contest marches on to its own beat.
Bush has repeatedly cast himself as a Washington outsider, a silly
pretense for a president's son but a means of distancing himself
from Capitol Hill. High-ranking Republican members of Congress were
conspicuously missing from the Bush-controlled GOP convention or
were allowed only brief speeches at odd hours well outside of prime
television time.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigns as ``a different kind of Republican'' _ different
from Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and the rest of the hard-core GOP congressional
leadership. Bush bragged at the convention, ``I have no stake in
the bitter arguments of the last few years,'' although his current
policy positions resemble those already taken by other Republicans
in these continuing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promises, if elected, to set a new tone of bipartisan
cooperation in the nation's capital. ``I believe the next president
must put Republicans and Democrats in a room and say, `Let's reform
Medicare,''' Bush said in a recent interview. Wow. Merely talking
to opponents will solve everything! What a concept.
</P>
<P>
   Can he really believe that Clinton, the biggest gabber of all
time, hasn't been talking to movers and shakers on Capitol Hill? If
charm alone could resolve ideological differences, Clinton would be
king of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also denounces the Clinton administration for failing to
complete its agenda of overhauling Social Security and Medicare and
improving public education, as though the White House functions in
a political vacuum. Of course it is not in Bush's interest to
mention that the GOP-led Congress has been busy blocking the
administration at every possible turn. That would put some of the
responsibility for the past eight years on Republican shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore has not rushed to pose beside House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt and wrap himself in the congressional battles
either. The two have a better relationship than they did a few
years ago when Gephardt flirted with a presidential candidacy and
the question of international trade rights ripped the party apart.
But they still circle each other warily.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle is closer to Gore and to
Gore's thinking. But the Senate minority itself is philosophically
divided, and until Gore's poll numbers improved recently, most
Democrats were nervous about embracing him too closely.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush fading fast, congressional Republicans are caving in
to Clinton on several major issues, hoping to avoid a government
shutdown and a nasty public fight with a president they impeached
in 1998 but whose job approval ratings still hovers at about 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore keeps his distance from that fuss because the Clinton
shadow could yet cloud over his new authority as his own man. Bush
keeps his distance because he doesn't have an alternative strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Originally congressional Republicans didn't mind being ignored
by Bush because they had signed on with him early in the game and
expected to ride to re-election on his coattails. Now they are
confused. If there are to be no coattails, they must separate
themselves from Bush immediately. But if they run from him, will he
go down to defeat and take them with him anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The congressional Democrats have a similar problem with Gore,
whose polls can go down as easily as they went up. Initial plans
for Gore to run against a do-nothing Republican Congress got
sidelined in his desperate attempt to sell himself as Al Gore,
independent leader not bogged down in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But both Bush and Gore are coordinating their policy messages
with their party's congressional candidates, who do or don't follow
the party plan. A Republican candidate in Connecticut recently
broadcast a commercial praising Democratic vice presidential
nominee Joe Lieberman. It aired during a visit by GOP vice
presidential nominee Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Elections always come down to every person for himself or
herself. But this year the national and local races seem more
disconnected than usual.

 AMSTERDAM: barbed wire. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our plan for this day's ride was to follow the route that
funerary barges took in previous centuries as they made their way
toward the water landing at Beth Haim. When we arrived, we locked
up our bikes by the cemetery fence and immediately noticed evidence
of a drainage and construction project, as well as a placard
directing us to Kerkstraat 7 across the street for more
information. There we were delighted to talk with Derek Brown,
office manager for the cemetery and its restoration. Many of the
cemetery's 27,000 graves, he told us, have now disappeared into
marsh, though in the late 19th century a member of the community,
David Henriques de Castro, had personally paid for the raising,
restoring and photographing of 70 of its most elaborately carved
marble tombs. Even these have now resettled much lower. But they
can still be seen, along with numerous other handsome, ornate tombs
set among Beth Haim's acres of grassy fields and gracious old
trees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes this site so exceptional _ perhaps the most
exceptional Jewish cemetery in Europe _ is the Amsterdam Sephardic
community's loose interpretation of the biblical proscription
against images of God. One stone shows divine hands gripping a
hatchet to fell the tree of life, another an angel descending just
in time to rescue a kneeling Isaac from his father's knife _ though
most, like that of Rembrandt's next door neighbor Daniel Pinto, are
more conventional, with skillfully executed floral motifs. As we
wandered around, Victor and I searched for Spinoza's parents (grave
No. 31 on Henriques de Castro's map), but could not find them _ an
unfulfilled quest that seemed appropriate to this evocative,
elm-shaded place.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next morning we awoke not to a complex, painterly Dutch sky
but to something more rare in the Netherlands: Pure sun. We headed
for the free bicycle ferry in back of Centraal Station, which
crosses the IJ every few minutes. Its berth on the north side of
the harbor almost adjoins the shady bike path along the Noord
Hollands Canal. Dug in 1819-1825 and intended to ease the passage
of oceangoing ships into Amsterdam, the canal today provides an
amenity for cyclists and houseboat owners, though its drawbridges
still get some use from barge-pushing tugs. It's a smooth conduit
into Waterland, a region of lush polders formed from lakes drained
in the 17th century, Mondrian-straight bike paths and unspoiled
villages.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Waterland now borders the IJsselmeer, the freshwater lake formed
in 1932 from the damming of the Zuider Zee. Both Jeroen, my Dutch
son-in-law, and Rob at Bike City had mentioned looping through it
as a favorite ride, one offering a wide horizon on Dutch culture.
And when we saw the church spires of our destination towns miles
away rising over the plain, we felt as if we were cycling through a
Ruisdael painting.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first of these spires belonged to the Protestant church of
Broek in Waterland, Hans Brinker's village. Although the
beautifully detailed church is steeped in history (built in the
14th century, burned by Spanish soldiers in the 16th, rebuilt in
the 17th), its contemporary members aren't cowed by it. Their
information sheet directs visitors' attention to a stained-glass
window depicting the great conflagration, but someone has also
provided a soft sculpture granny who's asleep in one of the pews.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the outskirts of Broek we spied the towers of Monnickendam,
an old port town about two miles northeast, noted for its fish
restaurants and pleasure boats. Following signs for the town's
``haven,'' or harbor, we came to the waterside terrace of 't
Markerveerhuis, where we lunched very pleasantly. But outside
Monnickendam, we gave up our spire-markers to follow the long
curves of the path atop the IJsselmeer dike. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeroen had warned us about prevailing winds on the dike and on
the causeway out to the nearby island of Marken in the late
afternoon. Today, however, we had nothing to worry about: The
IJsselmeer was an unruffled sheet of haze, still as the herons
perched by the polders' ditches. We veered southeast down the
headland, glorying in the dike's exposure. Approximately 5 miles
beyond Monnickendam we turned inland, toward the tiny, boggy
village of Holysloot. Its attraction was a bicycle ferry, indicated
on our map, which made possible a shortcut back to the city. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first person we queried in Holysloot turned out to be the
ferryman himself, who sold us cold drinks while we waited for a
boatful of cyclists to accumulate. The ferry dropped us off in a
cow-pied pasture _ no bike path in sight, only five white
sawhorselike structures that upon closer inspection included narrow
rails at ground level. These were loopbruggen, as we learned from a
sign, ditch-spanning bridges intended for cyclists on foot pushing
their bikes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sophistication of Amsterdam seemed a long way off, though in
fact we were back within city limits in less than an hour. In the
trickiest part of the whole expedition, we had to chart a careful
course back across the Noord Hollands Canal in order to reach the
IJ bicycle ferry, which docks on its western side. Our ride to and
through Waterland had totaled nearly 19 miles _ about 7 more than
the previous day's _ leaving us pleasantly tired when we returned
to our temporary home in the Jordaan.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Any of the towns along our routes, even diminutive Holysloot,
can be reached by bus from Amsterdam. But the slower pace and
unframed vista of bicycle travel give one _ besides the chance to
be a reborn 10-year-old _ ample time to absorb the landscape. In
this city and its surroundings, where not only architecture and
history are human creations but also much of the land itself, the
lack of velocity offers a special opportunity. And it won't take
your breath away.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For ad man Edgar Hatcher, retirement came at age 65, after ``I
had done work for all the clients I wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   For accountant Lois Schwartz, it was age 60, when she felt
``completely burned out. ... I had worked 80 hours a week for two
years, without a day off. Including holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   For superstar Barbra Streisand, 58 is the age to retire from her
public singing career, which she will do after four highly
publicized concerts this month.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone with a job, there comes a time to retire.
Determining, from an emotional standpoint, precisely when to leave
the work force is one of the most life-altering decisions a person
can make _ and, ironically, one of the least studied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't know much about it,'' said Terry Alan Beehr, a
psychology professor at Central Michigan University in Mount
Pleasant. ``Economists have studied it using financial models, but
money doesn't explain everything.''
</P>
<P>
   From a psychological point of view, ``there's just not much
research on that, period,'' Beehr said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because the decision process is hard to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   ``My speculation would be _ and this is just speculation _ that
it's harder to get that kind of information,'' said Andy Eschtruth
of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. For
financial and health-related retirement topics, ``there are data
sets available, providing hard numbers. This is a softer issue,''
demanding in-depth interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers may focus more on the emotional and
psychological aspects of the retirement decision as the working
population ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to change with the baby boomers retiring,''
said Jean Talaga, who holds a doctorate in
industrial/organizational psychology and has examined gender
differences in retirement decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomers are interested in finances, but other issues also are
important, such as making sure they feel their lives are
fulfilling,'' said Talaga, of Grand Rapids, Mich. ``So I think in
the future there will be more research from that standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   For now, when trying to explain the timing of their decision,
people from the famous to the ordinary tend to resort to that vague
``It's just time'':
</P>
<P>
   _ Rock legend Tina Turner announced her retirement in July.
``Sixty is a good time to stop,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Houston Comets star Cynthia Cooper, 37, announced her
retirement at the end of this season, after 15 years of pro
basketball. ``I just think it's time to move on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lynn Crooks retired in July after 31 years as an assistant
U.S. attorney in Fargo, N.D. ``I think it's just time,'' said
Crooks, 59.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alfreda Wilson, 73, retired in February after 30 years as
organist at Ray Winder Field in Little Rock, Ark., playing for the
Arkansas Travelers baseball team. ``It's just time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finances do figure greatly into the retirement timing decision.
But, perhaps surprisingly, money is not the most important factor.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Cornell University's Retirement and Well-Being Study tracked 664
people, older workers and recent retirees ages 50 to 72, from 1994
to 1999. Participants were surveyed every two years. One question
focused on reasons for retiring when they did.
</P>
<P>
   Their top answer: About 70 percent said they ``wanted to do
other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Retirement expert Marion Haynes agreed that is a good benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave when there's something else you'd rather be doing, not
just because you want to get away from work,'' said Haynes from his
Springdale, Ark., home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, after a 35-year career, Haynes retired from Shell Oil
Co. as manager of pensioner relations. He is a past president of
the International Society of Retirement Planning and author of
several books, including ``From Work to Retirement'' and ``The Best
of Retirement Planning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's life is so different,'' Haynes said. ``The bottom
line is this: What else would you be doing with your time _
traveling, or caring for an elderly parent, or serving on a
community board _ if you weren't at work?''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, the accountant, worked for 45 years before retiring
from a large manufacturing firm in 1997. Now she tends the garden
of her Columbus, Ohio, home, in addition to painting and bowling _
``but I've bowled forever,'' she quipped.
</P>
<P>
   She also takes care of her ailing parents. Her mother broke a
hip last year, and her father has Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz began seriously considering retirement in the
mid-1990s. After examining her finances and medical insurance
options, she figured she could leave at age 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also started playing bridge a couple years before I
retired,'' she said. ``I decided I needed a new interest. Bridge,
that's a fascinating game.'' Now she plays on Friday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Her experience provides examples of what researcher Beehr calls
``retirement push and pull variables.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz was burned out by her job, which pushed her toward
retirement; she was pulled toward retirement by her healthy
financial situation and outside interests.
</P>
<P>
   Other push variables may include employee cutbacks, employer
incentives and workplace social factors (not getting along with
co-workers). Pull variables might be more time for relaxation,
concentrating on hobbies or doing volunteer work.
</P>
<P>
   One important consideration for former advertising executive
Hatcher was timing _ getting out while the getting was good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to leave feeling you got beat,'' said Hatcher,
now 74, who lives in Manhattan. ``You'd like to leave feeling you
kicked the last butt you could kick.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher, who worked on ad campaigns including ``Ford has a
better idea,'' retired nine years ago from McCann-Erickson
Worldwide Advertising in New York. A week later he got a call from
the office: Would he help finish a project? So, for several years,
he worked part time.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees choose to transition into retirement by doing
that. The 10th annual Retirement Confidence Survey shows that 25
percent of retirees in 2000 have worked for pay since they have
been retired. Of those, 75 percent report they are doing so because
they ``enjoy work and want to stay involved.''
</P>
<P>
   That survey, of 1,000 adults (779 workers and 221 retirees), was
conducted by the American Savings Education Council and the
Employee Benefit Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the occupation itself affects the timing of
retirement. University of Illinois research just out shows that
farmers, for example, are nearly twice as likely to continue
working beyond age 65 than are workers of similar age in other
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older farmers simply don't think about retirement most of the
time,'' said Andrew Sofranko, professor of human and community
development, in announcing the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not a lot of young people around them reminding them
of their older age,'' Sofranko said. ``And unlike a lot of other
professions, no one is encouraging their retirement to reduce a
company's payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,700 Illinois farmers responding to the survey, 25
percent were 65 or older; this compares with about 13 percent of
all workers nationwide who are 65 or older.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the decision when to retire remains a very
individual one, perhaps because it signals an end as well as a
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's owning up to our mortality,'' Haynes said. ``Depending on
one's viewpoint, you can say that you've gotten work out of the way
and can get on with living. But often the attitude seems to be,
life is more over than what lies ahead.''

 ATTENTION EDITORS: Election is Tuesday, Sept. 12 
 By JONATHAN TILOVE  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala. _ By car, van, bus and plane, scores of activists _
some of whom were in Selma in 1965 and some who had never heard of
it until last week _ poured into this small Alabama city in advance
of Tuesday's election. Their mission: to defeat, at long last, the
white mayor who has held power since the bloody voting rights
confrontations that ultimately empowered blacks throughout the
South.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their mecca,'' said Joe T. Smitherman, the object of
their animus.
</P>
<P>
   It would be, he acknowledged, a nice symbol for the activists,
an easy story for the national media were he to lose Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But to Smitherman, now 70, his transformation from diehard
segregationist to the mayor of an administration dominated by black
department heads, and dependent on black votes to survive, is as
telling a symbol of change as anything these modern-day freedom
riders hope to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Either way it goes, the symbol that is Selma will be burnished
or burdened anew as voters in a city with more civil rights history
per capita than any place in the nation decide whether _ as his
opponents' slogan puts it _ ``Joe Gotta Go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-some-odd years ago, Selma began the process of changing
America. Selma was part of the wall coming down in Germany. Selma
was part of ending apartheid in South Africa,'' said Emmanual ben
Avraham, a community activist from Trenton, N.J., who was back in
Selma this week.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, it is time for Selma to do for Selma what it did
for the world.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   In ways charming or chilling, depending on one's mind-set and
experience, Selma, Ala., appears undisturbed by time. Remove the
cars from the truly Broad Street that is the city's spine, and one
could shoot a movie set in 1960 or 1920 or 1850.
</P>
<P>
   Antebellum buildings dominate the landscape. The Rexall sign on
the pharmacy appears at once vintage and pristine. Walk in, in
search of a map, and the reply is, there aren't any, but where you
trying to get to?
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman's visage peers down from posters on many of the
second-story exteriors.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's challenger is James Perkins Jr., at 47 making his
third run at Smitherman. Each time he comes closer, this time, in
the Aug. 22 preliminary election, falling behind Smitherman by 276
votes only after the absentee ballots were counted. But he had
forced a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, Smitherman's days ought to be numbered. Selma
has 9,300 black voters and 5,700 white voters. Smitherman will get
virtually all the white vote, and Perkins the overwhelming majority
of the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   When Smitherman was first elected mayor in 1964, Selma had
10,000 white voters and 300 black voters. This time, said
Smitherman, ``I've got to get about 1,000 black votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins has run a pretty low-profile campaign. A computer
consultant, he is the protege of F.D. Reese, the civil rights
leader, educator and pastor who made the first serious run by a
black candidate against Smitherman in 1984. Perkins managed that
campaign, but Reese didn't come close.
</P>
<P>
   According to attorney J.L. Chestnut, a leading figure in Selma's
black community, Reese made the tactical mistake of trying to pick
up some white support, a fruitless exercise that only undermined
black turnout.
</P>
<P>
   All the real noise against Smitherman this year comes not from
Perkins but from Rose Sanders, a law partner with Chestnut, and her
husband, Hank, a state senator. Together they wield enormous
influence throughout Alabama's Black Belt, so named for its rich
soil but as fitting a sobriquet for its concentration of
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Sanders especially is loved and hated in Selma, and
Smitherman said his main purpose in running is because ``I don't
want Rose Sanders taking over the town.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, it is Smitherman who uses words like ``diversity'' and
``inclusion.'' To ``Joe Gotta Go,'' the Smitherman campaign
replies, ``Why Change?'' on an ad trumpeting the fact that ``Blacks
have 9 of 13 of the Highest Paid Positions in the City,'' from
police and fire chiefs to cemetery sexton.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``What more can you change other than make it all black, and I
think that would be bad for Selma,'' Smitherman said, adding that
no matter Tuesday's outcome, ``You are looking at the last white
mayor of Selma.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, Smitherman's longtime antagonist even as they have
forged a relationship of mutual respect, said that the mayor's
attempt to present himself as some kind of symbol of racial
progress is clever, and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's misleading because nobody has traded more effectively on
racial division in this town as successfully or as long as he
has,'' Chestnut said. ``For nearly 40 years he's been running as
the last white hope.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Chestnut charged, Smitherman has given blacks
just enough to stay in power, and taken credit for all the things
the federal government would have required him to do anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the most gifted politicians I've ever met,''
Chestnut said. But he added, ``There is no way that Joe Smitherman
can win this election. He has to steal it.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Accusations of fraud and intimidation have been flying in both
directions, and when the call went out to civil rights activists
around the country, scores of folks from as far away as California
and New England responded. So did students from Tulane University
in New Orleans, Tougaloo College in Jackson, Miss., the University
of Mississippi in Oxford and Fisk University in Nashville, Tenn.
The NAACP dispatched 75 staff and volunteers from throughout the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   It echoed the city's history. In the 1960s, the black community
invited first the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and
later the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, led by Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., to come to Selma to press for voting
rights. Selma was chosen because it had the kind of hard-edged
white resistance that the movement needed to make its case plain to
a watching world.
</P>
<P>
   When blacks in Selma attempted to march to Montgomery in 1965,
they were met at the Edmund Pettus Bridge by state troopers and a
county sheriff's posse who beat them bloody. It became known as
``Bloody Sunday'' and led directly to enactment of the 1965 Voting
Rights Act, which opened the floodgates of black political
empowerment in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, of course, Smitherman was a leader of the white
resistance,infamously referring to Martin Luther King as ``Martin
Luther Coon.'' It was, he said, a slip of the tongue, but one that
he acknowledges he will take to his grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really wanted to come to Selma. I saw the whole mess
on television,'' said Margaret Scrivens, of Nashville, who came,
nonetheless, as part of the latest NAACP entourage. ``I felt
obligated.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Melissa Burch, a Canadian by birth who now lives in
New Orleans, said, ``I never heard of Selma until a couple of weeks
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Burch is associated with Estacion Libre, which works on behalf
of the people of Chiapas, Mexico. Earlier this year, she was an
observer at the Mexican elections that ousted the ruling party
after 71 years in power. On Sunday she was here, distributing
election literature to residents of the George Washington Carver
Homes, a housing project on Martin Luther King Street.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, inside First Baptist Church where services were soon to
start, the complexity of Selma's racial politics was fully in
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the last pew, Gloria Shears, head of the usher board,
expressed her displeasure with the ``Joe Gotta Go'' campaign. She
considered it coarse and mean. ``Joe's helped a lot of people,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   One pew forward, Louella Wilkins, who moved down from New York
in hopes of reviving a black boarding school outside Selma, reacted
with shock.
</P>
<P>
   Shears was part of the protests back in 1965. She marched with
King. She was arrested. ``I was right in the middle of it,'' she
said. ``It was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was necessary, don't you think?'' Wilkins asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, said Shears. But that was then; she was young. She is
older now.
</P>
<P>
   She knows Selma remains a terribly divided and prejudiced place.
She has white friends who are the ``dearest, sweetest people'' one
could find. They visit each other's homes. But, she said, they have
to hide that fact from other white friends. ``Isn't that
terrible?''
</P>
<P>
   While Shears and Wilkins talked, a white women in shorts and a
``Resist'' T-shirt stepped into the church and offered them fliers
about voting. Michelle Gross of Minneapolis, Minn., had come to
Selma to help out however she could.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, Gross said, she doesn't believe in voting. It only
legitimizes the system. But there are exceptions, she said, and
this is one.
</P>
<P>
   To D'Linell Finley, a political scientist at the University of
Alabama, the presence of folks like Gross is as likely to hurt as
help the effort to oust Smitherman.
</P>
<P>
   But the symbolic weight of everything about Selma makes such
practical considerations almost beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   For many who arrived here in recent days, it is about something
unfinished. There is something unsatisfying about the Selma story,
something that they cannot let stand.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, at least for a moment, said Gloria J. Sweet-Love,
president of Tennessee's NAACP _ who came down to Selma despite a
bad leg and doctor's orders _ the whole world is watching. And, she
said, if after the votes are counted, Joe has gotta go, ``I think
people around the world will be jumping and shouting, `It's finally
happening where it began, in Selma, Alabama.'''

<P>
   It's not Ali-Frazier, Yankees-Red Sox or John Rocker-Mets fans.
Not yet, anyway. But the words are already flying in what could be
the best Olympic big-country rivalry since the breakup of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Outspoken U.S. swimmer Gary Hall hadn't even boarded the plane
to Sydney when he trashed Australian swimmers, boasting the United
States ``would smash them like guitars'' once the Olympics commence
this week in Sydney. So much for diplomacy. Australia adores its
swimmers like rock stars, and from across the Pacific, two-time
1,500-meter gold medalist Kieran Perkins answered with a harsh,
personal slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take a lot of notice of drug cheats,'' said Perkins,
referring to Hall's two positive marijuana tests, the second
earning Hall a three-month suspension in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This followed Australian long jumper Jai Taurima's startling
assertion that America's ``dark athletes'' don't jump well in cold
weather, which Savante Stringfellow said inspired him to beat
Taurima at a pre-Olympic meet in Brisbane last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Red Menace is no more. But the country that gave the
world Olivia Newton-John, Rod Laver and ``Waltzing Matilda'' offers
the biggest challenge to the United States in this XXVII Olympiad,
boosted by the home-country advantage the United States enjoyed
four years ago in Atlanta. Opening ceremonies are Friday, but play
begins in soccer Wednesday (men) and Thursday (women).
</P>
<P>
   From swimming to softball, Australians are good in many
traditionally strong U.S. events. The depth isn't there, especially
in track and field, but the top-end quality is. The United States
should still win more medals, though it won't be like Atlanta, when
its 44 more than quadrupled Australia's nine.
</P>
<P>
   And though Australia embraced the world at the 1956 Games in
Melbourne, U.S. athletes and coaches aren't expecting similar
warmth this time. Take softball, where Australia has been trying to
knock off the United States for years. ``Hopefully, things won't be
thrown from the stands at us,'' said pitcher Michele Smith.
</P>
<P>
   That rivalry goes back to 1996, when Australia handed the United
States its only loss in Atlanta because Dani Tyler missed the plate
on a home run. Two years ago the United States bested Australia for
the world championship, and the United States is 5-0 against them
since Dot Richardson rejoined the team last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we've played them since '96, it's been a battle,''
said Smith, who joked she might do the Bobby Bonilla thing and wear
earplugs to block out the crowd. ``They don't like us a whole lot.
We don't like them a whole lot. That's what is going to make it so
great and so exciting. And the fact it's going to be in their home
country is going to make it bigger and better.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time those teams meet Sept. 21, the Aussie-American thing
should be rolling. The first medals are awarded Saturday in women's
triathlon, and Australia could sweep with world champion Nicole
Hackett and top-ranked Michellie Jones and Loretta Harrop. Imagine
the party if that happens. ``I really want to head-start the
Australian team,'' Harrop said.
</P>
<P>
   That night, at the 17,000-seat Aquatic Center, 17-year-old
Aussie sensation Ian Thorpe is heavily favored in the 400
freestyle, where he holds one of his 10 world records. The United
States has no one in Thorpe's class.
</P>
<P>
   And the women's 4 x 100 relay with '96 200 butterfly gold
medalist Susie O'Neill should challenge a veteran U.S. group with
former gold medalists Jenny Thompson, Dara Torres and Amy Van
Dyken. The United States barely beat the Aussies for the team title
in last year's Pan Pacific Championships, and U.S. Women's Coach
Richard Quick knows the Americans had better tune out the
pro-Aussie crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a little bit of an adjustment, but a
powerful adjustment,'' said Quick, who coaches Thompson and Torres
at Stanford Swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's taking on the atmosphere of a United States vs.
Australia dual meet. Their goal is obviously to win as many gold
medals as they can. Our goal is to defend our position as the best
swimming country in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the host country twice earned Australia generous
tournament seedings. In women's soccer, the world's top teams _ the
United States, Norway and China _ were bunched in the opposite side
of the draw from Australia. And Australian beach volleyball pairs
Lee Zahner/Julien Prosser and Natalie Cook/Kerri Potthurst drew top
men's and women's seeds ahead of Brazilian and American teams with
higher world rankings, easing their paths to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Australia should win women's field hockey gold; the
United States didn't qualify. In track the United States has no
answer for women's world 400 champion Cathy Freeman, an Aborigine
and one of the country's biggest sports heroes. Australia's Emma
George faces Stacy Dragila, who broke her world record, in the
first Olympic women's pole vault.
</P>
<P>
   In women's basketball, and to a lesser extent men's rowing
eights, Australia presents enough problems to the favored United
States to make home crowds a factor. ``When we go to Australia,
they're going to want to rip us (apart) and send us home,'' said
U.S. basketball player DeLisha Milton. ``Our goal is to win.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   But to Smith, everything comes down to softball. In their last
two championship meetings, in 1998, Lisa Fernandez beat the Aussies
in the South Pacific Classic (perfect game) and the world
championships (one-hit shutout plus a home run). Incentive? The
Aussies have plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their whole country is going to be behind that team,'' Smith
said. ``They have a lot of good chances for medals, but I think
even more so, this is the sport they want to come home with that
gold medal. And we're going to be there making sure it doesn't
happen.''

   But to Smitherman, now 70, his transformation from diehard
segregationist to the mayor of an administration dominated by black
department heads, and dependent on black votes to survive, is as
telling a symbol of change as anything these modern-day freedom
riders hope to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Either way it goes, the symbol that is Selma will be burnished
or burdened anew as voters in a city with more civil rights history
per capita than any place in the nation decide whether _ as his
opponents' slogan puts it _ ``Joe Gotta Go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-some-odd years ago, Selma began the process of changing
America. Selma was part of the wall coming down in Germany. Selma
was part of ending apartheid in South Africa,'' said Emmanual ben
Avraham, a community activist from Trenton, N.J., who was back in
Selma this week.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, it is time for Selma to do for Selma what it did
for the world.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In ways charming or chilling, depending on one's mind-set and
experience, Selma, Ala., appears undisturbed by time. Remove the
cars from the truly Broad Street that is the city's spine, and one
could shoot a movie set in 1960 or 1920 or 1850.
</P>
<P>
   Antebellum buildings dominate the landscape. The Rexall sign on
the pharmacy appears at once vintage and pristine. Walk in, in
search of a map, and the reply is, there aren't any, but where you
trying to get to?
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman's visage peers down from posters on many of the
second-story exteriors.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's challenger is James Perkins Jr., at 47 making his
third run at Smitherman. Each time he comes closer, this time, in
the Aug. 22 preliminary election, falling behind Smitherman by 276
votes only after the absentee ballots were counted. But he had
forced a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, Smitherman's days ought to be numbered. Selma
has 9,300 black voters and 5,700 white voters. Smitherman will get
virtually all the white vote, and Perkins the overwhelming majority
of the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   When Smitherman was first elected mayor in 1964, Selma had
10,000 white voters and 300 black voters. This time, said
Smitherman, ``I've got to get about 1,000 black votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins has run a pretty low-profile campaign. A computer
consultant, he is the protege of F.D. Reese, the civil rights
leader, educator and pastor who made the first serious run by a
black candidate against Smitherman in 1984. Perkins managed that
campaign, but Reese didn't come close.
</P>
<P>
   According to attorney J.L. Chestnut, a leading figure in Selma's
black community, Reese made the tactical mistake of trying to pick
up some white support, a fruitless exercise that only undermined
black turnout.
</P>
<P>
   All the real noise against Smitherman this year comes not from
Perkins but from Rose Sanders, a law partner with Chestnut, and her
husband, Hank, a state senator. Together they wield enormous
influence throughout Alabama's Black Belt, so named for its rich
soil but as fitting a sobriquet for its concentration of
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Sanders especially is loved and hated in Selma, and
Smitherman said his main purpose in running is because ``I don't
want Rose Sanders taking over the town.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, it is Smitherman who uses words like ``diversity'' and
``inclusion.'' To ``Joe Gotta Go,'' the Smitherman campaign
replies, ``Why Change?'' on an ad trumpeting the fact that ``Blacks
have 9 of 13 of the Highest Paid Positions in the City,'' from
police and fire chiefs to cemetery sexton.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``What more can you change other than make it all black, and I
think that would be bad for Selma,'' Smitherman said, adding that
no matter Tuesday's outcome, ``You are looking at the last white
mayor of Selma.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, Smitherman's longtime antagonist even as they have
forged a relationship of mutual respect, said that the mayor's
attempt to present himself as some kind of symbol of racial
progress is clever, and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's misleading because nobody has traded more effectively on
racial division in this town as successfully or as long as he
has,'' Chestnut said. ``For nearly 40 years he's been running as
the last white hope.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Chestnut charged, Smitherman has given blacks
just enough to stay in power, and taken credit for all the things
the federal government would have required him to do anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the most gifted politicians I've ever met,''
Chestnut said. But he added, ``There is no way that Joe Smitherman
can win this election. He has to steal it.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Accusations of fraud and intimidation have been flying in both
directions, and when the call went out to civil rights activists
around the country, scores of folks from as far away as California
and New England responded. So did students from Tulane University
in New Orleans, Tougaloo College in Jackson, Miss., the University
of Mississippi in Oxford and Fisk University in Nashville, Tenn.
The NAACP dispatched 75 staff and volunteers from throughout the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   It echoed the city's history. In the 1960s, the black community
invited first the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and
later the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, led by Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., to come to Selma to press for voting
rights. Selma was chosen because it had the kind of hard-edged
white resistance that the movement needed to make its case plain to
a watching world.
</P>
<P>
   When blacks in Selma attempted to march to Montgomery in 1965,
they were met at the Edmund Pettus Bridge by state troopers and a
county sheriff's posse who beat them bloody. It became known as
``Bloody Sunday'' and led directly to enactment of the 1965 Voting
Rights Act, which opened the floodgates of black political
empowerment in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, of course, Smitherman was a leader of the white
resistance,infamously referring to Martin Luther King as ``Martin
Luther Coon.'' It was, he said, a slip of the tongue, but one that
he acknowledges he will take to his grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really wanted to come to Selma. I saw the whole mess
on television,'' said Margaret Scrivens, of Nashville, who came,
nonetheless, as part of the latest NAACP entourage. ``I felt
obligated.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Melissa Burch, a Canadian by birth who now lives in
New Orleans, said, ``I never heard of Selma until a couple of weeks
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Burch is associated with Estacion Libre, which works on behalf
of the people of Chiapas, Mexico. Earlier this year, she was an
observer at the Mexican elections that ousted the ruling party
after 71 years in power. On Sunday she was here, distributing
election literature to residents of the George Washington Carver
Homes, a housing project on Martin Luther King Street.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, inside First Baptist Church where services were soon to
start, the complexity of Selma's racial politics was fully in
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the last pew, Gloria Shears, head of the usher board,
expressed her displeasure with the ``Joe Gotta Go'' campaign. She
considered it coarse and mean. ``Joe's helped a lot of people,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   One pew forward, Louella Wilkins, who moved down from New York
in hopes of reviving a black boarding school outside Selma, reacted
with shock.
</P>
<P>
   Shears was part of the protests back in 1965. She marched with
King. She was arrested. ``I was right in the middle of it,'' she
said. ``It was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was necessary, don't you think?'' Wilkins asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, said Shears. But that was then; she was young. She is
older now.
</P>
<P>
   She knows Selma remains a terribly divided and prejudiced place.
She has white friends who are the ``dearest, sweetest people'' one
could find. They visit each other's homes. But, she said, they have
to hide that fact from other white friends. ``Isn't that
terrible?''
</P>
<P>
   While Shears and Wilkins talked, a white women in shorts and a
``Resist'' T-shirt stepped into the church and offered them fliers
about voting. Michelle Gross of Minneapolis, Minn., had come to
Selma to help out however she could.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, Gross said, she doesn't believe in voting. It only
legitimizes the system. But there are exceptions, she said, and
this is one.
</P>
<P>
   To D'Linell Finley, a political scientist at the University of
Alabama, the presence of folks like Gross is as likely to hurt as
help the effort to oust Smitherman.
</P>
<P>
   But the symbolic weight of everything about Selma makes such
practical considerations almost beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   For many who arrived here in recent days, it is about something
unfinished. There is something unsatisfying about the Selma story,
something that they cannot let stand.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, at least for a moment, said Gloria J. Sweet-Love,
president of Tennessee's NAACP _ who came down to Selma despite a
bad leg and doctor's orders _ the whole world is watching. And, she
said, if after the votes are counted, Joe has gotta go, ``I think
people around the world will be jumping and shouting, `It's finally
happening where it began, in Selma, Alabama.'''

   For ad man Edgar Hatcher, retirement came at age 65, after ``I
had done work for all the clients I wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   For accountant Lois Schwartz, it was age 60, when she felt
``completely burned out. ... I had worked 80 hours a week for two
years, without a day off. Including holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   For superstar Barbra Streisand, 58 is the age to retire from her
public singing career, which she will do after four highly
publicized concerts this month.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone with a job, there comes a time to retire.
Determining, from an emotional standpoint, precisely when to leave
the work force is one of the most life-altering decisions a person
can make _ and, ironically, one of the least studied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't know much about it,'' said Terry Alan Beehr, a
psychology professor at Central Michigan University in Mount
Pleasant. ``Economists have studied it using financial models, but
money doesn't explain everything.''
</P>
<P>
   From a psychological point of view, ``there's just not much
research on that, period,'' Beehr said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because the decision process is hard to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   ``My speculation would be _ and this is just speculation _ that
it's harder to get that kind of information,'' said Andy Eschtruth
of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. For
financial and health-related retirement topics, ``there are data
sets available, providing hard numbers. This is a softer issue,''
demanding in-depth interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers may focus more on the emotional and
psychological aspects of the retirement decision as the working
population ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to change with the baby boomers retiring,''
said Jean Talaga, who holds a doctorate in
industrial/organizational psychology and has examined gender
differences in retirement decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomers are interested in finances, but other issues also are
important, such as making sure they feel their lives are
fulfilling,'' said Talaga, of Grand Rapids, Mich. ``So I think in
the future there will be more research from that standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   For now, when trying to explain the timing of their decision,
people from the famous to the ordinary tend to resort to that vague
``It's just time'':
</P>
<P>
   _ Rock legend Tina Turner announced her retirement in July.
``Sixty is a good time to stop,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Houston Comets star Cynthia Cooper, 37, announced her
retirement at the end of this season, after 15 years of pro
basketball. ``I just think it's time to move on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lynn Crooks retired in July after 31 years as an assistant
U.S. attorney in Fargo, N.D. ``I think it's just time,'' said
Crooks, 59.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alfreda Wilson, 73, retired in February after 30 years as
organist at Ray Winder Field in Little Rock, Ark., playing for the
Arkansas Travelers baseball team. ``It's just time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finances do figure greatly into the retirement timing decision.
But, perhaps surprisingly, money is not the most important factor.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Cornell University's Retirement and Well-Being Study tracked 664
people, older workers and recent retirees ages 50 to 72, from 1994
to 1999. Participants were surveyed every two years. One question
focused on reasons for retiring when they did.
</P>
<P>
   Their top answer: About 70 percent said they ``wanted to do
other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Retirement expert Marion Haynes agreed that is a good benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave when there's something else you'd rather be doing, not
just because you want to get away from work,'' said Haynes from his
Springdale, Ark., home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, after a 35-year career, Haynes retired from Shell Oil
Co. as manager of pensioner relations. He is a past president of
the International Society of Retirement Planning and author of
several books, including ``From Work to Retirement'' and ``The Best
of Retirement Planning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's life is so different,'' Haynes said. ``The bottom
line is this: What else would you be doing with your time _
traveling, or caring for an elderly parent, or serving on a
community board _ if you weren't at work?''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, the accountant, worked for 45 years before retiring
from a large manufacturing firm in 1997. Now she tends the garden
of her Columbus, Ohio, home, in addition to painting and bowling _
``but I've bowled forever,'' she quipped.
</P>
<P>
   She also takes care of her ailing parents. Her mother broke a
hip last year, and her father has Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz began seriously considering retirement in the
mid-1990s. After examining her finances and medical insurance
options, she figured she could leave at age 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also started playing bridge a couple years before I
retired,'' she said. ``I decided I needed a new interest. Bridge,
that's a fascinating game.'' Now she plays on Friday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Her experience provides examples of what researcher Beehr calls
``retirement push and pull variables.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz was burned out by her job, which pushed her toward
retirement; she was pulled toward retirement by her healthy
financial situation and outside interests.
</P>
<P>
   Other push variables may include employee cutbacks, employer
incentives and workplace social factors (not getting along with
co-workers). Pull variables might be more time for relaxation,
concentrating on hobbies or doing volunteer work.
</P>
<P>
   One important consideration for former advertising executive
Hatcher was timing _ getting out while the getting was good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to leave feeling you got beat,'' said Hatcher,
now 74, who lives in Manhattan. ``You'd like to leave feeling you
kicked the last butt you could kick.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher, who worked on ad campaigns including ``Ford has a
better idea,'' retired nine years ago from McCann-Erickson
Worldwide Advertising in New York. A week later he got a call from
the office: Would he help finish a project? So, for several years,
he worked part time.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees choose to transition into retirement by doing
that. The 10th annual Retirement Confidence Survey shows that 25
percent of retirees in 2000 have worked for pay since they have
been retired. Of those, 75 percent report they are doing so because
they ``enjoy work and want to stay involved.''
</P>
<P>
   That survey, of 1,000 adults (779 workers and 221 retirees), was
conducted by the American Savings Education Council and the
Employee Benefit Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the occupation itself affects the timing of
retirement. University of Illinois research just out shows that
farmers, for example, are nearly twice as likely to continue
working beyond age 65 than are workers of similar age in other
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older farmers simply don't think about retirement most of the
time,'' said Andrew Sofranko, professor of human and community
development, in announcing the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not a lot of young people around them reminding them
of their older age,'' Sofranko said. ``And unlike a lot of other
professions, no one is encouraging their retirement to reduce a
company's payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,700 Illinois farmers responding to the survey, 25
percent were 65 or older; this compares with about 13 percent of
all workers nationwide who are 65 or older.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the decision when to retire remains a very
individual one, perhaps because it signals an end as well as a
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's owning up to our mortality,'' Haynes said. ``Depending on
one's viewpoint, you can say that you've gotten work out of the way
and can get on with living. But often the attitude seems to be,
life is more over than what lies ahead.''

 &HT;    Day3 main death story
 &HT;    Treat patient's suffering as well as the disease
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - For Sharon Morgan, the conversation didn't take
place until her mother arrived at the emergency room, in septic
shock for the fourth time in less than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, she didn't expect Dr. Basel Yanes to suggest letting
her mother die. She knew sepsis, a common infection among cancer
patients, is life-threatening on its own. She's a registered nurse.
``But in our minds, this was something you could fix,'' she said.
Her mom had survived it three times.
</P>
<P>
   But come to think of it, Mary Monnin had shared some regret
about surviving that last sepsis. Even if she pulled through this
time, she didn't figure to live more than another two months while
her multiple myeloma became progressively more painful. Her living
will was clear that she didn't want to endure a lot of heroic
measures to extend her life.
</P>
<P>
   All Yanes had to do for Morgan, her father and 11 siblings, was
connect the dots. ``He knew this was a good time to let go,''
Morgan said of Yanes, who directs cancer care at Miami Valley
Hospital and chairs its palliative care committee.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation Yanes initiated doesn't happen often enough or
soon enough, dozens of health care workers and patients' family
members agree. They told the Cox News Service that is the main
reason barely two in 10 people use hospice services when a loved
one has a terminal illness, and those who have hospice services are
there for a median length of only 29 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to let go,'' Morgan said. ``You don't want to let
go. But I'm very glad he brought it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients and families generally don't want to discuss impending
death and doctors don't know how to. They aren't trained in
breaking bad news, and more fundamentally, they aren't trained in
battling anything beyond illness and injury, even though the need
for care continues after that battle is lost
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to bring the mindset of physicians more into making
sure the patient's suffering is treated in addition to the disease
being treated,'' Dr. Richard Wyderski said.
</P>
<P>
   That is the purpose of the elective course Wyderski teaches to
new doctors in Wright State University's internal medicine program
at Miami Valley. It's called palliative medicine, which is the
comforting treatment that goes on after the classic curative
treatment has failed. More and more residency programs also are
incorporating hospice care.
</P>
<P>
   Monnin, 69, did not go to a hospice but received some of its
psychological benefits in Miami Valley's palliative care program,
which shares the hospice philosophy that terminal illness brings
the opportunity to actually live today as if it might be your last.
She achieved another goal of palliative care by dying about 12
hours after her trip to the ER in July and bypassing the
disheartening steps of deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was there one day and the next day she was gone,'' Morgan
said. ``There was no in-between. She could still go to the bathroom
by herself and take a shower. The in-between is what's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fears of dying patients are pain and becoming
burdens to their families, research shows. A report in the May 16
Annals of Internal Medicine listed several other elements of what
hospice advocates now are calling a ``good death.''
</P>
<P>
   They want to be involved in medical decision-making and prepared
for what their disease will do to them. To resolve conflicts and
say goodbye. To energize their spirituality. To remain with loved
ones. To keep contributing to others' well-being. And to be
recognized until death as complete people, not overlooked or
dismissed like wallpaper or a finished novel.
</P>
<P>
   They also want to stay alive as long as it's absolutely possible
to keep living meaningfully. Good-death advocates forget to mention
that sometimes, but for people experiencing it, ``good death'' can
be ``a tough phrase to swallow,'' said James Londis, Kettering
Medical Center's ethics director.
</P>
<P>
   There is concern, even among those committed to palliative care,
that doctors should not be so enthusiastic about hospice advantages
that they prepare a patient for death before all reasonable options
are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``People beat the odds every day,'' said Mary Murphy, who leads
a Hospice of Dayton team that draws on specialties in grief
counseling, financial management, psychology, spirituality,
nursing, home care and pain relief. ``If you're a doc and you've
seen that, you're thinking any person could be one of them. Some
people, you don't know why they make it out the doors, but they
do.''
</P>
<P>
   So even when doctors decide no more can be done to cure a
disease, Yanes said they keep accounting for the possibility that
they're wrong. ``You tend to err on the side of doing more than
doing less. You can reverse that decision. You can't reverse the
decision to let the patient die.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes experience to learn when trying to extend a life ``is
really just extending the dying process,'' said Dr. Cathie Zofkie
of Kettering Medical Center, who specializes in caring for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most physicians are not trained to do these things,'' Yanes
said. ``We learn how to treat diseases, but we lack knowledge in
the areas of emotional support and how to break bad news to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to learn that caring for patients is not just helping
control their disease, but also helping them learn to live with
their disease. Our job is also to relieve suffering, control their
symptoms, help them emotionally to deal with the disease. I think
we need to learn that when we fail to control a disease, that does
not mean our job ends.''
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental model of medicine changes at that point, said
Miami Valley pain specialist Dr. Townsend Smith. All the basic
medical goals of diagnosing and curing are abandoned in favor of
alleviating symptoms. Whether the symptom is nausea or pain,
loneliness or depression, palliative care requires the same focus
that an oncologist takes when downplaying the side effects of
chemotherapy for the primary goal of curing the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   That shift toward comfort can't completely take place without a
conversation among doctor, patient and family. The subject is less
taboo than it was, said Beth Delaney, Miami Valley's
palliative-care coordinator. ``But it's not something we routinely
discuss with every patient, and I think that's where we need to
go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and families don't always want to have that talk,
though. ``One researcher refers to us as the temporarily
immortal,'' Wright State medical ethicist Robert Reece said. ``We
all like to think of ourselves as immortal.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, that delusion is more comforting than pain medication.
``They equate getting treatment with hope,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Others don't believe there's an advantage to hospice care, often
out of misunderstanding. Research by the National Hospice and
Palliative Care Organization indicates fewer than one in 14
Americans associate hospices with pain control or family support.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it widely known that hospice care is covered by Medicare
and more than 80 percent of health plans for large or medium-sized
businesses. Medicare saved $1.52 in 1995 for every dollar it spent
on hospice services, largely by replacing more expensive
hospitalization, according to the national hospice organization.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's mother had her own reasons for avoiding hospice. She
was comfortable with the people at Miami Valley and didn't want to
be constantly interrupted by strangers. She didn't even like it
when Morgan took her blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some families are afraid, 'You're not going to take as good
care of my loved one,' if they choose hospice or palliative care,''
Delaney said. ``We give the same attention to the patient in a
palliative-care mode as we give to the patient in the next bed with
open-heart surgery. The care just has a different purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients don't choose hospice or palliative care to hasten their
deaths but to improve what remains of their lives, said nurse Kathy
Hayes, who coordinates the hospice unit at the Dayton VA Medical
Center. Hospice of Dayton surveys indicate about six of every 10
families wish their loved one had been sent there sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are astounded by our environment,'' Hayes said. ``It's
not a depressing, oh-my-gosh-people-are-dying-here. Our emphasis is
on enjoying the time you have left.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a time for ``finishing unfinished business,'' Murphy said.
``Who do you want to talk to? What do you want to do?''
</P>
<P>
   VA psychologist Nicole Best calls it ``righting wrongs,
forgiving each other, remembering good times and bad times.'' And
everyone connected to hospices talks about relieving pain.
</P>
<P>
   Physical pain can almost always be controlled after doctors have
given up on fighting the disease, pain specialist Smith said.
Higher doses of pain medicines can be given. Patients aren't taking
therapeutic drugs that cause pain. The question is how sedated the
patient wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   Even patients who die after feeding tubes are withdrawn do not
appear to suffer greatly, Zofkie said. Their blood pressures and
heart rates aren't those of people in pain. ``It's more painful
psychologically for the people watching,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Physical pain is easier for most dying patients than their
functional impairments, Smith and Zofkie said. Some can no longer
swallow. Others develop shortness of breath. Anxiety attacks are
fairly common.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person with ALS is not really having any pain,'' Smith said.
``He just can't use his arms or his legs. There can't be anything
more miserable than that. That situation is much more difficult for
improving the quality of life.'' But as he said, palliative care
can concentrate on quality of life as its only goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they never have to give up hope,'' said Dr. Geetika Kumar
of the VA hospice. People beat the odds all the time. The hospice
guideline of six months' remaining life is not an unbreakable rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put many people in hospice who prove me wrong,'' Zofkie
said. ``That's not a failure. I think if every patient you put in
hospice winds up dying, then you're probably not putting enough
people in hospice. You're waiting too long until it's obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens during hospice and palliative care, it's not
likely to begin unless the doctor, patient or family initiates that
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The talk really should be just another step in the doctor's
ongoing communication with them, Yanes said. ``By understanding the
patient's and family's wishes, we can identify situations that can
help them say goodbye or stop aggressive treatment and move on to
the palliative.''
</P>
<P>
   Kumar doesn't go into the discussion by saying it looks like the
patient's not going to make it. ``I will tell them that yes, the
disease is terminal, but you can make the best use of this time for
any last wishes you have, any remorse you have,'' she said. ``The
patient usually understands. Patients usually know when their time
has come.''
</P>
<P>
   They might even be relieved to learn they don't have to keep
trying to save their lives, said Hospice of Dayton's Murphy. Or
they might also slam the figurative door in the doctor's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to emphasize is, when the time is right, do
patients know their choices,'' she said. ``Just as they know they
can get treatment, they also need to know there's a point when
repairing their bodies is no longer possible and what their options
are then. That's part of being an informed consumer, too.''

   KELLY PRESTON IN PARADISE
</P>
<P>
   KELLY-PRESTON-LIFEBEAT _ Kelly Preston has invited me to spend a
day with her at home in Hawaii, one of three she owns with husband
John Travolta, 46. I expected to find a pampered, self-involved
starlet vacationing with an army of servants. The little I knew of
her _ her marriage to a megastar, a few notable roles opposite some
marquee names, such as Kevin Costner and Tom Cruise, did nothing to
dispel that image. Yet here she is, answering her own front door in
flip-flops, denim shorts, a bikini top and no makeup. I have to
admire a 37-year-old woman who, 10 weeks after giving birth to Ella
Bleu, greets me in the middle of her daughter's mealtime. By Debra
Birnbaum. 1,400 words.

</P>
<P>
   PARENTING-MONEY-LIFEBEAT _ Living and working in Beverly Hills,
I've become all too accustomed to fashionably clad twentysomethings
styling down Rodeo Drive, cell phones pressed firmly to their ears.
Arranging a business meeting? Perhaps. Arranging another ``loan''
from Mom and Dad? More likely. Not to disparage today's young
people, but too many have come to expect their parents' unequivocal
support, financial and otherwise. Blanket approval and a blank
check. By Esther M. Berger. 650 words.

   RESEARCHERS TARGET AN ELUSIVE SILENT KILLER
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-OVARIAN-CANCER-LIFEBEAT _ Ovarian cancer has been
nicknamed the silent killer because it is difficult to detect. When
found, it has often spread beyond the ovaries and is too advanced
to cure. Even the symptoms are vague and easily ignored: Who hasn't
felt bloated and tired from time to time? But experts in the field
say that a new National Cancer Institute initiative, the Ovarian
Cancer Early Detection Program, promises to yield more sensitive,
highly specific _ and thus accurate _ screening tests for ovarian
cancer within the next five years. By Vicky Lowry. 1,100 words.

 &HT;    WARNING SHOT TO ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore says he would propose new laws to protect children from
violent entertainment, as the Federal Trade Commission released a
report criticizing the movie, music and video-game industries.
``It's hard enough to raise children today without the
entertainment industry making it more difficult,'' Gore said in a
statement Monday. He and running mate Joe Lieberman said that if
elected, they would give entertainment-industry leaders a six-month
deadline to adopt voluntary controls over their products. If the
industry did not begin self-policing, he said, he'd recommend the
FTC take action.
</P>
<P>
   `OPRAH': WHERE THE WOMEN VOTERS ARE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore appeared on the ``Oprah'' season premiere in Chicago
Monday, kicking off a week in which he hopes to solidify gains
among women voters. But he left the talk show diva wanting. ``No
kiss? I was hoping for something,'' Oprah Winfrey shrieked after
Gore greeted her with a handshake and one-armed, half hug. Gore's
lighthearted appearance was the first time Winfrey had invited a
politician to her TV stage. George W. Bush is scheduled to appear
on Winfrey's show Sept. 19. Asked by an audience member if he would
ever make an issue of Bush's drinking history before quitting at
age 40, Gore said, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH IN FLORIDA, NOW NO SURE THING
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush promoted his health care and prescription drug
proposals Monday in Florida, a state where his brother Jeb is
governor and strategists once believed was firmly in his column for
November. Hoping to ignite momentum, Bush armed himself with a new
slogan and a fresh style, chatting informally with elderly voters
in Clearwater on everything from Cuba to classrooms. In
shirt-sleeves and microphone in hand, Bush stood in the midst of a
packed recreation room answering questions and stressing his ``real
plans for real people'' theme. He briefly talked about his $198
billion plan to overhaul the health-care system for the elderly and
provide them with a prescription drug benefit, sharpening his
differences with Al Gore on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   GORE ON FENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has been a leading advocate of a $7.8 billion, long-term
Everglades rescue effort, but an airport controversy at the
southern rim of the Florida Everglades is causing him problems. The
dispute over Homestead Air Force Base, less than 10 miles from the
Everglades, has dampened environmentalists' enthusiasm toward him.
Gore has refused to either support or oppose conversion of the base
to a commercial, reliever airport, as some powerful South Florida
Democrats and business interests have urged. The Air Force is
expected to make a decision after completing an environmental
impact review, possibly this month. ``We'd like to see Gore come
out and say he's adamantly opposed to a commercial airport at this
location,'' said Michael Chenoweth, president of Friends of the
Everglades and a national director of the Izaak Walton League.
</P>
<P>
   FACE-LIFT WITH THE SAME FACES
</P>
<P>
   As George W. Bush gives his campaign a face-lift to try to halt
his slide in the polls, there's one thing he hasn't changed: any
faces. No staff shake-up. No calls to the bullpen. No relocation of
headquarters. The same close-knit Texas band that was with Bush two
years ago _ long before the first GOP primary _ is still steering
his campaign today. Among the stalwarts: Don Evans, campaign
chairman; Joe Allbaugh, campaign manager; Karl Rove, chief
political strategist; Karen Hughes, communications director and
close adviser; Mark McKinnon, in-house ad maker.
</P>
<P>
   GORE CONFIDENT OF THREE COMMISSION DEBATES
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore said he expects his campaign to work out a plan for
three prime-time debates with George W. Bush, despite friction
between the two camps over the issue. ``I think that it's clearly
in the public interest to have three 90-minute prime time debates
sponsored by the bipartisan commission,'' Gore told the Chicago
Tribune. ``If (Bush) is ready to accept the commission's basic
recommendation, I'm certain that all the disagreements over the
minor details can be worked out.'' Gore declined to be specific
about details. ``I'm going to let Bill Daley handle it,'' he said,
referring to his campaign chairman, the former secretary of
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   GORE CLOSER IN COLORADO POLL
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has closed gap with George W. Bush in Colorado, says a
new poll, continuing a pattern that has seen the Democrat catch up
with Republican in many states since the Democratic convention. In
a Talmey-Drake poll taken for the Rocky Mountain News and KCNC-TV
(4 percentage point margin of error) Bush led 43-40 percent, with
the Greens' Ralph Nader at 5 percent, the Reform Party's Pat
Buchanan at 1 percent and Libertarian Harry Browne at 3 percent.
That same poll had Bush up 14 points in July. And an NBC News-Wall
Street Journal national poll (2 percentage point error margin)
showed Gore ahead 45-42 percent, with Nader at 4 percent and
Buchanan at 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   MEMORIES OF DUKAKIS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is beginning to look to political observers like
another presidential candidate who blew a big post-convention lead:
Michael Dukakis, the pride of Massachusetts, in 1988. Each used his
record as governor of an important state to capture his party's
nomination. Each faced a sitting vice president armed with a go-go
economy. Each came out of his national convention with a sizable
poll lead, as much as 17 percent in both instances. And each
managed to lose that lead by Labor Day. Dukakis never did recover.
</P>
<P>
   BLEAK FUTURE FOR THIRD PARTIES
</P>
<P>
   The splintered Reform Party is the only minor political party
eligible to receive federal funding this year for its presidential
candidate. The Federal Election Commission meets today to decide
whether Pat Buchanan should get the $12.6 million. But there may
well be no money to fight for in 2004. A candidate needs at least 5
percent of the general election vote to qualify his party for
funding in the following presidential election, and Buchanan has
mustered only 1 or 2 percent in recent polls. Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader initially appeared to be the best hope for people
yearning for third-party options this year. Polls had placed his
support as high as 8 percent, but the numbers have since dwindled
to 3 or 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   VEEP CANDIDATES: MAKE IT OR BREAK IT?
</P>
<P>
   So far, it appears, Joe Lieberman has done more for Democratic
candidate Al Gore than Dick Cheney has for Republican George W.
Bush. Whether it matters that much is debatable. Many political
scientists say it doesn't, that people vote for presidents and not
vice presidents. Lieberman, however, isn't so sure. ``Obviously,
the most important element in a vote is the presidential
candidates, but I think vice-presidential candidates could be part
of a decision on who to vote for,'' said Lieberman, attending a
pair of fund-raisers Monday in Dallas. For his part, Cheney says he
wants neither credit nor blame as the campaign's poll numbers rise
and fall.
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY'S LOW-KEY STYLE WORRIES SOME
</P>
<P>
   The question is not whether Dick Cheney has the makings of an
excellent vice president. Many Republicans and Democrats say he
might be the most valuable asset for George W. Bush _ as president.
But so far, there is scant evidence that Cheney is helping Bush to
get the top job. GOP grumblings continue that he may be hurting the
ticket. Some longtime Republicans voice particular concern, given
the evident campaign chemistry between Al Gore and his running
mate, Joe Lieberman. One thing appears certain: Lieberman is having
more fun on the campaign trail than his GOP counterpart. While the
taciturn Cheney sometimes seems to be fighting acid reflux, the
smiling and ruddy-faced Lieberman jokes as if he's auditioning for
a comedy club slot.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN'S SENATE FOE CHARGES NEGLECT
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman's Senate challenger, Waterbury Mayor Philip
Giordano, is accusing him of being an absentee politician,
forsaking his Connecticut constituents for a shot at the vice
presidency _ even as he seeks re-election. No one expects the
attacks to do much damage. Lieberman has missed all six of the roll
call votes the Senate has taken since he was tapped as Al Gore's
running mate. And Lieberman plans to be in Washington Wednesday for
a hearing on a Federal Trade Commission report accusing
entertainment industries of marketing violence to minors. In a 1988
campaign ad, Lieberman likened his Senate opponent then _
Republican incumbent Lowell Weicker _ to a slumbering, snoring bear
who missed votes in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   LAZIO PRESSED ON ARAFAT PHOTO
</P>
<P>
   Staying on the offensive in the latest New York Senate campaign
controversy, Hillary Clinton criticized opponent Rick Lazio again
Monday after a photo surfaced of Lazio shaking hands with Yasser
Arafat. The photo, taken in December 1998, shows Lazio shaking
hands with Arafat and grinning broadly. The White House released
the picture a day after Lazio sharply criticized President Clinton
and the first lady for their own greetings of controversial foreign
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IF THEY HELD AN ELECTION AND _
</P>
<P>
   In her drive toward the final weeks of her Senate campaign,
Hillary Clinton has neglected one thing: she's not the Democratic
candidate just yet. There's a primary Tuesday, and she faces an
opponent. Turnout is certain to be extremely low _ very few people
know a primary is happening _ but that is precisely the danger. The
nightmare scenario going through some party leaders' minds is this:
What if scads of anti-Hillary Democrats show up to cast protest
votes, while nearly everyone else stays home? Could she get tossed
out in a fluke? Her challenger is a 39-year-old Manhattan
orthopedist and Harvard Medica; School graduate named Mark McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   POLLS DIFFER ON CLINTON AND JEWISH VOTE
</P>
<P>
   Two weekend polls put Hillary Clinton's support among Jewish
voters at 70 percent and 52 percent in her Senate race against Rick
Lazio. Some analysts believe that to win statewide in New York, a
Democrat needs at least 60 percent of the Jewish vote. Most recent
statewide polls have had Clinton's support between 50 percent and
60 percent. The New York Post poll showed Clinton's support at 70
percent versus 23 percent for Lazio, while a poll conducted for
Albany's Times Union and the Buffalo News found Clinton leading
52-34 percent. ``I think the truth is probably somewhere in the
middle,'' said independent pollster John Zogby, whose organization
conducted both surveys.
</P>
<P>
   MR. FIX-IT FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES
</P>
<P>
   While Al Gore has sought to put distance between himself and the
scandal-plagued President Clinton _ it's been almost a month since
they shared a public podium _ Democratic House and Senate
candidates clamor for the president's presence. Clinton went to
Connecticut Monday to lend a political hand to Rep. James Maloney a
public event in Danbury, then headline a fund-raiser on the
lawmaker's behalf, expected to net $175,000. Monday night the
president was to be in New York for more fund-raisers, including
one benefiting his wife, Hillary.

 By HELEN CORDES  
 c. 2000 Child magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most kids, September doesn't just mean back to school, it
also means back to music lessons, karate, dance class, religious
education, soccer practice and tutoring. Whew! While the hours
spent at school or day care get the spotlight, a child's ``off
time'' can be just as important. If that off time becomes a source
of stress instead of fun, say experts, the added pressure can
negatively affect the time a child spends at school or day care.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, several trends are converging to make kids'
leisure time decidedly less leisurely. The amount of free time 3-
to 12-year-olds have each week has shrunk by about an hour and a
half since 1981, reports a recent study at the University of
Michigan in Ann Arbor that compared daily diaries of preschool and
elementary-age kids in 1981 and 1997. The study also showed that
sports participation has doubled to nearly four and a half hours a
week, and time spent going to movies and other events increased
fivefold to more than three hours a week. Enrollment in academic
enrichment classes, like Kumon Math and Reading Centers (which
enroll more than 2.6 million students worldwide and accept kids as
young as 3), is also booming.
</P>
<P>
   The whirlwind of activities means that time for traditional
children's pastimes _ doodling, playing outside _ is shrinking.
``Creative, spontaneous play is taking a beating,'' says University
of Pennsylvania professor of education Dr. Joan F. Goodman. ``Free
time for playing and imagining is important,'' she says. ``This is
where kids learn to create and think imaginatively. Aren't these
the skills we most want them to develop?''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, family therapists and school counselors are seeing
more stressed-out kids. ``Children as young as preschool age come
in with symptoms including depression, stomachaches, headaches,
fatigue and plain old crankiness,'' says Dr. Ann Vernon, professor
of counseling at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls.
``We're seeing increased instances of biting, shoving, choking and
other aggressive behavior by preschoolers and early elementary
school children,'' adds Dr. Carlota Schechter an education
professor at St. Joseph's College in West Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   While stress can be caused by many factors, enrichment classes
draw particular ire from some child-development experts.
``Particularly for younger children, these classes force a child to
do something he's not ready to do, which is to sit in a classroom
and learn facts instead of exploring the world through creative
play,'' says Dr. Suzanne Johnson, an associate professor of
psychology at Dowling College in Oakdale, N.Y. When older kids are
put in enrichment classes after a full day of school, it can add
stress, impinge on creative playtime and even dampen a child's
enthusiasm for learning, Dr. Johnson adds. The key is choosing
activities wisely, and keeping in mind that there's no time limit
on learning.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to figure out if your child's schedule is too stressful?
Compare her behavior on less scheduled days and more scheduled
days, or current behavior with behavior in less busy times. Is she
crankier, more anxious or more sluggish? (Talking with your child's
teacher about her behavior can give you valuable clues.) Evaluate
each activity to determine whether it is worthy of your child's
time. ``The one question I always ask parents about their child's
activities is: 'Is this really meaningful for your child?''' says
Dr. Vernon. If you feel it is, then it's a keeper. If not, then
seriously consider dropping it from your child's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Parents concerned about providing their kids with learning
experiences outside of structured activities should be reassured by
a recent University of Connecticut study. Ordinary activities
(going to the park, helping to prepare meals) provided the richest
learning environment for children. ``Children learn best by doing
ordinary things, especially those the family values,'' reports lead
researcher Dr. Mary Beth Bruder, director of child and family
studies at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Just stepping out the door can be a learning experience.
``Little kids love to watch things outdoors and play around in the
dirt,'' notes Dr. Mary Rivkin, the Baltimore-based author of ``The
Great Outdoors: Restoring Children's Right to Play Outside.'' Older
kids often enjoy identifying animals and plants. They might find
that they like drawing flowers or starting a collection of rocks or
shells. ``When they do that, they are using their sensory skills to
investigate. They're loading up on direct information about nature
and science they will draw on for a lifetime,'' Dr. Rivkin says.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents create free time for their children by choosing
activities that don't require a lot of time, or that allow
flexibility. Emmi Volosov, 41, a mother of two boys, 5 and 8, in
Morehead City, N.C., cut back on the karate program her older son
attended several times a week. ``He wanted to go more often, and I
let him, but then he got burned out,'' says Volosov. ``Now that he
goes just once a week, he really enjoys it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to scale back your child's commitments, be
prepared for some resistance in the beginning, says Dr. Vernon.
``When children become used to stimulation from a lot of activity,
they may find it hard to keep themselves amused at first,'' notes
Dr. Goodman. You may want to schedule more play dates initially to
show kids that they can still keep up with friends outside of
activities. You can also suggest home-based activities kids may
have forgotten, such as doing crafts and reading.
</P>
<P>
   Kids will eventually find something to do, assures Dr. Vernon.
``The job of children, from preschoolers even up to the middle
school years, is to play,'' she says. ``They don't need lots of
structured activities or TV and videos. When you give kids free
time, they find ways to amuse themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Another smart strategy: Schedule family activity ``dates'' that
carry the same importance as the soccer practice, dance class or
enrichment course that they replace. ``When our kids were younger,
we set a time once a week for an hour or two to do something as a
family,'' says Dr. John Covey, co-creator with brother Stephen
Covey of ``The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Families.'' ``No one
would schedule anything else for that night. We did all sorts of
fun things: played games, took walks. It was one of the most
memorable things we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Set realistic goals to increase family time, Dr. Covey adds.
Many families can't eat together every night, but they can pick a
few nights a week and stick to them. Cutting back on TV, video
games and computer time should also be gradual, and Dr. Covey
encourages families to watch some TV programs together. ``Talking
about the show is fun, and sometimes brings up related topics,'' he
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that children aren't the only ones spreading
themselves too thin. Parents are trying to do too much, too, and
children can suffer when parents get cranky and tired. That was the
biggest concern reported by more than 1,000 kids in ``Ask the
Children: What America's Children Really Think About Working
Parents,'' by Ellen Galinsky, co-founder of the Families and Work
Institute in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, it may be time to rethink your own schedule.
Dr. Vernon advises, ``Apply the 'Is this meaningful?', question to
your own commitments.'' Adds Walton: ``Children are with us such a
short time. We should enjoy as much time with them as we can.''

 By VICKY LOWRY   
 c.2000 New York Times   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ovarian cancer has been nicknamed the silent killer because it
is difficult to detect. When found, it has often spread beyond the
ovaries and is too advanced to cure. Even the symptoms are vague
and easily ignored: Who hasn't felt bloated and tired from time to
time?
</P>
<P>
   But experts in the field say that a new National Cancer
Institute initiative, the Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program,
promises to yield more sensitive, highly specific _ and thus
accurate _ screening tests for ovarian cancer within the next five
years. The program, which brings together 26 comprehensive cancer
centers in the United States and more than 100 scientists
worldwide, is planning to enroll more than 10,000 asymptomatic
women to develop new means for accurately detecting early-stage
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a clear-cut change in priority in the research
community,'' said Dr. Gordon Mills at the University of Texas
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. He is leading research on a new
blood test for ovarian cancer as well as on the underlying causes
of the disease. ``There is a high level of optimism that effective
markers for ovarian cancer will be discovered,'' he said. ``The
opportunities are greater than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   The research money is at an all-time high, too. Financing for
ovarian cancer has risen substantially in the last decade, to $63
million today from under $10 million in 1990, according to the
National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 1 in 55 women will be told she has ovarian cancer.
(It is rarer than breast cancer, in which the lifetime risk is 1 in
8.) That translates into 23,100 newly affected women in the United
States. Thirty percent _ primarily those whose cancer is detected
in its earliest stages, when it has not spread beyond the ovaries _
will survive at least five years following surgery and
chemotherapy. For a majority, however, detection will come too
late, resulting in a death toll of about 14,000 women a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women need to know about the symptoms and inform their
physicians so that at least the possibility of ovarian cancer is on
their radar screen,'' said Patricia Goldman, a seven-year survivor
of the disease and president of the Ovarian Cancer National
Alliance, a group that is trying to raise awareness of the disease.
``Unfortunately, we're accustomed to discomfort below the
bellybutton.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovarian cancer most often strikes postmenopausal women who are
over 50. Women with one or more first-degree relatives _ that is,
mother, sister or aunt _ who have had the disease are at slightly
greater risk. It is equally likely to be transmitted from the
father's side as from the mother's, said Dr. Beth Karlan, the
director of gynecologic oncology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in
Los Angeles. Women with a history of breast cancer are also at
higher risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first step for women is to find out their own family
history and discuss it with their physician,'' Dr. Karlan said. She
recommended that women who are unsure about their families' medical
histories complete the cancer risk assessment survey on the Web
site for the Women's Cancer Network (www.wcn.org), which helps give
women a sense of their own risk for various cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts think that women who take fertility drugs, like
Clomid and Pergonal, which stimulate the ovaries, may be more
susceptible to ovarian cancer, because the more often a woman
ovulates, the more she is at risk for ovarian abnormalities in
general. This may also explain why women who have given birth more
than once, or who use oral contraceptives, are much less likely to
develop the disease. Indeed, some doctors prescribe birth control
pills to high-risk patients as a preventive measure.
</P>
<P>
   Ovarian cancer is difficult to detect early because the ovaries
are located deep within the pelvis: good for protecting eggs, bad
for finding disease. There are some screening tools, but none are
accurate enough to pick up the cancer while it is still confined to
the ovaries and curable.
</P>
<P>
   Transvaginal ultrasound, in which a probe is inserted inside the
vagina to detect ovarian abnormalities, produces too many
false-positive and false-negative readings to become routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before an ovary even looks abnormal on the ultrasound, there
could already be widespread disease,'' Dr. Karlan warned. ``And a
false-positive reading could lead a patient to unnecessary surgery
and removal of the ovaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack van Nagell, who is conducting a study on transvaginal
sonography at the University of Kentucky Medical School, added,
``This test is very effective in identifying ovarian tumors, but
not effective in distinguishing between tumors and ovarian cancer.
More operations doesn't mean better cancer care.''
</P>
<P>
   Another screening tool, the CA125 blood test, measures proteins
in the blood that are often released by cancer cells. But
researchers said that the test misses 50 percent of early cancers.
So far, there is no evidence that either the blood test or the
ultrasound procedure will make a difference in the outcome of the
disease in the general population, which is why routine screening
for ovarian cancer is not yet recommended. For now, women who have
a family history, or who are at increased risk, are the only ones
who should be routinely screened with transvaginal ultrasound and
the CA125 test, according to the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   A more promising blood test is in its final stages of research
and may become available next year. This test detects a tumor
marker called lysophospholipids, whose levels are significantly
elevated in women with even early-stage ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   An ovarian Pap smear may be available in five years, experts
say. Developed by Dr. David Fishman, a gynecologic oncologist at
Northwestern University Medical School and the director of the
Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program, this Pap smear involves
inserting a hollow needle into the abdomen or vagina and collecting
cells from the ovary walls. Scientists can then evaluate the cells
and any gene mutations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman would probably get the test once every 5 to 10 years,
because genes don't change that quickly,'' Dr. Fishman said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If we could detect ovarian cancer while it's still
confined to the ovaries, 90 percent of those women would not only
survive five years, but would require much less radical surgery.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Living and working in Beverly Hills, I've become all too
accustomed to fashionably clad twentysomethings styling down Rodeo
Drive, cell phones pressed firmly to their ears. Arranging a
business meeting? Perhaps. Arranging another ``loan'' from Mom and
Dad? More likely. Not to disparage today's young people, but too
many have come to expect their parents' unequivocal support,
financial and otherwise. Blanket approval and a blank check.
</P>
<P>
   As an investment adviser, I hear parents' incessant lament:
``When will my kids start pulling their own weight? When will they
stop coming to me with their hands out?'' The answer is as simple
as it is difficult to employ. Kids do what we teach them to do;
when we start saying no, they'll learn to take no for an answer _
perhaps not immediately, but eventually.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation, of course, is to continue supporting them in the
style in which they were raised. Why make them wait to inherit,
after all, when helping them now would make their lives so much
easier _ and allow us to forgo the discomfort (and, perhaps, guilt)
of seeing them live less comfortably than we would like? The pretty
paradox, though, is that coming to their financial rescue before
they have had a chance to test their own mettle may lead our
children to believe that they can't succeed without our help. This
is particularly true for those who have recently left the nest. A
small allowance or monthly stipend may offer an appropriate helping
hand, but too much might well be interpreted as an implied vote of
no confidence.
</P>
<P>
   A better approach would be to treat our children as the
responsible young adults they are _ or should be. Establish, or
reestablish, firm ground rules and expectations. In our family, for
example, college tuition is paid in full by Mom and Dad, but after
graduation our children are expected to work for a living and pay
their own way. We're here for them in case they need a hand, but
not if they want a handout.
</P>
<P>
   More important than the actual dollars, of course, is the
attitude and belief system that we parents adhere to in educating
our children financially. If we convey a sense of willingness to
help but an unwillingness to play Daddy Warbucks ad infinitum,
they'll get that message. A client once complained that her
32-year-old son thought nothing of asking her for several thousand
dollars every month. Born and bred in the lap of Bel Air luxury, he
considered it his due; I considered it chutzpa par excellence! When
I suggested that she institute a ``no more money from Mom'' policy,
she was appalled. As unhappy as she was with the situation, my
client was unwilling to change, so he didn't have to. She stayed
angry; he stayed dependent and irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to imply that parents should throw their kids out
there without a net. When your children were growing up, you taught
them the rudiments of money management _ how to balance a
checkbook, how to use a credit card judiciously. Now that they're
on their own, help them formulate a reasonable budget and stick to
it. Discuss what monthly expenses may total and suggest ways to cut
back if their income doesn't match their outgo.
</P>
<P>
   In some situations parental assistance may be a necessity _ for
example, few young people can afford their first apartments without
at least some help from their families. But if you lend a hand, be
sure to stipulate in advance how much and for how long. As a
financial professional and a parent, I am disinclined to supplement
my children's income unless they demonstrate a sincere and
quantifiable commitment to economizing (Show me the numbers!). If
they are truly budgeting intelligently, but their salaries still
prove insufficient, I would agree to help _ modestly and for a
finite period. The issue, of course, is one of proportion and
perspective _ as it is in all aspects of life. And teaching our
children well in this regard is truly a gift that keeps on giving.

 (ART ADV: Photo of Kelly Preston is available on Newscom or by
calling William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.) 
 By DEBRA BIRNBAUM  
 c. 2000 Hearst Communications Inc.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first thing I notice is her breasts. The otherwise petite
blonde answers the door at her unassuming ranch-style house near
Honolulu nursing a newborn. It isn't until she shifts her balance
and shakes her long curly hair from her face that I recognize those
clear blue eyes and realize who's standing before me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to answer the door breast-feeding,'' says
Kelly Preston, laughing as she ushers me inside.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't expect her to either.
</P>
<P>
   Preston has invited me to spend a day with her at home in
Hawaii, one of three she owns with husband John Travolta, 46. I
expected to find a pampered, self-involved starlet vacationing with
an army of servants. The little I knew of her _ her marriage to a
megastar, a few notable roles opposite some marquee names, such as
Kevin Costner and Tom Cruise, did nothing to dispel that image.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here she is, answering her own front door in flip-flops,
denim shorts, a bikini top and no makeup. I have to admire a
37-year-old woman who, 10 weeks after giving birth to Ella Bleu,
not only agrees to pose naked with her baby for a photo shoot but
is confident enough to greet me in the middle of her daughter's
mealtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Preston-Travolta house is remarkably unostentatious. True,
the patio leads right to the Pacific Ocean's deep blue waters, and
there is that skylight-lit indoor pool. But the comfy, casual decor
is more beach house than celebrity manse.
</P>
<P>
   I sneak a peek at the countless framed photographs that fill the
place. Our day's adventures will take us away from her baby for
several hours, but she talks constantly about Ella and 8-year-old
Jett.
</P>
<P>
   Ella has Preston's blue eyes, but her shock of black hair is
clearly her father's, as are her ``big delicious lips.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a Mini-Me of Johnny,'' Preston says, referring to the
character from the Austin Powers sequel. ``He was holding her the
other day, and he did the Mini-Me dance with her. She was even
doing the same sneer that he was. It was hilarious!''
</P>
<P>
   Then, abruptly, she says, ``We did it at home, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It?'' Then ``it'' hits me: ``You had a home birth?'' I
venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievably beautiful,'' she says. ``We did it for the
closeness of it _ and for the simplicity.'' A Scientologist,
Preston believes in ``quiet birth,'' an approach that requires
silence _ no music, no talking during labor and delivery. After
giving birth to Jett in a hospital, she and Travolta decided a
quiet birth would be even better at home.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been wondering how to bring up her involvement in the
controversial church, but she's wholly unguarded as she launches
into her defense of the practice. ``We're always recording,'' she
explains passionately. ``You know everything that's going on right
now, although you're not aware of it. So it's just a peaceful,
beautiful entry into this earth.'' So, surrounded by her ob/gyn,
her midwife, an osteopath, a couple of her closest friends and
Travolta, Preston gave birth to Ella in what would become the
baby's own bedroom in their Los Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   Preston was just 16 and living in Australia when she saw a
poster for ``Grease'' and had a flash of foresight: She just knew
she would one day be with the movie's star, the young John
Travolta. At that point, however, she was thousands of miles from
California, and she'd set her sights on a career in advertising.
But when the family moved back to Hawaii after two years, the
would-be advertising executive, whose only acting experience was a
few Japanese commercials, flew to Hollywood for her first screen
test. Years later, she auditioned for a role in ``The Experts,''
opposite Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw John,'' she says, ``I was sitting in the
reception area waiting for my screen test. He was so devastatingly
handsome. I thought, 'Thank God I'm meeting him out here, because I
would be speechless in there.''' Preston got the job.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a glitch: Preston was married to actor Kevin Gage,
though they were on the road to divorce. ``I would come to work
sobbing,'' she recalls, ``and Johnny would give me these 'body
assists''' _ Scientology-speak for a kind of touch therapy _ ``and
I would go from sobbing to completely giggling. I just thought, 'I
would like life to be like this. I want to giggle and laugh and
play and love every aspect of life, because I used to be that
way.''' Preston, who'd found Scientology years earlier through an
acting class, was delighted to discover that Travolta was also a
devotee.
</P>
<P>
   Once the film wrapped, though, they drifted apart. Three years
passed before they were reunited in Vancouver _ both now
unattached. Kirstie Alley invited them to dinner and, playing
matchmaker, seated them next to each other. By the end of the
night, Preston and Travolta had decided to date. Seven months
later, on New Year's Eve in Gstaad, Switzerland, at the stroke of
midnight, Travolta proposed before a group of friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   This month they celebrate their ninth anniversary _ a
near-record for Hollywood. ``There are hard times,'' she admits,
``but they are few and far between. We almost never fight because
we know what pushes each other's buttons, and we have made an
agreement not to push them.''
</P>
<P>
   She's the rule maker in the marriage, that's for certain.
``Without a doubt, my husband is the biggest pushover that God put
on this earth,'' she laughs. ``He will let Jett stay up all night.
I once caught them on the trampoline at 1:30 in the morning. He
told me he was putting him to sleep, then I hear these shrieks of
giggles from the backyard. When Jett was little, I caught them on
the floor in the pantry throwing rice up in the air because it felt
like snow. I said, 'This is all very cool, but Mom is not cleaning
this up.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so different when you have kids,'' she says. ``The
greatest moment in my life was right after Ella was born. I was
sleeping in her room with her _ eventually, we'll sleep with Dad,
but first we have to work it out so he doesn't roll over on her.
Anyway, I was lying there; I had nursed her, and she had just
fallen asleep. Jett crawled into bed with me, and I was stroking
him until he fell asleep, too. Right then I realized I had my two
babies. It was the most magical moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Preston and Travolta divide their time among homes in
Hawaii, Los Angeles and Maine, Preston clearly cherishes any time
she can spend in her hometown. ``It feeds me,'' she says simply of
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   And she's not just talking spiritual hunger: Before the hike we
stop at Leonard's, ``the greatest bakery on the island,'' for
malasadas _ the Portuguese doughnuts she calls ``the most insane
thing you've ever had in your whole life.'' I watch in amazement as
she licks the sugar off her fingers, then rummages in the box for
loose crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Our hour-long trek takes us along the side of a mountain,
through lush vegetation, past bamboo trees, to a breathtaking
waterfall. With the exception of a couple of passersby who elbow
each other and wonder aloud, ``Is that Kelly Preston?'' she goes
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   On our way down the trail, a teenager is brazen enough to
approach us: ``Are you a movie star?'' she asks, then collapses
into giggles and runs downhill with her boyfriend in tow.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fair question. Preston's scene-stealing turn as Tom
Cruise's fiancee in ``Jerry Maguire'' earned her critical praise,
and her role as a lesbian pro-choice activist in ``Citizen Ruth''
won her fame among the indie crowd. But that's a far cry from the
A-list stardom her husband enjoys (``Battlefield Earth''
notwithstanding).
</P>
<P>
   Is she just along for the ride? She insists not. After all, she
married Travolta three years before his ``Pulp Fiction'' comeback,
when he was still mired in ``Look Who's Talking'' sequels. ``I fell
in love with the man, not the career,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As for her own career, she's determinedly laid-back. ``I decided
a long time ago that life is too short, that I only want to work
with people I really want to work with,'' she says. ``I don't want
to leave my kids for even a minute to work on something that I am
not excited about, or to work with somebody who is a screamer, a
yeller, who makes everybody unhappy. Right now, I'm just trying to
open a script. It's hard,'' and now she's joking again. ``There are
malasadas to eat, waterfalls to climb.''

<P>
   It's not Ali-Frazier, Yankees-Red Sox or John Rocker-Mets fans.
Not yet, anyway. But the words are already flying in what could be
the best Olympic big-country rivalry since the breakup of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Outspoken U.S. swimmer Gary Hall hadn't even boarded the plane
to Sydney when he trashed Australian swimmers, boasting the United
States ``would smash them like guitars'' once the Olympics commence
this week in Sydney. So much for diplomacy. Australia adores its
swimmers like rock stars, and from across the Pacific, two-time
1,500-meter gold medalist Kieran Perkins answered with a harsh,
personal slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take a lot of notice of drug cheats,'' said Perkins,
referring to Hall's two positive marijuana tests, the second
earning Hall a three-month suspension in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This followed Australian long jumper Jai Taurima's startling
assertion that America's ``dark athletes'' don't jump well in cold
weather, which Savante Stringfellow said inspired him to beat
Taurima at a pre-Olympic meet in Brisbane last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Red Menace is no more. But the country that gave the
world Olivia Newton-John, Rod Laver and ``Waltzing Matilda'' offers
the biggest challenge to the United States in this XXVII Olympiad,
boosted by the home-country advantage the United States enjoyed
four years ago in Atlanta. Opening ceremonies are Friday, but play
begins in soccer Wednesday (men) and Thursday (women).
</P>
<P>
   From swimming to softball, Australians are good in many
traditionally strong U.S. events. The depth isn't there, especially
in track and field, but the top-end quality is. The United States
should still win more medals, though it won't be like Atlanta, when
its 44 more than quadrupled Australia's nine.
</P>
<P>
   And though Australia embraced the world at the 1956 Games in
Melbourne, U.S. athletes and coaches aren't expecting similar
warmth this time. Take softball, where Australia has been trying to
knock off the United States for years. ``Hopefully, things won't be
thrown from the stands at us,'' said pitcher Michele Smith.
</P>
<P>
   That rivalry goes back to 1996, when Australia handed the United
States its only loss in Atlanta because Dani Tyler missed the plate
on a home run. Two years ago the United States bested Australia for
the world championship, and the United States is 5-0 against them
since Dot Richardson rejoined the team last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we've played them since '96, it's been a battle,''
said Smith, who joked she might do the Bobby Bonilla thing and wear
earplugs to block out the crowd. ``They don't like us a whole lot.
We don't like them a whole lot. That's what is going to make it so
great and so exciting. And the fact it's going to be in their home
country is going to make it bigger and better.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time those teams meet Sept. 21, the Aussie-American thing
should be rolling. The first medals are awarded Saturday in women's
triathlon, and Australia could sweep with world champion Nicole
Hackett and top-ranked Michellie Jones and Loretta Harrop. Imagine
the party if that happens. ``I really want to head-start the
Australian team,'' Harrop said.
</P>
<P>
   That night, at the 17,000-seat Aquatic Center, 17-year-old
Aussie sensation Ian Thorpe is heavily favored in the 400
freestyle, where he holds one of his 10 world records. The United
States has no one in Thorpe's class.
</P>
<P>
   And the women's 4 x 100 relay with '96 200 butterfly gold
medalist Susie O'Neill should challenge a veteran U.S. group with
former gold medalists Jenny Thompson, Dara Torres and Amy Van
Dyken. The United States barely beat the Aussies for the team title
in last year's Pan Pacific Championships, and U.S. Women's Coach
Richard Quick knows the Americans had better tune out the
pro-Aussie crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a little bit of an adjustment, but a
powerful adjustment,'' said Quick, who coaches Thompson and Torres
at Stanford Swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's taking on the atmosphere of a United States vs.
Australia dual meet. Their goal is obviously to win as many gold
medals as they can. Our goal is to defend our position as the best
swimming country in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the host country twice earned Australia generous
tournament seedings. In women's soccer, the world's top teams _ the
United States, Norway and China _ were bunched in the opposite side
of the draw from Australia. And Australian beach volleyball pairs
Lee Zahner/Julien Prosser and Natalie Cook/Kerri Potthurst drew top
men's and women's seeds ahead of Brazilian and American teams with
higher world rankings, easing their paths to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Australia should win women's field hockey gold; the
United States didn't qualify. In track the United States has no
answer for women's world 400 champion Cathy Freeman, an Aborigine
and one of the country's biggest sports heroes. Australia's Emma
George faces Stacy Dragila, who broke her world record, in the
first Olympic women's pole vault.
</P>
<P>
   In women's basketball, and to a lesser extent men's rowing
eights, Australia presents enough problems to the favored United
States to make home crowds a factor. ``When we go to Australia,
they're going to want to rip us (apart) and send us home,'' said
U.S. basketball player DeLisha Milton. ``Our goal is to win.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   But to Smith, everything comes down to softball. In their last
two championship meetings, in 1998, Lisa Fernandez beat the Aussies
in the South Pacific Classic (perfect game) and the world
championships (one-hit shutout plus a home run). Incentive? The
Aussies have plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their whole country is going to be behind that team,'' Smith
said. ``They have a lot of good chances for medals, but I think
even more so, this is the sport they want to come home with that
gold medal. And we're going to be there making sure it doesn't
happen.''

 &HT;    GORE PROMOTES FAMILY POLICIES IN 'OPRAH' APPEARANCE
 &HT;    430&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore used an appearance on the
Oprah Winfrey television show Monday to promote his family-friendly
politics, scold the entertainment industry, and try to sustain his
surging popularity among women voters.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president left the talk show diva with at least one
complaint, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``No kiss? I was hoping for something,'' she said after Gore
greeted her Monday with a handshake and one-armed hug. She was
alluding to the lingering kiss Gore gave his wife, Tipper, on the
night he accepted the Democratic presidential nomination last
month.
</P>
<P>
   But after an hour of talk, which wandered from tax policy to
Winfrey's ruby-red stiletto boots, Winfrey marveled that Gore, long
known for his stiff public demeanor, was a ``fun, funny guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard to believe, isn't it?'' Gore quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Gore often tried to steer the conversation into policy areas.
But just as often, Winfrey steered the talk into more entertaining
areas, asking the vice president provocative questions that
occasionally led to titters from the mostly female studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during a portion in which Winfrey quizzed Gore
about his favorite things, she asked him about his favorite thing
to sleep in, a question stemming from his wife's disclosure that he
sleeps in the nude.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bed,'' Gore replied. ``You get the picture?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore appeared a bit flirtatious when he complimented Winfrey on
her spike-heeled boots. ``Aren't they great?'' he prompted the
audience before high-fiving Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared to charm the audience with his earnest discussion of
his marriage and family. He called Tipper his ``soul mate'' and
declared ``family is first,'' even amid the demands of a
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The two former Nashville journalists briefly reminisced about
their early careers and having crossed paths on assignments
occasionally, although Winfrey expressed some skepticism: ``Do you
really remember that, or did you just research that?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance on the season premiere of the hourlong Winfrey
show _ which has an audience of 22 million, mostly women _ reflects
a campaign strategy to solidify their support for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, he barely led his Republican rival, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, among women voters. But polls since the
Democratic convention in mid-August have suggested that Gore's lead
among women has grown to double digits.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey, who has given $12,000 to Democrats since 1992, has Bush
scheduled for an appearance on her program next week.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance coincided with the release of a Federal Trade
Commission report that concludes that more needs to be done to
shield youngsters from violent and adult entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose wife led the campaign for parental guidance labels
in the recording industry more than a decade ago, embraced the
report's findings and called on the entertainment industry to stop
marketing such material to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are calling for in this case is industry
self-restraint and self-regulation, not censorship,'' the vice
president said in a statement. ``It's about parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Florida, said the vice president has no
credibility on the issue because President Clinton and Gore had
raised millions in campaign funds from the entertainment industry.
Bush said Gore is ``changing his tune'' about the industry now that
the election is approaching.
</P>
<P>
   On the Winfrey program, Gore recalled how Tipper had persuaded
the recording industry to place warning labels on their products.
And when he tried to work the FTC report into remarks about
``inappropriate albums'' being marketed to children, Winfrey
stopped him cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're called CDs now,'' she said. ``They've been CDs for a
long time.''

EFFORTS TO TEST DRUGS ON CHILDREN HASTEN DRIVE FOR RESEARCH
GUIDELINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Md., Conn., N.H., Utah, Mass., Fla., Va.)  By ALEXIS JETTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
  WASHINGTON _ Researchers give a 6-year-old girl who suffers from
asthma attacks a promising new drug in addition to her old
medicine, then withdraw  to see how she will do without it. A
depressed teen-ager enrolls in a study for an antidepressant, but
does not know if he will get a sugar pill or the real thing. The
parents of an epileptic youngster enroll her in a test of a new
drug that has worked well in adults. But no one knows whether she
will get the new medication, or the one that has worked only
moderately well for her in the past.
<TEXT>
<P>
   These quandaries, all based on actual experiences, are likely to
be faced by an increasing number of parents, children and medical
researchers around the country as the federal government steps up
its efforts to test drugs on children.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, largely because of financial
incentives that Congress has given pharmaceutical companies,
pediatric studies of new drugs have boomed. In December, the Food
and Drug Administration will begin mandating that such tests be
done on certain drugs, and the agency is concerned that researchers
protect child participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``What level of discomfort or risk should a child in a study be
exposed to?'' asked Dr. Steven Hirschfeld, a medical officer at the
FDA's Center for Drug Research and Evaluation. ``If a child gets an
asthma attack and starts to wheeze, are people willing to tolerate
that to get complete information about a potentially helpful drug
for children?''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, an FDA advisory panel met in Bethesda, Md., to begin
discussions aimed at setting the first guidelines for researchers
regarding the controversial use of placebos in children. Placebos,
commonly used in drug trials, are sugar pills, injections or other
treatments that resemble the drug that is being tested without
having any of the same effects.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld said that the particular vulnerability of children
often makes placebo controls necessary. ``Children are not only
very susceptible to their own expectations,'' he said in an
interview. ``They are very susceptible to their parents'
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   But a panelist, Dr. Charles Weijer, a bioethicist and an
assistant professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax,
Nova Scotia, said it was wrong to submit children to risks while
providing them no immediate benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``An investigator's chief concern ought to be the health and
well-being of her patients,'' Weijer said at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   And he also challenged the scientific value of placebos. ``The
unethical use of placebo controls in clinical trials is the most
widespread problem in medical research today,'' Weijer said in a
telephone interview. The view that placebos provide scientific
information that cannot be obtained in other ways ``is pure
fantasy,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Weijer said new drugs should not be compared with placebos, but
with drugs already used to treat the condition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The panel of 27 researchers that met Monday included several
researchers from Europe who are working on international standards
for clinical trials in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you people decide will affect directly not only children
in the U.S., but children in Europe and the world at large,'' said
Francis Crawley, chairman of a group working to set standards in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Murphy, the associate director for pediatrics at the
FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said that use of
placebos can reduce the number of children needed in a study and
can ensure the most conclusive outcome. ``If you need a placebo
trial to get an answer, and you don't do it, then you've wasted
that child's blood, time and possible chance, in a trial that won't
give them an answer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers agree on two points: Where there is no effective
treatment, placebos may be appropriate. Where there is an
established effective treatment for a life-threatening disease,
neither children nor adults should be denied that treatment while
testing a drug. That means all study participants are given the
best current medicine. Then, half are given the new drug as well,
while the other half are given the placebo in what is called an
``add-on placebo trial.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts disagree on the ethics of withholding effective
treatment from children when studying nonfatal conditions such as
allergies or skin rashes. And there is no consensus for how to
treat children with other serious ailments, such as depression,
where the best treatment is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   That is an issue that researchers in the field face everyday.
``There is still not an established standard of care for the
treatment of child depression,'' said Dr. Craig Donnelly, an
assistant professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Dartmouth
Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H., who was not at the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly is now engaged in a large study of child depression, in
which five antidepressants, previously tested on adults only, are
being tested on children. Half will receive the drugs and half
placebos. All have been taken off their current medicine and are
prohibited from receiving therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But they have weekly meetings with a psychiatrist, and if they
become suicidal or exhibit serious symptoms, they are removed from
the study.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fear about abusing children as research subjects is
rooted in grim experiments of the past. The Nuremberg Code, which
sets global standards for research on humans, grew out of the
world's moral revulsion against Nazi experiments on concentration
camp prisoners, including many children. In the 1960s, the creator
of the first effective vaccine against hepatitis B injected
hepatitis-infected blood products into children, many of them
mentally handicapped, at the Willowbrook State School for the
Retarded in Staten Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, the prevailing ethical view was that research
is dangerous and people have to be protected from it,'' said Dr.
David Wendler, a philosopher and bioethicist who directs the Unit
on Vulnerable Populations at the National Institutes of Health.
``People were worried about exposing kids to potential risks. Now a
lot of concern focuses on the placebo group, because they may be
denied possible beneficial treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the big worry, particularly for little kids,'' is informed
consent, said Wendler.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, children under 7 are guided by their parents'
decision about whether they should participate in a clinical trial.
Children 7 to 14 can be asked for their ``assent,'' rather than
informed consent, along with their parents, while teen-agers 14 and
older can weigh the possible risks and benefits and make up their
own minds nearly as well as any adult, Wendler said. &UR;  &LR;  Kelson
Pediatric Partners, based in Hartford, Conn., is one of a growing
number of companies engaged in the new effort to test children.
Kelson, the country's leading pediatric-practice management
company, advertises on its Web site that it can provide drug
researchers access to ``pediatric practices seeing over 1.5 million
patient visits per year.'' The company's research sites in
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Virginia, Florida and Utah
have enrolled over 2,400 of their patients in 40 trials of
vaccines, allergy drugs, analgesics, antibiotics and asthma
treatments.

&HT;     OLYMPICS COMMITTEE SUES OVER MAGAZINE NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The U.S. Olympic Committee, which carefully
guards its rights to the words and symbols associated with the
Olympic Games, has a new complaint: an ``Olympics USA'' magazine
sold by the publisher of the National Enquirer, and filled with
references to Olympic events, athletes and medals.
</P>
<P>
   The publication violates a federal law granting the USOC ``the
exclusive right to use Olympic terminology and symbols,'' the
committee said in a lawsuit filed in federal court in San
Francisco, a week before the opening of the Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks a court order halting distribution of the
magazine and damages for trademark infringement. No hearing has
been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC used the same law to stop a San Francisco organization
from calling its athletic competition the Gay Olympics, a case that
reached the Supreme Court in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But American Media Inc. of Lantana, Fla., which also publishes
the Globe and Star tabloids, said the committee was going too far
by trying to limit what news media could say about the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The law may give the USOC the right to control commercial and
promotional uses of Olympic names and symbols, but ``does not and
could not give (the USOC) the right to prevent editorial coverage
of the Olympics,'' Roger Myers, a lawyer for American Media Inc.,
said in court papers filed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The committee ``does not own the Olympic athletes, the locations
of sporting events in which they participate or the various sports
that comprise the Olympic competition, and it cannot control
reporting about them,'' Myers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, a monthly publication called ``AMI Specials,''
contains 76 pages of articles and pictures of U.S. Olympic athletes
and their sports. It has ads, but none for products bearing Olympic
names or symbols. It also has a disclaimer saying the publisher and
magazine have no connection with the Olympics, the USOC or any
other official body.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic committee's lawsuit said the disclaimer was too
small to be effective and, in any event, could not excuse the
publisher's failure to seek its consent for use of Olympic words
and symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher ``misappropriated'' the USOC's rights and created
the false impression that the magazine was approved by the
committee, wrote USOC lawyer Jeffrey Benz.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said any law allowing the USOC to control written
descriptions of the Olympics would be unconstitutional.

 &HT;    CONTROVERSIAL BILL REGULATING PAIN MEDICATION HEADED FOR SENATE
 &HT;    By ANGEL WILSON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bill designed to discourage physician-assisted
suicide may meet strong opposition when it goes to the Senate next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, called the Pain Relief Promotion Act, would impose
criminal penalties if the Drug Enforcement Administration
determines that controlled substances such as morphine were used to
intentionally hasten death.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the bill worry that the DEA would have the power to
prosecute physicians who prescribe potentially lethal medications
in the usual course of their medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argue that the bill clearly defines the difference
between using medication to ease pain and using medication to
deliberately kill, and imposes a federal prohibition on
physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was sponsored in the Senate by Republican Whip Don
Nickles of Oklahoma and Democratic vice presidential nominee Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut and has the support of the American
Medical Association. The bill passed the House by a vote of 271-156
last October. President Clinton has expressed concerns about it,
but has not threatened a veto.
</P>
<P>
   John Guest, executive director of the American Pain Foundation,
an independent organization which lobbies for effective pain
management, said the bill would reduce a patient's right to
effective treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system already chills effective use of pain medications.
This would expand the DEA's role from fighting illegal drug
trafficking to regulating the practice of medicine,'' Guest said at
a news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge that Congress instead develop and pass legislation
that addresses the real problems in our health care system that
block access to high quality pain and symptom management and
palliative care.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Walter Hunter, a member of the Americans for Integrity in
Palliative Care, an umbrella group for organizations that support
the bill, said opponents do not understand its purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a hospice physician, this bill will not alter one iota what
I do,'' he said, arguing that the DEA would not be given any
additional authority in reference to assisted suicide
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very good legislation. It says very clearly that
the U.S. government recognizes the importance of pain relief.''
</P>
<P>
   If adopted, the bill would largely overturn a 1997 Oregon law
that allows doctors to prescribe lethal dose of pain medications,
but not administer them.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Hamilton, president of the Physicians for Compassionate
Care, said many assisted suicide cases in Oregon have involved
federally controlled substances. The bill would end that, he said.

and Suites is a dizzying blur of activity _ hand- and crane-held
cameras and microphones swirl about, people in matching purple
T-shirts hustle from one room to another, women of all ages and
races chatter, compare outfits and pose for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scene Dallas has seen before: A TV network _ in this
case, the WB _ is holding auditions for a new series, and about a
hundred young women have gathered to try out for it.
</P>
<P>
   What seems a little odd, though, is the number of police
officers swarming around. When a member of the WB army _
distinguishable by a purple T-shirt with the name of the series,
``Popstars,'' emblazoned on it _ is asked why so many cops are
here, she says, refusing to give her name, ``in case something
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Like what?
</P>
<P>
   Before she can answer, she is responding to someone else on her
walkie-talkie and quickly scurries away.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all.
</P>
<P>
   Upon entering the audition room, members of the press are asked
to sign confidentiality agreements, promising not to reveal certain
details of the show. The photographers and writers make the show's
publicist visibly antsy _ staring eyes, sweating brow _ when they
start shooting photos or scribbling notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think this was NASA,'' a fellow reporter whispers.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the hush-hush world of reality-TV auditions, a place
where hopeful actors and actresses are known by numbers, not names;
confidentiality agreements must be signed by all those involved;
and every episode is safe-guarded with Cold War-like intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Following the reality-TV formula, such secrecy is only for the
show, not the hundred or so young women who've gathered for their
shot at TV fame. Just like on the wildy popular ``Survivor'' and
its successor ``Big Brother,'' abandoning your privacy is a
prerequisite for auditioning for ``Popstars.''
</P>
<P>
   The show traces the cutthroat formation of a singing/dancing
girl group, a la Spice Girls, pieced together by three
music-industry people who will handpick the five members through
auditions such as this one. Similar auditions have already happened
in Atlanta, Miami and Chicago. After Dallas, the entourage travels
to New York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The first few episodes of ``Popstars'' will feature scenes from
these auditions, which explains why the hotel lobby of the Hampton
Inn in Mesquite is bustling with so many cameras. Every audition is
taped. Some girls will have camera crews follow them around after
the audition. Even the girls who do not make the final cut, they
are told, may appear on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Which means Raegan Payne might just get some screen time after
all.
</P>
<P>
   A seemingly likely candidate to make the final cut, Payne is a
model-gorgeous 22-year-old from Dallas whose audition was one of
the day's most impressive. She's got the look _ slim and trim, with
blond, curly hair showering across her shoulders _ and a strong
voice. But after her audition, which consisted of her singing a few
lines of Christina Aguilera's ``What a Girl Wants,'' she's given a
thumbs-down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want me back,'' says Payne, plopped in a chair in
the hotel's lobby. ``I don't have the right look. It could be that
I'm too old. Who knows? They know what they're looking for and if
you're not that, you can't do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes were higher for 18-year-old Dawntoya Pettie, an
18-year-old student at Richland Community College in Dallas. After
her performance, the trio of judges asked her to come back the next
day for another audition.
</P>
<P>
   Pettie says the WB people were talking her up so much, it looked
pretty promising that she would at least be one of the 25 selected
from around the country for the final-five showdown.
</P>
<P>
   That thought seemed even more likely when she was selected by
the WB to be the one and only contestant in Dallas to have a camera
crew follow her every move on Day 2 of the auditioning process.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 a.m. the second day, the crew was at her door, filming her
in her pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They watched me pick out the clothes I was gonna wear and
everything,'' Pettie says. ``They interviewed me, my mom, and they
drove to the hotel with us. It was a lot of pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Much to her dismay, though, Pettie didn't survive Round 2. ``I
don't know what the deal was,'' she says. ``This was the closest
I'd gotten to make my dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry folks in charge of the show, of course, are keeping
the who's-in results under lock and key. Even those who've made it
to the last round won't be told until after the final audition in
Los Angeles on Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing's for sure, it will take a strong person to do
this,'' says Kelli, a 20-year-old redhead from Dallas who asked
that her last name not be used, perhaps because she's embarrassed
that she, too, was not invited back. ``Cameras following you around
every day, taping everything you do, every conversation you have,
I'm not sure if I could have handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   She sure tried, though.
</P>
<P>
   Kelli says she practiced singing for days; she says she even put
her smoking habit on hold in hopes it would help her voice sound
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Now smoking outside the hotel, Kelli blames her failure on
nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally nervous, and that fouled me up,'' she says,
blowing smoke into the morning air. ``But I'm not really sure I'd
wanna be a part of a girl group. They seem too temporary. But it
would have been cool anyway. Like I'd say, `No, thanks.'''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiments of Kelli and Pettie are echoed throughout the
day. The few who are chosen for callbacks are elated; the ones who
are not chalk it up as experience, dismiss it with a ``they don't
know what they're missing'' or _ and this is certainly no secret _
see it for what it's worth: two fleeting fads rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, getting picked would be a setback,'' says Pettie.
``Because no matter what, people would always look at you as
someone who was on a reality show and in a girl group. I don't know
how far that would have taken me.''

CAN ROBOTS RULE THE WORLD? NOT YET 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., Okla., Mass., Pa.)  By KENNETH CHANG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bees do it. Birds do it. Bacteria do it.
</P>
<P>
   But robots cannot do it. They cannot reproduce themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason robotics researchers do not believe that
robots will displace humans any time soon. Last month organizers of
the Humanoids 2000 conference surveyed some of the participants
about possible social implications of their work. On a scale of 0,
for highly unlikely, to 5, for highly likely, the robotics
researchers rated the possibility that robots ``will be the next
step in the evolution and will eventually displace human beings'' a
zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are much less euphoric than other people, say, movie
producers,'' said Dr. Alois Knoll of the University of Bielefeld in
Germany, one of the organizers of the conference, which featured
reports on research to create humanoid robots.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted before the announcement by Brandeis
University researchers that they had built a robotic system that
designs and builds other robots. But at the conference, held last
week at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, most
participants said robots capable of challenging humanity, as in the
movie ``Terminator,'' remained in the realm of science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Knoll listed the limitations of present-day robots: ``We don't
have the mechanical dexterity. We don't have the power supply. We
don't have the brains. We don't have the emotions. We don't have
the autonomy in general to undertake these things to even come
close to humans.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, even if intelligent, conniving robots did exist and
wanted to take over the world, they would have to act fast: Most
exhaust their batteries in less than half an hour. ``It's the same
problem as electric cars,'' Knoll said.
</P>
<P>
   But the most difficult obstacle to building an intelligent,
evolving, self-reproducing robot may turn out to be the
self-reproducing part.
</P>
<P>
   The Brandeis system's ability to design and build robots with
little help from humans help set off speculation about
self-reproducing, evolving robots that could explore the galaxy _
or push humans to extinction. Even the Brandeis researchers call
that far-fetched. ``We're so far from that, it's kind of a silly
question,'' said one of them, Dr. Jordan B. Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   The machines created at Brandeis were little more than toys, far
less complex than the system that designed and built them.
</P>
<P>
   In the biological world, reproduction is a mundane ability
mastered by every creature from the smallest microbe to the largest
whale.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have made self-reproducing, evolving organisms of
their own _ but only within a computer. In 1994, Karl Sims, who was
then a research scientist at Thinking Machines, populated a
simulated world with animated, evolving creatures. Other
researchers, like Dr. Christoph Adami, a research fellow at the
California Institute of Technology, and Dr. Thomas S. Ray Jr. of
the University of Oklahoma have created self-replicating computer
programs that mutate in ways similar to actual organisms like
bacteria, fungi and fruit flies.
</P>
<P>
   To give machines the ability to reproduce, however, strikes most
robotics researchers as an almost impossible task, even more
difficult than building an intelligent robot.
</P>
<P>
   Like other robotics researchers, Dr. Rodney Brooks, director of
the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, predicts the development of robots that
assemble themselves, so to speak, out of ready-made parts. But to
build a copy of itself, a robot would have to forage for raw
materials, shape them into motors, sensors, computer chips and
other parts and then put the pieces together.
</P>
<P>
   Just making computer chips _ currently manufactured in
sophisticated factories that cost up to a billion dollars to build
_ would be a daunting task for a robot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-replicating robots would have to possess all that ability
in a few cubic feet,'' Brooks said. ``I don't see it on the horizon
in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Joy, chief scientist of Sun Microsystems, writing in an
article in the April issue of Wired magazine, expressed his concern
that self-reproducing robots could displace biological life, and he
suggested that scientists ought to avoid developing some
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack disagreed. ``I think it's kind of being used as a
bogeyman,'' he said. ``The question is, will it get out of control?
It would take a large industrial, warlike scenario for someone to
build a doomsday robot. I don't think anyone knows how to do that.
Could robots themselves figure out how to become a doomsday robot?
And the answer is, it's as far off as a fax machine is from a Star
Trek transporter.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the optimistic dissenter. Dr. Hans P. Moravec, a
principal research scientist at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie
Mellon University, sees robots as the future _ and welcomes them.
He notes that the processing power of computer chips doubles every
year to 18 months. ``By 2040,'' said Moravec, ``the robots will be
as smart as we are.'' By then robots should be skilled enough to
design and build automated factories that manufacture improved
versions of themselves, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business competition will ensure that robots take over human
jobs until 100 percent of industry is automated, from top to
bottom,'' Moravec said. ``I think we can retire comfortably.''
</P>
<P>
   The last significant act of humans, he said, would be the
passing of laws to ensure that robot-run companies acted in the
interest of humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about this for 40 years, and I've become
very comfortable with this,'' Moravec said. ``As you think about
these ideas, they gradually become less and less strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Moravec said he would not be disturbed even if intelligent
robots eventually displaced humanity. ``These things are all our
descendants,'' he said. ``We built them. They were initially, more
or less, in our image. The robots are us. The biology is no longer
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank J. Tipler, a professor of mathematical physics at
Tulane University, also believes that robots are the future of
life, and he argues that the lack of robotic spacecraft zipping
past Earth means there are not any other intelligent species in the
galaxy. ``Not only is there no intelligent life in the galaxy,''
Tipler said, ``there isn't intelligent life within an order of a
billion light-years.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-replicating robots, Tipler argues, would also be an
efficient way to explore the galaxy. Several spacecraft could be
sent from Earth to scout nearby stars. After transmitting reports
about what they found, the spacecraft would then set up factories
to build more spacecraft to head for the next nearest stars.
</P>
<P>
   Even if each probe traveled at a speed of only a tenth of the
speed of light, the ever expanding fleet would would be able to
visit every star in the galaxy within 10 million years, less than
1/1,000th of the age of the galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such visions still seem far off for most researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never say never,'' Knoll said. ``But the likelihood of
these things happening in our lifetime is very little.'' He
estimated that 90 percent of the Humanoid 2000 participants do not
believe Moravec's predictions.
</P>
<P>
   The pessimism may reflect the many obstacles that researchers
face in creating useful robots, much less ones that would displace
humanity. Two-legged humanoid robots walk slowly and awkwardly.
Robots like Kismet at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
can display childlike reactions when addressed in different tones
of voice, but discussions of what would be deemed conscious and
intelligent behavior are still rooted in philosophy, not
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   However, robots do not have to be humanlike, or even visible, to
be useful _ or dangerous. In the Aug. 31 issue of Nature,
researchers at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, reported
that a group of robots programmed with a few simple rules patterned
after ant behavior could efficiently forage their environment.
</P>
<P>
   With the development of nanotechnology, the building of machines
out of individual atoms and molecules, Joy worries about artificial
microbes that are better than their biological counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Such minuscule robots, less than 1/25,000th of an inch, are one
of the aims of Zyvex, but company officials say they will not make
anything that could pose any danger.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ralph C. Merkle, a principal fellow of Zyvex and a
consultant to the Foresight Institute, says that by design the
robots will not be able to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   To minimize risks, the Foresight Institute, which studies
nanotechnology, has proposed guidelines for its work, including
encrypting the robot's programming and designing the robots so that
they do not function in an uncontrolled environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not interested in evolution,'' Merkle said. ``Quite the
reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Zyvex's nanorobots would be mindless machines that followed
instructions to build other nanorobots, including ones that could
be injected into the bloodstream of a hospital patient. ``It could
be programmed to remove specific stuff you don't want,'' like
cancer cells, blood vessel obstructions or invading germs, Merkle
said.
</P>
<P>
   But without the instructions, nanorobots could not reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you flush them down the toilet,'' Merkle said, ``they stop
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding a built-in ability to replicate would add unnecessary
cost and complexity _ unless one was trying to create a dangerous
nanorobot as a weapon. Merkle agrees with Joy that perhaps some
technologies should be avoided. But, he added, research in this
area needs to continue to develop defenses if an enemy unleashed a
nanorobot weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things we need to think about very
carefully,'' Merkle said, referring to nanorobots. ``Should we
relinquish autonomous, self-replicating devices that can function
in a natural environment? The answer is yes, that looks like a fine
thing to relinquish.''

   &QL; 
JEROME, Ariz. _ It was the dot-com of its day, a speculative
enterprise that soared, stalled, soared again, then plunged
precipitously and ultimately flickered out.
</P>
<P>
   The byproduct was Jerome, an Arizona frontier town that perches
on a steep hillside in the Mazatzal Mountains, a 110-mile drive
north of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Copper mining was the industry. It was begun in the late 1800s,
but its nosebleed vagaries caused Jerome to go from tent encampment
to boom city to certifiable ghost town by 1955. Then, in the 1970s,
the hippies and bikers and artists found their way here (some
squatting in abandoned buildings), and a tentative percolation back
to life began.
</P>
<P>
   Sightseers can't resist such swings of fortune _ which exemplify
a wilder era of the West _ so ultimately they began trickling in,
too, often on detours from Sedona or Flagstaff to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome stands ready to satisfy them, and all curiosity-seekers
who seek to pick through its gloriously checkered past.
</P>
<P>
   It has been declared a National Historic Landmark, which means
that if anyone acquires one of its crumbling brick ruins and seeks
to rebuild, a degree of integrity must be maintained _ you have to
be faithful to the design of the whorehouse or card parlor that
once stood there. A portion of the town is also a state historic
park, with an exceptional museum (housed in the former mansion of a
mining boss) that chronicles its past.
</P>
<P>
   The mining entrepreneurs picked the site for one reason: Beneath
the surface sat a rich lode of ore, one that would produce 1.45
million tons of copper over the life of the operation (plus 1,700
tons of silver and 47 tons of gold). This proved fortuitous in an
era when the nation was being newly wired for both electricity and
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The mine bosses were otherwise unconcerned with location, but
they picked a great one. Jerome teeters astride Cleopatra Hill at
nearly one mile in elevation, affording its visitors a spectacular
view to the east of the Verde Valley, Arizona's Mongollon Rim and,
on a clear day, the San Francisco Peaks above Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   You can enjoy that sweep from about any point in town because of
Jerome's unique geography. Again, the mine dictated settlement, and
this one is on a slope that in many places is 50 degrees. There is
a 1,500-foot fall in elevation from the town's highest point to its
lowest, and it's said that in Jerome's heyday, a person could walk
out on his front porch ... and look down the chimney of his
neighbor's kitchen stove.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Jerome don't stroll its streets. They climb them.
And shortcuts across the switchbacks are routinely achieved with
staircases. One such span features 92 steps, another 56. Early one
morning, a local resident was encountered jogging through town. ``I
do all the stairs in town,'' he puffed as he passed. ``It's the
Stairmaster Supreme, especially at this elevation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce lists the number of permanent residents
as 475, but tourism keeps Jerome's pulse strong and steady.
Especially on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you want to incorporate Jerome into an Arizona
excursion, you might want to plan your visit for midweek _ unless,
that is, you own a Harley-Davidson or embrace the biker lifestyle.
The little town reverberates with the noisy motorcycles on weekends
_ in open defiance of a sign on the edge of town feebly warning,
``Vehicle Noise Ordinance Strictly Enforced'' _ and the generally
sullen riders, when not sweltering in their leathers at the town
center, crowd into the Spirit Room to drink beer and rock to a live
band.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors might recoil at this, but actually it's in keeping
with Jerome's heritage. Those weren't choirboys working in the
depths of the mine.
</P>
<P>
   This was clearly evident in a historical walking tour conducted
by Nancy Smith, former curator and archivist for the Jerome
Historical Society. As she led two visitors through a downslope
section of town, Smith pointed to buildings in various stages of
disrepair or restoration and said, ``That was a brothel. That was a
brothel. That was a brothel. They'd usually have a bar, gambling, a
dance hall, rooms for the girls, pool (tables).''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the town's rough edges have since been smoothed over by
craftsmen. The shops here, many of them started by counter-culture
nomads who settled here in the '70s, offer a selection of goods of
exceptional quality: pottery, jewelry, wood carvings, Southwest
baskets, antique glass, wind chimes, textiles, and, fittingly,
copper items ranging from jewelry to gigantic pots.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, some artisans sell their wares from open-air stalls
along the streets. We encountered one persistent fellow selling his
handmade clay flutes. ``The Arabic scale is my favorite,'' he said,
breaking into a plaintive dirge and making the musicianship look
easy.
</P>
<P>
   The general eccentricity of this community is reflected in the
names of its shops: Pure Foolishness &AMP; Artful Stuff. Color Outside
the Lines. One establishment with a more conventional name, the
Jerome Gallery, carries particularly fine merchandise, notably an
elaborate selection of stained-glass kaleidoscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome has been a day-trip or pass-through destination for
several years, but it is straining to be considered as an overnight
option. It has a clutch of bed-and-breakfasts, but it celebrated a
pivotal event four years ago when the Jerome Grand Hotel was opened
after a two-year renovation.
</P>
<P>
   That much time was required to whip this lodging property into
shape because the building, a former hospital for mine workers, had
been abandoned for 44 years. ``It's basically an above-ground bomb
shelter done in Spanish Mission,'' proprietor Larry Altherr quipped
of the hotel, which currently offers 22 rooms (with 14 more in the
renovation plans).
</P>
<P>
   The state required a fire-sprinkler system to be put in, which
was kind of laughable because there is virtually no wood in the
five-story vault. Mine officials, who had had trouble with other
buildings cracking, ripping apart and even sliding downhill as the
result of underground tunneling and blasting, built this one for
keeps _ entirely of concrete, with wood used only in windows and
doors.
</P>
<P>
   The Altherr family tore up the ``battleship linoleum'' that was
found throughout and replaced it with carpet, but otherwise sought
to maintain as much of the building's original integrity as
possible. The self-service Otis elevator still works _ you have to
close the cage behind you when you get in _ and the place is heated
through its original steam-radiator system.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's vaguely institutional feel probably can never be
shaken (nor, perhaps, should it be). The hallways and doors are
much wider than you'll find in any other hotel. There is no grand
lobby. And although there are ceiling fans and colorful curtains
and pots of silk flowers in the spotless rooms and hallways, there
are also gray walls, gray carpet and gray-and-white tile in the
bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Advisory: some of the rooms are outfitted only with bathtubs,
and do not have showers. If this is important to you, especially
for an extended stay in a dusty mining town, be certain to specify
this when you make your reservation. Also, be warned: while the
concrete walls often result in pin-drop sleeping conditions, there
are transom windows above the doors to the rooms, and if you leave
yours open, any late-night conversation in the hall will sound as
if it's being conducted at the foot of your bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto is, `Experience the past,''' said Altherr. ``So
there you go. ... If you want climate control, you need to go to
the Hilton. Here, if you want to make a call, you have to pick up
the receiver and wait. We use the old-fashioned switchboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lodging option in town has a similarly medical theme. It
is the Surgeon's House, the former home of the mine doctor which is
now a four-room bed-and-breakfast inn. ``This is like staying with
Aunt Minnie,'' said owner Andrea Prince, ``except you don't have to
put up with Aunt Minnie.''
</P>
<P>
   Or do you? The inn seemed a pleasant enough place for those who
are comfortable lodging in someone else's house, but Prince seemed
to be a bit fussy. When we asked if we could see a vacant room, she
said, ``No, because if I took you in there I'd have to clean it
again.'' (Gee, thanks.)
</P>
<P>
   Also, there seemed to be a lot of prickly signs posted. One
warned passersby of dogs (she didn't seem to have any). Another
declared that touching the thermostat was ``a no-no.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of Jerome life that required an upgrade to
attract overnight travelers was its dining. Most of its offerings
for dinner are glorified lunch spots _ notably the Jerome Palace
(an after-dinner glass of Grand Marnier was served on !ital!ice)
and the Jerome Brewery, a pizza joint housed in a former automotive
garage.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Jerome Grand Hotel sought to fill this void by
recently opening Jerome's Bistro, a fine-dining restaurant with an
ambitious menu. (It and the hotel's new lounge were not yet open
when we visited in May.)
</P>
<P>
   For breakfast or lunch, meanwhile, it's tough to beat the
Flatiron Cafe, a triangular building that sits where Main Street
and Hull Avenue come to a quirky point. In the morning, it serves
up hearty scrambles, breakfast quesadillas and gourmet coffee
drinks, while its stereo features such intriguing musical artists
as The Innocence Mission and Michelle Shocked.
</P>
<P>
   It's obviously a popular spot with locals, and the restraining
spring on its wooden screen door has long since played out, such
that it bangs reassuringly in the frame every time someone happens
in or out.
</P>
<P>
   These businesses represent quite a comeback from Jerome's
ghost-town days. When the mine was shut down in 1953, its workers
and support folk bolted immediately. Two years later, the
population was estimated to be between 50 and 100 _ down from a
high of about 15,000 in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   My family passed through here on a trip home from nearby Oak
Creek Canyon in 1964, and the place was eerily deserted, an effect
deepened by a dark, threatening cloud cover. Occasionally a face
could be seen peering from behind a curtain, but otherwise there
were absolutely no signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome doesn't seem keen on shedding that image entirely,
though. It has no gas station. It has no market, not even a small
convenience store. It has no liquor store. Not a single fast-food
outlet.
</P>
<P>
   A gas station isn't feasible because current building codes
require that it have a substantial setback from the road, and this
road, remember, clings to a veritable cliff. Meanwhile, markets,
even small ones, have had difficulty squeezing enough commerce out
of those 400-plus residents. Any proprietor must also take on the
expense of maintaining or restoring the historic features of
whatever building he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had several come in and try it,'' said Mary Lou
Thompson, who came here in 1949 when her dad took over the garage
(now the brewery). ``We don't want any McDonald's or so forth like
that. We want to keep the flavor of the town as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, when your heritage, when the source of your appeal,
lies in ghostly, dilapidated buildings, you certainly don't want to
proceed too quickly on urban renewal. &QL;

   When you visit Jerome, Ariz., you have to be prepared for some
serious climbing. The town was built on a steep mountainside, and
it's not unusual for two parallel roads to be connected by
seemingly endless staircases.
</P>
<P>
   (TRVL JEROME3)
</P>
<P>
   While many of Jerome's buildings have been carefully restored,
some remnants from its days as a 1950s ghost town are very much in
evidence. Some sorry structures, in fact, appear ready to tumble
down the hillside at any instant.

   !Because of its designation as a National Historic Landmark,

<P>
   IF YOU GO &QL; 
GETTING THERE: Jerome, Ariz., is about a two-hour drive north of
Phoenix via U.S. 17 and state routes 260 and 89A. It is 27 miles
southwest of Sedona via a scenic stretch of 89A.
</P>
<P>
   ACTIVITIES: The museum at Jerome State Historic Park is an
excellent place to get an overview of the history of the town.
Housed in the Douglas Mansion (eastern edge of town), it is open
daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $2.50 adults, $1 children
ages 7-13. Historical walking tours of Jerome are conducted by
former Jerome Historical Society curator Nancy Smith. Cost is $10.
Phone: (520) 634-8654. Smith, a 28-year resident, is a bit crusty
in manner and doesn't seem to appreciate questions that break up
her prepared commentary, but this is not someone winging the tour
and glossing over unfamiliar parts _ she knows her Jerome history
chapter and verse.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Rooms at the Jerome Grand Hotel (200 Hill St.) start at
$70. You might want to specify a room overlooking the Verde Valley;
the hotel is at the very top of the hillside town and has quite a
view. Phone: (888) 817-6788 or (520) 634-8200. Web:
www.jeromegrandhotel.net. Rooms at the Surgeon's House (101 Hill
St.) start at $100. The Chauffeur's Quarters, detached from the
main house, cost $150. Phone: (800) 639-1452 or (520) 639-1452.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: Jerome's Bistro, which recently opened at the Jerome
Grand Hotel, offers an a la carte menu featuring pasta, seafood,
steaks and chops. Entrees average in the mid-$20s. It's the only
restaurant in town that takes reservations: (520) 639-3197. The
only thing memorable about the Jerome Palace (410 E. Clark St.) was
the view from its wrap-around veranda. Phone: (520) 634-0554. The
Jerome Brewery (111 Main St.), a glorified pizza parlor with
microbrews, is a downscale option. Phone: (520) 639-8477. For
breakfast, it's tough to beat the tiny but comfy Flatiron Cafe (416
Main St.). Phone: (520) 634-2733.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: The Jerome Chamber of Commerce can be reached at
(520) 634-2900. Web: www.jeromechamber.com. The Jerome State
Historical Park can be reached at (520) 634-5381. It does not have

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A government report released Monday accused
entertainment companies of aggressively targeting children in their
advertising for sexually-explicit movies, violent video games and
music with explicit content and threatened possible action against
the industry for ignoring its own rating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Trade Commission Chairman Robert Pitofsky, whose agency
produced the report, said he was developing potential sanctions if
the industry ``is unable to clean up its act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If self-regulation doesn't work, sanctions should be
considered,'' Pitofsky told a news conference here. He emphasized,
however, that he did not believe the FTC should become the
``thought police'' and that ``bureaucrats should in no way try to
influence the work of artists and studios.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic and Republican presidential candidates both
seized the opportunity to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said that if he is elected president, he
will ask the entertainment industry for a voluntary ``cease-fire''
in marketing inappropriate videos, games and music to children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose wife Tipper began calling for warning labels on
recordings with explicit lyrics in the 1980s, added that his
administration would give entertainment companies six months to
stop targeting children. If they failed, he would encourage the FTC
use its power to prohibit false and deceptive advertising. Or he
said he would propose legislation to broaden the government's
ability to sanction the industry.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, said
entertainment companies needed to do a better job policing their
sales pitches. But he questioned whether Gore was the person to
deal with the industry, asserting that the vice president had
failed until recently to take a strong stand on violence in
entertainment media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the man's short on credibility on the issue,'' Bush
said, adding that Gore has raised millions of dollars in campaign
money from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who commissioned the FTC investigation,
challenged the industry to be responsive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people will give, I think, the entertainment
industry a period now to fix this but something has to be done,''
Clinton said during an appearance in Scarsdale, N.Y., with his
wife, Hillary, who is running for the Senate. ``They say these
rating systems mean something. They can't turn around and advertise
to people that shouldn't see this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the key findings contained in the FTC study:
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the 44 movies rated R for violence that the commission
selected for its study, 35 had advertising campaigns targeted at
children under 17. In addition, marketing plans for 28 of those
films expressly stated that the movies' target audience included
children under 17.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every one of the advertising campaigns of the 55 music CDs
with explicit content labels chosen for the FTC study targeted
children under 17.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seventy percent, or 83, of the 118 video games labeled as
violent went used advertising promotions aimed at children under
17.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed that MTV, with a core demographic of 12- to
24-year-olds, was the largest cable advertising outlet for each of
the 44 rated R-rated movies in the study. In addition, magazines
with majority under-17 audiences, such as Teen, Jump, YM, DC Comics
and Marvel Comics, contained advertisements for a number of R-rated
films.
</P>
<P>
   The commission study relied on internal marketing documents
provided by the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment industry leaders dismissed the report, saying the
FTC incorrectly evaluated many companies' marketing campaigns. They
also said that movies and video games have no effect on children's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are causing moral decay in this country, we ought to
have an explosion of crime,'' said Jack Valenti, head of the Motion
Picture Association of America. ``The exact opposite is
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Hollywood voluntary imposed a rating system on
movies to help parents choose which films were appropriate for
their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``For almost 32 years, this industry has been the only segment
of our national marketplace that voluntarily turns away revenues at
the box office to redeem the pledge that we have made to parents,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tushnet, who specializes in the First Amendment at
Georgetown University, said the government could write a law
allowing the FTC to regulate entertainment marketing but that its
enforcement would be ``complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was convinced the law could be enforced in cases
where companies seem to be undermining their own rating and
labeling standards in their advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the industry violates its own rules and actively misleads
parents with advertising, then the industry should be held
accountable,'' he said in a statement.

CHENEY'S LOW-KEY STYLE WORRYING SOME IN GOP

<P>
   WAYNE, Pa. _ Traveling up the winding, wooded road, Dick
Cheney's motorcade emerged into a sunlit field, where the guests
stood waiting, in a neatly ordered double line.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less would have been in violation of command. This was,
after all, the Valley Forge Military Academy. It was, also, one of
the safest venues for the former secretary of defense to give a
speech calling for more defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a low-key reiteration of Cheney's well-honed
views. They were warmly received by the cadets in Eisenhower Hall;
they are mostly ignored elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, in New England, was little different. The first
stop was at a Maine defense subcontractor that makes submarine
valves. Then there were visits to a New Hampshire maker of military
night-vision equipment, and to a Vermont veterans' group.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it was an agenda that seemed more designed for a
Pentagon chief than for a vice presidential candidate. And that
appears to be the way the Bush campaign wants it.
</P>
<P>
   When Cheney was picked as George W. Bush's running mate, the
campaign said he wouldn't be relegated to minor markets, but that
is where he often appears. Cheney was heralded by Bush as a
relatively nonpolitical choice when the Texas governor was sky-high
in the polls, and when, perhaps, he thought he might easily be
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Bush is in a tight race with Vice President Al Gore,
the limitations of Cheney the campaigner have become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The question is not whether Cheney, 59, has the makings of an
excellent vice president. Many Republicans and Democrats say that
the former Wyoming congressman, and the former chief of staff to
President Gerald R. Ford, might be the most valuable asset for Bush
_ as president.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, there is scant evidence that Cheney is helping Bush
to get the top job. GOP grumblings continue that he may be hurting
the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime Republicans voice particular concern about
Cheney's role, given the evident campaign chemistry between Gore
and his running mate, Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut senator.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's zest on the stump is obvious. Cheney can seem
impatient with the give and take, and the occasional indignities,
of life on the trail.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser Friday in Vermont, a contributor, Fred
Bertrand, former chief executive officer of the National Life
Insurance Co., asked Cheney whether the campaign would change
strategy. Cheney brushed aside the question by saying he always
felt the race would be close.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, Bertrand said later, ``was not a spectacular choice,''
but a ``safe'' one. He added that the campaign ``was not helped''
by the controversy over reports that Cheney was in line to receive
$17.2 million in stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Some leading Republicans, who spoke privately, voiced irritation
that the campaign had been prepared neither for questions about
Cheney's wealth nor for his record as one of the most conservative
members of the US House.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the start, his choice has raised eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Bush announced that Cheney was his choice, Cheney
appeared on Larry King Live and talked about the money he would
lose by leaving Halliburton Co., the worldwide oil conglomerate
that he headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens financially, obviously, is I take a bath, in one
sense,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cheney was in line for millions of dollars in stock
options. After weeks of press accounts about the windfall, Cheney
announced that, if elected, he would forgo the options that are not
vested.
</P>
<P>
   A Cheney spokesman, Dirk Vande Beek, said this would amount to
$3.6 million of Cheney's retirement package. The remaining $13.6
million he would keep, no matter what happened on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said through his spokesman that he had no second thoughts
about the logic behind his choice as a running mate. Cheney
initially had the job of vetting vice presidential candidates
before taking the position himself. Some of the candidates who were
bypassed might have secured a significant electoral state for Bush,
such as Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Ridge or former Missouri
Senator John Danforth.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Cheney is that his strengths may be inconsistent
with Bush's political needs.
</P>
<P>
   Thus:
</P>
<P>
   --Some polls have found that the state of the military is not a
key issue.
</P>
<P>
   --yoming is a reliable Republican state with only three
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   --Cheney's tenure as head of an oil conglomerate may further
irritate voters upset at rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Jude Wanniski, a Republican economic specialist who has known
him for 30 years, said Cheney was ``the perfect pick'' for vice
president, but added that that people around Bush ``are now telling
him he made a great mistake in picking Cheney.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanniski said the same thing happened after Bob Dole picked Jack
Kemp in 1996: ``The process begins by which the establishment
blames Cheney for losing the election. Cheney will be kept off TV
and relegated to backwater spots, as Jack was in 1996. Then they
will tie Cheney's hands in talking about things he may disagree
with Bush on, a la our overseas commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanniski said: ``The more Cheney appears on Sunday talk shows
talking about issues, the better he will look, because he is great
on issues and unflappable.''
</P>
<P>
   A hint of Cheney's discomfort at strongly stating some of his
own views was evident on Wednesday. Asked whether he backed
President Clinton's decision to use force in Kosovo, which was
supported by Bush, Cheney hedged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had reservations about it,'' Cheney said. ``It was a tough
call, a close call. Once the president made the decision to use
force, then I think there clearly was an obligation to support
him.''
</P>
<P>
   So what would Cheney have done? Again, he hedged: ``If I was
commander-in-chief, I don't know that I would have made exactly the
same decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has also weathered several smaller issues including
reports that he has given only 1 percent of his income to charity
in the past 10 years, and that he skipped voting in 14 of 16
elections in five years as a Dallas resident.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign advisers say that in the end, voters will
appreciate that Bush chose a man not for political calculation, but
for competence. For all the complaints about Cheney, there has been
little talk about whether he is qualified to take over the
presidency in a heartbeat. And that is the most important question
about a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't think of a person more qualified and capable as Dick
Cheney,'' said a friend and former Reagan White House chief of
staff, Ken Duberstein. ``Dick Cheney should be reassuring to the
American people. After all, the campaign is one thing, but the goal
of a campaign is to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's top issue is his assertion that the military is not
sufficiently prepared to fight wars of the future. That has
prompted Democrats to report that military spending began to
decline under Cheney, who, under a budget agreement in 1990,
authorized a 25 percent reduction in manpower over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is in many ways an antithesis to the modern campaigner,
as epitomized by President Clinton. Where Clinton's campaign
appearances were symbolized by his comment that he ``feels your
pain,'' Cheney's sometimes make listeners aware of his own
discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   This should not be a surprise: Cheney has always been a low-key,
somewhat taciturn politician, valued for intellect rather than for
charisma or people skills.
</P>
<P>
   Life on the road for Cheney is designed to be safe, predictable,
and relatively news-free. On a swing through the Northeast last
week, Cheney made a series of appearances that seemed designed to
avoid controversy.
</P>
<P>
   He visited Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and
Connecticut, which have a combined 22 electoral votes, as well as
the stop at Valley Forge in the crucial state of Pennsylvania, with
23 electoral votes. Most were invitation-only events, closed to the
voting public, although a few protesters showed up at a Vermont
rally waving signs that criticized Cheney for backing billions of
dollars for the military and for opposing Head Start as a US House
member.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst, Charles E. Cook Jr., editor of the Cook Political
Report, a Washington journal, said Cheney would have little
positive or negative impact on the election, ``which is the norm''
for a running mate. ``Lieberman is the exception,'' Cook said.
``That was an outside-the-box selection that triggered Gore's
comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, despite all of his years dealing with the press in
Washington, does not appear comfortable with reporters. That seemed
especially the case last week, which began when a microphone caught
Cheney agreeing with Bush's vulgar condemnation of a New York Times
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cheney had just 10 journalists with him on his
chartered 727 jet last week, aides said they could not persuade
Cheney on Wednesday or Thursday to chat with the press in the back
of the plane, either on or off the record, as Bush often does.
</P>
<P>
   He held a brief press conference at Valley Forge and canceled a
tentatively scheduled interview. The schedule did not seem heavy,
with two or three daily public events, along with some
fund-raisers. Nothing was public after 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Cheney leaves no doubt that he is in command of
his facts. To those who remember the way Dan Quayle struggled
through such appearances when he was picked for the vice
presidential slot in 1988, Cheney is the un-Quayle. No question is
too obscure, and like a good professor, he rephrases many questions
that the general audience may not understand.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney shows little interest in trying to win points for
style. A Cheney address is just that _ an address. The head is
cocked at a 45 degree angle, the lip is curled, the tone is flat
and stern. He typically begins his speeches by saying that ``life
was good'' this summer before Bush ``put the arm on me'' to be his
running mate, leaving the suggestion, perhaps unintended, that he
doesn't really want to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Westerner, a man of few words,'' Cheney says. Asked
about his religious belief, he contrasts himself to the way
Lieberman injects Orthodox Judaism into political discourse. He
says he is a Protestant and has never talked publicly about his
private beliefs _ and he is true to his word.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney made perhaps his most revealing comment on Thursday in
Manchester, N.H., when he told a roomful of veterans and employees
of a military subcontractor how much he loves to be alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an avid fisherman and hunter,'' Cheney said. ``I like to
get out all by myself with a fly rod; there's no one else around.
That's one of the more enjoyable parts of life.''

   &QL; 
JEROME, Ariz. _ It was the dot-com of its day, a speculative
enterprise that soared, stalled, soared again, then plunged
precipitously and ultimately flickered out.
</P>
<P>
   The byproduct was Jerome, an Arizona frontier town that perches
on a steep hillside in the Mazatzal Mountains, a 110-mile drive
north of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Copper mining was the industry. It was begun in the late 1800s,
but its nosebleed vagaries caused Jerome to go from tent encampment
to boom city to certifiable ghost town by 1955. Then, in the 1970s,
the hippies and bikers and artists found their way here (some
squatting in abandoned buildings), and a tentative percolation back
to life began.
</P>
<P>
   Sightseers can't resist such swings of fortune _ which exemplify
a wilder era of the West _ so ultimately they began trickling in,
too, often on detours from Sedona or Flagstaff to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome stands ready to satisfy them, and all curiosity-seekers
who seek to pick through its gloriously checkered past.
</P>
<P>
   It has been declared a National Historic Landmark, which means
that if anyone acquires one of its crumbling brick ruins and seeks
to rebuild, a degree of integrity must be maintained _ you have to
be faithful to the design of the whorehouse or card parlor that
once stood there. A portion of the town is also a state historic
park, with an exceptional museum (housed in the former mansion of a
mining boss) that chronicles its past.
</P>
<P>
   The mining entrepreneurs picked the site for one reason: Beneath
the surface sat a rich lode of ore, one that would produce 1.45
million tons of copper over the life of the operation (plus 1,700
tons of silver and 47 tons of gold). This proved fortuitous in an
era when the nation was being newly wired for both electricity and
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The mine bosses were otherwise unconcerned with location, but
they picked a great one. Jerome teeters astride Cleopatra Hill at
nearly one mile in elevation, affording its visitors a spectacular
view to the east of the Verde Valley, Arizona's Mongollon Rim and,
on a clear day, the San Francisco Peaks above Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   You can enjoy that sweep from about any point in town because of
Jerome's unique geography. Again, the mine dictated settlement, and
this one is on a slope that in many places is 50 degrees. There is
a 1,500-foot fall in elevation from the town's highest point to its
lowest, and it's said that in Jerome's heyday, a person could walk
out on his front porch ... and look down the chimney of his
neighbor's kitchen stove.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Jerome don't stroll its streets. They climb them.
And shortcuts across the switchbacks are routinely achieved with
staircases. One such span features 92 steps, another 56. Early one
morning, a local resident was encountered jogging through town. ``I
do all the stairs in town,'' he puffed as he passed. ``It's the
Stairmaster Supreme, especially at this elevation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce lists the number of permanent residents
as 475, but tourism keeps Jerome's pulse strong and steady.
Especially on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you want to incorporate Jerome into an Arizona
excursion, you might want to plan your visit for midweek _ unless,
that is, you own a Harley-Davidson or embrace the biker lifestyle.
The little town reverberates with the noisy motorcycles on weekends
_ in open defiance of a sign on the edge of town feebly warning,
``Vehicle Noise Ordinance Strictly Enforced'' _ and the generally
sullen riders, when not sweltering in their leathers at the town
center, crowd into the Spirit Room to drink beer and rock to a live
band.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors might recoil at this, but actually it's in keeping
with Jerome's heritage. Those weren't choirboys working in the
depths of the mine.
</P>
<P>
   This was clearly evident in a historical walking tour conducted
by Nancy Smith, former curator and archivist for the Jerome
Historical Society. As she led two visitors through a downslope
section of town, Smith pointed to buildings in various stages of
disrepair or restoration and said, ``That was a brothel. That was a
brothel. That was a brothel. They'd usually have a bar, gambling, a
dance hall, rooms for the girls, pool (tables).''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the town's rough edges have since been smoothed over by
craftsmen. The shops here, many of them started by counter-culture
nomads who settled here in the '70s, offer a selection of goods of
exceptional quality: pottery, jewelry, wood carvings, Southwest
baskets, antique glass, wind chimes, textiles, and, fittingly,
copper items ranging from jewelry to gigantic pots.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, some artisans sell their wares from open-air stalls
along the streets. We encountered one persistent fellow selling his
handmade clay flutes. ``The Arabic scale is my favorite,'' he said,
breaking into a plaintive dirge and making the musicianship look
easy.
</P>
<P>
   The general eccentricity of this community is reflected in the
names of its shops: Pure Foolishness &AMP; Artful Stuff. Color Outside
the Lines. One establishment with a more conventional name, the
Jerome Gallery, carries particularly fine merchandise, notably an
elaborate selection of stained-glass kaleidoscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome has been a day-trip or pass-through destination for
several years, but it is straining to be considered as an overnight
option. It has a clutch of bed-and-breakfasts, but it celebrated a
pivotal event four years ago when the Jerome Grand Hotel was opened
after a two-year renovation.
</P>
<P>
   That much time was required to whip this lodging property into
shape because the building, a former hospital for mine workers, had
been abandoned for 44 years. ``It's basically an above-ground bomb
shelter done in Spanish Mission,'' proprietor Larry Altherr quipped
of the hotel, which currently offers 22 rooms (with 14 more in the
renovation plans).
</P>
<P>
   The state required a fire-sprinkler system to be put in, which
was kind of laughable because there is virtually no wood in the
five-story vault. Mine officials, who had had trouble with other
buildings cracking, ripping apart and even sliding downhill as the
result of underground tunneling and blasting, built this one for
keeps _ entirely of concrete, with wood used only in windows and
doors.
</P>
<P>
   The Altherr family tore up the ``battleship linoleum'' that was
found throughout and replaced it with carpet, but otherwise sought
to maintain as much of the building's original integrity as
possible. The self-service Otis elevator still works _ you have to
close the cage behind you when you get in _ and the place is heated
through its original steam-radiator system.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's vaguely institutional feel probably can never be
shaken (nor, perhaps, should it be). The hallways and doors are
much wider than you'll find in any other hotel. There is no grand
lobby. And although there are ceiling fans and colorful curtains
and pots of silk flowers in the spotless rooms and hallways, there
are also gray walls, gray carpet and gray-and-white tile in the
bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Advisory: some of the rooms are outfitted only with bathtubs,
and do not have showers. If this is important to you, especially
for an extended stay in a dusty mining town, be certain to specify
this when you make your reservation. Also, be warned: while the
concrete walls often result in pin-drop sleeping conditions, there
are transom windows above the doors to the rooms, and if you leave
yours open, any late-night conversation in the hall will sound as
if it's being conducted at the foot of your bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto is, `Experience the past,''' said Altherr. ``So
there you go. ... If you want climate control, you need to go to
the Hilton. Here, if you want to make a call, you have to pick up
the receiver and wait. We use the old-fashioned switchboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lodging option in town has a similarly medical theme. It
is the Surgeon's House, the former home of the mine doctor which is
now a four-room bed-and-breakfast inn. ``This is like staying with
Aunt Minnie,'' said owner Andrea Prince, ``except you don't have to
put up with Aunt Minnie.''
</P>
<P>
   Or do you? The inn seemed a pleasant enough place for those who
are comfortable lodging in someone else's house, but Prince seemed
to be a bit fussy. When we asked if we could see a vacant room, she
said, ``No, because if I took you in there I'd have to clean it
again.'' (Gee, thanks.)
</P>
<P>
   Also, there seemed to be a lot of prickly signs posted. One
warned passersby of dogs (she didn't seem to have any). Another
declared that touching the thermostat was ``a no-no.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of Jerome life that required an upgrade to
attract overnight travelers was its dining. Most of its offerings
for dinner are glorified lunch spots _ notably the Jerome Palace
(an after-dinner glass of Grand Marnier was served on !ital!ice)
and the Jerome Brewery, a pizza joint housed in a former automotive
garage.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Jerome Grand Hotel sought to fill this void by
recently opening Jerome's Bistro, a fine-dining restaurant with an
ambitious menu. (It and the hotel's new lounge were not yet open
when we visited in May.)
</P>
<P>
   For breakfast or lunch, meanwhile, it's tough to beat the
Flatiron Cafe, a triangular building that sits where Main Street
and Hull Avenue come to a quirky point. In the morning, it serves
up hearty scrambles, breakfast quesadillas and gourmet coffee
drinks, while its stereo features such intriguing musical artists
as The Innocence Mission and Michelle Shocked.
</P>
<P>
   It's obviously a popular spot with locals, and the restraining
spring on its wooden screen door has long since played out, such
that it bangs reassuringly in the frame every time someone happens
in or out.
</P>
<P>
   These businesses represent quite a comeback from Jerome's
ghost-town days. When the mine was shut down in 1953, its workers
and support folk bolted immediately. Two years later, the
population was estimated to be between 50 and 100 _ down from a
high of about 15,000 in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   My family passed through here on a trip home from nearby Oak
Creek Canyon in 1964, and the place was eerily deserted, an effect
deepened by a dark, threatening cloud cover. Occasionally a face
could be seen peering from behind a curtain, but otherwise there
were absolutely no signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome doesn't seem keen on shedding that image entirely,
though. It has no gas station. It has no market, not even a small
convenience store. It has no liquor store. Not a single fast-food
outlet.
</P>
<P>
   A gas station isn't feasible because current building codes
require that it have a substantial setback from the road, and this
road, remember, clings to a veritable cliff. Meanwhile, markets,
even small ones, have had difficulty squeezing enough commerce out
of those 400-plus residents. Any proprietor must also take on the
expense of maintaining or restoring the historic features of
whatever building he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had several come in and try it,'' said Mary Lou
Thompson, who came here in 1949 when her dad took over the garage
(now the brewery). ``We don't want any McDonald's or so forth like
that. We want to keep the flavor of the town as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, when your heritage, when the source of your appeal,
lies in ghostly, dilapidated buildings, you certainly don't want to
proceed too quickly on urban renewal. &QL;

   When you visit Jerome, Ariz., you have to be prepared for some
serious climbing. The town was built on a steep mountainside, and
it's not unusual for two parallel roads to be connected by
seemingly endless staircases.

<P>
   While many of Jerome's buildings have been carefully restored,
some remnants from its days as a 1950s ghost town are very much in
evidence. Some sorry structures, in fact, appear ready to tumble
down the hillside at any instant.

   IF YOU GO &QL; 
GETTING THERE: Jerome, Ariz., is about a two-hour drive north of
Phoenix via U.S. 17 and state routes 260 and 89A. It is 27 miles
southwest of Sedona via a scenic stretch of 89A.
</P>
<P>
   ACTIVITIES: The museum at Jerome State Historic Park is an
excellent place to get an overview of the history of the town.
Housed in the Douglas Mansion (eastern edge of town), it is open
daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $2.50 adults, $1 children
ages 7-13. Historical walking tours of Jerome are conducted by
former Jerome Historical Society curator Nancy Smith. Cost is $10.
Phone: (520) 634-8654. Smith, a 28-year resident, is a bit crusty
in manner and doesn't seem to appreciate questions that break up
her prepared commentary, but this is not someone winging the tour
and glossing over unfamiliar parts _ she knows her Jerome history
chapter and verse.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Rooms at the Jerome Grand Hotel (200 Hill St.) start at
$70. You might want to specify a room overlooking the Verde Valley;
the hotel is at the very top of the hillside town and has quite a
view. Phone: (888) 817-6788 or (520) 634-8200. Web:
www.jeromegrandhotel.net. Rooms at the Surgeon's House (101 Hill
St.) start at $100. The Chauffeur's Quarters, detached from the
main house, cost $150. Phone: (800) 639-1452 or (520) 639-1452.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: Jerome's Bistro, which recently opened at the Jerome
Grand Hotel, offers an a la carte menu featuring pasta, seafood,
steaks and chops. Entrees average in the mid-$20s. It's the only
restaurant in town that takes reservations: (520) 639-3197. The
only thing memorable about the Jerome Palace (410 E. Clark St.) was
the view from its wrap-around veranda. Phone: (520) 634-0554. The
Jerome Brewery (111 Main St.), a glorified pizza parlor with
microbrews, is a downscale option. Phone: (520) 639-8477. For
breakfast, it's tough to beat the tiny but comfy Flatiron Cafe (416
Main St.). Phone: (520) 634-2733.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: The Jerome Chamber of Commerce can be reached at
(520) 634-2900. Web: www.jeromechamber.com. The Jerome State
Historical Park can be reached at (520) 634-5381. It does not have
its own Web site, but information on Jerome is available through

  Scenic sightseeing train marks 10th year in Arizona 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box and captions below) 
ART AVAILABLE 
By ERIC NOLAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLARKDALE, Ariz. _ Arizona has some of the most breathtaking
scenery in the Southwest, but in this defiantly rugged state, only
a fraction of it is interlaced with roads or hiking trails.
</P>
<P>
   This fact may have run through the mind of railroad owner Dave
Durbano a dozen years ago after he acquired an obscure freight line
in the central part of the state. On his first ride from Clarkdale
to Drake, his chin kept hitting his chest in wonderment.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a sightseeing train was hatched, and soon tourists
were riding the Verde Canyon Railroad, marveling at narrow canyons,
bald eagles, cliffside Indian ruins and broad river valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The excursion, which celebrates its 10th anniversary in
November, follows a rail line that stretches from Clarkdale to the
former water stop of Perkinsville. Then the engine uses a siding to
reposition itself at the opposite end of the train and returns
along the same route.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century ago, the rail line was used to
transport copper from the mines at Jerome, about six miles from
Clarkdale, north to the Santa Fe's main line at Ash Fork. But the
route was cut through a spectacular natural region, now part of the
Prescott National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The area is otherwise accessible only to hikers with extremely
sturdy boots and a great deal of persistence.
</P>
<P>
   The train affords considerably more comfort _ and obvious
nostalgia. The restored Pullman cars date to the 1940s, the diesel
locomotives to the 1950s. Small wonder the mean age of passengers
on our midweek ride in May seemed to be about 77.
</P>
<P>
   To maximize viewing, the train has several open-air cars. A
guide also offers a running commentary along the four-hour
afternoon trip.
</P>
<P>
   The guide for our trip was Clay Miller, who moved to this region
from the Hollywood Hills 13 years ago to conduct archeological
tourism expeditions out of nearby Sedona. Miller's narrative,
delivered over the train's sound system, was a delightful mix of
history, geology, songs, poems of his own composition, and American
Indian stories and legends.
</P>
<P>
   The train poked along at freight speed, bouncing and rocking and
protesting the exertion.
</P>
<P>
   It passed by an appalling expanse of slag left over from the
mine's smelting operation _ picture 40 acres of charred gunk
reaching to a depth of 40 feet. It traversed S.O.B. Canyon (so
named by the railroad workers who had to build a towering trestle
over it in 1911). It treated us to the mesmerizing red and pink
rocks of Sycamore Canyon, then passed through a 600-foot curved
tunnel _ the train passes within six inches of the walls in spots _
before coming to a halt in the ranchland of Perkinsville.
</P>
<P>
   When the mine was operating and steam engines needed water, this
settlement was a fairly lively place, with about a dozen families,
a school, a store, a post office. Now? ``When everybody's home,''
said the attendant in our car, ``the population's three.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point along the way, Miller indicated a bald eagle,
perched on a red-canyon cliff wall and staring blandly at us from
about 100 yards away. Also, along the canyon bottom, several great
blue herons were spotted.
</P>
<P>
   The features of the ride change with the seasons. This time of
year, the cottonwood and sycamore trees begin to provide some fall
color. Winter is a prime time to see bald eagles. Springtime brings
the yellow and peach-colored blooms of cactus flowers, as well as
such wildflowers as desert marigolds and blackfoot daisies. Because
of the heat, summer is probably the least desirable, although you
might get to see the desert in the midst of a dramatic
thunderstorm. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
IF YOU GO &QL; 
The excursion is offered year-round. In the fall and spring, it
operates daily except at 1 p.m. Tuesday (two rides on Saturdays).
In the summer and winter, visitors are asked to call in advance for
the schedule. Reservations at all times of the year are strongly
recommended: (800) 293-7245 or (520) 639-0010. Web:
www.verdecanyonrr.com. Coach fare is $35.95 adults, $32.95 seniors
(over 65), $20.95 children under 12. First-class fare is $54.95.
Drinks and snacks are offered for sale on the train, and there is a
picnic ground, cafe and gift shop at the depot. &QL;

nine months to transform the 35-year-old government insurance
program into an efficient, largely private health care marketplace.
But many health care experts __ and sadder-but-wiser veterans of
past Medicare wars __ say that the last decade has shown the
immense difficulties in accomplishing such reforms. The
philosophical differences between the two parties over how to
reshape Medicare are large and enduring. The experience with

<P>
   Sometimes you find a dish worth copying when you least expect
it. Such has been the case during several of my recent travels.
</P>
<P>
   First in today's quartet of replica offerings is a terrific
hummus, copied from The Prado restaurant at Balboa Park in San
Diego _ a good dining choice in a lovely setting if you're in that
area.
</P>
<P>
   A small container of this hummus accompanied by crispy pieces of
flatbread arrives at the table once you're seated _ and makes great
noshing while you're perusing the menu selections and waiting for
your meal. Although we don't usually ask restaurants for ingredient
lists, chef Jeff Thurston was happy to share his creation. In fact,
he even sent along the quantity recipe, based on 4 1/2 gallons
cooked garbanzo beans and 9 cups tahini!
</P>
<P>
   We relied on taste memories from a recent visit there to create
our copycat version. Although the restaurant starts by cooking
dried garbanzo beans, we took the liberty of streamlining the
recipe by using rinsed and drained canned beans.
</P>
<P>
   The mixture goes together in short order in the food processor
with fresh garlic or garlic pepper, lemon and lime juices (be sure
to use freshly squeezed), tahini (sesame seed paste), cilantro and
chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (available in some supermarkets and
Latino markets). Be sure to include the chipotle chiles, which lend
the signature smoky flavor along with some heat. Serve with crispy
thin baked lavosh pieces. This appetizer is a winner _ and one
that's difficult to stop eating.
</P>
<P>
   A recent trip to check out what's new at the takeout deli
counter at Gelson's in North Hollywood yielded a couple of
excellent salads that are a breeze to turn out at home. The first _
made with strips of cactus that can be purchased in a jar _ is
unusual and delicious. The strips are teamed with chopped avocado,
onions, green peppers, tomatoes, cilantro, lime juice, olive oil
and small pieces of queso fresco cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Our tasters raved about the Barbecue Potato Salad from Gelson's,
which is a novel combination but one that works well _ and is great
tasting. Cook red potatoes in the microwave oven until tender, then
cool and chill. The dressing is a mixture of sour cream,
hickory-flavored barbecue sauce (Chris &AMP; Pitts preferred), chopped
green onions, celery and red peppers, corn and crumbled bacon (buy
cooked bacon in a jar if time is at a premium). Zip up the mixture
with a few dashes of cayenne pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with grilled or broiled chicken or meats. Clip and save
this idea to use all year long when you want to add barbecue flavor
to the table without heating up the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Last in today's roundup is a copycat version of a Mascarpone
Cheesecake sampled at Buca di Beppo at Universal CityWalk. Pick up
the mascarpone cheese _ which makes a divine dessert _ at an
Italian deli, Costco or the supermarket. Top the baked slices with
a ruby red raspberry sauce whipped up in a food processor with
frozen unsweetened raspberries and a little powdered sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Give these restaurant replicas a whirl to jazz up end-of-summer
and fall menus. &QL;

WHEN IT'S A MAN'S JOB, SEND FOGARTY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Asked about the worldwide explosion of vapid teen-pop the other
day, U2's Bono said it was time for the boys to move over and let
the men show how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   John Fogerty did just that at Sunday's New Orleans festival at
the L.A. Tennis Center in Westwood, an imaginative bill that
suffered from a woeful lack of promotion that caused the place to
be only two-thirds full.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shame more people didn't get to see this revered
roots-rocker, whose songs for Creedence Clearwater Revival are some
of rock's most popular and best-crafted tunes.
</P>
<P>
   At 55, Fogerty is still in top form, his guitar chords ringing
with conviction, his build slim and energetic and his vocal
delivery a burnished thing of gritty beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Charged readings of classic Creedence material, such as ``Green
River,'' ``Bad Moon Rising,'' ``Born on the Bayou'' and ``Down on
the Corner,'' were marvelous.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the excitement of Fogerty's well-paced set was a
dynamic backing unit that included veteran drummer Kenny Aronoff
and guitarist Rick Vito.
</P>
<P>
   Fogerty is still one of the best performers of the rock era,
right up there with Bruce Springsteen and Don Henley, and he seemed
to be in an expansive mood. Maybe there was extra spark to the set
Sunday because the gig was the final night of the band's world
tour.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Irma Thomas performed her slinky New Orleans r&AMP;b to a
sparse house, while Big Easy jazz-funk pianist Dr. John brought an
unusually ragged band on stage to perform such classic Mardi Gras
material as ``Big Chief'' and ``Right Place, Wrong Time.''
</P>
<P>
   That last tune seemed to sum up an evening that should have
attracted many more customers. &QL;

AFTER DECIPHERING THE MAP, THE NEXT TASK IS A GUIDEBOOK FOR THE
HUMAN GENOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Eric S. Lander is the Director of the Whitehead Institute
Center for Genome Research and a Professor of Biology at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge
Massachusetts.) 
 By ERIC S. LANDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Labor Day has come and gone, and I am chagrined to find that I
haven't made it through my summer reading.
</P>
<P>
   My list comprised only a single book, but a rather unusual one:
the text is 3 billion years old, has 6 billion copies in print,
runs 3 billion letters long (about 1 million pages), and is written
entirely in four characters _ A, T, C and G _ with no spaces or
punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   The book, of course, is a great classic: ``The Sequence of the
Human Genome.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the Fourth of July holiday, an international
scientific consortium announced at a White House celebration that
it had largely deciphered the DNA instructions encoded in the human
chromosomes. I felt a special pride in the accomplishment, because
my own scientific group at the Whitehead Institute Center for
Genome Research was a major contributor to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Once the hoopla died down, we've all turned to the work of
preparing a scientific paper to be submitted later this year
describing the findings. The real challenge is ``annotating'' the
sequence, attaching meaning to an otherwise boring string of
genetic bits.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by computer programs, we're trying to parse the continuous
DNA into distinct genes and discern each gene's role in making
neurotransmitter receptors, bone proteins, stomach enzymes,
reproductive hormones and so on. We're trying to glean meaning from
the breathtaking variations in chromosomal landscape, from vast
gene deserts to dense urban cores. And, we're trying to reconstruct
the glory days of ancient transposable elements that hopped around
our genomes millions of years ago but have since fallen into ruin.
In effect, we're preparing the first edition of a guidebook
describing the landmarks of the human chromosomes, designed to
shape the experience of generations of genome travelers to come.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm aware that our work is just one of the many ways to
breathe meaning into the human genome. So, I was glad to visit the
Exit Art Gallery in SoHo for the opening of a different kind of
genome annotation project, a show entitled ``Paradise Now:
Picturing the Genetic Revolution'' by 39 artists probing the social
meaning of genetics. The works tackle such themes as genetic
identity, species boundaries, biotechnology, evolution and racism.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific revolutions may start with dry, objective data, but
their ultimate impact depends on human interpretation in a societal
context. Scientific milestones set off a search, often a struggle,
for the metaphors and images that will be used to connect the
findings with our daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo's discovery in 1610 that Jupiter had moons shook his
world's foundations because it undermined the religious image of an
Earth placed at the center of creation, with all heavenly bodies
orbiting it. After a drawn-out battle, the image came to be
replaced by a picture of humans alone on small planet circling a
mediocre sun in a backwater of an ordinary galaxy in an
unimaginably vast and empty cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Intriguingly, the Vatican showed that it won't make the same
mistake twice: when scientists in 1996 reported possible evidence
for ancient life on Mars in a meteorite recovered from Antarctica,
Roman Catholic officials swiftly said that such a possibility did
not conflict with religious doctrine, but revealed God's greater
glory. Likewise, the struggle over the meaning of the human genome
is already under way. The language and imagery will be important
because it will shape society's choices in the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   GENETIC DETERMINISM
</P>
<P>
   To what extent will we regard ourselves as constrained by our
genes?
</P>
<P>
   Brain function, color perception, reaction times, rate of memory
formation and personality are surely affected by slight sequence
variations in genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors and
biosynthetic enzymes.
</P>
<P>
   But do these gene sequences define limits that we must live
within or influences that may, if understood, be overcome or turned
to an advantage?
</P>
<P>
   I already detect a naive biological determinism in some popular
writing on genetics, stretching the science far beyond the data.
Human beings may not be blank slates, but neither is there evidence
that the chromosomes contain the legendary handwriting on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   I'm suspicious of the language of limits. The gene pool has not
changed significantly over the past 5,000 years, but human society
and individual opportunity have been transformed. Moreover, history
is littered with supposedly scientific pronouncements about the
limits of women, African-Americans, Southern Europeans, Asians and
Jews. Science has done a singularly poor job when it has sought to
define limits on human potential.
</P>
<P>
   GENETIC DISCRIMINATION
</P>
<P>
   To what extent will we seek to pigeonhole people based on their
genes?
</P>
<P>
   Humans are a remarkably homogeneous species, with any two
people, regardless of racial or ethnic group, being 99.9 percent
identical at the genetic level. (By comparison, two random
chimpanzees in Africa show a fivefold greater difference.) Still,
the residual 0.1 percent translates to roughly 3 million spelling
differences, with some conferring dramatically higher risk of
Alzheimer's disease or breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Will we see genetic variation as an economically efficient way
to divide people based on group or individual risk of disease? Or,
we will say, ``There but for the grace of God go I,'' and choose to
stand together?
</P>
<P>
   Will we speak of genetic defects or genetic variants?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, some DNA changes are unquestionably negative mutations,
destroying the function of a crucial protein. But many of the
common ones are likely to confer mixed blessings __ perhaps an
increased risk of infection by one pathogen, but greater resistance
to another. It's easy to slip into thinking in terms of deviations
from an ``ideal'' genotype, although population genetics instead
suggests the image of a genetic tapestry is closer to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   GENETIC MODIFICATION
</P>
<P>
   The hardest question is, ``To what extent will we decide to
reshape the genes we pass to our children?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of my close colleagues are already proposing ways to
``re-engineer'' what they view as an ``imperfect'' human genome _
to prevent cancer, slow aging, or enhance memory. These are serious
goals, not to be lightly dismissed. Yet, I find it unsettling that
we've only just skimmed the 3-billion-year-old genetic text and
already they're saying, ``Hey! I think I can improve on this!''
</P>
<P>
   Safety is, of course, a major concern. Given the subtleties of
human physiology, quick genetic fixes are likely to do more harm
than good. And, the prospect of a ``product recall'' from the human
gene pool is too surreal to contemplate. But there will come a time
when we can do such things safely, and it's not too soon to ask
whether we should. Will we adopt the image of humans as a product
of manufacture, rather than a product of nature? If we cross that
fateful threshold, I don't see how we can ever return.
</P>
<P>
   I part company from some of my colleagues here. While I'm
strongly opposed to laws limiting scientific investigation, I would
support a ban on modifying the human germline. Society could always
repeal the prohibition if we become technically adept enough and
morally wise enough. But we should have to rebut a strong
presumption against tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I'm back home in my study sifting through genome
analyses for the scientific paper. I have to explain periodically
to my three wonderful children why Dad is holed up working on the
weekend. I try to give them a sense of what I am laboring over.
And, as I do, I find myself attempting to imagine the new world and
new world view that they will inherit as a consequence of our
science. And hoping that they'll be proud.

 &HT;    Day3 main death story
 &HT;    Treat patient's suffering as well as the disease
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - For Sharon Morgan, the conversation didn't take
place until her mother arrived at the emergency room, in septic
shock for the fourth time in less than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, she didn't expect Dr. Basel Yanes to suggest letting
her mother die. She knew sepsis, a common infection among cancer
patients, is life-threatening on its own. She's a registered nurse.
``But in our minds, this was something you could fix,'' she said.
Her mom had survived it three times.
</P>
<P>
   But come to think of it, Mary Monnin had shared some regret
about surviving that last sepsis. Even if she pulled through this
time, she didn't figure to live more than another two months while
her multiple myeloma became progressively more painful. Her living
will was clear that she didn't want to endure a lot of heroic
measures to extend her life.
</P>
<P>
   All Yanes had to do for Morgan, her father and 11 siblings, was
connect the dots. ``He knew this was a good time to let go,''
Morgan said of Yanes, who directs cancer care at Miami Valley
Hospital and chairs its palliative care committee.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation Yanes initiated doesn't happen often enough or
soon enough, dozens of health care workers and patients' family
members agree. They told the Cox News Service that is the main
reason barely two in 10 people use hospice services when a loved
one has a terminal illness, and those who have hospice services are
there for a median length of only 29 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to let go,'' Morgan said. ``You don't want to let
go. But I'm very glad he brought it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients and families generally don't want to discuss impending
death and doctors don't know how to. They aren't trained in
breaking bad news, and more fundamentally, they aren't trained in
battling anything beyond illness and injury, even though the need
for care continues after that battle is lost
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to bring the mindset of physicians more into making
sure the patient's suffering is treated in addition to the disease
being treated,'' Dr. Richard Wyderski said.
</P>
<P>
   That is the purpose of the elective course Wyderski teaches to
new doctors in Wright State University's internal medicine program
at Miami Valley. It's called palliative medicine, which is the
comforting treatment that goes on after the classic curative
treatment has failed. More and more residency programs also are
incorporating hospice care.
</P>
<P>
   Monnin, 69, did not go to a hospice but received some of its
psychological benefits in Miami Valley's palliative care program,
which shares the hospice philosophy that terminal illness brings
the opportunity to actually live today as if it might be your last.
She achieved another goal of palliative care by dying about 12
hours after her trip to the ER in July and bypassing the
disheartening steps of deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was there one day and the next day she was gone,'' Morgan
said. ``There was no in-between. She could still go to the bathroom
by herself and take a shower. The in-between is what's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fears of dying patients are pain and becoming
burdens to their families, research shows. A report in the May 16
Annals of Internal Medicine listed several other elements of what
hospice advocates now are calling a ``good death.''
</P>
<P>
   They want to be involved in medical decision-making and prepared
for what their disease will do to them. To resolve conflicts and
say goodbye. To energize their spirituality. To remain with loved
ones. To keep contributing to others' well-being. And to be
recognized until death as complete people, not overlooked or
dismissed like wallpaper or a finished novel.
</P>
<P>
   They also want to stay alive as long as it's absolutely possible
to keep living meaningfully. Good-death advocates forget to mention
that sometimes, but for people experiencing it, ``good death'' can
be ``a tough phrase to swallow,'' said James Londis, Kettering
Medical Center's ethics director.
</P>
<P>
   There is concern, even among those committed to palliative care,
that doctors should not be so enthusiastic about hospice advantages
that they prepare a patient for death before all reasonable options
are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``People beat the odds every day,'' said Mary Murphy, who leads
a Hospice of Dayton team that draws on specialties in grief
counseling, financial management, psychology, spirituality,
nursing, home care and pain relief. ``If you're a doc and you've
seen that, you're thinking any person could be one of them. Some
people, you don't know why they make it out the doors, but they
do.''
</P>
<P>
   So even when doctors decide no more can be done to cure a
disease, Yanes said they keep accounting for the possibility that
they're wrong. ``You tend to err on the side of doing more than
doing less. You can reverse that decision. You can't reverse the
decision to let the patient die.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes experience to learn when trying to extend a life ``is
really just extending the dying process,'' said Dr. Cathie Zofkie
of Kettering Medical Center, who specializes in caring for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most physicians are not trained to do these things,'' Yanes
said. ``We learn how to treat diseases, but we lack knowledge in
the areas of emotional support and how to break bad news to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to learn that caring for patients is not just helping
control their disease, but also helping them learn to live with
their disease. Our job is also to relieve suffering, control their
symptoms, help them emotionally to deal with the disease. I think
we need to learn that when we fail to control a disease, that does
not mean our job ends.''
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental model of medicine changes at that point, said
Miami Valley pain specialist Dr. Townsend Smith. All the basic
medical goals of diagnosing and curing are abandoned in favor of
alleviating symptoms. Whether the symptom is nausea or pain,
loneliness or depression, palliative care requires the same focus
that an oncologist takes when downplaying the side effects of
chemotherapy for the primary goal of curing the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   That shift toward comfort can't completely take place without a
conversation among doctor, patient and family. The subject is less
taboo than it was, said Beth Delaney, Miami Valley's
palliative-care coordinator. ``But it's not something we routinely
discuss with every patient, and I think that's where we need to
go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and families don't always want to have that talk,
though. ``One researcher refers to us as the temporarily
immortal,'' Wright State medical ethicist Robert Reece said. ``We
all like to think of ourselves as immortal.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, that delusion is more comforting than pain medication.
``They equate getting treatment with hope,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Others don't believe there's an advantage to hospice care, often
out of misunderstanding. Research by the National Hospice and
Palliative Care Organization indicates fewer than one in 14
Americans associate hospices with pain control or family support.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it widely known that hospice care is covered by Medicare
and more than 80 percent of health plans for large or medium-sized
businesses. Medicare saved $1.52 in 1995 for every dollar it spent
on hospice services, largely by replacing more expensive
hospitalization, according to the national hospice organization.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's mother had her own reasons for avoiding hospice. She
was comfortable with the people at Miami Valley and didn't want to
be constantly interrupted by strangers. She didn't even like it
when Morgan took her blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some families are afraid, 'You're not going to take as good
care of my loved one,' if they choose hospice or palliative care,''
Delaney said. ``We give the same attention to the patient in a
palliative-care mode as we give to the patient in the next bed with
open-heart surgery. The care just has a different purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients don't choose hospice or palliative care to hasten their
deaths but to improve what remains of their lives, said nurse Kathy
Hayes, who coordinates the hospice unit at the Dayton VA Medical
Center. Hospice of Dayton surveys indicate about six of every 10
families wish their loved one had been sent there sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are astounded by our environment,'' Hayes said. ``It's
not a depressing, oh-my-gosh-people-are-dying-here. Our emphasis is
on enjoying the time you have left.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a time for ``finishing unfinished business,'' Murphy said.
``Who do you want to talk to? What do you want to do?''
</P>
<P>
   VA psychologist Nicole Best calls it ``righting wrongs,
forgiving each other, remembering good times and bad times.'' And
everyone connected to hospices talks about relieving pain.
</P>
<P>
   Physical pain can almost always be controlled after doctors have
given up on fighting the disease, pain specialist Smith said.
Higher doses of pain medicines can be given. Patients aren't taking
therapeutic drugs that cause pain. The question is how sedated the
patient wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   Even patients who die after feeding tubes are withdrawn do not
appear to suffer greatly, Zofkie said. Their blood pressures and
heart rates aren't those of people in pain. ``It's more painful
psychologically for the people watching,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Physical pain is easier for most dying patients than their
functional impairments, Smith and Zofkie said. Some can no longer
swallow. Others develop shortness of breath. Anxiety attacks are
fairly common.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person with ALS is not really having any pain,'' Smith said.
``He just can't use his arms or his legs. There can't be anything
more miserable than that. That situation is much more difficult for
improving the quality of life.'' But as he said, palliative care
can concentrate on quality of life as its only goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they never have to give up hope,'' said Dr. Geetika Kumar
of the VA hospice. People beat the odds all the time. The hospice
guideline of six months' remaining life is not an unbreakable rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put many people in hospice who prove me wrong,'' Zofkie
said. ``That's not a failure. I think if every patient you put in
hospice winds up dying, then you're probably not putting enough
people in hospice. You're waiting too long until it's obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens during hospice and palliative care, it's not
likely to begin unless the doctor, patient or family initiates that
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The talk really should be just another step in the doctor's
ongoing communication with them, Yanes said. ``By understanding the
patient's and family's wishes, we can identify situations that can
help them say goodbye or stop aggressive treatment and move on to
the palliative.''
</P>
<P>
   Kumar doesn't go into the discussion by saying it looks like the
patient's not going to make it. ``I will tell them that yes, the
disease is terminal, but you can make the best use of this time for
any last wishes you have, any remorse you have,'' she said. ``The
patient usually understands. Patients usually know when their time
has come.''
</P>
<P>
   They might even be relieved to learn they don't have to keep
trying to save their lives, said Hospice of Dayton's Murphy. Or
they might also slam the figurative door in the doctor's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to emphasize is, when the time is right, do
patients know their choices,'' she said. ``Just as they know they
can get treatment, they also need to know there's a point when
repairing their bodies is no longer possible and what their options
are then. That's part of being an informed consumer, too.''

 &HT;    Practical Grandma has seen it all, and discloses almost all of
it
 &HT;    By The Practical Man
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - The practical man went to his grandma
for advice last week.
</P>
<P>
   He figured he'd Q&AMP;A the 90-year-old Indiana native. She's seen
two world wars, the Great Depression, raised three children, a load
of grandkids, scrimped, saved and survived it all. Surely, he'd get
plenty of practical tips.
</P>
<P>
   He got a beating instead.
</P>
<P>
   No, the rickety oldster didn't whip out the wooden yardstick she
busted over his head when he lied to her about the broken lamp back
in '69.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't dig up the tattered tennis shoe and thump his rump
like she did when he sassed her in '71.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't even try to cram another cake of Palmolive in his
mouth _ despite the cussing. Even she could understand the
practical man's dip into the dark side this time, given the topic:
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, she did a little swearing
</P>
<P>
   herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lands o' Goshen!'' she howled. ``You better watch out. That
girl's boy-crazy!''
</P>
<P>
   Painful words, for the girl in question was the practical man's
16-year-old daughter, who recently proclaimed that she's ``in
love'' _ and not with the practical man.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Forget her father _ that soft and soothing spirit
who babied her diapered behind and wiped her nasty nose. Dump that
dear old doofus! So what if Pop bandaged her boo-boos, blew bubbles
on her belly and wasted weeks wading through algebra with her?
Scratch that slate clean! Barbies and makeup and princess outfits
and glitter pens _ bah! Get the gummy geezer out of her sight!
</P>
<P>
   Oops! The practical man was digressing. He didn't come to
Grandmother's house to whine. He came to explain his plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I figure I'll be in the front yard nonchalantly firing up
the chain saw the next time this pimply puke ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Oops! At that point, the practical man lost his train of thought
again, for the image of his daughter's boyfriend distracted him.
This young fella, one Jacob _ so young, so handsome, so innocent _
wait _ so uninnocent! Sweet mother of heaven! The practical man was
16 once, and he'd be danged if he'd have let himself date his
daughter!
</P>
<P>
   Grandma, what to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, for Pete's sake! Don't you have any sense? A saw won't do
any good when a girl is boy-crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   No? Then how about a sledgehammer? Ax? Please Grandma, wise the
practical man up!
</P>
<P>
   ``Merciful heavens! Think about it, son. There's only one thing
that'll keep a young woman and a young man apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Cough it up, Grandma! The practical man needs help!
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, for crying out loud. I shouldn't have to tell you
everything! You have to go with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Go with her?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yes! Sit right between them, keep them apart. Take all
the fun out of it! That's how my mom fixed me when I was boy-crazy,
and that's what I did with your mom. Nip the hanky-panky in the
bud, that's what I say. Otherwise, we'll all be sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandma, that might not work ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Hush! You wanted the facts. And no going out after dark!''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. And you guys thought the practical man was extreme. On
other topics, though, the Practical Grandma took a less radical
line.
</P>
<P>
   PM: Grandma, give me some money advice.
</P>
<P>
   PG: Ooh, that's easy! Pay cash, son. Even for cars. I like my
credit card, but I always pay it off at the end of the month.
You're silly to pay interest to those crooks.
</P>
<P>
   PM: How about cooking. What's the most practical meal?
</P>
<P>
   PG: The most practical meal is whatever the cook wants to eat!
Hee hee! If the rest of the family doesn't like it, tough! Beggars
can't be choosers.
</P>
<P>
   PM: What's the best thing about being married?
</P>
<P>
   PG: You're trying to get me to talk about sex, aren't you? Well,
I'm not going to do it, Mr. Smarty Pants! I don't know what the
best thing is, but I know what I remember. When I got married, I
was 18, and I used to love to wash my husband's clothes! I scrubbed
them on a washboard, and it made me feel so free! I was grown up, I
was a woman. I'll always remember that.
</P>
<P>
   PM: What's the biggest mistake parents make nowadays?
</P>
<P>
   PG: I don't want to stick my nose in anyone's business, but I
think it's wrong to give a child an allowance. Parents should buy
kids what they need when they need it, and get them what they want
when they deserve it. And then when kids get old enough to start
making money on their own, they should give you a little something
out of every paycheck. My land! It's the least they can do!
</P>
<P>
   PM: Last question, Grandma. What's the secret to long life?
</P>
<P>
   PG: Oh, gracious! I don't know. I thank the good Lord, of
course, and then I think maybe it's two things, but you're not
going to like the first one: No drinking! I've never tasted a drop,
and I'm not about to start now. The other thing is hot peppers. I
love 'em _ eat 'em raw, with just a little salt. They keep you
clean on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in the interest of fairness, the practical man opens
the floor to nuts ... Oh, wait, the practical man didn't mean to
say nuts. He meant to say readers who are intelligent, yet somehow
misguided and muddle-minded ... Dang! Wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's just call them readers who disagree with him.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: I enjoy your column but was bewildered by
Sunday's response to the troubled parent with the boys in sports.
</P>
<P>
   I was waiting for the ``Only Kiddin'' one liner, but it never
happened. Man, what have they done to you? Life is not all this or
all that. It's all about balance.
</P>
<P>
   My eldest of three daughters, age 12, is a soccer star and
parents routinely approach me asking how I got her to be so
competitive, to outwardly show desire, commitment, drive to
succeed, intensity and discipline. Whaddaya know, an early example
of the ultimate employee!
</P>
<P>
   Growing up as a jock, I thrived on competition. I learned to
work hard if I wanted results, what I started I finished, it takes
a team to win, goal setting, learning how to win and lose with
pride, knowing I did my very best, a strong work ethic and
discipline. I believe it's not competition that is evil but
complacency, a laissez faire, Jimmy Buffett, kickin' back approach
to life which is, by its nature, self-destructive. Failing to
attain your potential through conscious inaction is the `evil'
which you should rail against.
</P>
<P>
   I will end by saying this _ this same daughter baby-sat an
infant next door full-time during the summer. She spent her first
week's pay on her 5-year-old sister to purchase her a baseball
glove, bat and ball. Success in life is built on a firm foundation
of balance. The intense sportsman is also the most generous loving
daughter in the world.

</P>
<P>
   Our objective is to assist customers in making the correct

   Would it have been better if you were ignored and not
greeted?... Is it not sad that when you were greeted and offered
help, you assumed that this person was the ``enemy'' instead of
someone to help you, a friend?... You mention ``bullets flying''
when it appears that the only shots being fired are by you.
</P>

   The saddest thing about this article is your preconceived idea
of what shopping might be.... Most people want to be assisted and
appreciate the knowledge of a professional salesman who can assist
them in a purchase.

   Your article was shortsighted, narrow-minded, and was totally

DOMINGO HOOKS UP WITH ILM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Placido Domingo, new artistic director of the Los Angeles Opera,
has come to town with a little ``Star Wars'' in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   A long-talked-about collaboration between the local opera
company and George Lucas' special effects company, Industrial Light
&AMP; Magic, will come to fruition in May 2003 for an all-new,
two-season staging of Richard Wagner's epic Ring Cycle, which
includes such works as ``Das Rheingold,'' ``Die Walkure'' and
``Siegfried,'' Domingo said.
</P>
<P>
   Early design plans are ``so spectacular ... I can tell you it
will really be quite different,'' the opera great said in a press
conference at the Music Center on Monday to announce the L.A.
Opera's future plans.
</P>
<P>
   During the 2001-02 season, the company will present eight staged
productions and one opera in concert. Of the nine works, seven have
never been performed by the L.A. company.
</P>
<P>
   The season opens Sept. 4, 2001, with a new production of
Tchaikovsky's ``Queen of Spades,'' along with a new production of
Wagner's ``Lohengrin,'' directed by Academy Award-winning actor
Maximilian Schell.
</P>
<P>
   Following ``Lohengrin'' in October 2001 will be a revival of the
company's 1999 production of Verdi's ``La Traviata,'' to be
conducted by Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   In December 2001, the company will offer Franz Lehar's ``The
Merry Widow.''
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the 50th anniversary of the death of composer Arnold
Schoenberg, who died in Los Angeles, the company will present a
single concert performance of his monumental ``Moses und Aron,''
conducted by the L.A. Opera's principal conductor, Kent Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   The season will also feature performances of Bach's ``Mass in B
Minor,'' Mozart's ``Die Zauberflote,'' Puccini's ``Turandot'' (with
a new ending composed by Luciano Berio), along with Bartok's ``Duke
Bluebeard's Castle'' and Puccini's ``Gianni Schicchi'' (both
directed by Academy Award-winning director William Friedkin).

   COKE-REPLAYTV _ Coca-Cola Co. has inked a deal to become one of
the first advertisers on ReplayTV, a fledgling service that lets
watchers record shows without videotape and alter the way they
watch live programs. Dubbed ``personal television,'' ReplayTV and
rivals such as TiVo could change the way people use the tube.
Digital video recorders pose challenges for advertisers, however,
because they can make it easier than ever to skip commercials.
Coke's deal could help the company find a way to splash its name in
front of ReplayTV viewers, including through sponsorship of
ReplayTV's high-visibility viewer menu. (Leith, Atlanta

   OLYMPICS-OZ _ Welcome to the Olympics of Oz. These Games Down

Michael Johnson, Maurice Greene, a pack of Austin-based swimmers
and thousands of the best athletes from around the globe are poised
to put on a riveting, heart-swelling and heart-tugging show, the
likes of which are staged only once every four years. The Summer
Olympics command world-wide attention like nothing else in or
outside of sport, and this time around the drama will be played out
against a dazzling and exotic backdrop. Oz is an Aussie nickname
for their homeland. We're not talking an HBO show, but a real penal
colony experiment begun in 1788 when 11 ships of Britain's First
Fleet sailed into the harbor here. This same port can now glisten
as brightly as any Emerald City, especially when fireworks are
cascading over the sail-shaped Sydney Opera House, as they will
when these Olympics begin. (Maher, Austin American-Statesman)

of the areas include the overall play of the defense, which has

   ``THE LAST RIVER''
</P>
<P>
   By Todd Balf
</P>
<P>
   (Crown, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 16, 1998, world-class kayaker Doug Gordon went over an
8-foot waterfall on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet. As three
fellow boaters watched horrified from shore, an obviously sluggish
Gordon tried to right himself in the roiling water but could not.
He was swept into the main current and never seen again. The
kayakers were exploring ``the Everest of rivers,'' writes Balf,
``every bit as mysterious, myth-laden, and malicious as the
unconquered summit was when Sir John Hunt's expedition arrived at
its icy doorstep in 1953.'' It's tempting to compare his book to
Jon Krakauer's (beginitalic)Into Thin Air(enditalic), and it's true
that if you liked it you'll probably like this one. But there are

   ``THE UNEXPECTED LEGACY OF DIVORCE''

</P>
<P>
   Here are two faulty beliefs that form our attitudes about
divorce: If the parents are happier, the children will be happier
too. And divorce is a temporary crisis that exerts its most harmful
effects on kids at the time of the breakup. The truth, writes
Wallerstein, is more complex and disturbing. Her previous books
reported on a core group of 131 children of divorced parents,
recruited and interviewed in 1971 and revisited at the five-, 10-
and 15-year marks. This book represents a 25-year follow-up of
those children, who now are 28 to 43. The findings? Divorce has
long-term ramifications, and its biggest effects occur only as
children grow up and embark on relationships of their own. It
alters the way they view the prospect of raising children and
leaves many with a lifelong fear of abandonment and betrayal. In
short, divorce changes everything. This excellent book will inspire
heated discussion on a subject that affects all modern families.

   There's something to be said for books that make you cry, but
we're too soggy to know what it is right now. Consider that a
warning. Payton was writing his autobiography before he died last
fall, and Yaeger has salvaged the book by interspersing
biographical passages about Payton's life - his Mississippi
childhood, his evolution as a football player in the newly
integrated South, his pro career in Chicago, his family, retirement
and battle with liver disease and cancer - with first-person
reminiscences from Payton and his family and friends. It's a moving
way to portray a good man who was loved fiercely by many people.
Among the contributors are Jim Brown, Matt Suhey, Jim McMahon,
Roland Harper and John Madden, but it's Mike Ditka who steals the
show with an eloquent and emotional eulogy. As one reporter said,
Payton's liver went bad but his heart went on forever. If you can
read this with dry eyes, you're a sturdy soul indeed.

   ``THE LAST RIVER''
</P>
<P>
   By Todd Balf
</P>
<P>
   (Crown, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 16, 1998, world-class kayaker Doug Gordon went over an
8-foot waterfall on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet. As three
fellow boaters watched horrified from shore, an obviously sluggish
Gordon tried to right himself in the roiling water but could not.
He was swept into the main current and never seen again. The
kayakers were exploring ``the Everest of rivers,'' writes Balf,
``every bit as mysterious, myth-laden, and malicious as the
unconquered summit was when Sir John Hunt's expedition arrived at
its icy doorstep in 1953.'' It's tempting to compare his book to
Jon Krakauer's (beginitalic)Into Thin Air(enditalic), and it's true
that if you liked it you'll probably like this one. But there are
no heroic rescues here, no amateurs among the men on the river that
day. Balf conveys the skill and motivation of the kayakers and the
ensuing controversy among members of the paddling community who
wondered if Gordon and his colleagues should have been on the
Tsangpo at all.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past 20 years, biologists have voiced increasing
concern about the monarch butterfly's most threatened and critical
habitat, a single stretch of Mexican forest to which hundreds of
millions of these butterflies migrate from the United States each
year to spend the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in spite of intense interest in this region, which is
thought to be the species' Achilles' heel, little had been known
about how these forests were actually faring.
</P>
<P>
   Now an international team of researchers has reported that what
was a broad swath of thousands of acres of intact forest just 30
years ago has been reduced to peppered remnants in a sea of farms,
homes, cattle grazing areas and logged and degraded woods. This has
occurred even in areas designated as protected monarch sanctuaries
for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, the first scientific study of the monarchs' habitat
in the mountains of central Mexico, mapped forest changes using
aerial photographs taken over three decades. The findings, which
were made available to The New York Times, showed that only a
little more than half of what was intact forest remained. The rest
has suffered some degree of degradation, from minor logging to
having had the forest entirely removed. The researchers estimate
that in 50 years, at the current rate of deforestation, nearly all
the original forest will be similarly degraded.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen there year after year, I predicted it
would be bad and getting worse,'' said Dr. Lincoln P. Brower, a
monarch biologist at Sweet Briar College who was an author of the
new study with colleagues at Universidad Nacional Autonoma de
Mexico and the World Wildlife Fund. ``But I didn't predict it would
be this bad. The maps just floored me.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, undertaken to assist in the Mexican government's
review of the monarch's wintering areas, has not yet been submitted
for publication but has been given to the government. In response
in part to the findings, the Mexican government unveiled a proposal
last Thursday for the creation of an expanded preserve _ already
ardently contested by some local residents _ that would be more
than three times the size of the current protected areas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karen Oberhauser, a monarch ecologist at the University of
Minnesota who was not involved in the study, praised the quality of
the work, saying: ``It's the first study and a really important
study. We didn't expect the change to be this great.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country now, monarchs are beginning their fall
migration, an annual trek that takes the butterflies from across
the central and eastern United States and Canada down to the
mountains of central Mexico. There they roost as they have for
millenniums, clustered in wintering areas sprinkled throughout what
were once dense, remote mountain forests. They remain there until
spring, when they fly north once again to breed. In each area, the
butterflies gather in massive roosting groups coloring the fir
trees in the orange and black of their wings.
</P>
<P>
   In order to study changes to the forests since the roosts were
discovered 25 years ago, the researchers examined a series of
aerial photographs taken in the 1970s, 1983 and 1999 of a
100,000-acre area that includes three of the most important
wintering sites, each of which was designated as a preserve in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   What researchers found was that not only was forest disappearing
both inside and outside the preserves, but it was being removed in
such a way that what forest remained was highly fragmented. Much of
the forest had been significantly thinned, a process leading not to
regeneration but instead to further degradation. Over the 28-year
period of the study, the average size of the conserved patches of
forest decreased nearly 90 percent, from 5,000 acres to 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if we're talking about the clearcuts of the
Western states in the U.S.,'' said Dr. Guillermo Castilleja, an
author of the study who is the World Wildlife Fund representative
in Mexico. ``Here people go in and selectively log. They take
certain trees. They take saplings for fence posts or beams in their
homes. Then as forests become more degraded they are used for
grazing by sheep or cows.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, even in remaining forest stands, trees are more
exposed to wind, drying, greater temperature extremes and are more
at risk of fire, all of which make the forests less suitable as
resting grounds for the butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the degradation, rough estimates of the area occupied by
monarchs in the wintering grounds do not show any dramatic
decreases in the butterflies so far, though anecdotal evidence
suggests that monarchs have begun to feel the effects.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Brower said that in one region where there has
always been a large monarch colony, development has encroached to
the point that the once remote roosts of monarchs are now dangling
in trees right next to farm fields. This winter, the butterflies
startled biologists by abandoning the site, moving over the
mountains to a more intact forest area an increasingly rare
commodity - that they have never used before.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists on the study collaborated with Mexico's Ministry of
the Environment, Natural Resources and Fisheries in the design of
the new reserve, which, they say, takes the biological needs of the
monarch into much better account than previous reserves. Previous
protected areas were 40,000 acres in total and dispersed over five
separate sites. The proposed new reserve spans 140,000 contiguous
acres, more adequately covers known wintering sites and is designed
to protect not only the individual roosting areas but the
watersheds of which the forests are an integral part.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the expanded preserve will suit
the needs of local people well enough to prevent the illegal
logging that has devastated current reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, reserve proponents say, is that in 1986,
when the Mexican government set aside the first sanctuaries, land
was appropriated without compensation for the area residents who
owned the land communally. As a result, researchers say, many
residents are angry and have shown a blatant disregard for the
prohibition of logging inside the sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the hopes of curbing illegal logging in the new sanctuary,
Mario Huacuja, director of communications for the ministry, said in
a telephone interview last week that in collaboration with private
foundations, the ministry was negotiating a novel system to pay
local people for their lost logging rights in the preserve. In
addition, there will be payments to people who help protect or
restore the forest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Castilleja said payments, which are to be administered by the
World Wildlife Fund and another private conservation group, Fondo
Mexicano para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza, will come from $5
million that will be provided by an anonymous source once final
action is taken to create the new preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the monetary incentives, there is already opposition to
an expanded preserve. Some have argued, for example, that the money
being offered for logging rights, about $16 per cubic meter of
wood, is below the market value and that residents will lose money.
Last Thursday, when the new sanctuary was announced, several
hundred angry residents staged a protest at the ministry, the local
press reported. The ministry is accepting public comments on the
new preserve until Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Others note that whatever the monetary incentives, it will
always be difficult to prevent illegal cutting in an area as
desperately impoverished as that around the wintering grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis Frey, behavioral ecologist studying monarchs at
California Polytechnic State University, said that on a recent
visit to a monarch sanctuary with a group of scientists, the sound
of their approach silenced the work of a nearby, but hidden,
woodsman.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the next two hours, as we headed up toward the
butterflies, there was no cutting,'' he said. ``But as soon we got
back into our vehicles to go, the chop, chop, chop started up again
immediately.''

COLLEGES SEEK TO REIN IN NETWORK-CLOGGING NAPSTER ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Clarifies, in 10th graf, that Gartner Group did survey.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The routine at Amherst College generally went this way: Students
like Chris Fargis woke up, logged on to Napster.com's Internet
library of recorded music, entered a search for a few tunes _ a
little indie rock, a little hip-hop _ and then went off to class.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster activity by Fargis and dozens of other students
burned up the campus computer system through the day, often taking
a stunning 50 percent of Amherst's network capabilities. Some
professors, like biologist Stephen George, became so frustrated
that they gave up using the Internet in class, or started coming in
at 7 a.m. to do research online.
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon, meanwhile, students were itching for their Napster
finds. ``It's just really nice to leave for class and come back and
have them there,'' said Fargis, a senior, of the songs he
automatically received on his computer.
</P>
<P>
   But no more. Starting this fall, Amherst is blocking all access
to the well-known Napster site. Smith and Hampshire colleges are
doing the same, citing rampant overuse of the popular, and
controversial, site. Other schools are trying less direct, and more
unusual, solutions: Mount Holyoke College, for one, has begun
monitoring Internet usage of each student _ and will question those
who are taking up too much bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   While the courts have become the chief battleground over the
legality of Napster _ which accommodates the electronic copying and
distribution of copyright music _ a secondary skirmish is taking
place exactly where the controversial software was invented and
thrived: college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, lawyers for recording artists asked Harvard, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and nine other schools to
join in a nationwide campus ban on Napster.
</P>
<P>
   With countless students downloading music from the Internet site
for free, arguably violating copyrights, colleges have ``a moral,
ethical, and legal obligation'' to block access, according to a
letter the lawyers sent the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is already facing a federal appeals court hearing,
expected in October, over whether its sampling service is
infringing on the rights of artists and record companies. The
outcome could well determine how involved colleges need to become
in the debate _ and for now, they want to avoid it as much as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard and MIT officials said Friday that they would consider
the request to block Napster, but added that they were reluctant to
filter the Internet on campus.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent national survey of 50 colleges by Gartner Group,
about one-third reported that they blocked access to Napster's
site. For schools that ban, questions about academic freedom and
the free use of the Internet have inevitably surfaced. Yet, those
issues have ultimately been sidestepped in most cases, as
administrators imposed bans as a way to relieve computing systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't taken a stand on the legal issues,'' said Philip
Fitz, Amherst's director of information technology. ``If the courts
are having trouble deciding that, it doesn't seem we would be able
to make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The costs Napster posed to Amherst exceeded the $25,000 in
estimated bandwidth use, Fitz said. Students paying tuition were
losing out because they couldn't zip around the Web quickly for
research projects or other uses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Smith College, complaints among professors began to mount as
well. ``We weren't thrilled about blocking, but there was great
concern that academic scholarship was being interrupted because of
the congestion,'' said Herbert Nickles, who oversees information
technology at Smith. ``It would take an hour to download the data,
rather than five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mount Holyoke officials also grew irritated about Napster's use
this year, but were loath to adopt a ban. Instead, they are handing
out a memo to students this month saying that activity on the site
``must be curtailed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a computer security official will analyze
online activity _ though not the content of it _ for each student.
Those found using much more bandwidth than others, in turn, will
get a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they work with us, there's not a big deal,'' said Susan
Perry, the college's director of library, information, and
technology services. ``And if they don't, we'll just cut them off
the network.''
</P>
<P>
   But some computer specialists at other colleges took a dim view
of both strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you block Napster, you'll just encourage it to take on a
different form that's harder to block,'' said Scott Conti, the
network operations manager at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst. ``And at public institutions, there's a whole freedom of
speech issue. We don't want to be inspecting traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Conti, among others, predicted that Web-savvy students would
hack their way through colleges' blocking technology and back into
Napster. It was a former Northeastern University student, Shawn
Fanning, who wrote the Napster program; some other undergraduates
are already trading safecracker tips in Internet chat rooms,
recommending using the off-campus computers of friends as Web
portals with which to access Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't found a way around the block yet, but I wouldn't be
surprised if there was a hack out there,'' said Fargis, who buys
music regularly but uses Napster to find live, unreleased, or
especially rare tracks.
</P>
<P>
   But Karen Chau, another Amherst senior, said she thinks the ban
will hurt Napster because many won't inconvenience themselves with
trying to break onto the site. The average student, she said, uses
Napster to procrastinate _ searching for songs to pump them up as
their homework sits on another screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole reason people used Napster was because it was
easy,'' Chau said. ``Everyone felt kind of guilty about using it. .
. . But now, they're annoyed.''

   Works by Faberge In Wilmington Show
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's largest exhibitions of the work of the
jeweler and goldsmith Peter Carl Faberge has opened at the
Riverfront Arts Center at 800 South Madison Street in Wilmington,
Del. ``Faberge'' features more than 1,000 works from museums and
private collections, including objects from the State Hermitage
Museum in St. Petersburg and the Moscow Kremlin Museums that have
never been seen in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Faberge was the official jeweler of czarist Russia, and the show
highlights the luxurious tastes of Russian and European
aristocracies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Exhibits
include at least 10 imperial Easter eggs, a family of silver
rabbits from the former collection of the king of Bulgaria, and
decorative boxes and cigarette cases in gold and enamel. Several
items are on loan from royal families, such as a gold- and
silver-mounted diamond-set tiara shaped as a myrtle wreath from the
Duke and Duchess of Westminster.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admission, by timed entry, includes a brief orientation and a
45-minute recorded tour; advance ticket purchase is recommended.
The price is $14.50, with discounts for seniors, children and
students. ``Faberge,'' through Feb. 18, is open Tuesday to Sunday 9
a.m. to 7 p.m., with the last entry at 5. Tickets: (888) 395-0005
or on the Web at www.faberge-exhibition.com.

   Completed on Malta
</P>
<P>
   The Hal-Saflieni Hypogeum, a Neolithic site in the town of
Paola, Malta, reopened to the public last month after a nine-year
restoration. The 6,000-year-old Hypogeum, discovered in 1902, is
thought to be one of the largest and most complex examples of
prehistoric rock-cut chamber tombs in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance has been covered by a chamber to keep the humidity
and temperature at proper levels to protect the caves. Visitors
enter in groups of 10 at set times. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The site, built without metal tools, has three levels. There are
more than 30 chambers, some with elaborate carvings, as well as
paintings in ocher. The numerous statues, amulets, figures and
vases found in the Hypogeum are now at the Valletta Archaeological
Museum in the Maltese capital, with a small selection displayed at
the site.
</P>
<P>
   Four visits a day are scheduled, at 9, 10 and 11 a.m. and noon.
Tickets cost $6.90, at 2.3 liri to the dollar, and can be purchased
only on site; it is advisable to get them a day in advance. From
the Valletta bus station, there are numerous buses to Paola.

   A Mark of Authenticity For Aboriginal Art
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to steer tourists away from fake Aboriginal art _
much of it mass-produced in Asia _ a nonprofit group representing
indigenous Australian artists has introduced a label to help
visitors recognize the real thing. The National Indigenous Arts
Advocacy Association's labels have begun appearing on individual
souvenir items such as boomerangs and T-shirts with Aboriginal
designs, and also on the windows of approved shops. The association
hopes the program will also boost indigenous artists' shares of an
industry that generates more than $120 million a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the label, artists must submit an application for
approval by two Aboriginal leaders willing to vouch for the
artists' identity and acceptance within their community. More than
300 artists have already registered for the label. The association
expects the list to grow into the thousands as its workers reach
more remote Aboriginal communities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the program is still in its infancy _ the labels made
their debut in June _ arts and crafts bearing Aboriginal designs
but not the association's label aren't necessarily fakes.
</P>
<P>
   The association can be reached in Sydney at (61-2) 9241-3533.

   Freshwater Aquarium Opens on Lake Superior
</P>
<P>
   The Great Lakes Aquarium, which says it is the first aquarium in
the United States with all freshwater tanks, recently opened on the
shore of Lake Superior in Duluth, Minn. It examines the geology and
plant and animal life of the lake, as well as the effects climate
and humans have had on it. The aquarium contains 70 species of fish
along with otters, frogs and turtles.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-foot-long model of the Great Lakes allows visitors to float
toy boats from Lake Superior to the St. Lawrence Seaway via the
lakes' system of locks. Visitors can also use a camera to look at
tiny living organisms native to the lake's sandy, rocky bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The aquarium is at 353 Harbor Drive in Duluth. It is open 10
a.m. to 6 p.m. daily except Thursday, when it will close at 9, and
Sunday, when it will close at 4 (Sept. 17 is the last Sunday with a
summer 6 p.m. closing time). Beginning Sept. 18, admission will be
lowered by a dollar to $9.95, $4.95 ages 4 to 17 and $7.95 ages 62
and over. Information: (218) 740-3474 or www.glaquarium.org.

   A Haven in the Heart of the Left Bank
</P>
<P>
   Suite 801 of the Pont Royal, according to a manager of the Left
Bank hotel, is the only hotel room in Paris with a view over the
entire city _ or at least its heart and its major monuments, from
the Invalides to Sacre-Coeur to Notre-Dame. Among the viewing
points in the suite, done in mauve toile de Jouy, are two terraces
and even the bathroom, which has two windows.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not that view is unique, standard and deluxe rooms on
the sixth and seventh floors, cozily tucked under the mansard roof,
offer delightful vistas over Paris rooftops. There is a total of 10
suites and 65 rooms, with two-line phones and in-room faxes and
dataports. The decor in the gracious 1920's building is classic and
understated, with rooms attractively done in tones of coffee, coral
or plum.
</P>
<P>
   Reopened a year ago after a major renovation, the hotel added a
small fitness center and massage room in the basement, and a
conference room on the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, there were sightings of Sartre and de Beauvoir in
the hotel bar and spacious restaurant, Les Antiquaires, long a
hangout for literary types. Today the lunch crowd is more likely to
be politicians, journalists and fashion folk, as well as people
from Gallimard, the publishing house just down the Rue de
Montalembert; Antoine Gallimard himself lunches there often.
Favorite dishes on the luncheon menu include beignets of crayfish
and mushrooms ($14.50, at 7.53 francs to the dollar) and red fruits
in sabayon sauce ($6.50). In the morning, the restaurant is a
comfortable setting for an ample buffet breakfast ($20).
</P>
<P>
   Just off the Rue du Bac near its juncture with the Boulevard
St.-Germain, the Pont Royal offers air-conditioning, pleasantly
efficient service and an island of calm in this busy part of the
Seventh Arrondissement. A few steps away is the Rue du Bac Metro
stop, not unimportant given Paris' increasingly fierce traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Pont Royal Hotel, 7, rue de Montalembert; telephone (33-1)
42.84.70.00, fax (33-1) 42.84.71.00. Doubles $259 to $305; suites
$425 to $597.

<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ After more than five years of concerns and
planning, the first of a new set of cases to protect the original
U.S. &UR;  &LR; Constitution and other key national documents is ready to
replace older encasements that have begun to break down.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers with the federal government and private contractors
have built the first of new airtight enclosures that they say
should preserve the founding documents of the nation for more than
100 years and help make them easier for people to view.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the National Archives and Records Administration will
let the public see one of the new cases for the first time. The
rarely seen second page of the Constitution will go on display for
three days behind the laminated tempered glass of its up-to-date
titanium and aluminum enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the original page will go back into a vault and an
early model of the case containing a facsimile of the Bill of
Rights will anchor an exhibit on efforts to preserve the documents
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   All six pages of the foundation documents of the country, known
as the Charters of Freedom, will be in new encasements when the
rotunda of the National Archives building, where they are
displayed, reopens in 2003 after extensive renovations. The
rotunda, one of Washington's most popular tourist attractions, will
close on July 5, 2001, for reconstruction that will make the
documents more accessible to the handicapped and other
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The Charter documents are the original parchment sheets on which
are written the Declaration of Independence, the four pages of the
United States Constitution and its first 10 amendments, known as
the Bill of Rights. George Washington's transmittal letter for the
Constitution will also be re-encased in one of the new enclosures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Charters of Freedom are the primary records of the nation,
the underpinnings of our society,'' said John W. Carlin, archivist
of the United States and head of the archives administration. ``We
are going to do everything we can to preserve them while keeping
them accessible to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The new encasements, which look like large, deep picture frames,
are to replace smaller ones made in 1952 by what was then the
National Bureau of Standards. The new cases are being made and
tested by the bureau's successor agency, the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, known as NIST.
</P>
<P>
   More than five years ago, keepers of the documents began
noticing subtle changes in the old, bronze-framed enclosures, which
hinted that the glass was beginning to deteriorate. Under special
lighting, a haziness was noticed in areas of inner panes of glass
that touched parts of the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of
Independence. Conservators also noticed tiny white flakes in some
enclosures, possible evidence of unwanted chemical reactions caused
by air and excessive moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Outside experts commissioned by the Archives concluded that
there was no immediate danger to the documents, but recommended
looking into new enclosures.
</P>
<P>
   The old enclosures are a sandwich of three panes of glass
supported by bronze brackets and sealed with lead strips, with the
entire assembly then placed in an outer bronze frame. The document
rests on a sheet of pure cellulose backing paper covering the back
glass pane. A thin glass cover lies atop the parchment to hold it
flat. There is an empty space above this inner pane and a top sheet
of glass in front. The middle glass sheet touching the parchment is
the major concern with the old case, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers pumped air out of the enclosure and filled it with
helium, an inert gas that displaces oxygen and inhibits chemical
reactions, and enough water vapor to produce a relative humidity
inside of 25 to 35 percent before sealing it. Parchment, which is
stretched and cured animal skin, needs some moisture to keep it
from becoming brittle. But too much water can cause the material to
swell and can promote the growth of organisms if they are present.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Judson, an engineer who serves as the Archives' project
manager for the new encasements, said preliminary tests of gases
from some of the old enclosures indicated that the concerns were
warranted. Relative humidity in these cases was found to range from
41.4 percent to 48.5 percent, higher than expected, and
oxygen-containing air was found in the containers holding Page 3 of
the Constitution and the transmittal page.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seal on the Page 2 enclosure looked fairly good, but the
seals on Page 3 and the transmittal page appeared to be leaking,''
Judson said. ``It looks like we were correct in moving ahead with
the new enclosures as soon as we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with more than 20 criteria for the new cases dictated by
the Archives, including high visibility for the documents and the
ability to open and re-seal the cases, engineers produced a working
model early last year and spent more than a year refining it into
prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   The standards institute is building nine cases, seven to house
the documents and two prototypes that will serve as backups. Two
cases will be slightly larger than the others, measuring 39 and
one-quarter inches tall, 37 and fifteen-sixteenths inches wide and
3 and one-sixth inches deep, because the Bill of Rights is larger
than the other documents. The other cases, sized for the
Constitution, will be 33 and five-eighths inches wide, but will
share the other dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   The Archives settled on a case that has a solid aluminum alloy
base, with sections milled out of the bottom to reduce weight that
give it a honeycomb appearance. A channel that goes around the
front edge of the base contains a tin-coated metal seal ring which
compresses when the case is tightened to create an airtight seal
with upper layers.
</P>
<P>
   Covering the enclosure and sitting atop the base is a two-layer,
three-eighths-of-an-inch-thick sheet of laminated, tempered glass
that is bonded with a layer of plastic to resist shattering. The
enclosure is bolted to a titanium metal frame that clamps the glass
against the seal ring.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For aesthetic reasons, the gray-colored titanium is
nickel-plated to bond an outer coating of 24-carat gold. Inside
each enclosure is a thin, perforated aluminum document platform
that stands about an inch high on three, snap-out posts. This
platform is detachable so that it and the attached document can be
removed from the enclosure if disassembled.
</P>
<P>
   The document is to rest on pieces of pure cellulose paper
specially made at the University of Iowa, and both will be affixed
to the platform with thin clips of clear polyester film that exert
almost no pressure. Each piece of parchment has irregular, unique
edges and both the platform and paper for each document will be cut
in its shape so as not to be visible beneath.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a number of design changes in the enclosures
since the first engineering model was completed last year, Judson
said. For instance, engineers reduced the number of bolts to 70
from 80. They also added two covered instrument bays in the base,
he said, one for valves used to fill and purge the cases with gases
and the other for humidity and temperature sensors.
</P>
<P>
   The cases will be filled with inert argon gas instead of the
helium used in the earlier enclosures because argon is a larger
molecule that is less likely to escape. And conservators decided to
keep the relative humidity inside the new cases at 40 percent,
higher than planned for the earlier containers, to more closely
match outside conditions in the event the enclosures must be
opened.
</P>
<P>
   To help check conditions inside the enclosures if internal
sensors fail, engineers decided to install an external monitoring
system that measures water vapor and oxygen content based upon
changes in the wavelengths of a special light beamed into the case.
This required putting two small optical windows, each covered with
a sapphire lens, in the base of the enclosure and a set of three
mirrors in a box beneath the document platform inside the case.
</P>
<P>
   With this system, developed by Aerodyne Research Inc. of
Billerica, Mass., light from an argon discharge lamp goes into the
enclosure, reflects off the mirrors and is measured coming out.
Changes in wavelength of this light caused by water vapor or oxygen
absorption should help conservators monitor the gaseous environment
inside the encasements, said Andrew Freedman, who helped develop
the system for Aerodyne.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the old cases also gives conservators their first chance
in five decades to closely examine the documents with modern
techniques. As each page comes out of its old case, the Archives
staff will remove tiny surface plugs from an edge to study the
parchment, said Kitty Nicholson, one of the conservators.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers will examine the fibers of each document and catalog
their individual characteristics and state of deterioration. By
comparing the condition of each sample with what is known about
other old parchment and unexposed examples in reference
collections, conservators will establish a standard of
deterioration for each document, Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   As each document comes out of its enclosure, it is placed on a
special vacuum suction table encased in highly humid air, a process
that slowly flattens parchment warped by years of changing
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with Page 2 of the Constitution and its transmittal
page, conservators are methodically examining each line of script,
which was written with iron-based gall ink that has discolored and
grown more brittle with age. Ink flakes seen pulling away from the
parchment are being reset in place by putting minuscule drops of a
special collagen solution behind them with tiny needles. This
``glue'' is made by cooking gelatin with pieces of new parchment to
make a jelly solution full of collagen protein fibers that are
found naturally in animal skin, Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lynn Ritzenthaler, another conservator working on the
documents, said microscopic examination of the parchments had so
far shown no evidence that the deteriorating glass of the old
enclosures had marked or otherwise affected the documents. But she
said there had been some surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see remnants of original rule lines used to help writers
keep their lines straight,'' she said. Conservators also found
evidence of insect feeding on the bottom edge of the transmittal
page, which occurred at some point before its first encasement.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the pages also gives conservators their first look at
the back sides of each page, which are not well documented. The
back of the Constitution's second page revealed a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the back of Page 2, we see the intimation of a hand print,
a very faint impression we didn't know was there before,''
Ritzenthaler said. ``We have no idea who it might belong to, but it
opens things up for a lot of speculation.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A broken band of showers and thunderstorms, some with heavy
rain, will precede a cold front slowly pushing east from the Great
Lakes. Meanwhile, winds from the south-southeast along the
Northeast Seaboard will continue to direct muggy air inland.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, some locations near Dallas will have the first
measurable rain in over two months as showers develop ahead of a
cold front. The clouds and showers will also bring cooler weather
to parts of the southern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front moving south from the Canadian Rockies will mark
the leading edge of noticeably cooler air. Some of this chilly air
will arrive in the East this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Florence, which formed Monday, will remain nearly
stationary about 400 miles east of Jacksonville, Fla.

   Each night from mid-August through October meteorologists are
blinded when, for two hours, the satellite that monitors North
America and the Atlantic loses power. During that time, from the
point of view of the satellite, there is a solar eclipse. The
solar-powered satellite is in a geostationary orbit 22,500 miles
over northern South America. Each year around the equinoxes, the
Earth passes between the satellite and the sun. In the fall, the
data loss can interfere briefly with hurricane tracking, but other
weather observations from ground-based instruments and
reconnaissance aircraft help fill the void. &QL;

   Many parents might be surprised to learn that most of the drugs
prescribed for children, from allergy relievers to asthma inhalants
and antidepressants, have never been formally tested on children.
Starting this December, however, a new Food and Drug Administration
rule mandates that any new adult drug that the FDA decides could be
used by children with the same disease must undergo pediatric
study, and its manufacturers must list doses for children on the
label. In addition, if an adult drug already on the market has the
potential to help children with the same disease, or if it is
widely used in children and the absence of labeling seems
dangerous, the FDA can require pediatric tests.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA was, in part, shaped in response to high-profile
tragedies involving children, including the severe birth defects
caused by thalidomide, a sedative given to pregnant women in the
late 1950s. But Dr. Dianne Murphy, associate director of the
agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, says that for a
host of ethical, scientific and economic reasons, the agency has
not mandated drug research on children, until now.
</P>
<P>
   In a major shift of policy, the federal government is now using
a combined carrot-and-stick approach to induce drug companies to
study children. Three years ago, Congress offered a lucrative
financial incentive for drug manufacturers, giving them a six-month
patent and marketing extension on drugs they agree to test in
children at the FDA's request.
</P>
<P>
   With such prodding, more than 275 clinical trials involving
nearly 20,000 children are completed, in progress or about to
begin. Advertisements soliciting children's participation in the
trials are appearing in newspapers, on public transportation and on
the Internet. Already, the new research has led to expanded labels
with clear pediatric dosage instructions for 11 drugs widely
prescribed for children, from painkillers to treatments for
allergies and HIV &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Times spoke with Murphy, 55, a pediatrician with 25 years'
experience who is leading efforts to get medications tested on
children.
</P>
<P>
   Q. At the moment, it seems pediatricians and parents must play a
guessing game with most medications. Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   A. When you go to treat your kid's fever, you want to know that
you're going to make them feel better. Or that you're giving them
the right dose to treat their infection. But up to 81 percent of
all products used on children have not been studied or labeled for
infants and children. We're treating our children without studying
the medicine to the degree that we require these drugs to be
studied and understood in adults.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How is it that the FDA has regulated drugs for adults and not
for children?
</P>
<P>
   A. The laws to mandate that we study drugs often were based on
terrible accidents with children. And yet children have not been
studied because people wanted to protect them from experimentation.
Ironically, that has led to a decades-long experimentation on our
children.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do doctors go about figuring out a dose without adequate
information?
</P>
<P>
   A. Of course they'd check the Physicians' Desk Reference to see
if there was any additional information. Three-quarters of the
time, there isn't. But all pediatricians carry around a little
handbook, called the Johns Hopkins Harriet Lane Handbook, which is
small enough to fit in the pocket of your lab coat. You get it when
you're a resident and you hang on to it for the rest of your life.
It contains all the information about dosages that the pediatric
community has collected, based on experience or studies that were
done in a limited way. I'll tell you what I do on the phone with
parents in the middle of the night: I look it up in my Harriet Lane
and calculate by weight. But parents can't always remember what
their children weigh. And then there's the parents who don't call.
They are guessing, and that clearly isn't the way to take care of
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've heard that weight isn't always the best way to measure
doses in children.
</P>
<P>
   A. That's true. You need to know the right dose for each age
group's metabolic state. At some ages, because of the differences
in enzyme maturation and total body water, kids actually need a
higher dose. With some of the anticonvulsants and drugs for
treating asthma and cancer, kids can tolerate higher doses and
actually need higher doses to get the same blood level you'd get in
an adult with a lower dose.
</P>
<P>
   Infants, on the other hand, don't metabolize medicine as well
because their liver and kidneys are immature in the first months of
life. If you go simply by weight, they're going to end up with
levels of the medicine in their bloodstream that are too high and
can be toxic.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why has it taken this long to get these studies done?
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually, the agency had been on this bandwagon since the
1970s, trying to get products studied in children. But it became
clear that, unless something dramatic happened, all of the pleading
wasn't going to change [the situation). We were asking drug
companies to tell us what they were doing about pediatric drug
development. But those regulations had no teeth; it was a strictly
voluntary thing.
</P>
<P>
   And there were ethical issues as well. Most everybody would
agree that, in general, you don't want to be putting a brand-new
molecular entity into a kid before it's tested first in older
adults. But there's a difference between saying we need information
before we give it to kids and never getting any information.
</P>
<P>
   HIV brought this into glaring focus. For years, the drug AZT was
available for adults with HIV, but not for kids. Children were
dying, and we couldn't use AZT to treat them because it hadn't been
studied in children.
</P>
<P>
   Those studies finally took place, but it took years for the drug
to be available to kids as a regular prescription drug. Today,
because of that experience, in the HIV area we almost always get
studies done on children early in the drug development process.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've heard that, until recently, emergency room doctors who
wanted to use the sedative Versed on kids had to rely on animal
data from beagles.
</P>
<P>
   A. Versed is a drug that's very commonly used to sedate people
before operations. Under our new regulations, for the first time
the [manufacturer of Versed) studied its effect on children,
particularly children with heart disease. And they found that if a
child with pulmonary hypertension was given the same dose, he would
be more likely to have breathing problems. They also found out that
you may need different dosing in obese children. If you did it on a
weight basis, you might overdose the child.
</P>
<P>
   So yes, there are life and death issues here. But the most
common problem is: Parents want to know that if their kids aren't
getting better, it's because the disease is getting worse _ not
because they're giving their kid the wrong dose.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What drugs can parents safely assume have been tested?
</P>
<P>
   A. Most of the antibiotics, all the vaccines and most of the
fever suppressants. And a number of the seizure medicines have been
studied down into younger age groups. Most of the psychotropic
drugs have not been studied in children.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can you safely assume that a child, even a very sick one,
understands the risks involved enough to say that he consents to
being part of a clinical trial?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Academy of Pediatrics suggests that about the age of 7,
children cognitively begin to understand risk. Somewhere around 7,
the kid can begin to understand what you tell them. But that
process is very time-consuming and very difficult and has to be
done by people who know how to put it in language that kids can
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, you have to have to know how to do clinical trials in
children. A kid isn't going to sit there and hold their arm out and
say, ``Oh yeah, go ahead, just take my blood.'' You've got to
create a situation where children don't feel threatened, and where
they understand what's going on. You need one nurse to talk to the
child while the other one is drawing the blood. And you've got to
somehow turn it into a game.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the technology issue. Ordinarily, with an adult,
you'd draw a blood sample at several one-hour intervals. But you
can't take large volumes of blood from a kid over a short period,
unless you want to make them hypotensive. So we had to wait for the
technology to get accurate results from small volumes of blood to
monitor a drug's effect on the liver, kidneys and white cells.
Hospitals for children have had that technology for a couple of
decades now. But until now, not everybody had that.
</P>
<P>
   Also, we are only now starting to pin down, on the molecular,
receptor level and developmentally, how kids are different from
adults. And that whole field is in its early childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So this big, black hole of information is not simply the
fault of pharmaceutical firms who don't want to shoulder the costs
of these studies?
</P>
<P>
   A. I wouldn't say there's no economics here _ these trials are
difficult and expensive. Not many people were interested in doing
pediatric studies until Congress offered drug companies a
[financial incentive). Since then, the interest in studying
products in children has increased dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are these clinical trials going to test drugs on sick kids
only? Or are healthy kids going to be included as well?
</P>
<P>
   A. The FDA has decided that kids in clinical trials have to,
potentially at least, receive a direct benefit. In cancer trials,
that's a really a very well-practiced approach. You would never put
a cancer drug into a person who didn't have cancer. In general, the
kid should have the disease that's being studied.

PANEL URGES MONITORING OF CHRONIC DISEASES
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Mont.) By PHILIP J. HILTS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pew Environmental Health Commission and 13 top public health
groups have proposed that the United States establish a system to
count and monitor chronic diseases like birth defects, asthma and
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   A report from the health commission, based at the Johns Hopkins
School of Public Health, said that while scientists had managed to
map the human genome and could track infectious diseases with some
speed and accuracy, they still lacked basic information about
chronic diseases, like how often they occur, whom they afflict,
where they frequently occur and the environmental factors
associated with them.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell Weicker, the commission chairman and the former governor
of Connecticut, said, ``We responded quickly to the threat of West
Nile virus, tracking and monitoring every report of infected birds
and people, but 20 years into the asthma epidemic, this country is
still unable to track where and when attacks occur and what
environmental links may trigger them.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, endorsed by several public health groups, including
the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association and the
American Public Health Association, noted that a survey conducted
for the commission showed that Americans believe, erroneously, that
chronic diseases are being monitored.
</P>
<P>
   The misperception comes from the small surveys done on different
diseases that often suggest, for example, that a disease's
occurrence is rising. But, said Dr. Thomas Burke, leader of the
study that produced the report, surveys cannot give the vital
information needed to help solve the mystery of how diseases move
and what may be causing them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the diseases and disorders that are not counted and
tracked, but should be, the report said, are asthma, emphysema,
birth defects, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy,
autism, mental retardation, and a variety of cancers, especially
childhood cancers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report said, toxic agents that are not
monitored, but which are suspected of causing disease, include
pollutants like PCB's and dioxin, dangerous metals like mercury and
lead, and pesticides. The Environmental Protection Agency sets
limits on how much of some of these substances can be put into the
environment, but it does not track them and try to link their
effects to human diseases.
</P>
<P>
   An example of the failure to monitor chronic diseases and
possible environmental causes was the case of Libby, Mont., the
report said. In that town of 2,700, an epidemic of respiratory
diseases, including asbestosis, unusual cancers and emphysema, has
been unofficially noted for decades. Only this year did a federal
investigation find that a vermiculite mine not far away had been
releasing tons of tremolite for 50 years. Tremolite is a natural
but rare and highly toxic form of asbestos. Investigators estimate
that 200 residents have died from diseases associated with the
substance, and many more are ill.
</P>
<P>
   Active tracking of respiratory disease ``might have picked this
up much sooner, and started preventive activities 10 to 20 years
ago,'' said Dr. Henry Falk, administrator of the federal Agency for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.

LOS ALAMOS INJUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The plea agreement between federal prosecutors and lawyers for
nuclear weapons scientist Wen Ho Lee _ in which the government
dropped 58 of the 59 counts in its indictment _ amounts to an
admission that the prosecution had no case against a man who spent
nine months in prison, too often in shackles and solitary
confinement.
</P>
<P>
   If it is viewed in the most general and positive light, the
government's belated confession of error can be taken as evidence
that the American justice system includes a self-correcting
mechanism. In that view, there should be something reassuring in
the prosecution's tacit acknowledgment that Lee did not pass
nuclear secrets to a foreign power, did not alter the strategic
balance of power, and did not lie to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   After all, from the very beginning Lee has conceded that he
downloaded classified nuclear codes from a secure computer within
Los Alamos to an unsecure computer within that federal laboratory.
Among scientists working at Los Alamos, he told ``60 Minutes,''
this kind of negligence was ``a very common practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The one count to which Lee pled guilty was his negligent
downloading. For this offense he deserved to be fired. Even if
there was no question of espionage and even if others were equally
careless about security rules, these are rules that must be
enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it now seems plain that Wen Ho Lee was made to
suffer inordinately for the government's incompetence and for a
bureaucratic effort to cover up its own bungling.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI agent recently admitted that he testified falsely that
Lee was deceptive with a colleague whose computer he used to
download classified codes and that Lee intended to use computer
tapes in a job search abroad. These were symptoms of excessive
prosecutorial zeal and perhaps also of a willingness to mislead the
court, but they were not the government's worst misdeeds. The fibs
told by the FBI came at the end of a long skein of unfounded
assumptions and obtuse attempts to tamp down the furor of
politicians who had been stampeded into believing that China was
stealing the ``crown jewels'' of America's nuclear weapons
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The government had no reason to assume originally that the X
Sector, or nuclear weapons division, at Los Alamos had to be the
source of a damaging security leak. There were more than 500
computers in federal government offices and private sector defense
contractors that received the design of the miniaturized W-88
warhead that Beijing had obtained by 1988. And there was no good
reason to assume that Lee was the likeliest espionage suspect.
</P>
<P>
   If there were damaging leaks or spies within the nation's
nuclear weapons establishment, then the foolish pursuit of Wen Ho
Lee made it easier for the thieves to get away with their theft
while making it harder for Los Alamos to recruit and retain able
scientists. The government's blunder harmed national security as
much as it harmed one scientist who was unjustly imprisoned.

THE WEST END IS STARSTRUCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 17) 
 By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Want a big theatrical success? Hire yourself a
celebrity, preferably a film star. This blunt wisdom has recently
brought Kevin Spacey, Cate Blanchett, Nicole Kidman and others to
London, and, with Jerry Hall replacing Kathleen Turner as the
seductive Mrs. Robinson, is currently ensuring that a
none-too-brilliant adaptation of ``The Graduate'' is packing the
Gielgud Theater. And the trend is set to continue this fall.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Hannah, a lovelorn mermaid in the 1984 movie ``Splash,''
plays the human siren in George Axelrod's ``Seven Year Itch''
(Queen's, Oct. 9), a role made famous on screen by Marilyn Monroe
and her billowing white dress. Then it's the turn of Macaulay
Culkin, who opens at the Vaudeville in mid-October in ``Madame
Melville,'' a play about a teen-ager sexually involved with a
French teacher played by Irene Jacob, who won Best Actress at
Cannes in 1991 for the film ``The Double Life of Veronique.'' Some
will suspect this is merely an excuse for the baby-faced actor to
kick-start a stalled career; but the author is Richard Nelson, the
American dramatist who has had no fewer than eight plays performed
by the Royal Shakespeare Company, last year winning an Olivier
Award for his ``Goodnight Children Everywhere.'' The omens are
better than cynics might think. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Hollywood influx finished. Nobody would be likely to
revive O'Neill's intense and grueling ``Long Day's Journey Into
Night'' in the West End these days with a mere theatrical dame as
the morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone; but with Jessica Lange in the
role the play is deemed worth the risk and will open at the Lyric
on Nov. 21. The presence of Charles Dance as Mary's husband, James,
a lightly disguised version of the famous actor who was O'Neill's
father, won't harm the production's chances, either.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry. Not all major stage performers are in
hibernation this fall. Simon Callow is now at the Comedy, offering
a lively portrait of the great Victorian in Peter Ackroyd's
``Mystery of Charles Dickens.'' Opening at the same theater on Nov.
15, Michael Gambon is to play the foul old tramp Davies alongside
Rupert Graves in a revival of ``The Caretaker'' by Harold Pinter.
That superb actress Janet Suzman is the wife whose fidelity is
interminably tested by her actor-husband in Molnar's ``Guardsman,''
which is at the Albery from Oct. 11. Felicity Kendal and Frances de
la Tour open at the Apollo on Oct. 25 in Noel Coward's gorgeously
flippant tale of frivolous women, ``Fallen Angels.'' Derek Jacobi
is scheduled for a yet unnamed theater in November in ``God Only
Knows'' by Hugh Whitemore, in whose ``Breaking the Code'' he had a
huge success in the West End and on Broadway 14 years ago. And
before then, on Sept. 21, the Redgrave siblings, Vanessa and Corin,
will have opened at the National in Trevor Nunn's revival of
Chekhov's ``Cherry Orchard.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National is pretty busy this fall, and certainly busier than
the RSC, whose openings at the Barbican are a small-scale
``Tempest'' and ``Duchess of Malfi,'' with the exciting young
Aisling O'Sullivan as Webster's doomed heroine. But the National
has already launched its new season by presenting Simon Russell
Beale's brilliantly fresh Hamlet, and is following up this critical
triumph with revivals of ``Romeo and Juliet,'' Ibsen's ``Peer
Gynt'' and Michael Frayn's preposterously funny ``Noises Off,'' as
well as Pinter's stage version of the film script he constructed
from Proust's ``Remembrance of Things Past'' and a play by the
unknown Zinnie Harris, which I much admired at this year's
Edinburgh Festival. ``Further than the Furthest Thing,'' as it's
called, involves islanders based on those who were forced by a
volcano to abandon their primitive life on Tristan da Cunha in the
1960s and find sanctuary in England. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fall also brings London two major musicals. One is Andrew
Lloyd Webber and Ben Elton's ``Beautiful Game'' (Cambridge, Sept.
26), about a soccer team in religion-riven Ulster, and the other
the latest of a series of shows that, for no clear reason, involve
French subjects. ``Lautrec,'' a musical about the painter, was an
early summer flop at the Shaftesbury. Quasimodo is still flaunting
his hump in ``Notre Dame de Paris'' at the Dominion, a show that
has impressed the public more than it has the critics. And on Oct.
17 the Shaftesbury plays host to ``Napoleon,'' a musical by Timothy
Williams and Andrew Sabiston that rumor says is more likely than
either to match the success of ``Les Miserables'' and ``The Phantom
of the Opera,'' both of which still illumine the West End. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are also intriguing prospects for those venturing beyond
mainstream Shaftesbury Avenue and the big national companies. I
myself can vouch for the quality of Gary Mitchell's ``Force of
Change,'' a highly topical tale of police corruption in Ulster that
follows David Hare's new ``My Zinc Bed'' into the Royal Court on
Nov. 8. I liked ``Howie the Rookie,'' Mark O'Rowe's play about
near-Homeric violence in Dublin that returns to London's
outstanding pub theater, the Bush, on Oct. 27. I enjoyed a young
actor called Jason Watkins, who reprises a hilarious performance as
a harlequin in Goldoni's ``Servant to Two Masters'' at the New
Ambassadors on Dec. 14. But I'm also hoping for a bit of stimulus
from the work opening, sight unseen, at the three most fashionable
of London's small theaters, the Donmar in Covent Garden, the
Almeida in Islington and the Royal Court's studio playhouse, the
Theater Upstairs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sam Mendes may have established himself as a successful
moviemaker with his Oscar-winning ``American Beauty,'' but he's
still the artistic director of the Donmar, and marks his return to
the theater staging a play by a completely unknown dramatist. Nick
Whitby's ``To the Green Fields Beyond,'' about a tank crew in World
War I, opens on Sept. 25, and will be followed on Dec. 11 by a
pocket revival of Sondheim's ``Merrily We Go Along.'' Meanwhile
Mendes' contemporary Stephen Daldry, whose extraordinary production
of ``An Inspector Calls'' by J.B. Priestley is in its fifth year in
the West End, directs a new play by Britain's leading female
dramatist, Caryl Churchill. Her ``Far Away,'' about strange doings
in a weird old mansion, opens in its attic theater on Nov. 30. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And what follows the darkly comic ``Conversations After a
Burial,'' the latest play by Yasmina Reza, author of ``Art,'' into
the ever enterprising Almeida on Oct. 31? The answer is ``Light,''
an adaptation of a novel about a man who leaves his village in
search of love, and returns bearing death in the form of a
plague-ridden rabbit, by the Swedish writer Torgny Lindgren. What
gives this play special interest is that the company responsible is
Theatre de Complicite, despite its name the most highly regarded of
English troupes specializing in physical theater. Would most
British critics rather see this odd-sounding piece than yet another
Hollywood star in yet another revival? You bet.

   Train to the Redwoods
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have never seen the redwoods of northern California and am
eager to do so, on a cross-country rail trip. My friend and I are
75 and 80, respectively, and would really enjoy seeing the United
States this way. _ J.C. Lieberman, Clifton, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is indeed possible to get within striking distance of the
magnificent redwoods by train, although it is a trek, with several
hours' wait for connections in Chicago and Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Black, Amtrak's director of special projects, recommends a
route to Klamath Falls, Ore., three and a half hours from Crescent
City near the California border, a departure point for the state
and national coastal redwood parks.
</P>
<P>
   For the four-day trip from Washington, D.C., the Capitol Limited
from Union Station to Chicago leaves daily at 4:05 p.m., arriving
at 9:35 a.m. For the next leg, through the spectacular Colorado
Rockies and Sierra Nevada, you switch to the California Zephyr,
departing Chicago at 3:35 p.m. and arriving at 4 p.m. two days
later in Sacramento; there you would board the Coast Starlight,
which leaves at 11:59 p.m. and arrives at 7:55 a.m. in Klamath
Falls, where you could pick up a rental car. (An agreement with
Hertz enables you to reserve your car there through Amtrak, and to
be picked up at the station free.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prices depend on availability and date, but one thing you can
count on is a 15 percent discount for those age 62 or over. Your
best bet is the Explore America fare, at $429 each round trip ($499
between June 15 and Aug. 20 and Dec. 15 to Jan. 2), with an
additional $563 to $842 one way for a shared sleeper; all meals
included. That means your total round trip on coach, with the
discount, comes to $843.20 a person with the least expensive shared
sleeper.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd prefer to fly back, Amtrak has an agreement with
United, which means you'd avoid paying the premium one-way fare
(you'd also get United's 10 percent senior discount); the one-way
train trip can cost from $250 to $450, without accommodations. In
any case, for the lowest train fares, reserve several months ahead;
call Amtrak at (800) 872-7245.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing in Greece and Turkey
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm thinking about renting a sailboat for two or three
couples for a three-week cruise in the Greek Islands and off the
Turkish coast. Can you help? _ R.E. MacDonald, North Kingstown,
R.I.

   A. There are many options for chartering a yacht to sail in the
Greek Islands and along the coast of Turkey. Grace Firogenis, a
spokeswoman at the Greek National Tourist Organization in New York,
and a skipper herself, says that spring and fall are the best times
for sailing, with May and September the best months of all. (In
summer, prices are higher, there may be no wind and it may be very
hot; winter, of course, can be cold, with rough seas.)
</P>
<P>
   But combining Greece and Turkey on a single chartered yacht is
problematic, as exit and entrance papers are required when crossing
into Turkish waters, as well as inspections and a fee of about
$600, and papers are required for the reverse course into Greek
waters as well.
</P>
<P>
   One American company that specializes in charters in both
countries and handles air transportation, transfers, land tours and
hotels is Albatross Yacht Charters, Box 250, Moorestown, N.J.
08057; (800) 377-8877, fax (856) 778-7555;
www.albatrosscharters.com. Founded in 1982, the company has a fleet
of more than 200 boats and can offer one-way charters, so you don't
have to take a circular route.
</P>
<P>
   A sailboat for two to eight people is typically 30 to 61 feet,
and can be chartered with an English-speaking skipper and cook
($135 and $100 a day respectively) or with no crew, that is,
``bareboat.'' (To charter a boat without a local skipper, a resume
showing experience sailing a similar-size boat in open water is
required.) Bareboat charters cost $1,000 to $5,000 a week,
depending on the size of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   For a three-week sail combining Greece and Turkey, in order to
avoid the delay and expense of crossing into the other country's
waters, Tim Monsul, the president, suggests sailing to Rhodes after
two weeks in the islands and taking the ferry from Mandraki to the
Turkish port of Marmaris, where you can pick up a Turkish-flagged
boat.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 Greek brokers are listed with the Hellenic Yacht
Brokers Association (Box 3093, Athens 10033, and on the Web at
www.biznet.com.gr/sail/brokers), which means they are licensed to
charter yachts by the National Greek Tourist Organization. Closer
to home, the Greek National Tourist Organization, at 645 Fifth
Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022, (212) 421-5777, fax (212) 826-6940,
has a list of 10 U.S. companies that offer such charters. Prices
for boats large enough for six range widely, from $1,000 and up a
week for a boat without crew to $7,000 to $12,000 and up for one
with crew.
</P>
<P>
   While a spokeswoman at the Turkish Tourist Office in New York
said it could not make specific recommendations, it does have a
list of charter companies; call (212) 687-2194.

   Hiking in Switzerland
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I would like to take a group walking tour in
the Swiss Alps next summer, with our baggage being delivered to
each evening's lodging destination. Do you know of such tours? _

<P>
   A. Wanderweg Holidays, based in Cherry Hill, N.J., (800)
270-2577, fax (856) 321-1040, Web site www.wanderwegholidays.com,
offers two ``hiking without luggage'' packages in Switzerland. The
``self-guided'' hikes consist of groups as large as 18, said Phil
Scheidt, Wanderweg's president, who began organizing Alpine hikes
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day Three Resort Walk is through the Grisons
(Graubunden), a region of Alpine lakes, that includes Davos, Arosa
and Lenzerheide. The hikes are moderate; to avoid very steep
climbs, hikers take the cable car from Davos to Strela Pass, at
7,200 feet, then walk a gradual ascent to Arosa, about five and a
half hours, where their bags are waiting at the hotel. The tour
includes a full day in and around Arosa, followed by a four-hour
hike to Lenzerheide, beginning with a gondola ride. This trip is
offered from mid-July to October, and this year cost $769 to $910 a
person, double occupancy, without air fare, depending on your
choice of a three-star or four-star hotel; meals and cable car
rides included.
</P>
<P>
   The Five Resort Walk begins and ends in Sierre, in the Valais
region to the south, and costs $769 for 6 nights, $1,189 for 10,
without air fare.

&HT;     BUSH, GORE COURT WOMEN VOTERS IN HARD-FOUGHT RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican George W. Bush appealed to elderly women worried by
prescription drug costs and Democrat Al Gore touted his nationally
televised kiss with ``soul mate'' Tipper Gore as the rivals on
Monday courted the female voters who could decide the outcome of
their hard-fought contest for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   With the latest polls showing Gore enjoying a slight lead over
Bush thanks to his edge among women, the two candidates are
devoting much of the coming week to issues with appeal to women _
health care, education, conservation and protecting children from
violence and sexual content in television, movies and music.
</P>
<P>
   Bush carried his campaign into the once GOP-reliable state of
Florida to persuade senior citizens that his plan for voluntary
prescription drug insurance would help bring coverage under the
1960s-era Medicare program in line with modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the $158 billion package of Medicare changes and
creation of a prescription drug benefit ``will make the system
modern.''
</P>
<P>
   Doffing his suit jacket to campaign in a shirt and tie, Bush
told senior citizens in Clearwater that his plan would provide
greater choice for coverage in contrast to a Gore plan would force
them into a ``government-run'' health maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan offers elderly Americans the choice of staying
within Medicare, the federally-subsidized health insurance program
forged in the 1960s, or joining a private plan that would provide
similar benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush planned to highlight his proposals to strengthen health
care for senior citizens again on Tuesday during a campaign
appearance in Orlando as he wages a five-state, cross-country
campaign swing that also takes him to Missouri, Washington,
California and New Mexico by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Gore shed his policy-laden campaign persona to
devote an hour-long appearance on Oprah Winfrey's Chicago-based
television talk program, showing a charming, playful side that
voters rarely see.
</P>
<P>
   Gore explained that his three-second embrace of his wife of 30
years at the Democratic convention reflected ``an overwhelming
surge of emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This was a great moment in our lives. I mean it's
not as if I got there by myself. This has been a partnership and
she is my soul mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose wife once disclosed that the vice president likes to
sleep in the nude, flashed a wry smile when Winfrey asked him about
what he liked to sleep in.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bed,'' Gore said, triggering titters from the audience.
``You get the picture?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to appear on Winfrey's show on Sept. 19. Her
program reaches 22 million viewers weekly, most of them women.
</P>
<P>
   Gore left it to campaign staffer Ron Klain to challenge Bush's
prescription drug plan, saying that Bush's income-based formula for
eligibility for government-backed coverage could leave out 6
million senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's effort to sell his proposals as real plans for real
people falls real flat,'' said Klain, a former chief of staff for
Gore at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' entreaties to women underscored that these
voters may hold the key to the Nov. 7 contest between Gore, a
24-year veteran of Washington including almost eight years as vice
president, and Bush, a second-term governor of Texas and former
Texas businessman who is son of President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore leads Bush 49 percent to 41 percent, according to a
Newsweek magazine survey of likely voters that appeared in Monday's
editions of the newsweekly. Much of Gore's 8-point edge over Bush
stems from the Democrat's 14-point lead among women.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has overcome Bush's earlier strength among men to force a
1-point edge over the Republican candidate, according to the survey
that has a margin of error of 4 percentage points. Support from
women voters helped the Clinton-Gore ticket win the White House in
1992 _ setting the stage for the first two successive terms by a
Democratic president since 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Gore moved quickly to embrace a Federal Trade Commission report
that accused the nation's multibillion dollar entertainment issue
of aggressively marketing violent movies, music and video games to
minors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, calling for a ``cease-fire'' in marketing such material,
devoted a campaign appearance at an elementary school in
Belleville, Ill., to urging ``tougher penalties'' such as liability
for false advertising if the entertainment industry fails to curb
the marketing of violent material to children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett countered that Bush's
election would change the climate and ``restore integrity to the
White House and usher in a new era of responsibility'' that would
include the entertainment industry. Bartlett added that Gore
deserved ``an Oscar award in hypocrisy'' after Gore and Democratic
campaign committees had raised $13.6 million in campaign
contributions from Hollywood and the entertainment industry this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, working to build support in Florida, waved off evidence
that he now has his work cut out for him to hold onto a state where
he once led handily. Bush campaigned with his brother Jeb, the
governor of the Sunshine State.
</P>
<P>
   The latest public opinion poll in Florida, taken in August
following the parties' conventions, showed Bush trailing Gore by 8
percentage points, according to North Carolina-based Rasmussen
Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in good shape here,'' Bush said, referring to a state
that had voted Republican in four straight presidential elections
until the Clinton-Gore ticket wrested it away in 1996. ``This is
going to be a good state for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Slade, the former Republican Party chairman in Florida, said
that the Bush campaign had allowed Gore to seize the initiative on
issues important to the elderly, including prescription drug
coverage and bolstering Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were whistling down the street thinking it would be a
cruise and all of a sudden we're in a no-joke race,'' Slade told
the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The National Journal's Hotline newsletter calculated Monday that
Gore has narrowed Bush's state-by-state lead in electoral votes.
According to latest state-by-state public opinion surveys reviewed
by the Hotline staff, Bush leads Gore in 21 states with 232
electoral votes; Gore leads Bush in 14 states with 228 electoral
votes, including Florida, with 25 electoral votes.

&HT;     SENATOR'S HUSBAND SUES CARPENTER FOR $20M 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Richard Blum, the wealthy financier and husband of
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, wants $20 million in damages from a retired
carpenter who accused him on an Internet Web site of looting a
union pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual claim filed in U.S. District Court, Blum contended
he had been defamed by Horacio Grana, a disabled retiree who draws
a pension of $570 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Grana has enraged Blum by using the Internet to pillory him and
officials of the $2 billion Carpenters Pension Trust for Southern
California for alleged mismanagement and cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   Blum, who is the fund's investment adviser, has repeatedly
denied Grana's allegations of impropriety, which are also contained
in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles by Grana and two other dissident
carpenters.
</P>
<P>
   But the financier has become so irritated by Grana's
``UnionPlainfacts'' Web site that in July he asked a federal judge
to make the retiree pay him a stunning $20 million in punitive
damages _ hundreds of times more than Grana's entire worth.
</P>
<P>
   No trial dates have been set in either lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Mozer, the lawyer representing Grana, said her client was
``merely seeking to find the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My client is a poor, innocent carpenter who believes that his
pension fund and the pension fund of his fellow carpenters has
absolutely been misused,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the legal contest has changed Grana's view of a
politician who once was one of his favorites _ Feinstein, D-Calif.,
who is favored over Republican challenger Tom Campbell in her bid
for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Grana was a big booster of Feinstein, and at a Labor Day picnic
in 1992 he was photographed as she autographed his sweatshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I supported her once. No more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Blum collects damages from Grana, he would use the money to
fund scholarships for children of carpenters, according to a
spokesman for Blum.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the damages, Blum wants the judge to order Grana
to post a retraction on the Internet, and never to repeat his
allegations again.
</P>
<P>
   Grana, 63, lives in the Los Angeles suburb of Thousand Oaks. In
January, he and fellow retirees Phillip R. Helsius and Walter J.
Sprenger sued the pension fund, Blum and fund trustee Ronald Tutor,
who is head of the giant Tutor-Saliba construction firm, alleging
multiple violations of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security
Act (ERISA).
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the suit accused the fund managers of paying
Blum excessive fees: $8 million in 1997, and $33 million in 1998,
according to federal records.
</P>
<P>
   And it claimed that in 1997 Blum and Tutor had improperly pumped
$27 million in union pension funds into the Perini Corp., a
financially troubled Massachusetts construction company that Tutor
later took over.
</P>
<P>
   The investment allegedly was made by a Blum investment
partnership called RB Capital Partners. The pension fund's
investment was lost as Perini's stock plunged, the lawsuit says,
but the investment allowed Blum, as a major shareholder, to name
Tutor to Perini's board of directors. Tutor took over the company
last year by buying $40 million in stock, according to a Perini
press release.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said that the alleged transactions violated ERISA rules
against self-dealing and conflict of interest. It asked the court
to replace Tutor and national carpenters union President Douglas
McCarron as fund trustees, and to fire Blum as investment adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations in the suit, Grana said, are based in part on
records he obtained via the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, and on
tips and documents slipped to him by dissident carpenters who know
him because of the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   When the suit was filed, Tutor dismissed it as ``idiotic,'' and
Blum said he was innocent of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   His fees are based on performance of the investments he makes
for the pension fund, Blum has said in court, and overall the
returns have been excellent. He also contends that it is utterly
untrue that any carpenter's pension funds were invested in Perini.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the pension fund's lawyers asked U.S.
District Judge George King to throw the Perini allegations out of
court and sanction Grana's lawyers for raising what they called
``frivolous'' and untrue allegations.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge declined, saying that although Blum and the
trustees have insisted that no pension fund money went into Perini,
they had refused to open the books to Grana to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the parties to meet informally to settle that part of
the suit. Blum filed his defamation claim after that.

<P>
   The 52nd annual Primetime Emmys broke out of the ratings slump
of recent years with a telecast seen at least in part by an
estimated 46 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nielsen's preliminary numbers released Monday, the
three- hour-plus broadcast on ABC Sunday averaged 21.6 million
viewers, the Emmys' largest average audience since at least 1986
when Nielsen began tracking total viewer figures.
</P>
<P>
   It was up 23 percent from Fox's audience last year, in part, no
doubt, due to promotional spots aired during ABC's top-rated shows
such as ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards telecast, hosted by Garry Shandling, also gained 16
percent from last year in the adults 18-49 demographic that is most
popular with advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of households, the show delivered a 14.2 rating and a
23 percent share of households using television. A rating point
equals 1,022,000 television homes.

   The hotspots in the European club scene, with reports from New
York Times correspondents in 5 cities:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN A CITY OF CONSTANT CHANGE, THE LATEST TREND IS A BIT OF
DISCRETION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BERLIN _ An aquarium seems almost de rigueur in Berlin bars
these days, an indication perhaps that the high-energy,
low-sophistication scene of the 1990s is giving way to the quieter
comforts of a leather chair, a fine martini and a touch of fish
gazing. Not that the adrenaline is gone from Berlin; it is merely
being channeled in more refined directions. The all-night techno
parties still burn, but an after-work scene of neophyte government
and e-business types has also come to life in the new capital.
</P>
<P>
   Take Reingold, an elegant watering hole that hides its charms
behind a very discreet entrance in the midst of Mitte, the buzzing
central area that once abutted the eastern side of the Berlin Wall.
The bar stretches almost the entire length of a narrow room whose
far wall is adorned with an androgynous mural. The place is chic
but understated: No gleaming mirror reflects the bottles behind the
bar and the overall effect may be described as Manet meeting
Hopper. Even the fish tank is discreet.
</P>
<P>
   The cocktails are mediocre, but Berlin's beautiful people are
here in abundance after midnight. And in Berlin, sensuality often
has a brash and electric tinge, the charge of a city whose very
essence is flux.
</P>
<P>
   For movement, it is hard to beat WMF, a club that has already
shifted premises several times since it began life soon after the
fall of the Berlin Wall in what had been the WMF kitchenware
factory. In vast new premises since June, its entrance now commands
a magnificent view of the illuminated dome of the restored
Oranienburgerstrasse synagogue. The exhilarating open-endedness and
strangeness of Berlin is evident as you edge down a dimly lighted
street, along a crumbling graffiti-smattered wall, to emerge into
WMF, a converted warehouse where large crowds dressed mainly in
gray and black dance on concrete floors to sounds dominated by
house and techno music. This club is spare, intense, raw, a great
place to let loose.
</P>
<P>
   For a cooler, and very flirtatious, note, try the Greenwich on
Gipsstrasse, a new joint that has taken the aquarium craze to
impressive lengths (the length of the bar, to be precise). Cowhide
adorns the padded walls and a certain animal intensity is
definitely in the air as couples, heterosexual and homosexual,
admire each other over some of the best martinis and whiskey sours
in the city. This establishment, full of Asian-Germans and
African-Germans, gives a real sense of the new Berlin, a city whose
population is an exotic mix. Closing time is 6 a.m. on weekdays and
8 a.m. weekends, so there is little problem squeezing in that last
drink.
</P>
<P>
   As you roll home, you may wish to look in on Newton's, a
swinging bar on the handsome Gendarmenmarkt decorated with Helmut
Newton's photographs, and on 90 Grad, an upmarket disco that is as
louche as the city it serves.

   &UR; TALK OR FUNK, WHATEVER YOUR TASTE THERE'S ALWAYS GUINNESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Against a tide of gaudy international discotheques, the
traditional Irish pub has no problem holding its own in Dublin.
Historic watering holes and polished nightclubs are learning to
live side by side.
</P>
<P>
   For a hip, young European capital, though, the standard of
high-fashion night life still falls far shy of London or Paris. But
even on the slowest of nights, there's never a problem finding the
unremitting buzz of laughter and conversation _ and a well-poured
pint of Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   You'll rarely have to walk more than 20 minutes to get anywhere
in Dublin's compact center. And it's just as well: Public
transportation and taxis are hard to come by. Dress at clubs is
almost uniformly casual. A growing number of bars and clubs now
have a no-sneakers rule, the only strict requirement.
</P>
<P>
   A fixture in the traditional pub establishment, Kehoe's Bar and
Lounge maintains an intimate air in one of Dublin's busiest areas,
just off Grafton Street. It's just as much home to Irish Times
journalists as it is to cell phone addicts in four-button suits.
Recently, I couldn't help but get dragged into conversation by
locals complaining about rip-off real estate prices. .
</P>
<P>
   The decor hasn't changed much in a generation or so, as
evidenced by scarred hardwood floors, high mirrors behind the bar
and running boards to hold pint glasses and tired elbows. Several
small rooms, or snugs, create a conspiratorial atmosphere. The
coziest snug in Kehoe's _ with effort, six people can squeeze in _
was previously the women's bathroom, now outfitted with
red-cushioned benches.
</P>
<P>
   On warm summer nights, the crowd at Kehoe's spills out onto the
sidewalk, and seats on the curb are as contested as stools at the
bar.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller crowd turned out recently at Vicar Street, a music
hall and bar in the Liberties area, to hear the Latin jazz master
Pucho. A Harlem native who revived a salsa-funk sound in '90s
England, he appeared with a nine-piece horn-and-percussion ensemble
that kept the audience dancing throughout the show (the cover
charge was slightly more than usual, about $15, at the rate of
$1.15 to the punt).
</P>
<P>
   For more-highbrow jazz acts, like the Mingus Big Band and Brad
Mehldau, both of whom played at Vicar Street recently, tables and
stools fill the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   The attentive staff of Vicar Street wouldn't feel at home in
Switch, a basement nightclub that stands out in sharp relief
against the increasingly tourist-dominated Temple Bar area.
Floor-level speakers in four corners barrage the packed dance
floor, while glowing cigarettes glimmer from couches in the
shadows. Camouflage netting hangs from the ceiling and the walls,
adding to the grungy feel. Most Fridays feature drum and bass by
the local D.J. crew Bassbin; the rest of the week ranges from hard
techno to deep house.
</P>
<P>
   A word on the pace of the evening: Drinking starts much earlier
than in other European countries. Many Dubliners down their first
pint after work about 6:30 and continue straight through until
midnight, when bars stop serving alcohol. Nightclubs and specially
licensed late bars serve until around 3 a.m.

<P>
   PARIS _ ``You have to go to Queen,'' my friend said. ``It's the
baddest club in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a surprising diversity to the after-dark diversions of
Paris, enough to please anyone from the bused-in Dutch tourists
lined up for topless shows in Pigalle to the blue bloods of the
16th Arrondissement checking each other out at BCBG (bon chic, bon
genre) bars.
</P>
<P>
   But ``bad'' is not the first thing that comes to mind.
Parisians, in public at least, are generally fairly well behaved.
So, for something different, we decided to make Queen the goal of a
night on the town.
</P>
<P>
   Not without a few preliminaries, of course. Though Paris may
lack the after-hours exuberance of, say, Madrid, things don't
really get started at Queen and other clubs until at least 1 a.m.
or so, which left us about three hours to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop was Le Fumoir, a clubby place across the street
from the Louvre. Its cigar bar ambience, bare wood floor and Art
Deco fittings draw a self-consciously stylish crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Next to us, shaven-headed Internet entrepreneurs reclined in
leather armchairs and discussed ``le start-up,'' which they said
would be engaged in ``le B-to-B.'' A fashion-industry type in
python-skin pants moved toward the bar and ordered a mojito. We
decided it was time to move on.

FIRST LATIN GRAMMYS HIT EARLY SOUR NOTE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By SANDRA BARRERA 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the same old story for the Grammys, which has had its share
of controversy over the years: You can't please all of the people
all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   That realization comes none too soon for the premiere of the
Latin Grammy Awards, being televised Wednesday on CBS from the
Staples Center. A couple of weeks ago, an independent record label
criticized the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences for not
enlisting any Mexican regional artists to perform at the awards
show. Then Mexican regional balladeer Alejandro Fernandez was added
to the bill, silencing critics.
</P>
<P>
   But bad feelings still lingered, leaving some in the music
industry speculating just how well-represented Latinos really are
in this first awards ceremony of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the Latin Grammys is to ``celebrate the
excellence'' of music made in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking
communities throughout the world. To be nominated, the songs must
be sung partially in Spanish or Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   But the question is, does it?
</P>
<P>
   With the Latin Grammy Awards inaugural ceremony being held in
Los Angeles and televised nationally, it's no surprise that the
show skews more to the American-bred crossover acts.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Aguilera, Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez are the
performers topping the list of entertainers that night. Because of
that, Beto Cuevas of the Chilean electronic band La Ley likens the
Latin Grammys to a showcasing of the latest trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never too excited about fashion shows,'' he says, speaking
to America's version of Latin music. ``I mean, I know they exist
and I respect them, but I thought this Grammy was going to be the
Latin Grammys for all those big artists from all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Mauricio Abaroa, senior vice president of LARAS, it
is.
</P>
<P>
   This Grammy was conceived from an idea started by the heads of
the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences 11 years ago
when they began venturing into Latin countries to network with the
recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   That grew into LARAS, founded in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the academy has more than 2,400 members from
Latin communities, including those inside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Abaroa says it's these members who are responsible for having
narrowed the more than 5,000 entries down to 200. And it's they who
decided who the 40 winners will be.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the academy's selection of nominees that has drawn
criticism _ not entirely, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It was Van Nuys-based Fonovisa that criticized LARAS for not
asking any Mexican regional artists to perform on the broadcast.
Instead, the Latin Grammy organization was accused of catering to
artists associated with Sony Music and its executive Emilio Estefan
Jr., the Miami-based producer who has worked on a number of
crossover albums, including English debuts by Ricky Martin and Marc
Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   Estefan was honored Monday as LARAS Person of the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Fonovisa was also ruffled because only five of its top-selling
performers were nominated for Latin Grammys. And they were all in
the regional category.
</P>
<P>
   With Mexican regional music making up an estimated 60 percent of
all Latin music sales in the country, this sent Fonovisa and its
supporters crying foul to a local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Cookman, who manages a number of Latin music acts
including Grammy nominees, was among those outraged in the article
that was picked up by news outlets across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But he has since changed his tune, saying that the reporter who
contacted him may have ``extended my opinion a little bit more than
my initial idea.''
</P>
<P>
   He was told the Latin Grammys would feature no Mexican or
Mexican regional artists on the bill. And that the list had been
finalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, if it really was that way, then that's horrible,''
he says. ``But it wasn't finalized. So she sort of just jumped the
gun by saying that.''
</P>
<P>
   LARAS shot off a press release early last week that listed the
names of performers including Alejandro Fernandez. He is touted as
the Grammys answer to regional music.
</P>
<P>
   ``He represents the new generation of rancheros,'' says Abaroa.
He then gushes, ``What Ricky Martin is to pop, Alejandro Fernandez
is to regional music.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear if Fernandez fits that bill for Fonovisa.
Representatives from the label refused to say anything more about
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The only certainty is that neither Fonovisa's employees nor its
artists, including the five who were nominated for awards in the
regional music category, will be attending the event.
</P>
<P>
   Rejelio Macin, general manager of BMG US Latin, says he's sorry
Fonovisa, one of the first American labels he worked for, has
decided to steer clear of the Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   Macin says he understands their frustration, but he also knows
the Grammys have a show to put on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very difficult the very first time _ as is
everything,'' he says. ``And to be honest, I don't know what the
result is going to be. I think we're just coming up with
conclusions and the show is not even over. The show hasn't even
started.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that most people in the recording industry are
looking forward to the Latin Grammys and all that it represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of it,'' says Maribel Schumacher, vice president of
marketing for Warner Music Latin America. ``I'm glad that we've
been able to garner the recognition that it merits a show in and of
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schumacher, too, admits Fonovisa will be sorely missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always sympathy for your competition, and I'm being
very serious,'' she says. ``Because if they took that kind of
position, then that leads me to believe that they were seriously
hurt. I am sorry for them, and I hope that next year they will be
vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   That could very well be.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin Grammy Awards show is being held in L.A. this year,
but next year it could be broadcast from Mexico City, Buenos Aires,
Madrid or Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Abaroa says this will give each year's show a different flavor,
explaining, ``That's why we have more crossover artists in this
first edition because it's going to be held in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is launching a satellite into orbit with this
first edition and, you know, we're not in the mood for sadness,''
he says. ``We are not the Regional Mexican Recording Academy of
Arts and Sciences.'' &QL; 
---The show: ``Latin Grammy Awards.'' &QL; 
What: Inaugural awards show. &QL; 
The stars: Hosted by Jennifer Lopez, Jimmy Smits, Gloria Estefan
and Andy Garcia. &QL; 
Where: CBS (Channel 2). &QL; 
When: 9 p.m. Wednesday. &QL;

 UNDATED: move on.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our next stop, the Buddha Bar, was not far away, around the
corner from the Hotel de Crillon off the Place de la Concorde.
Since it opened in 1996, this 1940s Saigon speak-easy on steroids
has spawned several other colonial-nostalgia imitators in Paris.
One of these, Man Ray _ which includes Johnny Depp among its owners
_ now gets more publicity, but I prefer the Buddha Bar.
</P>
<P>
   After descending a grand staircase, you enter a dimly lighted
open space with red-lacquered walls. Dominating it all is a
20-foot-tall statue of Buddha, a brooding presence _ perhaps
warning the thin women seated at low tables around him of the
dangers of doing anything more than picking at their Asian fusion
food.
</P>
<P>
   But eating is not the reason to go there. It is a comfortable
spot for conversation, or just mingling, with enough attitude
thrown in to make it feel like Paris. Bigger than the New York
establishment of the same name that enjoyed its 15 minutes of fame
in the mid-1990s, Paris' Buddha Bar packs in a less exclusive
crowd, a mix of visiting young businessmen who want to spend some
money and Parisians who might or might not want to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, it was the French who seemed to be enjoying
themselves the most, particularly when the music shifted from
Asian-themed house to North African rai and they got up to dance in
the darker corners.
</P>
<P>
   But by now we were ready for more serious dancing, so we caught
a cab up the Champs-Elysees and stopped outside Queen.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the setting, it is hard to imagine that this is a
``bad'' club, let alone the baddest in the city. The heavily
globalized avenue is about as conventionally bland a place as there
is in Paris. The cheesy purple sign over the door hardly
distinguishes the club from the theme restaurants that surround it.
</P>
<P>
   But kitsch is part of the appeal, attracting a part-gay,
part-straight crowd that moves quickly past the doorman (except for
groups of women, on some nights, I am told.)
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it quickly became clear that we were not at the Disney
store. The coat-check boy wagged his tongue at guests. The house
music made my eardrums throb. Several women swung from netting
covering the dance floor, as a crowd writhed underneath. In the
cavernous unisex bathroom, there was evidence of seriously bad
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know whether Queen is the baddest club in Paris. But
after a night of dancing, the worst was yet to come: Trying to hail
a taxi at 4 a.m., when the Metro stopped running three hours
earlier and there are no gypsy cabs. Talk about bad.

   &UR; HOT SPOTS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL AS IF YOU BELONG &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LONDON _ There is nothing easy about going out for an evening in
London. Sure you can always belly up to the bar at the local pub,
but painting the town red here takes much more effort than that.
Almost in a throwback to the old British penchant for classifying
people by aristocratic pedigree, when you line up behind the velvet
rope, it doesn't matter how primped you look; the bouncer doesn't
care. The real question: Are you a member?
</P>
<P>
   London's hottest bars and clubs are for members only and that
means being a celebrity, knowing one, or anteing up as much as
$3,000 a year after being nominated by another member _ and
seconded _ just to get your foot in the door.
</P>
<P>
   For the tourist passing through town, hitting the hottest spots
can be a risky, though thrilling endeavor. And for those less
adventurous, there are still a number of good places to try without
the hassle of having to be or look like Claudia Schiffer.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner or the theater in the West End, a good place for a
drink is Mezzo, a relatively low-key bar and restaurant in Soho.
One of Sir Terrance Conran's ever-expanding number of overly
designed bars and restaurants around town, Mezzo is a bit luxurious
without a sense of arrogance. The expansive bar on the first floor
has an eclectic mix, from 20-somethings in jeans to 60-year-olds in
suits. It's easy to feel comfortable, unless you like dimmer
lighting.
</P>
<P>
   For something a bit more exclusive, try the Purple Bar inside
Ian Schrager's newest London hotel, Sanderson. It will take a
little work to talk your way in _ if you're not a hotel guest, get
there really early _ because the bar is normally for members only.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside this small purple temple of chic arrogance, order a
classic martini _ no fruit martinis _ or vodka, though everything
is expensive ($10 or more a drink). With Frank Sinatra playing in
the background, the Purple Bar is a great people-watching place,
especially if you care which people you're watching. If you'd
rather leave celebrity watching to the cable channel E!, go to
Mezzo.
</P>
<P>
   For a bit of dancing while you drink, make your way to the
Notting Hill Arts Club in the heart of Notting Hill. Catering to a
distinctly younger set _ 20s and 30s _ the club has a steady stream
of cool D.J.'s spinning house and garage music into the early
morning, with a different theme each night. In a huge basement, the
club seems a bit grungy, but attracts a very attractive clientele.
And it's not impossible to get past the bouncer.
</P>
<P>
   If your goal is to dance into the night, go to a club like China
White, near Soho, or Heaven, north of Piccadilly Circus. It will be
helpful to get on the guest list for either place, so creativity
counts. You can try calling ahead and citing some business
affiliation or a local connection you might have. A concierge at a
trendy hotel can help, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both are multifloor extravaganzas, filled with thumping music
that doesn't stop until the sun comes up. These clubs are great for
getting sweaty with beautiful people, but don't expect meaningful
conversation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A note about getting home: The subway stops running at midnight.
Your only choices after that, until about 5:30 a.m,, when it
resumes service, are a bus or taxi. Both are extremely hard to come
by in the early morning hours, and gypsy cabs are not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to ensure a ride home is to take the telephone
number of an authorized radio taxi company with you. And yes, even
the taxi company will ask when you call: Are you a member?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   PRAGUE _ A town swarming with tourists does its best to cater to
their nighttime whims and to make some money besides, but it's
still possible to find a few places to drink, sup, listen or dance
where not everyone is foreign or wearing a baseball cap backward or
tripping out on Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Prague has some nice jazz, and like everything here, the price
is reasonable. Downstairs at U Maleho Glena (At Little Glenn's) is
a small cellar with tables and an unusually good selection of local
groups, including the excellent Robert Balzar Trio; Jan Knop, a
pianist who calls himself Najponk; and Yvonne Sanchez, a popular
half-Cuban, half-Polish chanteuse. There is a cafe and bar
upstairs; the jazz club in the basement has a cover charge of 90
crowns, all of $2.30, at 39 crowns to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Little Glenn is an American, Glenn Spicker, who also introduced
bagels to Prague at his two Bohemia Bagel restaurants. But his jazz
club has a friendly, local feel and it's close to the crowded
Charles Bridge, which you'll end up strolling at night even if you
vow not to.
</P>
<P>
   Prague's cafes are open late into the evening. The most famous
is Cafe Slavia, where President Vaclav Havel and other dissidents
often lingered and argued when they weren't in jail. In 1992, it
was closed over an ownership dispute (though broken into in an act
of liberation for a couple of nights by Havel and friends, who
brought their own coffee).
</P>
<P>
   Slavia reopened in late 1997, refurbished with a green theme. It
is rooted in a painting the new owners resurrected, Viktor Oliva's
``Absinthe Drinker,'' featuring a comely bright green female
fantasy sitting on a customer's table. Perhaps you'll share the
vision in this country where absinthe remains legal and on sale.
It's likely to be better than the coffee, which is Dutch and weak,
or the service, which is glacial. Granny's cake with walnuts,
however, is great.
</P>
<P>
   Another lovely cafe, closed for 10 years in a different
post-Communist ownership dispute, the Cafe Imperial, reopened just
three months ago. Informal yet spectacular, its original 1914 tiled
walls and ceiling are intact. The coffee is Italian and comes with
a free kobliha, or jam doughnut. And it isn't too crowded, yet.
</P>
<P>
   Radost FX remains Prague's most famous nightclub cum cafe and
lounge, with everything from vegetarian food upstairs to a hazy,
smoky dance floor and D.J. in the basement. There is a small
gallery above it from which one can watch others dance, kiss or
negotiate other forms of intoxication.
</P>
<P>
   It is very loud and very popular. On a recent night, however,
the sofas covered with animal prints were occupied by rather glum
groups in their early 20s. It got better, presumably, much later.
</P>
<P>
   For a change, try Palac Akropolis, a somewhat quieter and more
adult spot in an old movie theater, with a performance hall and two
downstairs bars where one might actually hold a conversation.
You'll find more Czechs there than tourists, at least most of the
time.

JAPAN'S ECONOMY GROWS 1 PERCENT IN MOST RECENT QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKI TANIKAWA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's economy expanded 1 percent in the April-June
quarter, the government said on Monday, a stronger-than-expected
performance driven by higher government and consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   The result reported by the Economic Planning Agency translated
into an annual growth rate of 4.2 percent and was the second
consecutive quarter of expansion in the world's second-largest
economy, which has been struggling to overcome the worst prolonged
downturn since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Some private economists said the quarterly growth, coming after
a 2.5 percent expansion in the January-March quarter, suggested the
recovery may be getting more solid, although it remains slow. Many
had forecast the economy would grow only seven-tenths of a percent
in the April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no consensus on whether the data meant Japan's
recovery was gathering momentum. And the Economic Planning
Minister, Taichi Sakaiya, was cautious about interpreting the
results, suggesting they might reflect temporary stimulants that
could dissipate later this year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest surprises was a 13.6 percent increase in
government spending in the quarter, which followed a 7.5 percent
decrease in the January-March quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main difference between our forecast and the result was
that there was a very, very big increase in public spending,'' said
Jeffrey Young, chief economist with Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   But that component of the economic expansion will have to be
replenished by the government through additional borrowing. Japan
already is borrowing record amounts of money to finance public
works projects to stimulate the economy, and the rising
indebtedness led Moody's Investors Service to lower Japan's credit
rating last week.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is a widespread expectation that Japan's
political leaders will opt to borrow more money for public
spending. Following the release of the data on Monday, Kiichi
Miyazawa, the finance minister, said senior Japanese political
officials had agreed on the need for a supplementary budget,
although the size of it was undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Another unexpectedly strong source of economic expansion in the
April-June quarter came from consumer spending, which rose 1.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said that corporate earnings, which have been
recovering for more than a year, are finally spilling over to
consumer spending and wage growth. They said the April-June results
now easily put the government's forecast of 1 percent growth for
the 2000 fiscal year, which ends March 31, within reach.
</P>
<P>
   Sakaiya, however, was cautious about reading too much optimism
into the consumer spending data. He noted that it contained
extraordinary elements, like the introduction of nursing care
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The personal spending gain, moreover, was counterbalanced by a
3.3 percent decline in capital spending, which until recently had
been a big component of economic growth.

BRIDGESTONE PLANS TO END DUAL STANDARD ON FIRESTONE QUALITY
CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKI TANIKAWA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In his first public appearance since the recall of 6.5
million Firestone tires in the United States, the president of
Firestone's Japanese parent acknowledged Monday that the company
had not paid proper attention to quality control.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Bridgestone, Yoichiro Kaizaki, said the company
would exert stronger control over the management of its American
subsidiary, Bridgestone/Firestone, and that it would apply the same
quality-control criteria for both its Bridgestone and Firestone
tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we have managed it was wrong,'' Kaizaki said. There
had been dual standards within the company regarding problems with
the two brands, he said. ``The responsibility for the problem lies
with Tokyo.''
</P>
<P>
   The acknowledgment was unusual for a company that has been
criticized for not having its top executives actively address the
tire problems. In another sign of a new public tack,
Bridgestone/Firestone said Monday that it had named Ketchum, a unit
of the Omnicom Group, as its new public relations firm, after
Fleishman-Hillard International Communications resigned earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we have been slow in responding to public
concerns, that we underestimated the intensity of the situation,
and that we have been too focused on internal details,'' Masatoshi
Ono, the chief executive of the American subsidiary, said in a
statement announcing the hire. ``We are determined to change all
that.''
</P>
<P>
   His boss, Kaizaki, said earlier at a news conference in Tokyo
that Bridgestone/Firestone was managed independent &UR;  &LR; of the parent.
``We managed subsidiaries located in Japan quite carefully but have
not applied the same attention to managing overseas subsidiaries,''
Kaizaki said. ```We let the U.S. unit use its own culture. There
was an element of mistake in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dual standards also existed when it came to technology support.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a problem with a Bridgestone tire, our technology
staff in Tokyo would rush to the site'' overseas to help out,
Kaizaki said. ``But if a problem arose with a Firestone tire, they
wouldn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the company has not identified specific defects
in the tires. He said there were variables that could have
contributed to the accidents, including air pressure and length of
use. He added that the number of accidents in other vehicles using
Firestone tires was considerably lower than those involving Ford
Explorers. The accidents ``for some reason'' keep happening, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaizaki, who was president of the United States subsidiary in
the early 1990s, said Bridgestone would do its ``utmost to keep the
Firestone brand.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had no plans to resign. Shares of Bridgestone
have plunged 46.6 percent since the Aug. 9 recall announcement. In
Tokyo trading Monday, Bridgestone slipped 2 yen, to 1108 yen
($10.45).
</P>
<P>
   ``I am fully aware that we suffered a critical damage,'' Kaizaki
said. ``But we firmly believe we can rebuild Firestone.''

AIR SO THIN IT'S NONEXISTENT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' refers to Tues., Sept. 12, 2000.) 
Our rating: 1 star 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Thin Air'' must describe the room conditions where the folks
responsible conceived of the project. Based on one of Robert
Parker's dozens of novels about tough-guy private eye Spenser, this
one follows the most predictable of plot templates.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mantegna reprises the role of Spenser, flirting with his
smart tootsie (Marcia Gay Harden), then plugging a thug right
between the eyes. The haggard cop investigating the incident soon
comes to Spenser with a quandary: His hotsie trophy bride (Yancy
Butler) has disappeared; said cop is soon written out of most of
the rest of the script so Spenser can go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that attractive dames in Spenser yarns are former
hookers or addicts or, in this case, both; she's being held by a
kinky lunatic ex (Jon Seda, who scarcely exudes the menace every
other character timorously attributes to him). Spenser recruits a
sidekick (Luis Guzman, a fine character actor doing good work in a
role way beneath him) and rescues the damsel in distress.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most depressing is what this movie says of Joe
Mantegna's career. A decade ago, Mantegna represented the height of
street-sensibility acting credibility.
</P>
<P>
   And now, here he is, squinting in order to create a character
point and otherwise doing a bad Ray Romano imitation. It's
appropriate that Mantegna channeled Dean Martin in HBO's ``Rat
Pack'' movie _ here, he's doing it again, only this time he's
dropping groaner quips that wouldn't pass muster in a Matt Helm
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ---The show: ``Thin Air.'' &QL; 
What: Mystery thriller based on Robert Parker's novel. &QL; 
The stars: Joe Mantegna, Jon Seda, Luis Guzman, Marcia Gay Harden,
Yancy Butler. &QL;

HITTING THE HIGH NOTES
</HEADLINE>
  Record label dropped her, but Osborne took righteous road 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By SANDRA BARRERA 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years is a long time for an artist to go without making a
new record.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Osborne knows this firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't put out a record since her 1995 debut ``Relish.''
That was the album that went multiplatinum and scored a major hit
with ``One of Us,'' a song that starred God as an Everyday Joe. It
even got her a handful of Grammy nominations.
</P>
<P>
   But when Mercury Records began breathing down her neck for
another hit, Osborne failed to deliver. So she was dropped like a
flash-in-the-pan only to resurface sans the corkscrew curls and
nose ring with the album ``Righteous Love.'' It hits stores today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to put any expectations on it because I feel like
it would be too easy to be disappointed,'' she says. ``I just hope
people are interested and that the music has some positive
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Righteous Love'' opens with the funky ballad ``Running Out of
Time'' and is followed by 10 more tracks that grind a la Britney
(``Love Is Alive''), play on Eastern rhythms (``If I Was Your
Man'') before ending in a stunning version of Bob Dylan's folky
``Make You Feel My Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so in love with that song,'' Osborne says. ``You know,
people think of him as this sort of cerebral, political,
intellectual writer _ and he certainly is that. But he's able to
have come through all of that and write this simple, beautiful love
song that just tears your heart out.''
</P>
<P>
   From the bluesy swagger of ``Righteous Love'' to the soulful
stride of her single ``Safety in Numbers,'' Osborne's voice has a
blues finesse that made her so desirable as a singer in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   While he was still hosting a radio show back in Woodstock, Nic
Harcourt, who now hosts ``Morning Becomes Eclectic'' on KCRW, began
playing Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   This was before she had put out ``Relish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so long ago I don't really remember the details,''
Harcourt says. ``But I must have connected with someone who was
involved in managing her and they sent me some cassettes, which I
really liked but didn't put on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she released an EP that we played on the air, and two
years later, I guess, she came out with this album that exploded,''
he says. ``She's just an amazing artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercury's loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly if somebody's not interested in supporting you as an
artist then you don't want to be on their label,'' she says. ``So
I'm not unhappy that I'm not there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne is now signed to Interscope Records, and she's gearing
up for a tour in support of ``Righteous Love.'' Tonight she
performs at the House of Blues and launches a new online
publications, Heroine Magazine (www.heroinemag.com).
</P>
<P>
   She says the focus of the magazine is to profile ``women who
have done amazing things,'' adding that the first issues features a
conversation between Susan Sarandon and the Indigo Girls on their
political activism and how they mix that with their art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kind of done everything from coming up with story ideas
to interviewing people,'' Osborne says. ``I can't do that anymore
because I have a lot of other work to do. But it was fun for me to
get started.'' &QL; 
---Who: Joan Osborne. &QL; 
Where: House of Blues, 8430 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood. &QL; 
When: 9 tonight. &QL; 
Tickets General admission is $21; tickets can be purchased at the
House of Blues box office or by calling (323) 848-5100. &QL;

CENSUS DATA CONFIRMS `BROWNING OF AMERICA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One out of every ten people living in the United States is
foreign born, the majority of them from Latin America, representing
the highest wave of immigrants in US history, according to Census
data released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It means that about 5 percent of the US population hails from
Latin America, a rising trend that's expected to continue for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Call it further evidence of the so-called ``browning of
America.'' Where immigration from Europe has slowed, it's been
quickly growing among people from Mexico, Central America, and
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But as Latinos arrive they are finding the prospects of
good-paying jobs bleak, unlike their European counterparts 80 years
ago. It has sociologists and worker's rights organizations
wondering if the cycle of poverty that ensnared Mexican farmworkers
in California in the past century will be as bad for Guatemalan day
laborers, Brazilian landscapers, and Dominican house cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to pull oneself up by bootstraps when working in a
hotel or cleaning houses,'' said Jason Pramas, associate director
for the Campaign on Contingent Work, an advocacy organization based
in Boston's Chinatown. ``There aren't better-paying jobs they can
aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Among foreign-born residents, Latin Americans had the highest
poverty rate, 24 percent, compared with 12 percent of Asians and 11
percent of Europeans, according to the Census's Current Population
Reports, which is based on a 1999 sampling survey.
</P>
<P>
   Just 6.2 percent of the workers who arrived from Mexico and
Central America, for example, were in managerial or professional
specialty occupations, compared with 38.9 percent of Asians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos arriving in the US don't have kind of education that
allows them to penetrate the higher-paying job market,'' said Miren
Uriarte, interim director of the Mauricio Gaston Institute for
Latino Community Development and Public Policy at the University of
Massachusetts in Boston. ``You are talking about a large number of
Latinos who only have the option of working in the service sector,
cleaning at hotels, working in restaurants. It pegs them at a very
low wage.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey counted 26.4 million foreign-born Americans, the
highest number in the nation's history. They accounted for 9.7
percent of the nation's population in 1999. Of that number, 51
percent arrived from Latin America, 27 percent from Asia, 16
percent from Europe, and 6 percent from other areas of the world.
</P>
<P>
   America saw the highest percentage of foreign-born Americans in
1910, when 14.7 percent of the US population arrived from
elsewhere. But since the population itself was small, the number of
foreign-born Americans was 13.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, most of the immigrants arrived from Europe.
Immigration steadily increased until 1930, when and the Depression
and then World War II slowed immigration. It continued to slow
until 1970, when the US marked the smallest percentage of
foreign-born Americans, 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Changing immigration policy opened the doors to Latin America.
According to the 1990 Census, 42.5 percent of the foreign-born
population arrived from Latin America. Now, it is 51 percent.
Asians now represent 27 percent of the immigrants, up from 25
percent 10 years ago. The percentage of Europeans among immigrants
has fallen to 16 percent of the total, compared with 22 percent in
1990, the census figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Italians, Irish and German immigrants were exploited in
factories, quarries, and sweatshops, immigrants from Central
America, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia are finding themselves
fighting similar problems in restaurants, construction sites, and
on farms.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations have circumvented the gains made by labor unions,
primarily by using temporary workers, outide contractors and by
moving factories overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A perfect example is what's happened at Raytheon. Instead of
bringing new immigrants to work in Raytheon's own plants, they've
outsourced a lot of assembly-line work so they don't have a larger,
unionized workforce with living wages, benefits and a pension
plan,'' said Pramas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the company uses temporary workers in plants
of subcontractors. Those workers, who are predominantly Cambodian
and Dominican, get paid much less and don't receive benefits _
unlike unionized workers, who would make twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   Since many immigrants are mired in low pay, low-skill jobs, many
tend to work two jobs or more, leaving them little time to take
English classes, said Lawrence H. Fuchs, professor of American
Civilization and Politics at Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more language problems parents have, the higher the
dropout rates for their children,'' he said. ``One factor affects
the other.''

  Pregnancy prevails at Emmys 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELIZABETH SMILOR 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those tuning into E! on Sunday for the Emmy fashion parade at
the Shrine Auditorium might have noticed a conversation theme.
Namely, babies.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Rivers rattled off pregnancy jokes as she and very pregnant
daughter Melissa opened the show. The over-excited Joan referred to
her daughter as her ``chunky monkey'' and after Melissa showed off
for all of E!'s camera angles, Joan quipped that E! also had a
``vagi-cam'' in case Melissa gave birth (she's due this month).
</P>
<P>
   Melissa, also sporting a new dark hair color done just days
before the show, had a little fun herself when ``Frasier's'' Jane
Leeves, who's nearly six months pregnant, stopped to compare
tummies. Leeves also had fun with ``The Practice's'' Kelli
Williams, also expecting, as the two presented an award during the
telecast. Referring to a video montage on TV romance, she said
``all that love, you know where it gets you? Knocked up,'' as she
and Williams touched their stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   Looking great after giving birth only 16 days before Emmy night
was Richard Schiff's (``The West Wing'') wife, Sheila Kelley. He
told Joan that his wife was breastfeeding their baby girl, Ruby
Christine, on the way to the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Joan and Melissa, we can now say we've heard it all. &QL;

IDLE STAFF RAISES ALARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN LLOYD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
  Question: I am a manager, and I am friends with the employees who
report to me. The problem is that some of them seem to be taking
advantage of the friendship and bending the rules. I need to draw
the line, but I don't want to ruin the friendship. How can I do
this? W.S.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Answer: It is great to be friendly with your employees, but not
so great to be friends with them. The reason is the exact situation
that you described.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be truly effective as a manager, you have to act
like one. At this point, unless your employees' behaviors are
outrageous, there is no need to start counseling or disciplining.
Rather, the best approach is for you to meet with them and discuss
the situation on a low-key basis.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to let them know how much you enjoy working with
them and how satisfied you are with the team. At the same time, let
them know that some of their behaviors are just not working. Be
quite specific in describing these behaviors, and then describe
some alternative behaviors that would work better in these types of
situations. Open the discussion to their suggestions and questions,
and be sure to listen carefully to what they have to say.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to wrap up the meeting with positive expectations. And,
down the road, give your staff some positive feedback when you see
improvements in their behavior. Managing friends can present
problems, but it sure beats managing enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a new assistant supervisor, and the first thing she
did was to rearrange people, causing our production to slow and
errors to occur. Her newest plan has people standing around for
three-quarters of the day, and the regular supervisor could not
care less about this. Should we just wait for the boss to realize
what is going on? E.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you have people standing around for most of the day and
the boss still does not realize what is going on, your assistant
manager is only part of the problem. The increase in errors,
decreases in productivity and groups of people milling around
should have already caught the attention of someone in management.
</P>
<P>
   If you and your associates find the current state of work to be
dissatisfying, several of you should meet with senior management
and discuss the situation. Your approach should not be an attack on
the assistant supervisor or any of the other leadership personnel
in your area. Rather, let management see that you are loyal
employees who are concerned about productivity, waste and
accidents. Let management know that you enjoy your jobs when you
are truly working, and you are interested in having management look
into the present situation.
</P>
<P>
   If you let this situation fester, it will only become worse.
When management finally wakes up to the reality of this mess, you
and your associates may well be described as part of the problem.
By acting now, you have a chance to be part of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several months ago, our company hired a consulting firm to
survey how we feel about working here. It was a very expensive
project, and it was a big interruption in our work. As of today, we
have not heard one thing about the findings, and our manager says
that he has heard nothing too. Do you have any suggestions? B.L.
</P>
<P>
   A: Here is yet another example of a way for a company to
interrupt work, generate unrest and spend lots of money all at the
same time. It is disheartening to see this caused by an employee
survey, since expressing one's views in an employee survey can be
quite satisfying in and of itself, and seeing actions taken as a
result of such participation can be downright motivational.
</P>
<P>
   If management has taken the ill-advised position that the survey
findings are not going to be distributed, that is not a decision
you are likely to change. You should discuss the matter further
with your manager and ask if there is a way that he can discuss
this with senior management. You should think about doing so as
well. If your company has a human resources representative, you
should also consider contacting him or her.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that conduct attitude surveys are generally interested
in any factors that may be undermining the employees' attitudes.
The irony in your situation is that one key factor that is doing so
is the survey itself.
</P>
<P>
   If senior management sees that the employees are truly
interested in learning more about the attitude survey findings,
that could actually tell them more about attitudes than any survey.

GORE, OPRAH MAKE PRIME-TIME DAYTIME TV

   CHICAGO _ Oprah: ``You know, we have to talk about that kiss!''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore: Throws back head, roars with laughter. (Cut to
commercial.)
</P>
<P>
   Back on the air, the kiss clip airs: the vice president, long
derided as uptight, hugs and deeply kisses his wife, Tipper, at the
Democratic National Convention. Cutaway to women laughing and
applauding in Oprah's audience. Oprah herself loves it so much she
tells her producers to air it again.
</P>
<P>
   How do you say demographic heaven? How do you reach millions of
women whose votes may choose the next president? How do you shed
the image of stiffness? For Al Gore, the answer was an incalculably
valuable hour on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' Monday _ an opportunity
born of a turnabout by the mega-star host, who for the first time
in 15 years has invited the two main presidential candidates on her
show.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, it is George W. Bush's turn on the nation's top-rated
daytime television talk show, but Monday it was hard to imagine a
more sympathetic screening for the vice president. He joked, he was
empathetic, he told love stories, he mocked himself and even traded
high-fives with Winfrey before another commercial break. In turn,
Winfrey seemed enthralled. As the closing credits rolled, Winfrey
paid him what may be the rarest of compliments. The vice president,
Winfrey told her US audience estimated at 7 million, was a ``fun,
funny guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard to believe,'' Gore said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   By playing along with Winfrey's quest for the intimate details
of his life, however, Gore might once again revive questions about
whether he is too willing to exploit for political effect parts of
his life some people might deem too personal. At various times
Monday, Gore retold the story of the near-death experience of his
son, Albert Jr., and revealed he had given his wife a ring
inscribed, ``To the bravest person I know.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore wouldn't get too personal. When he was asked by Winfrey
to reveal the ``thing he likes to sleep in'' the question hung in
the air like the famous MTV query to President Clinton about
whether he prefers boxers or briefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bed,'' Gore responded. ``You get the picture?''
</P>
<P>
   He would reveal such things as his favorite book, ``The Red and
the Black,'' by 19th Century French author Henri Stendhal; favorite
movie, ``Local Hero''; and favorite quote, Bob Dylan's ``He not
busy being born is busy dying.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience clearly loved it, and if the show has an impact
remotely akin to Winfrey's influential book selections, it will
have been one of the most worthwhile hours of Gore's campaign.
Winfrey helped by zeroing in on Gore's perceived weaknesses, airing
the common complaints that Gore is stiff, boring and out of touch.
But she softened the blow by airing videotapes that showed Gore in
numerous adoring moments with his wife, Tipper. At every
opportunity, Gore told viewers that his most important values are
centered around his wife, his children and his faith _ which also
happen to be daily themes of Winfrey's talk show.
</P>
<P>
   The show was especially important because it is aimed primarily
at women, who are Gore's strongest supporters. Gore leads Bush
among women by 14 to 20 points in various polls, with the overall
race in a dead heat. Gore hopes to win partly by increasing the
gender gap farther while regaining more of the male vote.
Television rating surveys show that Winfrey's audience is almost 80
percent female, mostly non-college educated, and typically 35 years
and older.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was mocked early in his campaign for his sudden shift
to beige and earth-toned casual clothing, showed up in a serious
dark blue suit, white shirt and blue power tie. Winfrey countered
with a tan suit, turtleneck sweater and stiletto-heeled red boots.
The two sat in over-sized chairs angled toward each other, in front
of a giant video screen that frequently showed images of an
alternately stiff or smiling vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the history of ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' the host
has refused invitations to host presidential debates or interview
candidates, saying that she was frustrated by the difficulty of
breaking through ``the wall'' of politicians. But she changed her
mind this year, convinced that an hour-long chat could provide a
valuable window into the candidates, both of whom leaped at the
chance to appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until today, I stayed away from politicians,'' Winfrey said.
``I never thought I could have a real conversation with them. What
we hope is at the end of the these two shows,'' viewers will know
``who do you trust, who feels right for you.'' She has not invited
Green Party candidate Ralph Nader or either of the two claiming to
be the Reform Party nominee, Patrick Buchanan or John Hagelin, a
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a personal tie to Winfrey, which helped the vice
president connect more easily to her than to other interviewers.
When he worked as a reporter for the Nashville Tennessean in the
1970s, she was a rising star on a local television station. As Gore
recalled on Monday's show, the two covered at least one story
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remembered you, but I didn't think you would remember me . .
. Did you really remember that?'' Winfrey asked. Gore did,
recalling how they both covered a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gore utilized the Winfrey forum, he simultaneously took
on the entertainment industry, proposing that music and video game
companies should voluntarily refrain from marketing their products
to children. Gore called for an ``immediate cease-fire'' in such
marketing, responding to a Federal Trade Commission finding that
the industry is deliberately targeting children with inappropriate
material. He suggested that if he is elected president, he would
give companies six months to stop such marketing or they would face
unspecified penalties. Gore's running mate, Senator Josepeh
Lieberman, and his wife have frequently taken on Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, for example, that he hoped the music industry would
be more sensitive about the way some ``albums'' have lyrics that
are inappropriate for some ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are called `CDs' now,'' Winfrey said, as the audience
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore recovered quickly, saying ``I shifted over to the MP3,''
referring to the digitized music format popular on the Internet.
Winfrey, unlike many other questioners, did not bring up Gore's
claim that he helped invent the Internet. Indeed, she stayed away
from controversial questions, preferring instead to ask whether
Gore agreed with some of her ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey, for example, said that schools need to start teaching
courses in parenting. Did Gore agree?
</P>
<P>
   Gore's unsurprising reply: ``I think it is a great idea.'' A
more controversial question came after the show was over. Asked by
a member of the audience whether he would make an issue of the fact
that Bush once was a heavy drinker, Gore said he understood Bush
had undergone a transformation and has served as governor without
any sign of such a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take at face value that he said that he wasn't, that he's
had a personal transformation and a period of growth, and that's
common in all of our lives . . . You know, he's been governor about
five years, and whatever you say about it, he certainly hasn't
given any reason for that question to be a matter of concern to
people, I don't think.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, like many celebrity guests, expressed awe at Winfrey's
sprawling publishing and broadcast empire, and her style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a magazine or a publishing house,'' Gore said.
And, Gore said, nodding to his host's outrageous footwear, ``I
don't have red boots.'' Oprah liked his comments so much that she
and the vice president gave each other a high-five.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey dwelled repeatedly on what has become known simply as
``The Kiss.'' Some observers have theorized The Kiss at the
convention was intended to send a message to voters who are upset
with President Clinton's affair with a former White House intern
and want an assurance that Gore has a strong relationship with his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised by . . . all the people who said that
was fake,'' Gore said. ``I felt this overwhelming surge of emotion.
This was a great moment in our lives. This has been a partnership
and she is my soulmate.''
</P>
<P>
   As the cameras zeroed in on women applauding in the audience,
Gore continued: ``One of the reporters asked if I was trying to
send a message.'' Pausing for effect, Gore said: ``I said I was
trying to send a message to Tipper!''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey, however, went kiss-less.
</P>
<P>
   ``No kiss?,'' Winfrey said as she greeted the vice president.
``I was hoping for something.''

REBELLIOUS HOUSE CONSERVATIVES TRYING TO BE MORE PRAGMATIC, AND
POLITICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House conservatives, who five years ago forced a
government shutdown to combat spending and helped oust Newt
Gingrich as speaker, have retreated this year and stayed mostly
silent about President Clinton's desire for significant increases
in spending levels.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than try to shut down the government or hamstring the
Republican leadership at every turn, as they previously did to get
what they wanted during year-end negotiations, these conservatives,
members of the so-called rebel class elected in 1994, have embraced
the art of Washington politics, in many cases swapping
philosophical principle for political pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   With their numbers dwindling to 60 or so stalwarts, these
conservatives say they have learned to make peace with Clinton's
powerful veto pen, to compromise and practice patience, and to
funnel money back home to protect themselves and the tenuous
Republican majority in the House. They recognize that a slim,
seven-vote margin of power does not allow them to behave like
revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   More important, though, in an era of budget surpluses, their
crusade to slash spending has become mostly irrelevant and
difficult to justify to their leaders and constituents. They are
soldiers in flux, their mission blunted by prosperity. In 1994,
they coalesced around balancing the budget, ending wasteful
spending and ridding the country of a ballooning deficit. Now that
has been accomplished, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This past month, I was running around the district trying to
find one person that still seemed interested in spending in
Washington,'' said Rep &UR; .  &LR; Joe Scarborough &UR;  &LR; of &UR;  &LR; Florida and a
one-time firebrand. ``Republicans have been the victim of their own
success, just like after the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, said Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, an
uncompromising fiscal conservative, ``the class of '94 has really
been co-opted. Our game now is trade-offs. What marbles can we
trade as opposed to the old line of when we first got here that
this is a matter of principle.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also biding their time, understanding that Gov. George
W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, could win the White
House and smooth the way for many of their causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not make waves so we don't cause a train wreck because
it will all be fixed when Bush gets in,'' Sanford said, a message
most conservatives have heeded.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some Republicans in the Senate are doing their best to
run from the label of conservative in the upcoming election.
``We've seen dozens of Republican general election ads and not one
has contained the words Republican or conservative,'' said Jim
Jordan, a spokesman for the Senate Democratic campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democratic leaders will meet with Clinton at the
White House on Tuesday in their first discussions to determine
exactly what spending levels the president wants. The talks come at
a time when many Republicans voice distrust that Clinton will
negotiate in good faith, feeling that he is more interested in
provoking disputes or delays with conservatives that would help
Democrats at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Although their numbers have dwindled and their mission grown
more fractured, these conservatives have not given up the fight
entirely. Their list of demands may be much shorter now _ gone for
the most part are battles over the National Endowment for the Arts,
education spending and, in many cases, abortion _ but they are
still making them.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, they want to underscore their displeasure with all
this spending; they are already squabbling with the leadership over
several appropriations bills, arguing that the bills exceed
spending limits outlined in the budget blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to blunt the increase in spending, they hope to offer a
plan to protect some of the surplus by setting aside $2 billion to
$5 billion on each &UR;  &LR; appropriations bill to pay down the debt. It is
a politically popular idea that pleases Republican leaders and
would be difficult for Clinton to oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives may also force an impasse on several of
Clinton's top policy priorities, including passage of a bill to
make hate attacks on gays a federal crime, expand school
construction and tighten gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our base doesn't expect us to win, but they want to make sure
we're fighting for them,'' said Rep. John Shadegg &UR;  &LR; of &UR;  &LR; Arizona, who
is chairman of the 60-member Conservative Action Team.

 WASHINGTON: Action Team.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That is a long cry from their all-or-nothing position back in
1994 when 73 freshmen became the foot soldiers in Gingrich's
Republican revolution to carry out the Contract With America, the
conservatives' manifesto.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over since 1995, a band of the rebellious freshmen held
up major spending bills with their demands to strip funds from the
National Endowment for the Arts, prevent federal dollars to be used
for abortions or to promulgate abortions or to permit striking
workers to be replaced, among many others. In 1995, they fueled the
push to seek a balanced budget by 2002, and shut down the
government to do it, a move that backfired politically.
</P>
<P>
   But now, many of those hard-line rebels, known as CATs, for
Conservative Action Team, have mellowed in tone and tactics, and
have acknowledged their willingness to compromise or accept failure
so long as they can say the House tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a practical conservative now,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham
of South Carolina, without a touch of remorse. ``I'll vote for
bills that I wouldn't have voted for two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert has helped along their transition.
In part, it was Newt Gingrich, Hastert's predecessor, who stoked
the conservatives' rage. A rebel himself, Gingrich often issued
dictates and seldom sat down to listen to them, the conservatives
said. They also said he was quick to promise much and deliver
little.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, a conciliator whom the conservatives say they trust,
has done the opposite, setting a less combative tone and explaining
the difficulty of governing with such a slim majority. Had Gingrich
still been in charge, said Rep. Mark Souder of Indiana, once of the
most defiant rebels, ``The CATs group, as well as moderates, would
have blown up by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denny identifies, really listens, changes, and then says how
would you do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who is still critical of the
Republican leadership, also concedes that there are differences
between Gingrich and Hastert. ``You can absolutely trust what Denny
Hastert tells you.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn is part of a shrinking number of rebels who say they
cannot stomach all of this capitulation on spending, despite the
budget surplus. Sanford is another. Not coincidentally, both men
are leaving at the end of this term as they make good on pledges
not to serve more than six years in the House. Their farewells,
they say, are colored with disillusion.
</P>
<P>
   The two men say that Republicans, for all their talk of
accomplishments, have nevertheless abandoned their principles for
political survival and lost sight of grander goals _ less
government and bedrock conservative social policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our leadership has not had courage to face Clinton down
because they're more interested in maintaining control of Congress
than doing what's best for the country,'' Coburn said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Most rebels, like Scarborough, &UR;  &LR; look back and see victory,
ticking off their successes since 1994. Sanford does the opposite.
The budget surplus, he said, has nothing to do with tightening
spending but everything to do with economic expansion and a bull
market, which could decline at any time. Clinton's tax increase,
which he secured before the rebels got elected, helped it all
along, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most frequent words you probably heard in those CAT
meetings four years ago is this is a matter of principle and we
can't vote for this,'' he said. ``But I guess as time goes by, and
one becomes a more seasoned legislator, the best word now is, `What
can we trade off in this bill?' That is a pretty, pretty, pretty
violent contrast.''
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, the two words that do not cross any of the
rebels' lips is government shutdown. Now it is Clinton, they note,
who is making that veiled reference, something they note with a
chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice little switch,'' Scarborough said. ``We wish him
all the best. It's not as fun as it sounds.''

BUSH TELLS FLORIDA SENIOR CITIZENS NOT TO BELIEVE `SCARE TACTICS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ Bringing his self-declared ``underdog''
campaign to a must-win state, George W. Bush urged several hundred
senior citizens on Monday not to believe ``scare tactics'' that may
be thrown at them by his opponents over issues dear to their
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   With recent polls indicating that Florida's 25 electoral votes
are up for grabs in the presidential race, Bush sought to assure
residents at the ``On Top of the World'' retirement community that
he was on their side on issues such as Social Security and access
to prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, lost his
first race for governor in 1994, partly because of ``old-style
politics'' and ``scare tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I promise you, unless something dramatically has changed,
the same old scare-tactics politics will come into Florida. They'll
be saying, you know, `If George W. becomes the president, he's
going to take away your Social Security check,' '' the Republican
nominee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't believe it. Here's my pledge to the people of Florida: A
promise made by our government will be a promise kept when I become
the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, George W. Bush may have felt comfortable about his
chances in Florida, since his brother is governor here. But the key
southern state also has a high concentration of elderly voters, and
Democratic nominee Al Gore has been campaigning hard here on Social
Security and health care, two issues of vital concern to senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor arrived in Florida on the same day that a new
poll by USA Today/CNN/Gallup showed that Bush had dropped behind
Gore in the race for the electoral votes that will determine the
White House winner.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he admitted that he was an ``underdog'' in the
presidential race after losing his longtime lead in the polls and
momentum to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clearwater was Bush's first stop on a five-state, nine-city,
7,700-mile transcontinental campaign swing that will end late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters not to blame the tightness of the race in
Florida on his brother, who greeted him at the airport and
introduced him to the retirement center audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to carry Florida. The reason is I've got real plans
for real people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bush campaign, senior citizens make up 25
percent of the voters in Pinellas County, where Clearwater is
located. The area, a Bush staffer said, also includes a high
concentration of swing voters, who could be crucial in the Nov. 7
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has a solemn obligation to help our seniors as
they get into the twilight of their lives,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He told the senior citizens that he would spend Social Security
revenue on Social Security only and spend half of the non-Social
Security federal surplus on Social Security as well.
</P>
<P>
   He said younger workers, under his plan, could remain in the
system as it is or invest part of their Social Security
contributions in private, individual investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also promoted his prescription drug plan,
which he unveiled last week. The proposal would let seniors choose
among private insurance plans offering drug-benefits, with Medicaid
subsidizing the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prescription drugs for seniors are going to be a priority. Not
only a priority, we're going to get something done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that his prescription drug plan, unlike Gore's, would
allow senior citizens to chose an option that best suits their own
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have a variety of plans for seniors, instead of
having a failed HMO called the federal government try to manage
your plan for you,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   As he did last Friday, when he first announced his retooled,
``underdog'' campaign, Bush also took several questions from his
audience, which he seldom has done until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Answering one question, Bush said that he not only would sign
legislation banning the procedure opponents call partial birth
abortion, he also would play an active role in getting Congress to
pass it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes declined to say whether the Bush
campaign considers Florida a ``must-win'' state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is clearly a battleground state,'' she said. ``But we
feel we can win and we will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush was elected governor of Florida in 1998, after losing
to Democrat Lawton Chiles in 1994. President Clinton carried
Florida over Republican nominee Bob Dole in 1996 after narrowly
losing the state to President Bush, the governor's father, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was to campaign in Florida and Missouri Tuesday before
flying west for campaign stops in Washington state, California and
New Mexico.

   RUSSIA-SPY _ MOSCOW _ On Monday, Sept. 11, a Moscow city court
is going to re-examine the case against Edmond Pope, the American
in jail charged with espionage. The court will consider a defense
lawyer's motion to release Pope on bail, or release him from jail
to a hospital, pending trial. Pope's wife, Cheri, and congressman
John Peterson have argued that Pope needs constant medical
attention because he has a rare form of bone cancer that is in
remission. (Coker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 22

   SELMA-ELECTION _ SELMA, Ala._Everything's changed and nothing's
changed here in the cradle of the Civil Rights movement. The town
where the famous voting rights march led by Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. took place in 1965 now has its first black police chief and
blacks now make up a majority of the registered voters. That's a
far cry from the days when blacks had to demand their right to
vote. One thing hasn't changed. Joe T. Smitherman, the mayor in
1965 when state troopers beat and trampled protestors on the Edmund
Pettus Bridge, still holds office. But there's hope among the black
community that's tried to unseat him for 36 years. Smitherman, a
former washing machine salesman, is in a runoff for the first time.
He's challenged by a black businessman who's tried twice before to
beat Smitherman. The election is Tuesday night. (Manuel, Atlanta

Reporters can be a pain in the posterior. But describing them as

rivals such as TiVo could change the way people use the tube.
Digital video recorders pose challenges for advertisers, however,
because they can make it easier than ever to skip commercials.
Coke's deal could help the company find a way to splash its name in

training in end-of life care, particularly the pain-relief and
psychological aspects, but aside from that, there is an honest
dispute as to where doctors belong on the spectrum from defying
death to embracing hospice care. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) 50

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Bob Knight's problems with the administration at
Indiana University _ particularly with Athletics Director Clarence
Doninger _ that bubbled to the surface in the past year, go further
back.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the 1988-89 basketball season, a lot of people on and

his staff. Although he had no public comment on the subject,
Doninger was among those who questioned the move.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the withdrawal of a blue chip recruit, Springfield's
Jason Collier in his sophomore season before the Big Ten Conference
schedule, that drew heavy criticism of Knight's program among IU
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Collier had been rated among the nation's most sought after and
highly publicized recruits of the previous year. There had been
other players who had left the program before, but no one of the
national stature of Collier.
</P>
<P>
   Knight felt that Doninger was not publicly supporting his coach.

<P>
   ``There were promising players that same year transferring from
the likes of Kentucky and North Carolina, but I was the guy getting
the most heat,'' he told me.
</P>
<P>
   Collier is an athlete of considerable skills, but Knight didn't
believe the competitive fire was burning in his belly. Collier
transferred to Georgia Tech where he didn't come close to
All-American status as expected and was actually blamed by some for
contributing to veteran coach Bobby Cremins losing his job last
season. (Collier was named second-team All-Atlantic Coast
Conference and he was an NBA first-round draft choice, 15th pick
overall).
</P>
<P>
   But if Knight was criticized for Collier's departure, the real
firestorm blew up a year later when Luke Recker announced his
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Recker was Indiana's ``Mr. Basketball'' in his senior year in
high school. That he committed to IU without ever considering
another school was something special. Recker later went on record
that he wasn't developing his talent _ a slap at Knight's coaching.
</P>
<P>
   But the coach's view was that Recker was unwilling to adapt to
Knight's long-standing concept of starting the offense off
defensive play _ which such players as high scoring Steve Alford,
Brian Evans, Isiah Thomas and A.J. Guyton had learned to accept and
do.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time, Knight's philosophy could be criticized
around the state in places it had never been before.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, there were two critical mistakes in
recruiting that came back to haunt Knight. Longtime assistant coach
Ron Felling was a participant in both.
</P>
<P>
   The first involved Brian Cardenal, whose father was athletic
trainer at Illinois. Felling apparently took the word of Illini
assistant coaches at the time that Cardenal wasn't Big Ten
material. The player later said he actually wanted to go to IU, but
wasn't recruited. He wound up at Purdue where he tormented the
Hoosiers every time he faced them.
</P>
<P>
   The balding Cardenal played basketball the same way Pete Rose
played baseball. He won a reputation of leading the league in floor
burns. He is evidence that recruiters never know what is inside a
man that drives him to perform beyond his potential.
</P>
<P>
   The other recruiting snafu involved is Andre Hutson, the power
forward out of Trotwood-Madison High School who helped Michigan
State to back-to-back Big Ten titles and has a year of eligibility
left.
</P>
<P>
   Vandalia Butler coach Ray Zawadzki recalls being surprised last
year to get a call from Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me if any member of his staff had contacted me for an
opinion on Hutson,'' Zawadzki said.
</P>
<P>
   Felling had turned in a negative report on Hutson. Knight fired
him last December in a move that drew attention to some in-house
unrest _ a prelude to the final sad story.

FOR TORONTO,   FILM FESTIVAL   IS A PASSION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ On the opening day of the 25th Toronto International
Film Festival, a sunny and muggy Thursday afternoon, a minor
miracle took place. At the corner of Bay and Bloor Streets, by the
Varsity Theater, a festival site, a sprinkle of water fell to offer
relief from the irritating heat.
</P>
<P>
   The moisture from a cloudless sky had everyone looking and
muttering the same question, ``Where's this coming from?'' It was
just the kind of thing you would expect from this festival and this
city, a place that's both sophisticated and pleasant, and for those
dashing from one theater to the next, the light drizzle was like a
a needed splash for a boxer between rounds. (I found out that the
water was coming from a construction site, but its origin seemed
almost beside the point.)
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's festival is among the most cosmopolitan and inclusive
because the city turns out to support film. It's a metropolis for
movie lovers who take the opportunity to immerse themselves in
their enthusiasm. (Toronto has one of the three largest moviegoing
populations in North America, along with New York and Los Angeles.)
</P>
<P>
   The joke has always been that Canadians in general _ and Toronto
residents specifically _ have to make up for a lack of cool with a
reflexive cordiality that borders on the pathological; this
couldn't be less true.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than 300 films at this year's festival
dramatize family life in distinctive and idiosyncratic ways. The
wry and subtly atmospheric ``Angels of the Universe,'' a film by
the Icelandic director Fridrik Thor Fridriksson, looks with
sumptuous intensity at obsession, loss and spirituality through the
eyes of its suffering and game protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all equal before God, angels of the universe,'' he says,
though it's hard to believe when you see him and several other men
with Messiah complexes puffing nervously on cigarettes. This
anxiety keeps the movie vibrating. Equally sumptuous is
Fridriksson's use of music; it's a big part of his hero's life, as
the star pounds the walls of his house to ``I Put a Spell on You,''
and the luscious colors shine while the lovely, weightless songs of
the Icelandic pop group Sigur Ros play. Some may find the
miraculous essence of ``Angels'' too literal, but Fridriksson has
manufactured a gorgeous fugue state.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cox's ``Innocence'' is about a body blow to family. Its two
elderly lovers pick up after a gap of 50 years, and reveries of
their earlier involvement intrude into their current lives. The
picture's a little square, but the performances by its leads, who
come to life slowly _ as they spend more time together, and old
feelings and insecurities re-emerge _ move the picture beyond a
safe timorousness. The two actresses playing the older and younger
Claire have the same pained lines around their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Even director Benoit Jacquot's ``Sade,'' a melodrama about the
Marquis de Sade (Daniel Auteuil), has the roving sensualist acting
as a father figure. It's the most unusual performance that the
generally laid-back Auteuil has ever given. Savoring every syllable
as each rolls off his lips, he incorporates a theatrical and
outsize audacity, like a French Jack Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   His daring and gentleness is responsible for one of the best
scenes of any movie in the festival: a group, including the
luminous young actress Islid Le Besco, has gone through a mild
debauchery tutorial by Sade, and while they can't hold their heads
up to look anyone in the eyes, Sade ravenously devours a peach;
another day, another virgin.
</P>
<P>
   The director Stephen Frears was honored by the festival for his
body of work. His remarkable and intimate new film, ``Liam,'' is
playing here in addition to other films by him. Though his work
seems to be about ad hoc families, he rolls his eyes when that
point is raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about these things that much,'' Frears said.
``The whole business of giving so much attention to directors is
rubbish. I know the contributions that others make. When I was a
boy I just went to the pictures. I didn't question things. Though I
have been the beneficiary of a questioning generation, that's very
true. I'm just sick of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Liam'' is about family and tragedy in Liverpool in 1930; its
7-year-old title character is played by Anthony Burrows. A family
struggles to make ends meet as Fascism begins to ripen in England,
though it's also a comedy about repression, a subject that
resonates through most of Frears' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, all right,'' he said with a laugh. ``This one is about
family. It's about a child's view of the world, and the cruel way
the father is treated, a man who's trying to maintain his dignity.
If you're treated like that by the world, then Fascism makes sense.
I feel sorry for him. I admire the mother, who keeps things going
in the house. I've always admired actresses in my films because
they're stoic and dignified, like the mother in `Liam' or Michelle
Pfeiffer in `Dangerous Liaisons.' Actors are always the ones who
complain, about their lines or their makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   Fascism leads to racism in the horrifying climax of ``Liam,''
and it's like the best of Frears' work: an apparent calm is
disrupted by characters coming to grips with the misery they're
capable of causing.
</P>
<P>
   Encountering that evil in Hanif Kureishi's script for ``My
Beautiful Laundrette'' saddened him, Frears said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism first appeared publicly in England in 1957, during the
race riots,'' he said. ``Otherwise it's very quiet and insidious.
When I read Hanif's script, my heart sank. There's so much denial,
there. But, yes, `Liam' is about denial, too. I first learned I was
Jewish when I was 20, when my mother told me. It was startling, but
it was much more startling to have something concealed from me for
so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say it made a sort of dollar-book-Freud sense of my
life. But it's funny about `Liam.' In the scene when the kids come
running out of the cinema after seeing the movie, they're playing
cowboys and Indians. And they didn't know how, so we had to teach
them to be racist.''

COMMENTARY: LOAVES AND WISHES 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My wife was buying groceries at the supermarket shortly after Al
Gore chose Joe Lieberman as his running mate. It was a Friday, and
as the checkout lady bagged my wife's groceries, she was left at
the end with two breads _ one a Sabbath challah and the other a
Roman Meal sandwich loaf. The checkout lady picked up the two
breads, put them in a bag together, looked at my wife with a little
smile and said: ``I think the Roman Meal and challah can go
together, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   My wife told me she was sure it was the grocery lady's little
commentary on the Gore-Lieberman ticket. I tell that story when
people ask if I think Americans will actually vote for a ticket
with a Jewish vice-presidential candidate. Sure, for some
Lieberman's religion will be a negative, but I have no doubt most
Americans will judge him on his merits, which, thus far, have only
elevated his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   It's become something of a truism in American politics that, to
paraphrase H.L. Mencken, you'll never go broke underestimating the
American people. I think just the opposite is true. It certainly
has been in this campaign. There is still a basic fairness and
intelligence to the American electorate, and both candidates have
gotten into their worst trouble when they have underestimated that.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Gov. George W. Bush's lengthy dodging of the official
presidential debates. Bush had a complicated explanation about how
it was really Gore who was dodging the debates, because he wouldn't
go on ``Larry King'' or ``Meet the Press'' first. But that didn't
fly. Eskimos in their igloos in Alaska could see that Bush was
running away. Australian aborigines tuning in by satellite could
tell that Bush was dodging Gore. That's why, when you listened to
Bush accusing Gore of avoiding the debates, you just wanted to say:
``Am I wearing a sign that says `Stupid' on it?'' A politician
should never put such a question on voters' lips. Bush seems to
have gotten the message.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's low point _ the moment that deflated his whole primary
campaign _ was when he declared that he believed that the Cuban
refugee Elian Gonzalez should not automatically be reunited with
his father, but that the case should be resolved in family court _
and that none of this had to do with Florida politics. People are
always ready to accept a certain amount of pandering, but they
resent it when it goes to a point of insulting their intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's recent rebound surely has to do with the fact that,
having underestimated American voters for so many months by
appealing to them with various disguises and Alpha Male routines,
he finally settled on running as, well, Al Gore. His convention
speech basically said: I'm a wonk, I'm a bore, but I love my wife,
I believe in government, and I know from experience in Washington
how to make things work at home and abroad. That was a person a lot
more people thought they might like as president. And on the
question of his association with Clinton's scandals, Gore declared:
Don't worry, I'm my own man.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, has run as himself from the start. And while
there are aspects of his personality that are clearly appealing to
voters, his inability to consistently put sentences together _ and
the holes in his knowledge that lead him to calling Greeks
``Grecians'' and to other eyebrow-raising bloopers _ have forced
him to essentially say to voters: Don't worry, I won't be my own
man.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, last week Bush introduced Colin Powell at a
campaign event by saying: ``The next man I introduce used to be in
government. And if all goes well ... (he will be in my cabinet
too).'' Message to voters: Don't worry, I won't be driving alone.
Powell will be there in the front seat, along with dad's other old
advisers. But this may not be a bad strategy, because it addresses
what voters worry about with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For many voters this election is clearly about differing
policies, but for many I believe it's about something more basic _
a feeling that the country's engine is running OK, and we're more
or less headed on the right road, and therefore the key question
is, to whom do you want to entrust the car keys? That's a question
the American people come to with a lot of good instincts _ whether
in evaluating character or tax cuts. And my own bet is that in
these closing weeks of the campaign the candidate who loses will be
the one who underestimates that.

GORE SAYS HE'LL COME DOWN HARD ON HOLLYWOOD VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore, distancing himself from the entertainment
executives who have donated very generously to his campaign, Monday
threatened that as president, he would find ways to punish
Hollywood for marketing violent material to children if it ``does
not clean up its act'' in six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard enough to raise children today without the
entertainment industry making it more difficult,'' the vice
president said as he campaigned in Belleville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was reacting to a blistering Federal Trade Commission
report on the entertainment industry's deliberate advertising of
R-rated material to young teens, was mocked by the Bush campaign as
``reaching new levels of hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, Al Gore is telling Hollywood to clean up its act
after aggressively cleaning out their wallets for the past year,''
said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Texas Governor George W. Bush.
``Al Gore waving around a report that he denounced at a Hollywood
fund-raiser just a year ago makes him a deserving candidate for an
Oscar award in hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not make an issue of the new FTC report as he
campaigned in Florida Monday. A spokeswoman said he supported the
agency's inquiry, which was ordered more than a year ago by
President Clinton in the wake of a White House summit on media
violence and the school shootings in Littleton, Colo., and Conyers,
Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers said it was smart for Gore, who is working
hard to woo women voters and determined to remove any taint of the
Clinton administration scandals, to seize the opportunity to
champion a family-values issue. Gore's running mate, Joseph
Lieberman, has been a stern Senate critic of the entertainment
industry, and Gore's wife, Tipper, led a fight in the mid-1980s to
get record companies to agree to put parental warnings on albums
and later CDs with dirty lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore and Joe Lieberman are playing the moral card, and it
makes sense strategically because the Gore ticket is most
vulnerable on moral issues,'' said Robert Knight, senior director
cultural studies at the conservative Family Research Council.
``Given the Democrats' ties to Hollywood, one would think this
would be perilous ground for them to occupy. But Gore has made an
end run, largely because the Republican ticket has not been
aggressive in addressing issues like entertainment violence.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some disagreement about how aggressive Vice President
Gore was on the media violence issue before it started popping up
in opinion polls as a concern, particularly of women.
Representative Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who pushed
Congress to enact legislation requiring program-blocking V-chips in
televisions, says President Clinton ``subcontracted''
telecommunications issues to Gore, and he remained prominent
political player.
</P>
<P>
   ``On every issue that dealt with children's television, with
media violence, with the ratings systems, it all came out of the
vice president's office,'' Markey said. ``Joe Lieberman helps Al
Gore get the credit on these media issues that he should have
gotten all along.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Los Angeles Times reported last year that shortly after
the president called for the FTC probe, Gore attended a Hollywood
fund raiser and privately disclosed that it had not been his idea,
nor had Clinton sought his input before initiating it. During the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in August, neither
Gore nor Lieberman attacked gratuitous sex and violence in the
media, though Lieberman has for a number of years bestowed the
``Silver Sewer'' award on Hollywood's worst ``cultural polluters.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Wyatt, president of the Parents Music Resource Center,
which Mrs. Gore founded in 1984, said she was asked by the Gores to
close the organization in 1988, when then-Senator Gore first ran
for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gores absolutely backed away and said, `Our mission is
completed,' '' Wyatt said. ``I want to give him his due, but
Clinton and Gore could have done much more over the last eight
years to use the bully pulpit on this issue, and they have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believed it was because the Clintons, in particular, had
become too comfortable with Hollywood entertainment executives and
entertainers. Since 1990 the television, film, and music
industries, including their corporate leaders, have contributed
$83.9 million to political races. Democrats received 65 percent of
the money, while Republicans got 35 percent, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign-finance watchdog group.
So far in this election cycle, Gore has received $929,000 and Bush
has received $728,000, the center reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he is biting the hand that feeds him, but to
some extent Gore is distancing himself from Hollywood the way Bush
and Cheney need to distance themselves from the oil industry,''
said Larry Makinson, who directs the center. ``I think Gore
perceives that in the mind of the general public, there is too
close a connection between Democrats and Hollywood, and he needs to
break that connection.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of an entertainment-industry trade group, who did not
want to be identified, went further, suggesting that Gore and
Lieberman have adopted the political strategy that ``there is hay
to be made in villifying our industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``By speaking out against this big constituency, by standing up
to the people who fund their campaign, Gore and Lieberman are
blunting the effort to be painted as captives of Hollywood and
special interests and affirming, `We have integrity.' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Lieberman will get another opportunity to do that
when he testifies at a hearing on media violence before the Senate
Commerce Committee, which is chaired by Senator John McCain. Lynne
Cheney, wife of Bush running mate Dick Cheney, will also testify, a
committee spokeswoman confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   David Walsh, president of the National Institute on Media and
the Family, a nonprofit group in Minneapolis, said he is happy to
see the bipartisan concern over the issue, even if the flurry of
activity has strong political-season overtones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women and mothers really relate to this issue, they `get it'
better than men,'' Walsh said. ``Partly it's because they are more
attuned to the things that are influencing their kids. Partly it's
because men tend to have a greater appetite themselves for
action-oriented media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most everyone, though, wants a more civil, decent, and
respectful society,'' Walsh said. ``And both men and women perceive
that the media contributes to the culture of disrespect.''

 &HT;    GM tries to shine up Cadillac image
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elvis bought them six at a time. President Eisenhower rode one
to his 1953 inauguration. John F. Kennedy tooled around Palm Beach
in a convertible. And they graced the driveways of King Saud and J.
Paul Getty.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after decades ``stuck in the mud,'' the Caddy _ Cadillac to
the uninitiated _ is about to make a new entrance in a ``bold new
campaign to rev up its image and its sales,'' Fortune (Sept. 18)
reports.
</P>
<P>
   The new marketing effort ``represents a high-stakes move by
General Motors' Cadillac division to reposition itself in the
luxury-car market after a quarter century of declining sales and
diminishing prestige,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Cadillac trails Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi and Lexus
models by a wide margin, it was once the premier luxury automobile
with its long fins and twin taillights _ and is still the
longest-running luxury-car brand name, Fortune notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cadillacs were icons of American might,'' writes Lucian
Truscott IV in a personal reminiscence about his first Caddy.
``Driving one of those monsters, a man of achievement must have
felt as if he could bluff his way through anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Warren Buffett might blink at the bill he would get from
the ``ultimate investment club'' assembled by Money (October), a
personal finance magazine. Among the 10 members are Wall Street
strategist Abby Joseph Cohen, mutual fund legend Peter Lynch and
Vanguard funds founder John C. Bogle.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a portfolio of stocks gleaned by Money from its
interviews with these high-priced gurus: American International
Group, Amazon.com, Aventis, Bank of America, BJ Services, Cisco,
Extreme Networks, Exxon Mobil, Fleetwood Enterprises, Merck, PE
Corp.PE Biosystems and WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor has rushed to assure consumers that it is doing
everything possible to quickly fix the problem of defective
Firestone tires. But Business Week (Sept. 18) says the automaker
should have acted at least three years sooner, when tire problems
first appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crisis that is testing (CEO Jacques) Nasser's
relatively new leadership and the strength of the Ford brand,''
says the magazine. Ford's strong sales and financial record and
fine reputation under Nasser are ``suddenly up in the air'' until
ultimate responsibility for the tire debacle is answered. For
Firestone, it may be too late, says Business Week.
</P>
<P>
   Cash in the hand can calm frazzled nerves in a down stock
market, which is why investors should buy shares of companies that
pay dividends, says Barron's (Sept. 11). The financial weekly's
best bets include General Electric, Merck and Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
whose stock performances have outstripped the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
in at least five of the past 10 years _ and they consistently up
their dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Synovus Financial, a Columbus-based financial services company,
is the lone Georgia company on the latest list of ``100 best
companies for working mothers,'' published annually by Working
Mother (October) magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's list is based on five criteria: child care, leave
for new parents, flexible work arrangements, work/life benefits
such as elder care and opportunities for advancement for women.
</P>
<P>
   Stock splits can be money-making opportunities for investors,
says Technology Investor (October), which walks readers through a
series of steps designed to make it easier to spot potential splits
before they happen.
</P>
<P>
   The latest spin by law firms that specialize in initial stock
offerings is to demand a share of the stock in the companies they
take public, Smart Business (September) says. And that's ``on top
of hefty fees,'' it adds.

RUSSIANS ARE QUICK TO CLAIM U.S. OPEN CHAMP AS THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  By   MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW &UR;  &LR; _ In a nation where there are but two sports _ soccer,
and everything else _ Russians were positively glowing with pride
today over the athletic prowess of 20-year-old Marat Safin.
</P>
<P>
   This, even though he practices a third-tier sport, tennis, in
which the only physical contact is between a racquet and a ball &UR; ;  &LR; 
even though he is an ethnic Tatar, a people too often derided here
_ a millennium after the fact, to boot _ as Atilla the Hun's
henchmen &UR; ;  &LR; and even though he and his family left Russia some four
years ago to live and play tennis in the sunnier climes of
Valencia, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Safin's accomplishment far outweighed any imagined negatives. On
Sunday, he became the first Russian ever to win the U.S. Open, one
of what Russian tennis buffs call the ``great helmets'' _ to
Westerners, the Grand Slam _ of tennis prizes. Better still, he did
it by demolishing the reigning American champion of world tennis,
Pete Sampras, in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wrong to say that Russians bear the average American
any great ill will. On the other hand, it would be just as wrong to
say that Russians have not been itching for the opportunity to show
that they are as good as the so-called sole remaining superpower,
particularly after a devastating August of submarine sinkings,
flaming television towers and stage whispers that the Russian bear
no longer can manage his own affairs, much less the world's.
</P>
<P>
   And so President Vladimir Putin hailed ``a bright new star'' in
the tennis firmament, and added: ``We are proud that today's victor
is a Russian.'' Reporters trailed Safin to a New York nightclub to
chronicle his early-morning victory celebration. And Monday
evening, the young tennis star's New York triumph _ and his
$800,000 first prize _ led all three network newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``On behalf of all Russians, we will be your fans,'' cooed an
anchorwoman on ORT, Russian Public Television, at the end of a
telephone interview on the 8 p.m. news.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to have such young men being so optimistic,''
chimed her male co-anchor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first Russian who is the U.S. champion,'' cheered a
reporter for a competing network, NTV _ and then deadpanned,
``nobody heard anything from Marat that he wanted to change
citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his parents moved him to Spain in 1996, where he
established a base for his tennis career, there seems little doubt
in Safin's mind today of where his roots lie. He is no stranger to
Moscow, his hometown, where he has occasionally been spotted at
some of the city's tonier nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter for Moscow's Izvestiya newspaper tracked him
down before sunrise on Monday in a New York disco shortly _
drinking celebratory beer, not vodka _ the new Open champion
credited much of his victory to the counsel of Aleksandr Volkov,
the Russian tennis star who had earlier made it to the Open
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   And he made it clear that his next stop, before flying to Sydney
and a spot on the Russian tennis team in the the summer Olympics,
would be Tashkent, Uzbekistan, a former Soviet state where he had
committed to friends to play in a decidedly lower-rung tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The nation seemed to return the embrace. From the top down,
Russia _ and its Soviet predecessor _ have long pigeonholed people
by religion and ethnicity beyond what most westerners would
consider acceptable. Tatars and Caucasians, usually Muslim, usually
darker-skinned people, have borne the brunt of discrimination, and
Safin's name marks him as being of Tatar descent.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's news accounts did not identify the nation's new
tennis sensation as a ``Rusian,'' the term applied to most ethnic
Russians, but instead as a ``Russki'' _ that is, the moniker
usually reserved for Russia's majority Slavic population.
</P>
<P>
   The government labor minister Aleksandr Pochinok observed that
all Russia indeed has a powerful reason to celebrate Safin's
victory. Not only has a major new force in tennis surfaced in
Russia, he told the news radio station Echo Moskvy _ ``a major new
taxpayer'' has arrived, too.

INCONCLUSIVE TESTS OF VACCINE LEAVE ORIGINS OF AIDS A MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tests have failed to support a theory that the worldwide AIDS
epidemic was touched off because an experimental oral polio vaccine
used in Africa more than 40 years ago was made from chimpanzee
tissue, scientists reported in London Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The tests do not conclusively disprove the possibility, however,
because other vaccines for which samples were not kept could still
have been made from chimpanzee cells. The tests leave unsolved the
mystery of the origins of AIDS, one of the worst epidemics in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in his book, ``The River,'' a British journalist,
Edward Hooper, advanced the provocative theory that such a vaccine
might have been made with chimpanzee tissue contaminated with an
ancestor of the virus that was to cause AIDS. The theory is based
in part on the general scientific belief that HIV-1 derives from a
simian virus in chimpanzees. HIV-1 is the virus that has caused the
overwhelming majority of the more than 50 million cases of AIDS and
HIV infection in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper suggested that the contamination might have come from an
experimental oral polio vaccine prepared at the Wistar institute, a
research center in Philadelphia. Scientific papers published at the
time did not say what primate tissues were used to make the
vaccine, Hooper said. The institute has denied that its scientists
used chimpanzee cells to prepare the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   After the vaccine theory was first raised in 1992 in an article
in ``Rolling Stone,'' the Wistar Institute appointed an independent
committee led by Dr. Claudio Basilico, chairman of the microbiology
department at New York University, to look into the matter. The
committee recommended testing the remaining stores of the vaccine.
But Wistar did not carry out the tests at the time, it has said,
because of a lack of scientific interest. Though Hooper's thesis
was not widely accepted, it led to calls for performing the tests.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Wistar provided the tiny amounts of remaining polio
vaccine to Dr. Vincent Racaniello at the Columbia University
College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. He divided and
coded the samples before delivering them to the researchers at
three independent laboratories who had agreed to perform the tests:
Dr. Shirley Kwok at Roche Molecular Systems in Pleasanton, Calif.;
Dr. Svante Paabo at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig, Germany;
and Dr. Simon Wain-Hobson at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Kwok tested the samples for the presence of HIV and SIV, its
simian cousin. Paabo tested for the presence and species origin of
two types of DNA in the samples. One comes from the nucleus. The
other comes from from mitochondria, which generate energy in the
cell and are quite species specific. Wain-Hobson performed both
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The three laboratories also tested samples sent from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. The federal agency in Atlanta
prepared samples that included old polio vaccine that it had kept
stored and other material that were used as controls for scientific
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The tests identified DNA from only one species of primate _ the
Asian macaque monkey, not the chimpanzee _ in the Wistar vaccine
samples, Basilico told the meeting in London at the Royal Society
on the origins of HIV and the AIDS Epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in the results from these tests to support
the theory that HIV entered the human population during the late
1950s polio virus clinical trials in Africa,'' Basilico said.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper could not be reached for comment Monday. In interview
last week, Hooper said he expected that the tests would not find
evidence of chimpanzee tissue because he believes the critical
samples are no longer available for testing.
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling case for the contaminated vaccine theory
would have been finding evidence of chimpanzee cells in the stored
vaccine. But even if the scientists had found evidence of a
chimpanzee virus in the samples tested, it would not have proved
that the virus started the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   An unanswered question is how HIV-1 jumped from primates to
humans. The earliest documented HIV-1 infection is from 1959 in a
man in Kinshasa in what was then the Belgian Congo.
</P>
<P>
   A widely held theory is that simian viruses passed from primates
to humans in blood-to-blood contact, like a bite or cut during the
slaughter of chimpanzees. But humans have killed chimpanzees for
centuries. Thus, an unanswered question is why widespread
transmission apparently did not begin until the late 1950s.

   AUTOS-ONLINE (Washington) _ On Monday, U.S. regulators put aside
antitrust concerns and approved formation of Covisint, a mammoth
online marketplace for the world's largest automakers. However, the
Federal Trade Commission, which voted to allow the venture to
proceed, said the government cannot say that implementation of the
Covisint venture will not cause competitive concerns, and it
reserved the right to take such further action as the public
interest ``may require.'' Covisint is an Internet marketplace joint
venture of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., DaimlerChrysler
AG, Renault SA and Nissan Motor Co., along with two information
technology companies, Commerce One Inc. and Oracle Corp. _ By Chris

   REAL-LIFE-MARKETING (Benton Harbor, Mich.) _ Tony Barbee was
never one for household chores. Even in college, he brought his
laundry home to mother, and he shunned the stove in favor of the
local Burger King or Kentucky Fried Chicken. But for two months
this summer, Barbee, now 30, and six other young recruits took part
in an unusual training program that might be considered the
corporate equivalent of realty-based television. A small group of
new hires at Whirlpool is essentially sentenced to live together in
a large house, where during the course of their stay they prepare
more than 900 plates of food; wash no fewer than 120 bags of
laundry; and perform countless hours of loading and reloading of
the company's refrigerators, dishwashers and dryers. _ By David

<TEXT>
<P>
   But where were they?
</P>
<P>
   It was 12:11 p.m. last Monday, and already the refrigerator
truck bearing $5 million worth of wax heads _ necessitating climate
control _ was two hours late.
</P>
<P>
   Worry was rising, as the welcoming committee, a five-member
design team imported from Madame Tussaud's in London, had nothing
to welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no fingernails left,'' said Gill Griffith, who in her
capacity as chief coiffeuse is known to all as head of hair.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that the team had spent months making 175 wax
likenesses of celebrities ranging from Maya Angelou to Diana,
Princess of Wales. The problem was that each moment of delay could
sabotage an intricate construction schedule. It wasn't until 3 p.m.
that they knew: the truck had turned back, stymied by Manhattan
streets frozen in Millennium Summit leaderlock.
</P>
<P>
   The heads finally arrived at 7:50 a.m. Tuesday. And separate
crates of bodies didn't begin turning up till Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after six months of construction and seven years of
planning, wax figures were finally arriving in the house of wax.
No, not the legendary London attraction, but the nearly finished
five-story wax palace in the Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   This Madame Tussaud's isn't quite ready for its close-up yet.
The official unveiling of the $50 million showcase is scheduled for
mid-November, although the public will begin to be admitted in a
``soft opening'' starting in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   So these days, the F.J. Sciame Construction Co. (the New Victory
Theater, Bridgemarket) is hurling 100 carpenters and electricians
into a nasty, brutish and short assault on the unfinished
structure. They are working from dawn to dusk six days a week to
bring the British institution's fixation with fame to an
85,000-square-foot shell on 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth
Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   The known world has been invited to the construction site
Tuesday to observe Gov. George E. Pataki unveiling his wax statue _
Tussaud's calls them portraits _ which cost $50,000 and took six
months to ``build,'' as Tussaud's refers to the creation of a
statue. Also among the bewaxed in the new exhibition will be Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, Woody Allen, Josephine Baker, Katie Couric, Joe
DiMaggio, Bill Gates, Hugh Grant, Ernest Hemingway, Yoko Ono, Annie
Leibovitz, Mickey Mantle, Joe Namath, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
Gen. Colin Powell, Christopher Reeve, Sitting Bull and Andy Warhol.
</P>
<P>
   All those heads and bodies must be assembled, clothed and placed
just so. There is also the matter of the crystal chandelier in the
Guillotine Room, which must be more richly crystal. Then there's
the guillotine itself, which must be programmed to decapitate the
wax aristocracy every three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In the balance is an assumption putting millions of dollars and
a legendary brand name at risk: that East Coast Yanks and the
tourists who visit them will go for Tussaud's. It is by no means a
slam dunk, this notion that London's most popular tourist
attraction _ 2.7 million visitors a year _ can capture a profitable
lifeline of American visitors. The Tussaud's aesthetic is an
amalgam of creepy glitz, high-oxygen portrait artistry and a
bizarre but jolly fascination with gruesome spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   And so, when Andrew Tansley, the director of the privately held
Tussaud's Group Ltd., arrived from England to inspect the
construction shell last spring, a visitor joined him, beginning a
five-month exposure to the art of Tussaudification. Herewith, a few
moments from the transplantation of an eccentric London institution
to a city that thought it was inured to the weird.
</P>
<P>
   APRIL 11
</P>
<P>
   Striding confidently through his bare-bones new space, Tansley
announced that Tussaud's had signed a 49-year lease and a 50-year
extension, close to a century of commitment. ``We'd like to think
that this is the place Madame Tussaud would have created had she
settled in New York rather than in London,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tansley, 48, referred, of course, to the company's founding
diva, Marie Tussaud, a teacher of art to royal French offspring who
was spared the guillotine so that she could use her skills to
create the death masks of aristocrats who included Marie Antoinette
and Louis XVI.
</P>
<P>
   So creepy is the quasi-historical verismo of Tussaud's that the
original mold of the death mask of Marie Antoinette _ taken by
Madame Tussaud _ contains some of the queen's eyelashes, still
entombed in the plaster.
</P>
<P>
   After fleeing the Napoleonic Wars and landing in England in
1802, Madame toured her portrait museum on wagons throughout
Britain before establishing her first London museum in 1835.
</P>
<P>
   Tansley said the greatest challenge for his team was to rekindle
in New York the spirit of the London original. Despite its Chamber
of Horrors (a gallery of assassination, torture and heads on
pikes), Tussaud's has acquired a certain brummagem cachet thanks to
its relationship with the rich and famous. The celebrities who pose
for portraits include the British royal family; every reigning
English monarch back to George III has sat for Tussaud's sculptors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been a slightly macabre side to a wax
portrait, and these portraits can seem pretty creepy,'' Tansley
said. But, he insisted, ``we are not glorifying blood or
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   APRIL 18
</P>
<P>
   The building lobby, destined to vaunt lush blue carpeting picked
out in gold stars, is now a realm of scaffolding and yellow caution
tape; chain hoists are clanking. Anyone navigating the construction
rubble would wonder how Tussaud's could ever expect that 1.8
million people a year (1,200 an hour at peak times) would troop
through that lobby, paying $12.75 to $19.95 for their two-hour
visits.
</P>
<P>
   It is even harder to envision customers being whooshed to the
top of the building in two exterior glass-sheathed elevators that
will disgorge them into a fantasy ``Opening Night Party'' featuring
wax celebrities hobnobbing at a mythical Broadway show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the stage where you look around and say, `It's not
going to happen,''' said Janine Scarpello, the feisty,
hard-hat-wearing general manager. ``But it always does.''

   ``Already, we're getting mail, mostly bills,'' said Rod Hickey,
the 37-year-old production manager, shouting over the whine of a
circular saw. ``The post office says we exist,'' he continued,
reading the address of a letter sent to ``234 West 43rd Street,
Madame Tussaud's.'' (In England, the surname is generally
pronounced tuh-SAWDZ, but Francophiles pronounce the final syllable
to rhyme with modes.)
</P>
<P>
   Hickey is an indomitably fireproof construction boss who has
seen it all, then fixed it. He orchestrated the creation of Cirque
du Soleil's aquatic ``O'' fantasia in Las Vegas, where he also
managed to get the pirate ship to sink on cue at the Treasure
Island Casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think there's a degree of difficulty with this
building,'' he said of Tussaud's, ``try explaining to Steve Wynn
why the ship won't come back up.''
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 5
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a small miscalculation can affect the likeness,'' said
Judy Craig, 58, the head of the Tussaud's portrait studio in
London, which has a staff of 80 artists and technicians. ``You want
the smile on the lips to match the smile in the eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tussaud's creative teams take 250 intricate measurements of
celebrities' body proportions and hundreds of color photographs in
creating likenesses of the face (sculptured in clay and cast in
wax), the hands (cast in clay, then wax) and body (fiberglass, with
an armature of steel and chicken wire, covered with clothes often
donated by the celebrity subjects). The eyes are acrylic. The hair?
Real. Inserted strand by strand.
</P>
<P>
   Later, on the phone, the singer Tony Bennett recalled what it
was like to be modeled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a real sense they are super-realist artists,'' said
Bennett, whose own oil paintings have had many gallery shows.
</P>
<P>
   When Bennett sat for a ``very tedious'' Tussaud's modeling
session, he remembered, ``they got everything right, down to the
crack in my tooth.'' He added: ``Then they conned me out of one of
my Brioni suits _ dark blue. So they could dress me up in the
museum.''

   There are showers of acetylene sparks down in the lobby as 10
workmen weld together 20-foot pieces of A36 structural steel, the
spine of the 15,000-pound staircase that millions of tourists are
expected to ascend to the summit of American waxdom. Upstairs, in
the Guillotine Room, the walls are being lined with murals of mobs
battling during the French Revolution; the canvas has been aged and
given a patina of craquelure.
</P>
<P>
   While New Yorkers will be spared such gruesome London spectacles
as Marat being knifed in his bath, there will be no dearth of
historic gore. An exhibition called ``Madame Tussaud's Story'' will
feature the functioning guillotine complete with its condemned
royal victims. In the Graveyard Room, Brett Klisch, 27, head scenic
artist for the installation, pointed out an open grave bearing a
decapitated nobleman, listed in the scenery roster as ``Generic
Headless Body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the family room,'' Klisch said proudly. ``Soon
we'll put in the bodies and the tombs to theme it out.''
</P>
<P>
   AUG. 2
</P>
<P>
   No one has been seriously injured on the construction site, but
there have been petty disasters: the roof leak in the Portrait
Gallery, the mural that didn't fit. Then there was the tragic Babe
Ruth incident. In mid-July, Tussaud's transported the portraits of
Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle to Yankee Stadium for a
publicity event. Only Joltin' Joe and the Mick came back in one
piece. The Sultan of Swat statue fell forward, shattering the
hollow wax head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We managed to save the eyeballs,'' said Steve Futcher, a
portrait molder, describing the rush to complete a new head by
opening night.
</P>
<P>
   AUG. 10
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, all the lighting isn't in, and the tree limbs aren't
quite done, but the Mirror Maze is up. A construction team using
suction cups manhandled the giant, custom-made mirrors into place.
What's the hardest thing about doing that? ``Not breaking the
mirrors between now and the opening,'' said Tony Bianco, a
carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   AUG. 24
</P>
<P>
   The guillotine has arrived, but Gavin Sadler is concerned about
the missing bolt. ``It's a metric M6,'' said Sadler, 30, the
technical director, who has arrived with the guillotine to get it
up and chopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get a metric _ where?'' asked Hickey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' said Steve Van Varick, a carpenter perched on a
scissors lift. ``We'll take it out of the Ikea furniture at Rod's
house.''
</P>
<P>
   The guillotine is, of course, a reproduction of a French
original: It was built in Haverhill, Suffolk, in England. The
18-foot-high, 661-pound contraption has a rough, dirty job to do,
and it accomplishes it with a yard-wide, 22-pound fake blade that
crashes convincingly, horrifying new batches of customers who enter
the room. It resets as the crowd is distracted by a cannon shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make it three times stronger than it needs to
be,'' said Sadler, a veteran set designer for West End productions
in London. He said proudly, ``It's my first guillotine.''
</P>
<P>
   SEPT. 7
</P>
<P>
   Bodies are arriving, four or five per crate, and the London
design team is toiling to join them to heads. Lisa Partridge, the
Tussaud's artist who creates acrylic eyes, has learned that Film
Forum in Manhattan will soon be screening a new 3-D print of
``House of Wax,'' the 1953 horror film starring Vincent Price as
the mad sculptor who repopulates his Victorian chamber of horrors
by coating victims with wax.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few colleagues for which that might be an
option,'' Partridge said, raising a laugh from the wax gang.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks of desperate labor remain until the first
faux-celebrity-starved visitors troop up the grand staircase.
</P>
<P>
   And then?
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all finished,'' said Hickey, unflappable to the
last, ``I get to leave.''

 &HT;    INTERNET HOLLYWOOD: The marriage of glitz and geek
 &HT;    By Bob Keefe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Tom Arnold hasn't had the best of luck with the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The actor recently did some ads for a high-speed Internet access
company. But it took the company months to install service at his
home.
</P>
<P>
   When he was considering whether to start a Web site, he went to
several companies that promised the world, but couldn't deliver.
One outfit's computers crashed halfway through a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a bit surprising to see Arnold bumping elbows with Web
designers and other Internet junkies at a recent private party in
an empty studio near Hollywood. It was even more surprising when,
between sets by a San Francisco salsa-rap band, he got up on stage
to announce he was joining the board of and investing in the
party's sponsor, Internet company Broadband Investment Group Corp.
He also plans to launch an Internet talk show with the group's
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would've told me a year ago that you were thinking
about doing something on the Internet, I would've puked,'' Arnold
said afterwards between puffs of a stubby Cohiba cigar. ``But the
perception of the Internet has changed. The medium has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   And with it, Hollywood is changing, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, William Shatner went where no star has been before with
his ads for Priceline.com Several actors and actresses have Web
sites _ authorized or not.
</P>
<P>
   But while Northern California's Silicon Valley might be the
epicenter of technology, only recently have the ripples reached the
epicenter of entertainment _ Hollywood and the Southern California
cities that surround it _ in a big way. The resulting marriage of
glitz and geek promises to produce everything from Internet movies
to star-powered technology business incubators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a period where _ for the first time in history _
technology and creative (entertainment) are beginning to
intersect,'' said Leonard Armato, a Los Angeles talent agent who
has also become an Internet entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Armato is best known in Los Angeles as Shaquille O'Neal's agent.
He also represents actress Pamela Anderson. In between contracts
and negotiations, Armato is starting something he calls the Digital
Media Campus, a quasi-technology business incubator where sports
and film celebrities can create Internet content.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only Anderson has set up shop there, working on a site
she plans to call Pamtv.com. But Digital Media Campus claims to
have some hefty backers. Among the advisers and investors Armato
lists are actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, music maker Quincy Jones and
tech stars such as Oracle Corp.'s Larry Ellison and Netscape
co-founder Marc Andreessen. Armato also has a little Web
experience: Earlier this year, he and O'Neal teamed up to create
Dunk.com to sell shoes and other athletic apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Like Arnold and Anderson, other stars are taking to the Internet
with profits in mind. One of the most visible has been actress
Melanie Griffith, who made a big splash recently when she launched
Oneworldlive.com, which sells beauty supplies and diet programs
while providing what it calls ``lifestyle and transformational
content.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's hitch to high-tech isn't just about actors and
athletes, however. After years of sitting on the sidelines, even
major film studios are cautiously starting to get in on the
Internet act.
</P>
<P>
   Following the success of last year's ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' which was promoted extensively through the Internet,
every major studio started doing extensive Internet advertising.
Universal Pictures reportedly spent $1 million promoting
Schwarzenegger's ``End of Days'' sci-fi thriller on America Online
last year. Look for more cross-marketing deals as AOL completes its
purchase of Time Warner Inc., the parent of Warner Bros., New Line
Cinema and Turner Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Some studios are taking more creative approaches to their
newfound technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Pictures Entertainment, for example, recently struck a deal
with Liberty Digital Inc. aimed at creating the first 24-hour
interactive game show network which promises to let viewers of
shows like such as ``Wheel of Fortune `` and ``Jeopardy'' play
along using television set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't eat our own lunch, somebody else is going to,''
Sony Pictures Senior Vice President Patrick Kennedy explained at a
recent Internet entertainment conference in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In June, in a sign of what might come for film distribution,
20th Century Fox and Cisco Systems Inc. teamed up to send an
80-minute digitized cartoon, ``Titan AE,'' over the Internet from
California to a theater in Atlanta. The event marked the first time
a movie was distributed without putting film in a can and shipping
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the major corporations, they all recognize that this is
something they have to get into someway or another,'' said Leron
Gubler who as president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce spends
a good bit of his time gripping and grinning with entertainment's
elite. ``They know they can't be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   A center for creativity
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the growth in the Hollywood area's technology
industry has come from small companies that do everything from Web
site creation to Internet marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Web designer Ready Set Net Inc. is a typical Hollywood tech
company.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Darin Andersen started Ready Set Net six years ago in
his home in Hollywood Hills, not far from the famed Hollywood sign.
When the company grew big enough to warrant its own space, he moved
it to downtown Los Angeles, but came back to Hollywood as soon as
his lease in a pricey L.A. office building was up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have clients that would come to our offices and
they'd say 'Gee, this is really corporate, isn't it?''' said
Andersen, whose company lists MGM Studios and CBS Television as its
clients. ``It's not what they expected from a Web company.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ready Set Net is based in a 70-year-old building off
Hollywood Boulevard, a few blocks from Mann's Chinese Theater
Theatre and across from Musso &AMP; Frank Grill, one of the Los
Angeles' area's oldest restaurants, best-known for its chilled
martinis and for people-watching.
</P>
<P>
   The four-story building, the original home of the Screen Actors
Guild, has high ceilings, tile floors, transom windows and other
remnants of Hollywood's first golden age, the 1920s and 1930s. In a
different time, the basement was home to The Masque, a rock club
where Blondie, the Go Gos and other 1980s bands played their early
gigs.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the building is in the center of a breeding
ground for creativity. And in the Web design business, creativity
is key.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our employees come from the (film) production
industry _ we're really tapping into that,'' Andersen said. ``If
you think about it, a Web site is constructed in a very similar
fashion to a movie. It's basically a one-time, major production,
with a lot of the same types of elements,'' like scripts and
special effects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking how many technology companies have sprung up in the
Hollywood area is tough, since the industry is so new and growing
so fast.
</P>
<P>
   But by most accounts, technology discovered Tinseltown _ and
vice-versa _ about three years ago, and the love affair has been
growing ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, we might have had 150 companies in this
area'' in the technology and electronic entertainment business,
said Mark Richter, economic development manager for Santa Monica,
west of Hollywood. ``Now we have probably well over 1,000 in Santa
Monica alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica's ``e-entertainment'' businesses, as Richter calls
them, range from film marketing company Reelplay.com Inc. to
Iam.com Inc., an online talent agency for actors, models and
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   While some companies have come to the region for talent, others
have come simply because it's Hollywood, and Hollywood is where you
need to be if you're in the entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile from Ready Set Net's offices is the headquarters
for the hottest Internet film company in business today, Ifilm
Corp. On Ifilm's Web site is ``405,'' a short movie about an
airplane that lands on an SUV on busy Interstate 405 in Los
Angeles. The film, with highly detailed special effects done
entirely with computers, has become the Internet's first big hit,
luring audiences in offices, campus dorm rooms and wherever else a
fast Web connection is available.
</P>
<P>
   Ifilm chairman and chief executiveKevin Wendle helped to start
the popular technology information Web site CNet.com and was one of
the first executives at Fox Broadcasting _ he created ``Beverly
Hills 90210'' _ before getting into the online film business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company (Ifilm) was started in Silicon Valley,'' he said.
``But ... when it comes to the film community, Hollywood and L.A.
are such company towns that you just need to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   A reason to hesitate
</P>
<P>
   With features such as ``405,'' visitors to Ifilm.com can
experience what many in Hollywood see as the Internet's Holy Grail:
downloadable films.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Web gets faster, however, nobody will make much money
from Internet films. Most of today's Web productions are
low-budget, independent films that aspiring directors can post on
sites such as Ifilm.com for free. Viewers can watch for free, too _
and many of the movies are so bad that few would pay to watch them
anyway. To help bring in revenue, Ifilm also runs a site that links
entertainment industry employers with prospective job candidates.
It also recently made the jump from the Web to television, striking
a deal with cable's Independent Film Channel to support each other
and produce a 26-episode series about independent film production.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of profits and the uncertainty over where the Internet
might take the film business are what kept Hollywood from jumping
on the technology bandwagon sooner. Hollywood, like Wall Street,
hates uncertainty (think about all those ``Beverly Hills Cop''
sequels.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The question has sort of been, OK, we need to get online, but
what do we do whenever we get there?'' said Malcolm Maclachlan,
media and e-commerce analyst with research company International
Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, yes, we're going to see on-demand movies and TV
shows delivered over the Internet,'' he said. ``But that could be
awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the metamorphosis has clearly begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood has been lagging behind technologically and in
exploiting and operating on the Web,'' said Andersen. ``But it's
really gotten the message now. And with the star power in this
town, you're going to see a lot more buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk into the restaurants and clubs around Andersen's offices
near Hollywood Boulevard and you can already hear it. Table talk is
not longer just about scripts and screens, it's also about
bandwidth and page views and cross-media marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they don't know exactly how just yet, it seems that
everybody who's anybody in Hollywood wants in on the tech trend.
And that's a far cry from where they were just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, there was practically no such thing as e-mail
in Hollywood,'' said Ifilm's Wendle. ``And up until two years ago,
many senior-level executives here were still having their
secretaries print their e-mails for them and respond for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still see that happening occasionally, but the sea change is
occurring.''

&HT;     NEW FACES ON COINS? HOW ABOUT KING, REAGAN AND TRUMAN? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNIFER A. DLOUHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress considers whether to order new designs
for U.S. coins, a poll of 1,940 collectors, released Monday, showed
that they favor adding Martin Luther King Jr., Ronald Reagan and
Harry Truman to the face of America's pocket change.
</P>
<P>
   A few of those polled would dispense altogether with the
presidents _ Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin Roosevelt,
George Washington and John F. Kennedy _ who are now depicted on
most U.S. coinage.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the civil rights leader and the two presidents who led
the list, the top 10 figures named by collectors in the survey
included, in order, astronaut and former Sen. John Glenn, Theodore
Roosevelt, the Rev. Billy Graham, astronaut Neil Armstrong, Albert
Einstein, John Wayne and Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Marsh, marketing director of the Littleton (N.H.) Coin
Company, which commissioned the poll, said one collector wrote that
the U.S. Mint ``should just lighten up and put a hot dog or a
turkey on a coin.'' Among other offbeat suggestions: former
Cincinnati mayor turned talk-show host Jerry Springer and the
animated cartoon character Elmer Fudd.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was No. 14 on the list, and former President
George Bush ranked No. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The poll results were released two days before the Senate
Banking Committee is scheduled to hold a symposium to discuss new
coin designs.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said the goal of
Wednesday meeting is to encourage designs ``worthy of a great
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the nation's last major effort to redesign coins,
Gramm said, ``We may not be able to match the golden era of coin
design under Theordore Roosevelt, but we should try.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bobbitt, spokesman for the American Numismatic
Association, said current coins' static portraits _ which
collectors sometimes call ``dead heads'' _ don't do justice to the
figures depicted.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbitt cited Lincoln, whose likeness has graced U.S. pennies
since 1909. ``Nothing against Abraham Lincoln, but I'm sure there
are some (other) portraits we could use. And the same with
Jefferson and Kennedy and Roosevelt.''
</P>
<P>
   New images on coins could pique the interest of collectors,
already eagerly gathering quarters released through the U.S. Mint's
50 State Quarters Program, Bobbitt added. Under the program,
quarters honoring the states are being released about every 10
weeks. The program started last year and will continue through
2008.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Mint Director Jay Johnson said that ``more than 110 million
people nationwide have started to collect the new quarters, and we
see that number rise each time a new (one) is released.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the enthusiasm is coming from people new to collecting.
``It certainly has helped the hobby overall,'' Marsh said. The
images on the new quarters are ``something people can relate to,''
he explained. ``They're unique designs specific to each state and
the fact that they're on quarters makes them inexpensive to
collect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobbitt said the recent rise in collecting has also been
stimulated by the new golden dollar coin featuring Sacagaewa, the
Indian woman who led explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark
on their 1804-1806 expedition to the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old Littleton coin dealership is one of the world's
largest, claiming to handle more than 200,000 orders a month. It
sponsored a similar poll five years ago.

SCIENTISTS DECLARE A PRIMATE GROUP EXTINCT  
 LOUD, RED-CHEEKED AND HARD TO MISS , WALDRON'S RED COLOBUS IS NOW
EXTINCT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Britain, Ghana, Ivory Coast)   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in several centuries, a member of the primate
order, the taxonomic group to which human beings belong, has become
extinct, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The vanished primate, Waldron's red colobus, was not nearly as
charismatic as, say, a chimpanzee or orangutan. Indeed, debate has
not yet ended on whether the loud-mouthed, red-cheeked monkey from
the rain forest canopy of Ghana and the Ivory Coast deserved full
status as a species in its own right or should remain a colobus
subspecies.
</P>
<P>
   But now that debate is moot, a team of primate experts reports
in a paper in the September issue of the peer-reviewed journal
Conservation Biology.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists say this is just the beginning of what they foresee
as a growing stream of extinctions of West African primates and
other wildlife. Fragmentation of forests by logging and road
building has created isolated islands of animals that are now being
systematically trapped and shot by hunters supplying the lucrative
trade in bush meat, which is flowing to urban restaurants and no
longer is just a staple of rural villagers.
</P>
<P>
   In the paper, the five authors, led by John F. Oates, an
anthropologist from Hunter College in Manhattan, conclude, ``The
extinction of Waldron's red colobus may be the first obvious
manifestation of an extinction spasm that will soon affect other
large animals in this region unless more rigorous protection is
applied immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   For biologists, proposing that something is extinct requires a
special level of confidence because no one wants to be the expert
who gets it wrong, and this time around, at least according to
several scientists familiar with the study, the authors' confidence
is justified.
</P>
<P>
   Ross D.E. MacPhee, an expert on extinction and the curator of
mammals at the American Museum of Natural History, said the
authors, by carefully monitoring the monkeys' habitat and history
over several decades, have created a rare, valuable picture of the
evolutionary endgame regardless of the monkey's status as species
or subspecies.
</P>
<P>
   Extinction is a process, not an event, he said, adding ``most
species do not wink out in an instant.'' With the disappearance of
Waldron's red colobus, scientists have had a front-row seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very legalistic sense, loss of this monkey may not amount
to a species-level extinction,'' MacPhee said, ``but it marks
something that may be even more important.''
</P>
<P>
   The last primate extinction documented by science occurred in
the early 1700s, MacPhee said, with the disappearance from Jamaica
of Xenothris mcgregori, a species similar to the capuchin monkeys
used by organ grinders. The next most recent extinctions occurred
in Madagascar in the 1500s, he said, with the loss of several giant
lemurs.
</P>
<P>
   Current lists of extremely endangered primates include lemurs
from Madagascar, tamarins from Brazil, langurs from Vietnam,
Sumatran orangutans, gorillas, and a variety of monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   The last sightings of Waldron's red colobus were in the 1970s,
and a concerted seven-year effort to visit every last scrap of the
swampy rain forests the monkey preferred ended late last month in
the Ivory Coast without even a hint of its presence, said W. Scott
McGraw, an anthropologist at Ohio State University who led the
latest trip and is a co-author of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``A healthy forest is loud, but this was like being in a
deserted cathedral,'' McGraw said. ``You don't hear anything, you
don't hear birds. You stumble over snares and shotgun shells.''
</P>
<P>
   McGraw said he offered large bounties to bush-meat hunters who
could lead him to red colobus _ $100 if he could hear the monkey's
distinctive call or $200 for a sighting _ with no results.
Satellite photographs were searched for any forgotten forest
tracts.
</P>
<P>
   Many ecologists have projected that dozens of obscure species of
plants and animals are becoming extinct each year as tropical
forests are invaded by farmers, loggers, and hunters. But these
vanishings are all theoretical.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the apparent end of Waldron's red colobus noteworthy,
scientists say, is that it was a conspicuous, large mammal _
weighing up to 20 pounds _ and also because it was related, albeit
distantly, to the scientists who studied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't really worry about cockroaches or newts too much,
but when you lose a large primate that's a culmination of lots of
years of evolution and with which we share a lot of genes, the
consequences to humans of that kind of loss _ both practical and
emotional _ are much greater,'' said John G. Robinson, a
primatologist and vice president of Wildlife Conservation
International, which supported recent searches for the monkey.
</P>
<P>
   Waldron's, Procolobus badius waldroni, is one of about a dozen
variations of red colobus monkey, a group with distinctive long
limbs and tails and a voracious appetite for the leaves of tropical
treetops.
</P>
<P>
   The monkey was first described by scientists in 1936, based on
eight specimens shot in 1933 in what is now Ghana by Willoughby P.
Lowe, a collector for British museums. It was named for one F.
Waldron, who was described in various references as a traveling
companion of Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s, deforestation and hunting were already threatening
the monkey, although it remained common in a few places in southern
Ghana, where packs could be seen roaming the forest canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the authors of the paper, Peter Grubb, a zoologist and
African mammal expert associated with the Natural History Museum in
London, said that, with better management of game preserves in
Ghana and the Ivory Coast, the monkey probably could have been
saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the forest reserves there were logged over and areas that
were to become national parks were whittled away until they were
tiny,'' Grubb said. He said it is probably worth waiting awhile
before Waldron's is formally relegated to history, ``but it doesn't

   AUSTRIA: SANCTIONS DECISION DUE
 &UR;  &LR; A decision on whether European Union partners will lift diplomatic
sanctions against Austria is expected soon, according to France's

   GERMANY: KOHL COMEBACK
 &UR;  &LR; After a 10-month absence, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl returned
to a regular strategy session of his Christian Democratic Party's
parliamentary group. Kohl, who retained his seat in Parliament
after being ousted as chancellor in 1998, skipped all meetings
after admitting last year that he had accepted illegal campaign

<P>
   The global campaign to ban land mines is urging governments to
take steps to pressure or isolate countries that have yet to sign
the 1997 treaty banning the devices. Campaigners have been urging
NATO members to refuse to take part in military actions involving
use of land mines, and so far France and the Netherlands have
indicated a willingness to do so. Delegates from 138 countries that
have signed the pact are meeting in Geneva.

   Small groups of students protesting the policies of the
International Monetary Fund were detained by the police in Istanbul

GORE SAYS HE'LL COME DOWN HARD ON HOLLYWOOD VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore, distancing himself from the entertainment
executives who have donated very generously to his campaign, Monday
threatened that as president, he would find ways to punish
Hollywood for marketing violent material to children if it ``does
not clean up its act'' in six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard enough to raise children today without the
entertainment industry making it more difficult,'' the vice
president said as he campaigned in Belleville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was reacting to a blistering Federal Trade Commission
report on the entertainment industry's deliberate advertising of
R-rated material to young teens, was mocked by the Bush campaign as
``reaching new levels of hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, Al Gore is telling Hollywood to clean up its act
after aggressively cleaning out their wallets for the past year,''
said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Texas Governor George W. Bush.
``Al Gore waving around a report that he denounced at a Hollywood
fund-raiser just a year ago makes him a deserving candidate for an
Oscar award in hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not make an issue of the new FTC report as he
campaigned in Florida Monday. A spokeswoman said he supported the
agency's inquiry, which was ordered more than a year ago by
President Clinton in the wake of a White House summit on media
violence and the school shootings in Littleton, Colo., and Conyers,
Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers said it was smart for Gore, who is working
hard to woo women voters and determined to remove any taint of the
Clinton administration scandals, to seize the opportunity to
champion a family-values issue. Gore's running mate, Joseph
Lieberman, has been a stern Senate critic of the entertainment
industry, and Gore's wife, Tipper, led a fight in the mid-1980s to
get record companies to agree to put parental warnings on albums
and later CDs with dirty lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore and Joe Lieberman are playing the moral card, and it
makes sense strategically because the Gore ticket is most
vulnerable on moral issues,'' said Robert Knight, senior director
cultural studies at the conservative Family Research Council.
``Given the Democrats' ties to Hollywood, one would think this
would be perilous ground for them to occupy. But Gore has made an
end run, largely because the Republican ticket has not been
aggressive in addressing issues like entertainment violence.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some disagreement about how aggressive Vice President
Gore was on the media violence issue before it started popping up
in opinion polls as a concern, particularly of women.
Representative Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who pushed
Congress to enact legislation requiring program-blocking V-chips in
televisions, says President Clinton ``subcontracted''
telecommunications issues to Gore, and he remained prominent
political player.
</P>
<P>
   ``On every issue that dealt with children's television, with
media violence, with the ratings systems, it all came out of the
vice president's office,'' Markey said. ``Joe Lieberman helps Al
Gore get the credit on these media issues that he should have
gotten all along.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Los Angeles Times reported last year that shortly after
the president called for the FTC probe, Gore attended a Hollywood
fund raiser and privately disclosed that it had not been his idea,
nor had Clinton sought his input before initiating it. During the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in August, neither
Gore nor Lieberman attacked gratuitous sex and violence in the
media, though Lieberman has for a number of years bestowed the
``Silver Sewer'' award on Hollywood's worst ``cultural polluters.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Wyatt, president of the Parents Music Resource Center,
which Mrs. Gore founded in 1984, said she was asked by the Gores to
close the organization in 1988, when then-Senator Gore first ran
for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gores absolutely backed away and said, `Our mission is
completed,' '' Wyatt said. ``I want to give him his due, but
Clinton and Gore could have done much more over the last eight
years to use the bully pulpit on this issue, and they have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believed it was because the Clintons, in particular, had
become too comfortable with Hollywood entertainment executives and
entertainers. Since 1990 the television, film, and music
industries, including their corporate leaders, have contributed
$83.9 million to political races. Democrats received 65 percent of
the money, while Republicans got 35 percent, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign-finance watchdog group.
So far in this election cycle, Gore has received $929,000 and Bush
has received $728,000, the center reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he is biting the hand that feeds him, but to
some extent Gore is distancing himself from Hollywood the way Bush
and Cheney need to distance themselves from the oil industry,''
said Larry Makinson, who directs the center. ``I think Gore
perceives that in the mind of the general public, there is too
close a connection between Democrats and Hollywood, and he needs to
break that connection.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of an entertainment-industry trade group, who did not
want to be identified, went further, suggesting that Gore and
Lieberman have adopted the political strategy that ``there is hay
to be made in villifying our industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``By speaking out against this big constituency, by standing up
to the people who fund their campaign, Gore and Lieberman are
blunting the effort to be painted as captives of Hollywood and
special interests and affirming, `We have integrity.' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Lieberman will get another opportunity to do that
when he testifies at a hearing on media violence before the Senate
Commerce Committee, which is chaired by Senator John McCain. Lynne
Cheney, wife of Bush running mate Dick Cheney, will also testify, a
committee spokeswoman confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   David Walsh, president of the National Institute on Media and
the Family, a nonprofit group in Minneapolis, said he is happy to
see the bipartisan concern over the issue, even if the flurry of
activity has strong political-season overtones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women and mothers really relate to this issue, they `get it'
better than men,'' Walsh said. ``Partly it's because they are more
attuned to the things that are influencing their kids. Partly it's
because men tend to have a greater appetite themselves for
action-oriented media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most everyone, though, wants a more civil, decent, and
respectful society,'' Walsh said. ``And both men and women perceive
that the media contributes to the culture of disrespect.''

APPEALS JUDGE BACKS WIRETAP USE IN MOBSERS' PROSECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a stunning reversal that restores key evidence in
the government's racketeering case against gangsters James
``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen Flemmi, a federal appeals court ruled
Monday that information the pair provided while working as FBI
informants may be used against them at trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a 31-page decision, the US Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit ruled that US District Judge Mark L. Wolf ``erred'' last
year when he tossed out evidence gathered from the FBI bugging of
four Mafia hangouts during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf had concluded that FBI agents promised Bulger and Flemmi
that information gleaned from the bugs wouldn't be used against
them because the gangsters had helped them get the court order they
needed to install the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court overturned Wolf, ruling that even if
agents had promised Bulger and Flemmi immunity for some of their
crimes, the agents didn't have the authority to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, the alleged promise of use immunity, even if made, was
unauthorized (and therefore, unenforceable), and the district court
erred in suppressing the evidence in question,'' wrote Appeals
Court Judge Bruce Selya.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is a major blow to Flemmi, 66, who revealed that he
was an FBI informant two years after the January 1995 federal
racketeering indictment charging him, Bulger and members of the
Mafia with racketeering. He argued that the charges should be
dismissed because he was promised immunity from prosecution in
exchange for information he provided the FBI on his Mafia rivals.
Bulger, 71, another longtime FBI informant, remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi claimed that he and Bulger had been promised immunity for
any crime short of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Kenneth Fishman, who represents Flemmi, said he's
reviewing the decision and has yet to decide whether to appeal the
decision to the US Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of evidence came out that supports his ultimate
defense, that he was given a green light to commit a number of the
offenses he's been charged with in order to gather information for
the FBI,'' Fishman said.
</P>
<P>
   US Attorney Donald K. Stern said the appeals court ``firmly
rejected Flemmi's bogus claim of immunity'' and made it clear FBI
agents don't have the power to confer immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any other result would turn the criminal justice system on its
head, leaving to individual agents the power to protect informants
even where the informants commit serious crimes and have a corrupt
relationship with their handlers,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling will allow prosecutors to introduce important
evidence and push the case toward resolution, Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   During 10 months of hearings throughout 1998 which exposed the
cozy relationship among Bulger, Flemmi and their FBI handlers, it
was revealed that one former FBI supervisor had pocketed $7,000 in
payoffs from the pair.
</P>
<P>
   A number of agents were accused of tipping off Bulger and Flemmi
to investigations and the identity of other informants.
</P>
<P>
   In a 661-page ruling last September, Wolf rejected Flemmi's
claim that he had been promised immunity from prosecution, but he
found that agents had assured Flemmi and Bulger that information
gleaned from four bugging operations wouldn't be used against them
because Bulger and Flemmi had helped gather evidence that was used
to win court authorization for the buggings.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Wolf barred prosecutors from presenting evidence at
Flemmi's trial from the 1981 bugging of the North End headquarters
of Patriarca family underboss Gennaro ``Jerry'' Angiulo; the
1986-1987 bugging of Vanessa's Italian Food Shop in the Prudential
Center by the FBI and State Police; and the infamous Oct. 29, 1989
Mafia induction ceremony at a Medford home, where four aspiring
mobsters pricked their trigger fingers and burned Holy cards in a
pledge of loyalty to the New England mob.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf concluded that Flemmi and Bulger were promised immunity by
former FBI Agent John Connolly Jr. and former FBI supervisor John
Morris. Connolly was indicted last December on racketeering charges
for allegedly protecting Bulger and Flemmi. Morris, who has been
granted immunity from prosecutors, has admitted taking $7,000 in
payoffs from the pair.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court concluded that under federal law, only
prosecutors have the authority to grant immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the rule were otherwise, a minor government functionary
hidden in the recesses of an obscure department would have the
power to prevent the prosecution of a most heinous criminal simply
by promised immunity in return for the performance of some act
which might benefit his department,'' Selya wrote. ``Such a result
could not be countenanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Monday's ruling, there is still no trial date in sight
for Flemmi. Federal prosecutors are currently appealing another
ruling by Wolf that bars them from using key testimony linking
Flemmi to the 1967 slayings of Richard Grasso and three Boston
brothers, William, Walter and Edward Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf ruled in July that prosecutors abused the grand jury
process when they added the four murder charges to an existing
indictment against Flemmi. Arguments on that issue have yet to be
heard by the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Flemmi is awaiting trial in two other cases: a 1997
federal indictment on money laundering charges, and a racketeering
indictment returned last year charging him along with Bulger and
Connolly.

  Scenic sightseeing train marks 10th year in Arizona 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Sidebar to `Jerome' story.

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLARKDALE, Ariz. _ Arizona has some of the most breathtaking
scenery in the Southwest, but in this defiantly rugged state, only
a fraction of it is interlaced with roads or hiking trails.
</P>
<P>
   This fact may have run through the mind of railroad owner Dave
Durbano a dozen years ago after he acquired an obscure freight line
in the central part of the state. On his first ride from Clarkdale
to Drake, his chin kept hitting his chest in wonderment.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a sightseeing train was hatched, and soon tourists
were riding the Verde Canyon Railroad, marveling at narrow canyons,
bald eagles, cliffside Indian ruins and broad river valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The excursion, which celebrates its 10th anniversary in
November, follows a rail line that stretches from Clarkdale to the
former water stop of Perkinsville. Then the engine uses a siding to
reposition itself at the opposite end of the train and returns
along the same route.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century ago, the rail line was used to
transport copper from the mines at Jerome, about six miles from
Clarkdale, north to the Santa Fe's main line at Ash Fork. But the
route was cut through a spectacular natural region, now part of the
Prescott National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The area is otherwise accessible only to hikers with extremely
sturdy boots and a great deal of persistence.
</P>
<P>
   The train affords considerably more comfort _ and obvious
nostalgia. The restored Pullman cars date to the 1940s, the diesel
locomotives to the 1950s. Small wonder the mean age of passengers
on our midweek ride in May seemed to be about 77.
</P>
<P>
   To maximize viewing, the train has several open-air cars. A
guide also offers a running commentary along the four-hour
afternoon trip.
</P>
<P>
   The guide for our trip was Clay Miller, who moved to this region
from the Hollywood Hills 13 years ago to conduct archeological
tourism expeditions out of nearby Sedona. Miller's narrative,
delivered over the train's sound system, was a delightful mix of
history, geology, songs, poems of his own composition, and American
Indian stories and legends.
</P>
<P>
   The train poked along at freight speed, bouncing and rocking and
protesting the exertion.
</P>
<P>
   It passed by an appalling expanse of slag left over from the
mine's smelting operation _ picture 40 acres of charred gunk
reaching to a depth of 40 feet. It traversed S.O.B. Canyon (so
named by the railroad workers who had to build a towering trestle
over it in 1911). It treated us to the mesmerizing red and pink
rocks of Sycamore Canyon, then passed through a 600-foot curved
tunnel _ the train passes within six inches of the walls in spots _
before coming to a halt in the ranchland of Perkinsville.
</P>
<P>
   When the mine was operating and steam engines needed water, this
settlement was a fairly lively place, with about a dozen families,
a school, a store, a post office. Now? ``When everybody's home,''
said the attendant in our car, ``the population's three.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point along the way, Miller indicated a bald eagle,
perched on a red-canyon cliff wall and staring blandly at us from
about 100 yards away. Also, along the canyon bottom, several great
blue herons were spotted.
</P>
<P>
   The features of the ride change with the seasons. This time of
year, the cottonwood and sycamore trees begin to provide some fall
color. Winter is a prime time to see bald eagles. Springtime brings
the yellow and peach-colored blooms of cactus flowers, as well as
such wildflowers as desert marigolds and blackfoot daisies. Because
of the heat, summer is probably the least desirable, although you
might get to see the desert in the midst of a dramatic
thunderstorm. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
IF YOU GO &QL; 
The excursion is offered year-round. In the fall and spring, it
operates daily except at 1 p.m. Tuesday (two rides on Saturdays).
In the summer and winter, visitors are asked to call in advance for
the schedule. Reservations at all times of the year are strongly
recommended: (800) 293-7245 or (520) 639-0010. Web:
www.verdecanyonrr.com. Coach fare is $35.95 adults, $32.95 seniors
(over 65), $20.95 children under 12. First-class fare is $54.95.
Drinks and snacks are offered for sale on the train, and there is a
picnic ground, cafe and gift shop at the depot. &QL;

GENZYME TO PAY $1 BILLION FOR GELTEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the largest biotechnology deals this year, Genzyme
Corp. said Monday it has agreed to buy GelTex Pharmaceuticals Inc.
for $1.016 billion in stock and cash.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to catapult Renagel, a GelTex product used
by kidney dialysis patients to bind and remove high phosphate
levels, into Genzyme's biggest moneymaker.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme and GelTex officials projected Renagel revenues would be
rising from $19.5 million last year to $45 million this year to
$500 million in five years and $1 billion by the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme's biggest drug is Cerezyme. That drug and its
predecessor, Ceredase, has been available for nearly nine years to
treat 2,700 patients with the rare disorder known as Gaucher's
disease. Cerezyme had sales of $479 million last year, 84 percent
of the company's total revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genzyme has been successful in developing a pipeline of drugs
to treat extremely rare diseases and this product (Renagel) brings
us a to a different level, where the patient population undergoing
kidney dialysis is 1 million people worldwide today, growing to 1.7
million in the next decade,'' said Henri Termeer, chairman and
chief executive of Genzyme, which has its headquarters in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, shareholders of GelTex will receive 0.7272
shares of Genzyme General unit stock, or $47.50 in cash, for each
GelTex share with the cash portion of the deal fixed at $500
million. The offer is a 27 percent premium to GelTex's Friday
closing price of $37.38.
</P>
<P>
   GelTex is based in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street analysts reacted positively to the deal, citing
the long-term prospets for GelTex shareholders under Genzyme.
</P>
<P>
   ``GelTex shareholders are getting a good deal,'' said Felicia L.
Reed, vice president of equity research at Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill
in Boston. ``GelTex does not have the commercial capacity that
Genzyme has and Genzyme will be able to take advantage of new
information about kidney dialysis plus expand its drug pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   In heavy trading on the Nasdaq exchange, GelTex shares Monday
rose $5.88 to $43.25 while Genzyme General stock slipped $7.63 to
$57.69.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of industry consolidation where most biotech companies
are scrambling to find new drugs that can provide immediate
revenues and profits, Genzyme did not have to look very far.
</P>
<P>
   More than three years ago, GelTex and Genzyme signed an
agreement to jointly market Renagel and share equally in the
profits. GelTex developed the drug, which costs about $1,200 a year
per patient, while Genzyme brought its marketing clout to the
agreement. Renagel gained US Food and Drug Administration approval
in November 1998 and has been approved for Medicare reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   But after a New England Journal of Medicine study in May,
Genzyme and GelTex saw an opportunity to transform Renagel into a
blockbuster drug. The study revealed how young patients on kidney
dialysis who were taking calcium-based drugs to lower their
phosphate levels suffered unusually high levels of calcium.
</P>
<P>
   The article said these patients had major signs of coronary
artery calcification that could lead to death and urged
nephrologists _ kidney specialists _ to rethink their use of
calcium-based drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike existing drugs, known as phosphate binders, Renagel does
not contain calcium. That enables kidney dialysis patients to
achieve better control of their levels of phosphorus and calcium in
the blood.
</P>
<P>
   The GelTex drug, which costs three to six times more than
calcium-based medications, works by absorbing water in the
digestive tract forming hydrogels that bind and remove phosphorus.
By contrast, healthy patients have kidneys that remove excess
phosphate into the urine.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both companies said the New England Journal study
along with some other reports indicated to them that Renagel had a
bigger future than originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Journal article made us think we really have something
important here, and it started to give us a lot of momentum,'' said
Mark Skaletsky, the GelTex chief executive, who noted prescriptions
had started to rise significantly earlier this year. ``And for us
to continue with a small sales force or work with Genzyme led us to
rethink what was best for our shareholders and employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, there will be no layoffs among the 110
GelTex employees who will continue to work in Waltham, although the
GelTex name will disappear, said Termeer. Skaletsky will stay with
Genzyme during a transition phase, but indicated he would leave at
some point to create or join a biotech startup.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a company begins is the period I find most exciting,''
Skaletsky said.

 &HT;    Bush campaigns Florida where polls say Gore has taken lead
 &HT;    By Ken Herman and Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ In a day as politically symbolic as they get,
GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush on Monday campaigned in a
battleground state that wasn't supposed to be much of a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't blame it on my brother,'' Bush joked, Florida Gov. Jeb
Bush at his side, as he arrived here. ``We're in good shape here in
Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, back when Bush looked like he was on the easy street
to Pennsylvania Avenue, Florida's 25 electoral votes were included
as a solid part of the 270 he needed for victory. But, like the
rest of the nation, Florida is now a toss-up as Vice President Al
Gore enjoys the biggest surge of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, whose chances of winning electoral vote-rich
California and New York are slipping, Florida has become a must-win
battle. No Republican since Calvin Coolidge in 1924 has taken the
White House without winning Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a battleground state, but we feel we can win it and will
win it,'' Bush aide Karen Hughes said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign is not taking Florida as a given.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeb lost one time and then won next time,'' Hughes said.
``Recent elections have been very much swing elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's uptick here has been issue-driven as the Democratic
nominee has been scoring points by hammering on Social Security,
prescription drugs and health insurance. Meanwhile, Bush's $1.3
trillion tax cut is not playing well among the state's elderly
voters who are often misperceived as all wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple answer is the issues are all going Democratic right
now,'' said Jim Kane, editor of the nonpartisan Florida Voter poll.
``You've got Medicare, prescription drugs, Social Security. A third
of our electorate, among likely voters, is over 60 years of age.
Those issues, I think, are benefitting Al Gore in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush countered Monday by talking about those issues in a speech
and question-and-answer session with a friendly crowd at the On Top
of the World retirement community on Florida's west coast. He
sought to inoculate himself against Democratic attacks on his
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeb got a pretty good lesson of old-style politics in 1994,''
he said, referring to his brother's narrow loss to Democrat Lawton
Chiles. ``I don't know if you remember the scare tactics that go on
in states like this. The easiest thing to do is not have a platform
and try to scare somebody. They'll be saying, `If George W. becomes
president he is going to take away your Social Security benefits.'
Don't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush engaged in a little scare talk of his own, branding Gore's
health-care plan as a ``government HMO.'' That's the message he'll
have to keep sounding to win over key elderly voters, said state
GOP Chairman Al Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore promised health care and prescription drug coverage in
'92,'' Cardenas said. ``He promised them in '96 and now he's
promising them in the year 2000. It's a credibility issue.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the town-hall meeting marked the start of a busy week
in which he also will take his new ``Real Plans for Real People''
theme to Missouri, Washington, California and New Mexico. It's a
key week in key states as the candidates move toward the Summer
Olympics that begin Friday and will compete for attention through
the Oct. 2 closing ceremonies. Both sides say the Olympics will
impact the race, but they are unsure how or how much.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's day-and-a-half in Florida included a Monday night event
in Palm Beach that raised more than $500,000 for Florida
Republicans, and a campaign stop today in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   By all measures, Florida's importance has been torqued up by
recent polls showing Gore leading, for the first time, in states
with more electoral votes than the states in which Bush leads.
</P>
<P>
   As a suddenly swing state, Florida reflects the way the race has
shifted in recent weeks. For months, Bush campaign officials were
buoyed by a belief that the battle was being fought on Gore's turf.
</P>
<P>
   At campaign headquarters in Austin, the Bush team has believed
he could win California, a recent Democratic stronghold; a healthy
chunk of the Midwest, which (save for Indiana) went Democratic in
1992 and 1996; and even Tennessee, Gore's home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neat thing is we are fighting on his territory rather than
him fighting for ours,'' Karl Rove, Bush's top strategist, said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Bush battled for part of his family's political
empire. His father carried Florida by a wide margin in 1988 and a
two-point edge in 1992. In 1998, after the narrow 1994 loss to
Chiles, Jeb Bush won the gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, President Bill Clinton easily defeated GOP challenger
Bob Dole here.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Democratic National Committee officials were
conceding Florida to Bush, citing the family ties and noting that
the state trailed only Texas in the number of Democratic
officeholders jumping to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore never conceded Florida. He chose Tallahassee for his
victory party in March on the night he knocked Democratic foe Bill
Bradley from the chase for the nomination. Last month, Gore picked
Florida as the delegation to put him over the top for the
nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta pollster Whit Ayers, a Republican not working in the
presidential race, said Florida will remain Bush country because
``Jeb Bush is wildly popular and a very effective politician who is
more than a little committed to a George W. victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayers believes Bush is helped by the fact that GOP governors
back him in swing states like Florida, Michigan, Illinois,
Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, the only real political organization worthy
of the name in most states is owned by incumbent governors,'' said
Ayers. ``They can't make a candidate who's not competitive
competitive. But they can make a difference of a point, maybe a
point in a half. So that if a presidential candidate is competitive
in those states, governors might make just enough difference to
pull out a close one.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jeb Bush, though still highly popular in Florida, has hit
some bumps. His school voucher plan, passed last year, is in a
legal limbo after a challenge from the state's National Education
Association affiliate. ``One Florida,'' his plan to end racial
preferences in state college admissions, raised eyebrows even among
some supporters, said Richard Scher, professor of political science
at the University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``While in general that was popular, the way he handled it was
very heavy handed and a lot of people resented that,'' Scher said.
``He has a reputation of ready, shoot, aim.''

ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY REPORT ON TARGETING CHILDREN WITH VIOLENT
GAMES, MOVIES, MUSIC DRAWS POLITICAL SNIPING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL HEDGES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A government report that found the entertainment
industry targeted children with violent games, movies and music
created political sniping Monday while fueling a debate over
whether sounds and images provoke violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission released a 104-page report that
detailed the extent to which makers of popular entertainment evaded
restrictions on violent content to pitch their products to children
as young as 12.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found the entertainment companies ``routinely target
children under 17 in their marketing of products their own ratings
systems deem inappropriate ... due to violent content,'' said FTC
Chairman Robert Pitofsky.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, game and music industries' marketing and advertising
campaigns, ``showed strategies to promote and advertise their
products in the media outlets most likely to reach children under
17,'' the report found.
</P>
<P>
   A vast majority of R-rated movies and virtually all of the
popular music with violent content pushed their products with
``pervasive and aggressive'' advertisements, Pitofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC study uncovered promotional material from the publicity
departments of entertainment firms that showed the companies sought
the ``elusive teen target audience'' with R-rated movies.
Similarly, video game companies devised ad campaigns for `mature'
rated products that said the key audience would be ``males,
12-17.''
</P>
<P>
   Games, movies and music that were restricted because of violent
content were hawked on children's web sites and promoted in ``teen
hangouts such as game rooms, pizza parlors and sports apparel
stores,'' the report found.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC called for stricter compliance by the industry with
voluntary restrictions on violent material. Movie theaters should
check identification or require parental approval before selling
tickets to R rated movies. Retail stores should also check before
selling compact discs labeled ``explicit'' or games rated R or M to
those younger than 17, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   And the industry should impose ``meaningful sanctions'' on
companies attempting to market violent products to children, said
the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were endorsed by President Clinton, who ordered the
study in June 1999 in response to the Columbine high school
killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say these rating systems mean something. They can't turn
around and advertise to people that shouldn't see this stuff,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore pounced on the issue
Monday, saying he would set a six month deadline on the industry to
change its marketing approach. If that didn't happen, he would
propose tougher regulatory powers for the FTC to control the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard enough to raise children today without the
entertainment industry making it more difficult,'' Gore said in a
statement released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican rival George W. Bush blasted Gore for hypocrisy on
the issue, pointing out that Gore had lobbied Hollywood hard for
cash over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Clearwater, Fla., on Monday, Bush said Gore was
``short on credibility on the issue'' because he and the Democratic
Party continued to accept millions of dollars in contributions from
entertainment figures.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will ``work with the CEOs of Hollywood, those who
produce the products that pollute our children's minds.'' But he
stopped short of vowing a governmental crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Bush campaign quoted news accounts which
that charged that Gore had met with entertainment executives last
year to assure them of his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to help families counter Hollywood's influence on
our children is to elect Gov. Bush, who will restore integrity to
the White House and usher in a new era of responsibility,'' said
Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Responsive Politics in Washington said Monday
that Gore, the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic
organizations had taken $13.6 million from the music, movie and
video game industries during this election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore was slated to appear at a series of fund-raisers this
week headlined by entertainers and hosted by Hollywood movie, music
and publishing executives at which he is expected to raise another
$8 million for his campaign and the DNC, according to the CRP.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and the Republican National Committee had taken nearly $2.5
million from entertainment industry companies, the CRP said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., will hold hearings on ``marketing
violence to children'' on Wednesday. Among the witnesses will be
the heads of movie, video games and recording companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, who is scheduled to testify at that hearing, declined to
comment on the FTC report Monday. In the past, Valenti has defended
the industry against charges that violent entertainment bred
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative groups are hoping that the FTC report will
spur major changes in the way movies, video games and recordings
come to the attention of pre-teens and teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco industry was forced to discontinue its use of `Joe
Camel' because it obviously targeted kids,'' said Robert Knight of
the Family Research Council. ``Well, Hollywood has a `Joe Camel'
problem of its own _ aggressive marketing of adult material to
underage children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts said there is no valid evidence that watching
or listening to violent material leads to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be seen as a diversion from the U.S. facing the
real causes of violence in this country,'' said Mike Males, a
researcher from the University of California at Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Males said in other cultures like Japan, Western Europe and
Canada, young people are exposed to even more violent imagery than
American youth are, without resulting in high rates of violence. He
said economic circumstances, not violent entertainment, was the
root cause of most violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are large population pockets in this country where the
kids are exposed to more movies, violent music and games than
anywhere else which haven't had a youthful murder in decades,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Santa Cruz area, an upscale part of California with about
250,000 people, there had been only three violent crimes among
teen-agers in the past 10 years, Males said. He compared that to
much higher rates of violence elsewhere in California with lower
household incomes. He added that the trend crosses racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report did not name specific movie, record or video game
companies whose products it said were improperly advertised to
young people.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said the problem was found almost universally.
</P>
<P>
   Of 44 movies rated R for violence studied by the FTC, 35 were
targeted for children younger than 17, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   The commission looked at 55 music recordings with labels warning
of explicit content, and found that all of them were marketed at
youths younger than 17. And 70 percent of the 118 video games with
a `mature' rating for violence were aimed at an underaged audience,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also staked out movie theaters, finding that just under
half admitted children as young as 13 to R-rated movies without an
accompanying adult. ``The surveys also revealed that unaccompanied
children ages 13 to 16 were able to buy both explicit recordings
and mature-rated electronic games 85 percent of the time,'' the FTC
said.

FTC SAYS ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY MARKETS VIOLENCE TO CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Restructures lead, adds comments from industry and commission
officials; no pickup. Now coded for Page One.) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Deploring what it called the ``pervasive and
aggressive marketing'' of violent entertainment to children, the
Federal Trade Commission said Monday that the vast majority of the
best-selling restricted movies, music and video games were
deliberately marketed for children as young as 12.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, reporting on a year-long study released an
internal memorandum apparently from a movie studio about an R-rated
film saying that its promotional ``goal was to find the elusive
teen target audience and make sure everyone between the ages of
12-18 was exposed to the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Another memorandum described how, in Kansas City, fliers and
posters about an R-rated movie would be distributed to
organizations like the Campfire Boys and Girls.
</P>
<P>
   A memorandum about an M-rated video game characterized the
``primary'' audience as ``males 12-17.''
</P>
<P>
   The ratings established by trade associations are voluntary and
do not carry the force of law. R-rated films are supposed to
require an adult to accompany children under 17. M-rated video
games are not to be sold to children under 17.
</P>
<P>
   In another case described by the commission, an advertising
summary for a recording with a label identifying violent content
identified the ``target audience'' as listeners 12 to 34.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the commission was not allowed to identify the companies
that were the source of the memorandums describing marketing aimed
at children. Mary Engle, a lawyer at the agency, said the documents
had been submitted to the commission under procedures that prohibit
disclosure of trade secrets or other confidential financial or
commercial information.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission examined a sampling of movies, recordings and
electronic games selected because they were best-selling products
or those most likely to appeal to young people and found that, in
the vast majority of the cases, advertising had been aimed at
underage children.
</P>
<P>
   All 55 music recordings with explicit content labels were
marketed to children under 17. So were 35 of the 44 movies rated R,
or 80 percent, and 83 of the 118 video games, or 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The commission found that violent movies, recordings and
electronic games were heavily advertised in outlets likely to reach
children under 17 _ television programs like ``South Park'' and
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and magazines like Teen, Jump and YM.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment industry officials have repeatedly denied that
their companies make a policy of directing advertisements toward
children. They say it is impossible in today's world of
communications to keep promotions of products for young adults away
from the eyes and ears of children.
</P>
<P>
   For the last several days, Democratic politicians have used the
commission's report to burnish their credentials as crusaders
against violence in popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of the commission's findings was reported in an article
on Sunday based on interviews with officials familiar with the
report. In an interview with The New York Times on Sunday, Vice
President Al Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, took note of the study and said that, if elected, they
would offer legislation or new regulations cracking down on the
entertainment industry if the industry did not take steps to comply
with the FTC recommendations within six months.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, President Clinton, making a rare appearance with Hillary
Rodham Clinton to support her candidacy for the Senate in New York
at the Jewish Community Center in New Rochelle, N.Y., condemned the
abuses cited in the report. The Clintons suggested they would
support some kind of government restraints if the industry did not
itself curb advertising aimed at an underage audience.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate,
agreed Monday that the entertainment industry needed to rein in its
marketing practices. But he questioned Gore's credibility, saying
the vice president had not previously taken a strong stand against
violence in entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual political twist, the Senate commerce committee,
under the chairmanship of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., will hold a
hearing on Wednesday about the commission's findings and provide a
forum for Lieberman, who is scheduled as a witness. Also testifying
will be several other politicians, entertainment industry
executives and representatives of advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered the Federal Trade Commission study last year
shortly after the massacre by two teen-agers at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, the commission chairman, said at a news
conference Monday that no particular companies were worse offenders
than others.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky also was careful not to blame violent entertainment for
the violence in society. ``We reviewed the literature and found
that scholars and observers generally agree that exposure to
violent materials alone does not cause a child to commit a violent
act,'' he said. ``Exposure to violent materials probably is not
even the most important factor. It is nevertheless a valid cause
for concern. Exposure does seem to correlate with aggressive
attitudes, insensitivity to violence and an exaggerated view of how
much violence occurs in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Pitofsky said, the entertainment industry would
strengthen its self-regulation. If that does not work, he said, he
would consider new legislation or enforcement under existing law.
But he quickly added, ``That's down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said he was concerned about breaching the First
Amendment guarantee of free speech. ``I don't want the Federal
Trade Commission to be the thought police,'' he said. ``I don't
want a bureaucrat like me influencing the content of these
materials, but rather, we need to influence the way these materials
are marketed.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that trade associations publish the names of their
members who direct marketing of restricted products to underage
audiences. ``a little sunlight might be a very effective sanction
in this area,'' he said.

 &HT;    Census hype no habla Espanol, panel told
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Spanish speakers in Georgia _ the most undercounted
group in Georgia 10 years ago _ may have been ignored this year by
census advertising, advocates said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very upset and disappointed,'' Jacqueline
Thomas-Rosier of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education
Fund said. She appeared before the U.S. Census Monitoring Board,
which met in Atlanta Monday. ``There are more than eight (Hispanic)
radio stations in Georgia,'' she said after the meeting. ``When
census did media buys, they skipped us and went to Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Georgia has seen an enormous increase in its
Spanish-speaking population. In 1990, 7.4 percent of Hispanics in
Georgia were not counted.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Georgia lost out on $180 million in federal money
because 2.3 percent of its population was not counted. If that
percentage does not improve this year, Georgia will lose about $272
million in federal funds for transportation, education and social
service programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we will have less of an undercount than we did
last time,'' said Atlanta lawyer Joe Whitley, one of four
Republicans on the eight-member monitoring board.
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring board was created two years ago, with the
Republican-controlled U.S. House and U.S. Senate appointing four
members and the president naming four. The board produced several
reports detailing problems with the 2000 census and another is
expected early next month.
</P>
<P>
   One approach taken this year to get a more accurate count was to
fund a $167 million advertising campaign that included multilingual
ads, directed mainly at minorities who were less likely to fill out
the form.
</P>
<P>
   But in Georgia, Thomas-Rosier said, almost every ad in a
language other than English was an unpaid public service
announcement, airing during the wee hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jost with the census communications office in Suitland,
Md., said the agency spent money where market research showed it
would get ``the biggest punch.'' The response rate was the highest
it has been in four decades. A larger percentage of households in
the Atlanta area _ 59 percent _ returned their census forms via
mail, answered questions on the Internet or competed questionnaires
at a census ``be counted'' center than the number 10 years ago _ 55
percent. But it was short of the goal of a 60 percent return rate
for 2000.

 &HT;    Total Movie makes slick premiere
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you thought there was no room left on newsstands,
another magazine makes its debut. This month's newcomer is Total
Movie ($7.99), a slick 112-page bimonthly publication aimed at film
buffs. The cover with a scantily clad, serpent-wrapped Elizabeth
Hurley is certainly eye-catching, and the content is a cut above
the usual stuff. Articles include previews of new films; Hollywood
gossip; a look at ``Unbreakable,'' Bruce Willis' follow-up to ``The
Sixth Sense''; and a mini-magazine of DVD reviews and a DVD with
previews and extra features. ``We're a little more discerning than
your average movie mag,'' says Editor-in-Chief Gary Whitta. ``You
won't find coverage of every single new release in every genre but
you will find better, hipper and more in-depth coverage of the
movies you love.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Literary South: The new Oxford American ($5.95) doesn't
include a bonus CD like the previous Southern music issue, but it
does offer a treasury of fine writing. The action picks up in the
fifth installment of John Grisham's six-part serial novel, ``The
Painted House,'' when young Luke witnesses another murder. In
nonfiction, author William Gay ventures to an eerie cave in Adams,
Tenn., in search of the truth behind the Bell Witch legend. And
Matthew Teague reports on the three-day UFO conference in Eureka
Springs, Ark., where he found fuzzy photos of what were purported
to be flying sauces and plenty of ``Star Trek'' memorabilia, but no
little green men. Also of note: John T. Edge profiles Duncan Hines,
the man who revolutionized dining on the road, and Jan DeBlieu
takes a look at efforts to save endangered red wolves in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More than parties: The Season ($3.95) continues to expand its
coverage beyond that of charity balls and other society events in
the area. The fall issue also includes a profile of Oprah Winfrey;
an article on the single life in Atlanta; interviews with Southern
authors Stuart Woods, Paul Hemphill, Terry Kay and Kathy Hogan
Trocheck; a dining section; and a fashion layout. For the piece on
the single life, the magazine's editors interviewed a focus group
of 22 unmarried Atlantans, ages 20s to the 40s. Yes, they agreed
that a good man and a good woman are hard to find, but singles
``experts'' offered tips and a list of clubs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The big three: In a rare coincidence, none of the newsweeklies
has a copycat cover or mirror image of George W. Bush and Al Gore.
Newsweek ($3.50) offers a fascinating report on the redefining of
race in America and concludes that the old labels of black and
white no longer capture the nation's diversity. There used to be
three Census categories, the editors note; now there are 30, with
11 Hispanic subsets.... Time's ($3.50) cover story on dying is
equally compelling. In interviews with doctors and terminally ill
patients, the magazine's staff writers explore ways we can manage
pain and ``die a good death at home.'' Also interviewed is Bill
Moyers, whose documentary ``On Our Own Terms'' airs on public
broadcasting stations this week (part three is tonight; the
concluding chapter on Wednesday at 9 p.m. on GPTV). Moyers is
promoting a dialogue about death on the Web site
www.pbs.org/onourownterms.... The cover story in U.S. News &AMP; World
Report ($3.50) looks at the U.S. military and whether our fighting
force is going soft.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: The New Yorker's ($3) Jeffrey Toobin chats with
Maria Hsia about the controversy surrounding the Hsi Lai Buddhist
temple and Al Gore's fund-raising activities. In the interview with
Toobin, Hsia insists Gore did nothing wrong. ``He should say...
this is no different from people visiting the black churches or any
churches or a Jewish temple''.... In a cover reminiscent of the
James Bond flick ``Goldfinger,'' Sports Illustrated ($3.50)
features a clever cover shot of gilded gymnast Ivan Ivankov and an
inside spread of a gold-covered gallery of other Olympic athletes
who will be favored in Sydney. Also included is a guide to the
Games..... Speaking of the Olympics, Maxim ($3.99) provides tips on
how to find the gems in the 441 hours of television coverage. And,
as a special bonus for its predominantly young male audience,
there's a revealing layout of eight female Olympic stars. Less
entertaining but more informative is Maxim's article on other
people's paychecks. A rodeo cowboy, for example, makes
$50,000-$60,000 in prize money; an air traffic controller earns
$64,880; and surgeons make $217,000 _ far below the average salary
of $1,408,000 for an NFL lineman.

 &HT;    Approaching your doctor
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you would like to pray with your doctors as a way to help the
healing process, how do you let your physicians know?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't be afraid to approach them. Ask them if they practice a
certain faith and how comfortable they are bringing those beliefs
into the examining room. Doctors say there is usually a time _
after they have discussed treatment options and explanations _ for
the patient to ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Explain your faith and what aspects are important to you. Tell
them if you would like to pray and when. If you are having surgery
a week from the appointment, tell the doctor you would like to have
a short time of prayer or meditation. That way, you can find a
place in the surgery schedule before you are medicated or too sick
to follow through.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you meet resistance or a high level of discomfort, consider
taking your requests for prayers to someone else _ the nurses, a
hospital chaplain or your family. However, if you believe this is
very important and you are shaken by your doctor's lack of
enthusiasm, perhaps you should think about finding a different
doctor.

SOUTH AFRICA'S NEW POOR: WHITE AND BEWILDERED 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Martin van Niekerk wakes with a
start and his sleepy blue eyes wander from the fraying curtains
fluttering over the window to the sagging ceiling and the shabby
walls lined with brown cardboard. And then he remembers.
</P>
<P>
   He is not at home. He has tumbled through a hole in the floor of
his once predictable life.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughterhouse where he weighed and priced animal skins for
17 years shut down in 1998. The clothing store where he worked as a
security guard closed abruptly three weeks ago. For days, he and
his wife and three children slept in the street until they landed
in this shelter, the Kempton Christian Action Settlement.
</P>
<P>
   He and the scores of men and women living here are members of a
tiny but growing slice of South Africa's evolving society: They are
unemployed, homeless and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cell phone, I sell that,'' said van Niekerk, 38, as he
guided a visitor through Shack No. G7, his temporary one-room home.
``And the iron. Even my wife, she sells our wedding rings. But it
is not enough to pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new South Africa is a very difficult place,'' van Niekerk
admitted quietly as he sat on his borrowed bed. ``I used to feel
different. I used to feel like it was my country. You can't say
it's your country anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a white man in South Africa used to mean a steady job, a
house, a car, respectability. For the overwhelming majority of
white men, it still does.
</P>
<P>
   But for an increasing number of whites, there are startling new
realities. Between 1995 and 1999, the ratio of unemployed whites
increased from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent, government statistics
show.
</P>
<P>
   That is minuscule, of course, compared with the unemployment
rate among the black majority _ about 35 percent _ after decades in
which an all-white government denied educational and professional
opportunities to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The poor are still overwhelmingly black and the rich and working
class are still overwhelmingly white. Still, stories like van
Niekerk's send shivers through many whites, who account for about
10 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that once refused to hire blacks now seek them out.
Whites are facing increasing competition, particularly at the lower
rungs of the work force, as the economy sheds thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And Greyling Bezuidenhout, an organizer for the Mine Workers
Union, fears the future will only bring tougher times to a country
that once reserved decent jobs for those with white skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a new problem in this country, and that's white
poverty, but nobody want to talk about it,'' said Bezuidenhout,
whose union represents 65,000 Afrikaners in mining,
telecommunications and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that whites benefited from the racist employment
practices of the past. Some, he says, got by without being
productive simply because they were white. But now, he adds, people
are suffering for old government policies they did not actively
support, and no one seems to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minority rights are seen as politically incorrect,'' he said,
as he shepherded a visitor through several homeless settlements for
whites last week. ``At the end of the day, we have to look after
ourselves. There's no one else to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bezuidenhout _ lanky and bearded, with bespectacled eyes that
burn with his passion for helping the poorest of his people _ is on
a mission that seems decidedly unpopular. He keeps a list of
settlements and visits them regularly, keeping track of their
problems and needs. But when he approaches big companies for
donations, executives typically listen politely and decline, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Few businesses want to invest publicly in a whites-only venture,
he said. As a result, places like the Kempton Christian Action
Settlement, which opened several years ago, quickly fall into
disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't condone the racism that has been done,'' Bezuidenhout
said. ``But a lot of these guys were never supportive of the
apartheid system. Now they pay for the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The forlorn wooden shacks here, all inhabited by parents with
children, house 120 people. When the rains come, the water stands
two inches above the floor. At night, the cold winds squeeze
through cracks in the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Some whites here are prisoners of their insatiable thirst for
drink and drugs. Others simply lost their grip on their
working-class existence, falling out of modest but comfortable
lives when factories closed or breadwinners fell sick.
</P>
<P>
   Van Niekerk keeps a gold-framed certificate of his son's
scholastic achievement hanging on the flimsy walls, a reminder that
his children must continue to strive.
</P>
<P>
   And J.J. Wait holds on to his silver-plated watch, which ticks
away the time in a world he no longer recognizes or understands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a house worth 250,000 rand'' _ $35,000 _ ``and the bank
took it back,'' said Wait, 42, who spent 10 years in the military
police and eight as a security guard before he injured his back and
lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then followed my furniture, then my car,'' he said. ``I
thought I'd work myself up, become a manager or something like
that. But since the new government comes in, everything has fallen
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait says he lacks the proper certification to find a new
security job, but he still blames his troubles on the end of
apartheid, as many people do here. When he applies for jobs, he
says, he is often told the slot is reserved for a black candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm not a racist,'' Wait cautioned hastily. ``My best
friends in the army were black. But this government is doing
nothing to help whites to improve their lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, many wealthy white business executives would say just
the opposite. Earlier this year, a group of prominent Afrikaner
executives issued a public declaration in support of President
Thabo Mbeki, praising his fiscally conservative policies, which
have reduced interest rates, inflation and the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   But that left the people here feeling more betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Even the predominantly white opposition party now courts black
voters, the homeless here grumble, while poor whites rummage
through bags of second-hand clothing and dine from dented cans of
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to stand outside and scream, but it won't help,''
said Meie Erasmus, 51, a resident of Shack No. D7. She said her
husband lost his job as a truck driver to a black who was willing
to work for less.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must accept how we are,'' she said, shaking her head. ``We
can't do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Niekerk spends his time filling out job applications. It is
a measure of his desperation that he is seeking manual labor, which
for most whites is still unthinkable. ``I will even do a black
man's work, just to get money,'' he said.
</P>

 &HT;    Spiritual side of healing edges into doctor's office
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dr. Robert Cowgill was a disbeliever.
</P>
<P>
   A man of science and surgical precision, the Atlanta physician
believed in the power of a scalpel and a practiced hand _ not in
spirituality and a healing touch.
</P>
<P>
   But after attending a weekend seminar on holistic approaches to
treatment, the oncology surgeon changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some of his cancer patients come to his office not to learn
merely about their medical options, but to share a moment of
meditation. ``I'm trying to be open to all possibilities; I'm
trying not to disbelieve too much,'' said Pat Waldo, a Brookhaven
resident who had a mastectomy last year to treat breast cancer.
``Dr. Cowgill helps me with this. This is his gift to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowgill, however, may be the exception to the rule. Many doctors
regard the mixture of church and science as taboo as integrating
church and state. Only 10 percent of physicians say they have
prayed with their patients or discussed spiritual issues with them,
according to a 1996 survey _ one of the scant pieces of research on
the subject. Yet almost 65 percent of people believe doctors should
join them in prayer if requested, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   And a growing body of research has suggested that prayer,
meditation and other mind-body approaches appear to be beneficial
in the healing process, although scientists are still baffled on
why. Some research, including a controversial study recently in the
Archives of Internal Medicine, has suggested that even patients who
are prayed for by a third party tend to fare better than those who
aren't the subject of prayer. Others indicate that the faithful
recover better from such procedures as open heart surgery and that,
among the elderly, blood pressure rates are lower.
</P>
<P>
   Still, approaching your physician _ if you believe the spiritual
aspect should be part of your treatment _ can be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors are trained not to focus on the metaphysical side
of healing, says Dr. David Hilton, a former family physician who
works with Emory University's dean of religious life and often
``hangs out'' at the anatomy labs to discuss any spiritual issues
medical students have as they work on cadavers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical education is focused almost exclusively on the
physical side; they are taught to stick to that,'' said Hilton, a
lifelong Methodist. ``And yet, there's definitely a need to address
more fully the other aspects of being human and being healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who do pray with their patients believe the best
approach is for patients to be honest about the importance of the
spiritual side of their own healing. They advise telling your
physicians about your own faith and gauging their comfort level
with prayer and other spiritual practices. And if you sense
resistance _ and the issue is important enough _ it might be better
to seek someone who is more in line with your own spiritual
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also don't want to offend or disappoint some patients.
And people who don't believe in God aren't going to want to hear
their physician bringing up spiritual issues. And some patients are
a lot more interested in fixing the problem _ whether it be a
blocked artery or a tumor _ than praying about it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some patients and even a few doctors feel a need to do
something beyond IVs, stitches and pills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure more patients probably wished that we did (pray) with
them more than we do,'' said Dr. Kenneth McGrath, a cardiologist
and director of non-invasive cardiology at Saint Joseph's Hospital.
``But I think it's something we're just not accustomed to.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the doctor is motivated, a deeper relationship can be
forged between healers and those in their care. For example,
Cowgill and Waldo still meet occasionally for special spiritual
sessions. They'll relax in Cowgill's examination room, dimmed for
the purpose. He will loosen his tie, they will both remove their
shoes and Cowgill will beseech what he calls ``the source'' to help
Waldo heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To limit yourself to being a body mechanic, well, it's like
applying handcuffs to yourself,'' Cowgill said. ``But if you can
work with the right patients and provide care on a mental,
emotional and spiritual plane, it's much more satisfying _ for both
me and the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dale A. Matthews, author of ``The Faith Factor: Proof of the
Healing Power of Prayer'' (Penguin, $13.95 paperback), says such
experiences are common among physicians who delve into a spiritual
realm with their patients. Matthews, a Washington internist and
speaker at a recent Harvard seminar on the subject, said he became
a convert after he was cajoled into praying with an elderly patient
experiencing symptoms of congestive heart failure. He wanted her to
go to the hospital immediately, but she refused.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they held hands and prayed together for healing, with
his patient clutching her rosary. She then said she would take the
fistful of prescriptions he gave her and would go home and pray
some more. A week later, she returned. She had lost 25 pounds _
much of it fluid that had built up in her body tissues _ and her
heart, once twice its size, was back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the question is, was it the medicine or the
prayer?'' Matthews said. ``Was it a miracle? I don't know, but it
sure was a dramatic turnaround in one week.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. G. Lee Cross, an Atlanta orthopedic surgeon, also prays with
his patients. And every morning, he prays for patients undergoing
surgery that day.
</P>
<P>
   Cross, a Baptist, believes the power of prayer not only helps
the patient, but is a good way to remind physicians that
ultimately, they are not alone in the healing process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of us are perfectionists _ and we don't deal
well when things don't go our way,'' said Cross, who practices at
Atlanta Medical Center. ``I have found prayer is calming for me; a
reminder that there are things beyond my control.''

 &HT;    Doctor a detective in fight against prostate cancer
 &HT;    By Gracie Bonds Staples
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is well past noon, 1:30 p.m., when Dr. James Bennett breaks
for lunch: a takeout container of dressing, carrots, green beans
and squash that his research nurse just picked up for him.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, a clinical associate professor of urology at Emory
University School of Medicine and a prostate cancer researcher,
settles at a table in the office library at Midtown Urology and
digs in, carefully avoiding the mound of Thanksgiving fare.
</P>
<P>
   A diet low in saturated fats and high in vegetables, he
acknowledges later, may play a key role in decreasing the rates of
prostate cancer, the most common cause of cancer in American men.
This year, an estimated 180,000 American men will be diagnosed with
the disease and 37,000 will die.
</P>
<P>
   But as with many deadly diseases, prostate cancer is showing up
in African-Americans at disproportionate rates _ 234 cases per
100,000 black men compared with 135 per 100,000 white men. What's
worse, black men are twice as likely to die from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   To raise awareness about the disease, Bennett, along with other
doctors and researchers, will be on hand to discuss research, risk
factors and treatment at a free two-hour public forum Thursday.
Also on the program will be notable Atlantans who have been treated
for prostate cancer, including former U.N. ambassador and former
Mayor Andrew Young.
</P>
<P>
   The forum, sponsored by the Georgia Prostate Cancer Coalition,
is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. in the Fox Theatre's Egyptian Ballroom,
660 Peachtree St. N.E. To register, call 404-816-4994. Parking is
free for the first 300 people who register.
</P>
<P>
   The event, co-sponsored by Saint Joseph's Hospital and the
Southeast Division of the American Cancer Society, is one of three
this week. The second, Walk for HIM (Health Initiatives for Men
Against Prostate Cancer), will begin at 8 a.m. Saturday at
Centennial Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following the walk, free screenings for prostate
cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure will be offered at Big
Bethel AME Church, 220 Auburn Ave. Screenings will be 10 a.m.-2
p.m.; Saint Joseph's will also offer free prostate cancer screening
7:30 a.m.-2 p.m. at its cancer center, 5665 Peachtree Dunwoody Road
(registration: 404-851-5175).
</P>
<P>
   For those who can't attend the free forum, Bennett answered
these questions:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the prostate and how often should it be checked?
</P>
<P>
   A: The prostate is an organ that sits right beneath the bladder.
Its central function is providing nutrients for reproduction, and
it should be checked every year beyond the age of 50. For men at
high risk of developing prostate cancer _ men of African descent
and men with a family history _ the time is every year after the
age of 40.
</P>
<P>
   Q: African-American men are 66 percent more likely to get
prostate cancer than their white counterparts. Why are the rates so
high?
</P>
<P>
   A: We really don't know why. We are suspicious of dietary issues
such as animal fat, but I don't think it's the match that starts
the fire. There may be a hereditary predisposition, and gene
mutations might even be responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there any telltale signs of trouble that men should be
looking for?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's the problem with prostate cancer. Early cancer, in
particular, has no symptoms at all. That's why it's important to
get regular checkups. In most cases, if symptoms are present _
decreased force of stream, hesitancy, blood in the urine, stinging
or burning during urination _ the cancer is already advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you make a diagnosis?
</P>
<P>
   A: We do a digital rectal exam and a prostate-specific antigen
exam, which measures the PSA in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're the principal investigator of the African-American
Hereditary Prostate Cancer Study. What exactly are you looking for?
</P>
<P>
   A: The goal of the study is to confirm the correlation of
hereditary prostate cancer to a genetic region on chromosome in
African-American men and for other genes associated with the
disease among this same group. We're hoping this information will
help us understand how genes cause or influence the course of
prostate cancer and better ways to diagnose and treat the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the status of the study?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's ongoing, and we're funded for the third year now. We
currently have about 50 African-American families nationwide
enrolled in the study, including nine families in Atlanta. We're
hoping that we can get an additional six more here in metro
Atlanta. (Information: 1-888-218-6157 or Bennett's office at

 &HT;    32,000 men in selenium, vitamin E trial
 &HT;    By Gracie Bond Staples
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors have believed for some time that selenium and vitamin E
might play a role in the prevention of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in perhaps one of the largest national trials ever
conducted, they hope to get a definitive answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some interest in selenium as a cancer
preventioe the mid-'90s, when a large trial was performed to
determine whether it would prevent skin cancer,'' said Dr. Holt
Sanders, a urologist at Saint Joseph's Hospital in Atlanta. ``It
did not, but (prostate cancer rates were) much lower, so it's going
to be very exciting to see how this one turns out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial
will likely get under way in January. Funded by the National Cancer
Institute, the $180 million trial will be conducted in Atlanta and
virtually every state in the country. It will involve some 32,000
men, who will take part in the study for five years with a
seven-year follow-up period.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the men will get selenium, others a placebo. Another
group will get vitamin E or a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two hypotheses,'' said Sanders. ``The first is that
one selenium tablet per day may decrease the risk of prostate
cancer, or taking vitamin E may do the same. This trial is designed
to figure this out.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, researchers need healthy men over 55 and
African-American men who are over 50 and have minimal medical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Saint Joseph's, the Atlanta portion of the
clinical trial will enroll men at DeKalb Medical Center, WellStar
Cobb Hospital, Wellstar Kennestone Hospital, Northside Hospital,
Piedmont Hospital, Gwinnett Hospital System and the Southern
Regional Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Men interested in participating should call Saint Joseph's
Cancer Center at 404-851-7116.

 &HT;    New television service gets Coke ad deal
 &HT;    By Scott Leith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. has inked a deal to become one of the
first advertisers on ReplayTV, a fledgling service that lets
watchers record shows without videotape.
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen is how many consumers will ever view the
beverage giant's ads. ReplayTV is still struggling to build an
audience and is trailing its main rival, TiVo. Coke's decision to
become a ReplayTV advertiser, however, could be a good sign for the
Mountain View, Calif., company.
</P>
<P>
   ReplayTV sells digital video recorders that look much like VCRs
but don't use tape. Viewers can create custom lineups of favorite
shows, along with manipulating live programs through the use of
slow motion and pausing while the actual show continues. Recording
is also simpler than with a VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Digital video recorders could be problematic for advertisers,
however, because they can make it easier to skip commercials.
Coke's deal could help the company splash its name in front of
viewers more effectively, such as through sponsorship of ReplayTV's
``ReplayZone,'' which offers a menu of channels.
</P>
<P>
   Coke ads won't appear as ever-present banners during shows,
however. ``None of our advertising with ReplayTV will show up in
the normal television programming,'' said Chuck Fruit, Coke's vice
president and director for media and marketing assets.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Pictures was ReplayTV's first sponsor. Coke's ads will
start in October.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Coke isn't sure what to expect. ``One of our goals in
forming this partnership with ReplayTV is to learn, while they
learn, about what the public thinks,'' Fruit said.
</P>
<P>
   ReplayTV won't reveal the number of users it has. Its recorders
cost $499 to $599.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Bernoff, principal analyst with Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., said the entire industry encompasses only 60,000
digital video recorders so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of that, probably 80 percent are TiVos,'' Bernoff said. TiVo
also has the highest profile in the business because of a
summerlong ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Coke and ReplayTV declined to discuss financial details, but
Coke does not have a financial stake in the smaller company.
</P>
<P>
   Bernoff said ReplayTV probably gave the beverage maker a good
deal to gain a big-name advertiser. ``Once you have Coke, it's
going to be easier to get Pampers or McDonald's,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because ReplayTV is an interactive system, it offers several
potential selling points for advertisers. ``We're building a media
system that will allow us to send the right ads to the right
people,'' said Michael Teicher, senior vice president of
advertising sales for ReplayTV. The system uses normal phone lines
to connect to a user's home so a program menu can be updated.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, ReplayTV remains in its infancy. ``Within this
category, the first pitch of spring training hasn't been thrown
yet,'' Teicher said.
</P>
<P>
   Coke doesn't have an ad deal with ReplayTV rival TiVo, which
charges users a monthly fee of $9.95 and is not dependent on
advertising. ReplayTV charges no fee once a recorder is purchased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had conversations with a number of other personal
video recorder systems, and at some point in the future, we may do
something similar,'' Fruit said. While Coke is apparently bullish
on the prospects for digital video recorders, investors have been
skeptical so far.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo, which is based in San Jose, Calif., went public in October
1999. Its stock closed Monday at $20.13, far off its high of
$78.75.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Enterprises is among TiVo's investors.
</P>
<P>
   ReplayTV had planned to go public but backed down in August
following the tech-sector shakeout on Wall Street.

VOTE ON LONDON-FRANKFURT EXCHANGE MERGER POSTPONED AGAIN  

</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE KAPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ What had been presented as a fait accompli just five
months ago faced a new setback Monday when the Frankfurt stock
exchange decided to postpone a shareholder vote meant to ratify a
planned merger with the London Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Frankfurt exchange's decision to cancel the Sept. 14
shareholder vote on the proposed merger with London to form the iX
exchange underscores the increasing complexities in the
consolidation of Europe's equity markets.
</P>
<P>
   The London exchange already had canceled its vote on the merger
in the aftermath of a hostile bid from Sweden's OM Gruppen, which
runs Stockholm's stock exchange. Details of OM's offer were made
public to shareholders Monday and did not significantly differ from
its original proposal.
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a grand scheme of cooperation among Europe's
major stock exchanges has in practice been much harder to
implement. While most of the participants agree that they want a
pan-European market that makes it easier and less costly to trade,
how to get there has been a source of increasing contention. Even
as the stock exchanges disagree on the best model for
consolidation, the shareholders find themselves at odds over
differing agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulties of these mergers in Europe should never be
underestimated,'' said Ruben Lee, director of the Oxford Finance
Group, a consulting firm, and author of ``What Is An Exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frankfurt exchange's decision to postpone the vote was
motivated more by strategy than pragmatism, said people close to
the exchange. They said it would be imprudent to hold a vote that
could be binding when the situation is changing so rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Frankfurt would be unlikely to sweeten its 50-50 merger terms
until it receives a clear signal from London shareholders on their
view of OMs proposal, these people said. The Frankfurt exchange
will continue exploring the option of joining forces with the
Madrid and Milan stock exchanges in its attempts to secure a deal
with London, they added.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Nasdaq, which has said it would take a stake in iX,
now appears to be keeping its options open. Nasdaq executives met
with officials from OM last week in New York for a ``friendly
discussion,''people close to those talks said. It is understood
that Nasdaq has hired Dresdner Kleinwort Benson as its adviser,
although the bank declined to confirm or deny it had been retained.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the London-Frankfurt merger plans will go a long
way toward deciding how stock exchanges will consolidate throughout
Europe. OMs model is based on a single trading system, one
regulatory system and consolidated processes for clearing and
settlement _ the financial details of paying for and receiving
shares that are purchased on the exchange. The iX plan, by
contrast, would use one trading system, but would split the markets
between London and Frankfurt, rely on two sets of regulations and
separate clearing and settlement houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the transaction costs come from clearing and
settlement,'' Lee said. ``If the key point is to reduce transaction
costs, then iX is flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the bidding for the London Stock Exchange is pitting
big banks against smaller retailer brokers _ both of which want to
promote competing visions of how stocks will trade in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the larger banks have expressed support for iX as a step
toward a Pan-European exchange, because it combines two of Europe's
largest markets.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Brian Winterflood, founder of retail brokerage firm
Winterflood Securities, is critical of iX, because it calls for
growth stocks, his main source of trading business, to list in
Frankfurt.Instead, he said he prefers a combination of the London
Stock Exchange, OM Gruppen, Nasdaq and the London futures market
called Liffe.
</P>
<P>
   Winterflood is also one of a growing number of retail brokers
who are calling for the dismissal of London exchange's chairman,
Don Cruickshank, and its chief executive, Gavin Casey. Both are up
for re-election at what is expected to be a contentious board
meeting Thursday.

Commission said on Monday that the four major options exchanges
agreed for years to restrain competition by not seeking to trade
options already traded on other exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges _ the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the American
Stock Exchange, the Pacific Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange _ signed a consent decree with the Justice
Department and accepted a censure by the SEC but did not admit any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the investigations, coupled with the entry of
another competitor, the International Securities Exchange, had
already broken down the barriers that the regulators complained
about, and most major options are now traded on multiple exchanges.
It is not yet clear, however, whether that competition is
benefiting investors or just the brokerage firms that send orders
to the exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the
antitrust division, said that the agreement by the exchanges not to
compete with one another's listings ``harmed consumers by depriving
some investors of better prices, lower transaction fees and higher
quality services.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC and the Justice Department painted a picture of an
active conspiracy that went on for years after the SEC ended legal
bars to multiple listing of options in 1990. As part of that
conspiracy, exchange officials used ``threats, intimidation and
harassment'' when some exchange members tried to promote
competition, the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   But having set forth claims of a long-lasting conspiracy that
harmed many investors, the SEC and the Justice Department stopped
short of penalizing the exchanges by imposing fines.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the exchanges, which are self-regulatory organizations
responsible for monitoring the conduct of those who trade on the
exchanges, agreed to spend more money on surveillance and the
enforcement of trading rules. The four exchanges agreed to spend a
total of $77 million on such activities over the next two years,
which the SEC said represented about a 50 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $77 million will provide what we believe to be real
concrete benefits to investors,'' said Richard Walker, the SEC's
enforcement director, when asked why there was no fine. ``We've
structured the settlement to put the money where it counts.''
</P>
<P>
   While no fines are to be paid, the Chicago and American
exchanges said they had reached tentative settlements of a
class-action suit covering the same issues but did not elaborate. A
person briefed on the agreements said they called for the Chicago
exchange to pay $16 million and the American exchange to pay $14
million. In addition, market makers at the various exchanges are to
pay a total of about $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia and Pacific exchanges previously settled that
suit by agreeing to pay a total of $7.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC, in its censure of the exchanges, said they had not met
their legal obligations to enforce compliance with rules intended
to give priority to customer orders and requiring options market
makers to live up to the quotes they post. The spending being
required is designed in part to enhance enforcement of those rules.
</P>
<P>
   The options exchanges, while neither admitting nor denying the
complaints, put as good a face as possible on the agreement. ``We
are satisfied that the relief sought by the SEC consists largely of
regulatory provisions that the CBOE believes should be put in
place,'' said William Brodsky, the chairman of the Chicago
exchange.

BUSH BACK IN FLORIDA TO TRY TO ERASE SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ If there is any place George W. Bush once
felt at home, it is here, home of another Governor Bush, where
voters broke the national trend to choose a Bush for president in
1992. Back in March, he declared this ``Bush Country,'' putting
Florida ``in the W column,'' as he likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the nationwide campaign has not gone as smoothly as
Bush once hoped, the race in Florida is also now a struggle, with
polls showing the Texas governor's lead erased. And the turnabout _
which puts a significant 25 electoral votes up for grabs _ is not
just a disappointing trend for Bush, who arrived here Monday. It is
also a shock to the people of Florida, Republicans and Democrats
alike, who suddenly find themselves in a real battleground state.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is now ground zero in the issues war being waged by Vice
President Al Gore, who is playing to seniors concerned about
prescription drug costs and powerful teachers unions here. His
running mate, Joe Lieberman, is treated like a rock star by the
elderly Jewish population. And either Gore or Lieberman is planning
to be here every week until the election _ a strategy unthinkable
just months ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush is now faced with having to really fight
here, to the dismay of Florida Republicans and the surprise of some
political anaylsts. While the polls are thus far inconclusive, and
could change in the coming weeks, almost no one uses the word
``sweep'' anymore to describe how Bush will fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I expect Florida to be a battleground state? No,'' said
Representative Clay Shaw, chairman of the House Appropriations
committee and a Florida Republican. ``But now it has to be a
battleground.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, Shaw said, the landscape shifted when Lieberman joined
the ticket, enthralling the heavily Jewish areas of the state. He
also credited the Democratic Convention with providing Gore a
``bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   But the convention ended weeks ago, and some political analysts
said the numbers reflect a much more elaborate situation, as
Florida voters, who chose Clinton over Bob Dole in 1996, have
picked up on the issues Gore is talking about. James P. Monroe, a
political science teacher at the University of Miami, said the
problem for Bush in Florida is ``how to deal with what would seem
to be a set of isses that have come out of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised,'' Monroe said. ``I actually thought the state
would be, not a runaway, but pretty solidly in Bush's column. It's
hard to believe it's as close as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself is less willing to describe the race in such stark
terms. Arriving here Monday _ his second Florida trip in three
weeks _ Bush said he expected to ``win in the great state of
Florida'' in November, dismissing the doubts of some of his
supporters and the recent round of polls.
</P>
<P>
   But he did defend his younger brother, who has delicately
balanced running the Republican campaign in Florida and continuing,
as governor, to run the state. Recently, that dual role has become
an issue for Jeb Bush, with some local supporters questioning
whether he is focused on the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to those accusations, Bush Monday said: ``Don't blame
it on my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in good shape here in Florida,'' the Texas governor told
reporters, as his brother stood by his side. ``I'm going to carry
Florida. I've got real plans for real people.''
</P>
<P>
   That message, which the Texas governor debuted on Friday and
plans to carry through a five-state swing this week, was the focus
Monday, as Bush bypassed his usual rally-style campaign event in
favor of a town hall-style meeting at a senior center here. In a
trip to the Top of the World retirement community _ a sprawling
residence of 10,000 seniors encompassing three voting precincts _
Bush spoke at length about his prescription drug plan for Medicare,
describing it as a ``plan that will make the system modern.''
</P>
<P>
   He took questions, holding a 37-minute event similar to the sort
favored by Gore. Later in the day, Bush flew to West Palm Beach,
where he greeted supporters at the airport, then attended a
$500,000 fundraiser for the Florida Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the trip was simple: To underscore his commitment to
overhauling the Medicare system and provide prescription drug
coverage to seniors. But the event, set against a backdrop of
seniors, was nearly identical to the ones Gore staged following the
Democratic National Convention last month, creating a challenge for
Bush as he tried to distinguish his policies from that of the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Bush sought to offset warnings by Gore that the
Republican plan for Medicare would be ``risky.'' In particular,
Gore has said that Bush's $198 billion plan, a provision of which
allow seniors to choose among health plans, would jeopardize the
entire Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will hear scare tactics. . . . You can't scare somebody
and try to lead. That's short-term politics,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush deployed the tactic himself somewhat, casting Gore's
$253 billion plan, which would include a prescription drug benefit
as part of Medicare, as a bureaucratic morass that would strangle
seniors' ability to select their own care.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent's point of view is that in order to have a
prescription drug benefit, you'll be thrown into a government-run
HMO,'' Bush said. ``You don't have flexibility. That's not fair and
that's not right. You ought to have a variety of options.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on health care, a topic Bush once left largely
unmentioned, is in itself a sign of how critical Florida has
become, and why Florida appears to be reconsidering Gore, who has
talked about it from the start. Indeed, some strategists on both
sides believe the state is essential to both candidates to win.
Florida is the fourth-largest electoral state; only larger are New
York and California, which are leaning heavily Democratic, and
Texas, which is all but guaranteed to favor Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a state the Texas governor thought he was going to
win,'' Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said. Now, he said, ``Our
prospects are sunny in the Sunshine State.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters who heard Bush speak Monday fiercely disagreed.
Bridget Phillips, 51, a former teacher in Clearwater and
Republican, said she thought the polls were flat-out wrong. ``I
don't believe it,'' she said. ``I think the press is making people
think Gore's ahead, and it isn't true.''

   SMARTER PHONES: Swedish cell phone giant Ericsson expects 1
billion people to use cell phones to link to the Web by 2005.
That's part of the reason it hooked up with Microsoft in a new
joint venture. Ericsson and Microsoft will tie cell phones to
corporate e-mail accounts and computer networks by the end of the
year. Their newly formed company, called Ericsson Microsoft Mobile
Venture AB, is part of a broader alliance that's expected to crank
out a new breed of so-called ``smart'' phones. Ericsson Microsoft's
software will also include calendars, to-do lists and other
personal organization functions.

   COMPETITION FOR MALLS: U.S. consumers aged 8 to 24 are spending
$164 billion a year online, according to a survey by Harris
Interactive. The survey, based on 3,900 responses, noted the online
purchases of 18- to 24-year-olds represented about 13 percent of
their total spending. Online purchases mimicked mall spending: the
most popular items were music, movie tickets and books.
</P>
<P>
   AD SALES DOWN: U.S. Internet advertising revenue fell 7.6
percent to $1.41 billion in August from the previous month as some
smaller companies cut back their spending, according to AdZone
Interactive. America Online's AOL.com shop, which spent $28.5
million, bought the most online ads last month, while NextCard Inc.
spent $25.8 million and Amazon.com Inc. spent $22.2 million. It's
the first month-to-month drop in online ad spending this year.
</P>

 &HT;    Tone nonpartisan as Miller begins ad campaign for Senate
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - As Zell Miller began his TV ad campaign for the U.S.
Senate last week, not even a distant echo remained from his fiery,
partisan keynote speech that invigorated the Democratic National
Convention eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in his second TV ad in less than a week, the newly
appointed senator goes out of his way to strike a nonpartisan tone
as he competes with six other candidates for the unexpired term of
the late U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it, a United States senator should take Georgia
values to Washington, not bring Washington values to Georgia,''
Miller said in the 30-second commercial that debuted on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he should be the senator for all our people _ and not just
Democrats and not just Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   If it continues to go unanswered, Miller's apolitical theme,
coupled with his support for Republican-oriented plans to end the
so-called marriage tax penalty and estate tax, could deflate the
already lagging campaign of his chief challenger, Mack Mattingly,
political experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The special, nonpartisan election to fill the remaining four
years of Coverdell's term is Nov. 7. Miller was appointed by Gov.
Roy Barnes to serve until then.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly, a former one-term U.S. senator, has yet to begin TV
advertising, which political observers believe to the most
effective way he can reintroduce himself to Georgia voters who
haven't seem his name on the ballot in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the nonpartisan ballot are Summerville lawyer Ben
Ballenger, Atlanta lawyer and author Jeff Gates, Alpharetta
businessman Paul MacGregor, Savannah free-lance writer Winnie Walsh
and Duluth Realtor/owner Bob Wood. None of them has started TV
campaign advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Mattingly's work has been concentrated on campaign stops
across the state with Republican Georgia congressmen, reminding the
party faithful that Miller is long-time Democrat and friend of
President Clinton and Al Gore. Miller's 1992 convention address in
New York preceded Clinton's party nomination for president. Earlier
that year, Miller changed the date of Georgia's presidential
primary, which helped the then-Arkansas governor carry the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Mattingly's constant mantra _ that only a Republican should
have been tapped to fill Coverdell's shoes _ does little to
resonate with the broader base of Georgians he must reach to win in
November, Emory University political scientist Merle Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't sell among all Republicans and it has no
resonance at all outside the Republican Party,'' Black said. ``This
is Zell's race to win or lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mattingly, who used an upset victory in 1980 to become the
state's first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate this century,
says he's gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Mattingly's aides cite the Miller campaign's
apparent change-of-heart on debate policy.
</P>
<P>
   First, the former governor's campaign said he would consider
only debate proposals that included all seven candidates, that were
broadcast statewide and that didn't fall within the final three
weeks of the campaign.(Miller will spend September and possibly
early October in Washington while the Senate is in session.)
</P>
<P>
   But late last week, Miller spokesman Rick Dent said the debate
posture remains ``flexible'' and that Miller's only condition is
that all debates be broadcast statewide to reach as many potential
voters as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because we said we'd accept everything,''
Mattingly spokesman Bill Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly also is calling for one-on-one debates, a format
Miller's campaign now says he's willing to accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Press Club has scheduled live U.S. Senate debates
Oct. 15 and Nov. 5 for statewide broadcast on Georgia Public
Television. Organizers are still awaiting confirmation from the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the sprinkling of TV ads, proposed debates and
Mattingly's establishment of advisory ``kitchen cabinets'' from the
coast to the mountains, the Senate contest has been slow to ignite.
Black and other political observers expect little activity until
the final month of what was initially projected to be a brief but
intense three-month campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag for Miller's initial round of TV advertising was
about $86,000 on four metro Atlanta stations, giving him less
face-time than 7th District congressional candidate Roger Kahn
bought on one Atlanta station over a nine-day period in a much
tougher contest against U.S. Rep. Bob Barr. Similar Miller ads also
hit the airwaves in Macon, Columbus and Savannah last week.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he's had to do little more than that to remain a solid
frontrunner. Miller left office with a remarkable 85 percent
approval rating, and not even his huge uptick in personal income
last year from a variety of corporate board memberships and
consulting work for the Philip Morris tobacco company has drawn
more than glancing attacks from opponents.
</P>
<P>
   As Miller's chief challenger, Mattingly is well-known among
Republicans for party fund raising. But to defeat Miller, his own
challenge is to re-establish himself among rank-and-file voters _
and offer them a compelling message _ after such a long absence
from public life.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that national Republicans have indicated a
reluctance to invest money in the contest unless Mattingly
demonstrates he's competitive. Despite that public posture,
national Republican senatorial groups have begun forwarding
campaign contributions, Mattingly said.
</P>
<P>
   He projects a $3 million campaign, and though he won't discuss
specifics, he says his fund raising is going well. The Miller
campaign claims pledges of more than $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Black and others, however, speculate that Mattingly wants to
reserve his limited pool of funds until the final weeks of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miller's setting the pace,'' Black said. ``The question is
whether Mattingly has the money to respond.''

GORE TOUTS EDUCATION PLAN, JOKES WITH OPRAH, URGES ENTERTAINMENT
INDUSTRY CONTROL OF VIOLENCE 

</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Houston Chronicle

<P>
   BELLEVILLE, Ill. _ With polls showing increasing support from
women voters, Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore kicked off
the campaign week Monday touting his $170 billion education plan
and promising to help parents shield their children from sex and
violence in entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   A clearly relaxed Gore began the day by appearing on the
nationally syndicated ``Oprah Winfrey Show'' before traveling to
Belleville to hold a town hall meeting at an elementary school, and
then on to Ohio, where he will spend Tuesday taking a Dayton to
Cincinnati tour in a yellow school bus.
</P>
<P>
   On the lighthearted ``Oprah,'' the vice president recounted for
a mostly-female audience his feelings before planting the big kiss
on wife Tipper at the Democratic National Convention in Los
Angeles. He answered questions on his favorite movie (``Local
Hero''), his favorite breakfast cereal (Wheaties) and his favorite
childhood memory (playing baseball with his dad).
</P>
<P>
   The vice president admired Winfrey's red boots and joked about
his reputation for being stiff.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore turned serious when he called for a ``cease-fire'' on
advertising adult-themed movies, music and video games in
publications and television broadcasts targeting young audiences.
If the entertainment industry doesn't police itself within the next
six months, he said, he and running mate Joe Lieberman would back
tougher laws to crack down on such advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about censorship. It's about citizenship, and that
includes corporate citizenship,'' he told Winfrey. He added that he
would build on long-standing efforts by his wife, Tipper, and
Lieberman to hold the entertainment industry accountable for
warning parents when their products contain adult-themed lyrics and
content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Lieberman and I are following up on that,'' he said, ``so
that young kids can't get these albums that are inappropriate for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're called CD's now,'' Winfrey interjected to laughter and
applause. But Gore was ready with a high-tech comeback: ``Well,
ever since I shifted over to the MP3 ...,'' he began, referring to
an audio format used for playing and distributing music on
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's announcement came in response to a Federal Trade
Commission report released Monday criticizing the entertainment
industry for its marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
   During a town hall meeting at Westhaven Elementary School in
Belleville, in southwestern Illinois, the vice president repeated
his call for the industry to ``clean up its act.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking to several students about their fears of school
violence, Gore pointed out that two students who killed their
classmates and teachers at Columbine High School in Colorado had
been obsessed with the violent video game ``Doom.''
</P>
<P>
   The television, movie and music industries are together the
fourth-largest source of cash for the Democratic Party, raising
$5.9 million so far this campaign cycle for the party and $928,000
for Gore _ figures not lost on Gore's opponent, Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the man's short on credibility on the issue,'' said
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's schedule this week includes several fund-raisers in which
the Democratic National Committee hopes to raise $7 million from
donors attending concerts by such stars as Bette Midler, Cher,
Michael Bolton, Jimmy Buffett, Paul Simon and James Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said that Gore can accept money from
the entertainment industry while still holding it responsible for
its actions. The is not true of Bush, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has taken huge amounts of money from the HMO
industry, from the big oil industry, from the pharmaceutical
industry. And then you look at the agenda that he has put forth,
and it parrots the interests of those special interests,'' Lehane
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, Al Gore has put forth an agenda that
benefits the people and he's on the people 's side, regardless of
who supports him and who doesn't support him.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of that, he said, could be found in Gore's record on
supporting the V-chip to allow parents to control what shows their
children can watch and in supporting a TV rating system and more
educational TV programming.
</P>
<P>
   Taking questions from an audience of parents, teachers and
students in Belleville, Gore outlined his education plan, calling
for higher pay and better training for teachers, smaller classrooms
connected to the Internet and universal preschool for 3- and
4-year-olds. He also said he would offer tax credits to families in
which one parent stays home to care for the children, and to
families seeking to send their children to college.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would expand the federal Family and Medical Leave
Act to include those working at small companies so they can take
unpaid time off work to care for sick relatives or to participate
in their children's school activities.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed requiring school districts to adopt strict
disciplinary codes and expand character and citizenship education.
And he promised to triple federal funding for charter schools,
allowing parents more choice in which public schools their children
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on ``Oprah,'' Gore said parents need more support from
their communities and from government, and he said they need more
time to spend with their children and each other.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to appear on the show next Tuesday.

JOAN KENNEDY CHARGED WITH DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN AND FARAH STOCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joan B. Kennedy, the former wife of US Senator Edward M. Kennedy
who has struggled for years with alcoholism, was arrested for drunk
driving Sunday evening on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest is her fourth since 1974 and comes just after the
64-year-old marked nine years of sobriety and publicly said she
felt ``free'' from the addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Barnstable, Mass. police said they received a call from another
motorist between 8:30 and 9 Sunday night reporting a blue Buick
driving erratically and crossing the center line in the rural
Marstons Mills section of Barnstable, about five miles from the
Kennedy compound in Hyannis. The motorist followed the car while
talking to police on a cell phone, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy pulled off the main road and parked on a dead-end
street, where she got out of the car and spoke to the motorist, who
stopped to ``ask if she was okay,'' Barnstable police Sgt. Sean
Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   When police arrived, Kennedy would only give her first name and
politely refused to produce a driver's license or car registration,
Sweeney said. She admitted having wine earlier in the evening and
``exhibited signs of intoxication,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer didn't conduct any field sobriety tests, Sweeney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy pleaded innocent to the charges at her arraignment
Monday in Barnstable District Court. A pretrial conference is set
for Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, US Rep. Patrick Kennedy, who has also received
treatment for alcoholism, issued a statement requesting that his
mother's privacy be respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``What my mother did was wrong, and she will pay a price for it
through the legal system,'' said the Rhode Island Democrat.
``However, my mother has always been very supportive of me, and I
intend to stand by her side in this very difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask that all individuals, and especially the media, respect
the personal nature of this insidious disease she has been fighting
for many years and give her the room and privacy to be able to deal
with this latest incident as she has handled other setbacks in her
life. I love my mother very much and will continue to provide her
with the support and help she needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Kennedy began speaking publicly about her struggle with
alcoholism after her tumultuous marriage to Senator Edward M.
Kennedy ended in divorce in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   In an article this year, she told The Boston Globe Magazine that
she ``had not had a drink in nine years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a relief to be free,'' she also said. ``So much of
my married life was about keeping secrets and pretending that I was
doing great and happy. Once you sober up, the whole idea is to be
honest with yourself and other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy has devoted time and her family name to charitable
causes, and also counseled other women at Alcoholics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has made many successful attempts at staying sober,'' Hope
Podell, who develops programs to help alcoholics conquer their
addictions, said Monday. ``If in fact she relapsed, it's too bad it
happened, but it's not the end of the world. She probably will
sincerely make the next attempt to put down her drink and not pick
up the next one.''

DESPITE DIFFERENCES ON MEDICARE PLANS, CANDIDATES APPEAL TO ELDERLY
VOTERS _ AND THEIR CONCERNED MIDDLE-AGED CHILDREN &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   A handful of pills and a fistful of dollars are the pictures
that might come to mind first for voters considering the competing
plans of George W. Bush and Al Gore to provide prescription drug
payments for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But in the political sense, the proposals also suggest the image
of IV poles _ structures that each candidate can carry around in
the race for president to dangle a variety of campaign themes,
strategies and debate points.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who announced his $158 billion plan last week in response
to Gore's and campaigned on the issue Monday in Florida, would use
federal Medicare funds to subsidize the premiums that elderly
people would pay to private insurance companies. The firms would
provide coverage for prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
   It's an approach that dovetails into the traditional Republican
side of the Texas governor's overall agenda, because it relies on
competition within the private sector rather than the Medicare
program itself, which any faithful GOP member would be tempted to
call a government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But it also gives Gore another line of attack, because the vice
president is fond these days of criticizing health maintenance
organizations, pharmaceutical companies and other corporations that
he says are powerful interests lined up against ``the people.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the vice president indeed demonstrated in the last few
days, it gives the Democrats a chance to cast doubt on whether Bush
can deliver on spending programs and an ambitious income tax cut at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Bush seeks the upper hand on a health care issue,
Democrats also attack his record in Texas. Gore's running mate,
Joseph Lieberman, waged the fight last week with a campaign
appearance in Houston, where he criticized Bush's record on
Medicaid programs for children. The program is different from
Medicare, which covers the elderly, but it was a health-coverage
topic nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Now switch sides.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's $253 billion Medicare plan would provide prescription
drug payments for the elderly directly through the government
program, not through private insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   This approach dovetails into the traditional Democratic theme of
preserving the government's so-called entitlement programs, such as
Medicare and Social Security, against attempts by the GOP to change
this ``sacred'' territory by mixing it with the private business
world.
</P>
<P>
   But it also allows Bush to push his vision of a less
confrontational and more bipartisan approach in Washington, because
the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare has
recommended that private insurers rather than the government
provide drug benefits to seniors. And it allows Bush to portray
himself as the more reform-minded contender, because Gore's plan
does not change the function of Medicare as much as Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences on Medicare, though, the plans give
both candidates the chance to appeal to elderly voters _ and to
their concerned middle-aged children who are elderly-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   As drug prices soar, a glance at the electoral map shows why the
elderly, most of whom rely on fixed incomes to pay their medical
costs, are an important group in this election.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, where Gore erased Bush's early lead in the polls, is
studded with retirement communities. In the Midwest, where the
contest is neck-and-neck, analysts say the most crucial cluster of
undecided voters is older members of the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush both propose to pay for prescription drug coverage
with part of the projected federal budget surplus. On a timeline,
Bush's plan is more aggressive. It would start next year. Gore's
plan would phase in over several years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the issue must be fought on what is usually Democratic turf,
because polls indicate that voters trust the Democrats more than
the Republicans to address problems with health care.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably one explanation for the findings of a July poll
by the Wall Street Journal and NBC. Forty-four percent of voters
said Gore would do a better job on prescription drug coverage, 22
percent said Bush would and 10 percent said the two were equal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore may have altered Bush's pace on the issue, too. The
Democrat came out with his plan first, then spent weeks flogging
his opponent for having no plan. Of course when Bush did put forth
his proposal last week, Gore picked at the details.
</P>
<P>
   It was a political ritual reminiscent of Gore's steamrolling of
challenger Bill Bradley in the Democratic primaries. Gore
criticized the former New Jersey senator for offering no plan on
education issues then pecked at the details of Bradley's subsequent
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as the prescription drug debate is fought out over
competing specifics, it feeds into Gore's strengths. He is running
partly on his grasp of government details, while Bush's appeal runs
closer to factors of character and freshness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Bush's favor, his plan shows on its face that he can
match Gore detail-for-detail when it comes to offering enticing
ways to spend surplus money.
</P>
<P>
   For voters thirsting for concrete proposals that would change
their personal finances if not their lives _ rather than shallow
posturing and what Bradley called ``the politics of a thousand
promises and a thousand attacks'' _ the prescription drug debate
offers all the ingredients, good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Both plans would provide free prescription drugs for seniors
earning less than $11,300 a year. Gore's plan would pay part of the
premiums for drug coverage for seniors earning less than $12,450 a
year; Bush's plan would provide the same benefits for seniors
earning less than $14,600.
</P>
<P>
   For those who earn more, Gore's plan would subsidize half the
cost of prescription drugs. Bush's plan, by providing subsidies for
payments to insurance companies, would allow seniors to pay more
for more generous coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's plan, no elderly person would have to pay more than
$4,000 a year for drugs. Under the first four years of Bush's plan
the annual limit on drug costs would be $6,000, but after that no
senior would have to pay more than $6,000 a year for all health
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Both approaches apparently would involve dictating terms to
private industry. Gore's plan, at least according to Bush, would
put the government in the position of negotiating drug discounts
from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Crimping the Republican
philosophy of free markets, though, Bush would require all insurers
that provide Medicare coverage to include a prescription drug
benefit.

   MEDICARE-REFORM (Washington) _ A look at the Medicare debate in
the presidential campaign: George W. Bush jumped into the Medicare
wars this week, promising that, if elected, he would form a White
House task force that would send legislation to Congress within
nine months to transform the 35-year-old government insurance
program into an efficient, largely private health care marketplace.
But many health care experts __ and sadder-but-wiser veterans of
past Medicare wars __ say that the last decade has shown the
immense difficulties in accomplishing such reforms. The
philosophical differences between the two parties over how to
reshape Medicare are large and enduring. The experience with
private HMOs in the Medicare program has been rocky, with hundreds
of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries dropped in recent years by
health plans who say they cannot make a profit. By Robin Toner.

ADVERTISERS SHY AWAY FROM DR. LAURA'S TV SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The premiere episode of the Dr. Laura Schlessinger syndicated
television series, which ran across the country Monday clearly
suffered from a summer's worth of protests by gay and lesbian
activists as well-known advertisers mostly shunned the show.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, complaining about remarks made by Schlessinger
about homosexuals on her popular syndicated radio program, urged
mainstream advertisers to steer clear of her foray onto television.
Indeed, only a handful of recognizable brand names were spotted
among the sponsors of the initial episode of ``Dr. Laura'' as the
giant packaged-goods marketers and retailers that dominate daytime
television were notably absent.
</P>
<P>
   The sole recognizable sponsors were: Brummel &AMP; Brown sandwich
spread, sold by the Lipton division of Unilever; Scott bathroom
tissue, made by Kimberly-Clark; and Summer's Eve, a feminine
hygiene product of the C.B. Fleet Co.
</P>
<P>
   The lion's share of the spots came from national marketers that
sell video tapes, diet aids and compact disks through toll-free
``800'' telephone numbers; local vocational schools and lawyers;
and units of Viacom, the parent of Paramount Domestic Television,
the Paramount Pictures unit that is producing and syndicating the
series.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials seen on WCBS-TV, Channel 2 in New York, a
Viacom-owned station, were from unfamiliar names like Castalian
Music, selling ``The Very Best of the Gipsy Kings'' and a
collection of Shirley Temple films; the Learning Institute for
Beauty Sciences; Premier Diet-ZX, which an announcer promoted by
shouting, ``Lose weight free 24 hours a day!''; the Invention
Submission Corp.; Sanford Rubenstein, a Brooklyn lawyer with a
toll-free number ending in ``H-U-R-T''; the Wound Care Center; the
New York Restaurant School, promoting classes in ``the highly
specialized field'' of ``pastry arts''; and Ontel Direct, selling
the Universal Inkjet Refill Kit, a syringe that is injected into
empty printer cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   The WCBS broadcast also included three commercials promoting Jon
Corzine, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in New Jersey.
Such political spots are usually placed by local stations
throughout their programming and sold by law at the lowest rates
they charge.
</P>
<P>
   The paucity of well-known advertisers and the predominance of
local marketers was also evident in markets like St. Louis and
Washington, D.C. That made the first program seem more like
late-night local cable fare than a nationally syndicated talk show
meant to appear on broadcast network stations during daytime hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the first time a controversial talk show debuted
with mainstream advertisers staying out,'' Joe Mandese, editor of
The Myers Report, an industry newsletter, said Monday after being
read a list of the sponsors. ``But this is not a good sign at
launch.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandese said: ``Controversy generates a lot of awareness. And if
you can leverage that, the advertising community will follow _ not
the mainstream, but the `bottom-feeders' looking for
efficiencies.'' He cited examples like the series of the talk-show
hosts Jenny Jones, Sally Jessy Raphael and Geraldo Rivera, which
were sponsored primarily by second-tier advertisers that market
national brands of over-the-counter drugs and remedies.
</P>
<P>
   However, none of the advertisers known to capitalize on the
reluctance of mainstream marketers to sponsor contentious
programming were present in the debut episode of ``Dr. Laura.''
Such advertisers were the initial sponsors of the prime-time drama
series ``N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' which during its first two seasons on ABC
ran spots from marketers like H.I.S. jeans, Plus White toothpaste
and Wash 'n Curl shampoo after protests from conservative activists
led blue-chip advertisers to avoid buying commercial time.
</P>
<P>
   ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' was able to parlay high ratings and favorable
reviews from well-regarded TV critics into acceptance from the
marketers who at first had bowed to pressure and stayed away.
Whether ``Dr. Laura'' can do the same remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe `Dr. Laura' is an advertiser-friendly
program offering an attractive demographic for national
advertisers,'' Joel Berman, co-president of Paramount Domestic
Television in Los Angeles, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount Domestic Television is ``committed to presenting
society's moral and ethical issues without creating or contributing
to an environment of hurt, hate or intolerance,'' the statement
also said.
</P>
<P>
   That was clearly an effort to defuse the vociferous protests by
the activists against the show, which have been orchestrated
through a Web site, www.stopdrlaura.com. The volunteers who put up
the site _ veterans of many organizations that seek to promote gay
civil rights _ persuaded a lengthy list of mainstream advertisers
to declare they would not advertise on ``Dr. Laura'' or stop
advertising on her radio show. Among them: Geico, Motel 6,
Priceline.com and Procter &AMP; Gamble, the largest packaged-goods
marketer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're walking away because they realize hateful programming
is bad business,'' said John Aravosis, a co-founded of the Web
site, adding that Paramount and Viacom were ``suffering as a result
of her own rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Aravosis said he was responsible for the withdrawal from ``Dr.
Laura'' of an advertiser whose commercial ran during the first
episode shown in Washington, where he lives. He identified the
advertiser as the Bally Total Fitness chain of health clubs.
</P>
<P>
   John Southern, a spokesman for Bally in Chicago, confirmed that
the company had ``no intention to advertise on this program in the
future,'' adding that the spot ran as part of a ``station-wide,
non-specific media buy.''

OPEC MOVE   DOESN'T LOWER   THE PRICE   OF HEATING OIL
</HEADLINE>
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER and NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of home heating oil surged to a 10-year high Monday as
traders discounted the impact of a decision over the weekend by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase crude oil
production by 800,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of
heating oil for October delivery jumped 5.49 cents, or 5.5 percent,
to $1.0498 a gallon, its highest since October 1990, after the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The price of crude oil rose $1.51, or 4.5
percent, to $35.14, just below the 10-year high it reached last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At its current price in the futures market, home heating oil is
now 51 percent higher than the average for last fall and winter and
is likely to become a bigger issue in the presidential election,
especially if October is cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the reports that OPEC member governments will
increase oil production by 800,000 barrels per day,'' Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson said Sunday. ``Whether such an increase
will stabilize the market remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the administration was still considering releasing
oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, urged
consumers last week to fill up their home heating oil tanks early,
instead of waiting for the first cold weather. More and more
analysts have said that this increase in OPEC production _ and any
further increase OPEC may approve at its next meeting on Nov. 12 _
will arrive too late to help. It takes about six weeks for the
crude oil to get to the United States and another week or 10 days
to refine it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is heating oil, timing and the weather,'' said Irene
King, a senior oil markets analyst at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. ``And the
increase will come too late to do anything for the home heating oil
price. Now there is a panic on the price and it's 80 degrees
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Flynn, senior energy market analyst of Alaron.com, said,
``The market is saying we're going to have shortages this winter.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the OPEC announcement, which was formalized in
Vienna on Monday, traders and analysts said there would be only
about 100,000 to 150,000 new barrels of oil produced because OPEC
members were already ``cheating'' by pumping more than their
current quotas.
</P>
<P>
   For the near term, an oil inventory report by the American
Petroleum Institute after the close of trading Tuesday and a
similar report from the Energy Information Administration that will
be issued on Wednesday morning will have an important impact on the
price of oil and home heating oil. Although the crude oil inventory
has been rising in recent weeks, it is still almost 22 million
barrels below its level at this time last year and not too far from
a 24-year low. The distillate inventory, from which home heating
oil is made, is 28 million barrels below its level at this time
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to strong consumer demand and low inventories,
traders said that hedge funds and other speculators who are betting
on the price of oil are also a major factor in the price rise.
</P>
<P>
   Home heating oil and crude oil prices also rallied despite the
promise of some OPEC officials that the cartel would consider
increasing production before their Nov. 12 meeting if prices got
out of control. Mexico, which is not a member of OPEC, said it
would increase production by up to 200,000 barrels a day in the
fourth quarter if prices remain high.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe the price of oil will decline over the
next 12 months as new fields begin pumping oil and as demand
abates. But analysts have been predicting that the price of crude
oil would begin to fall again ``soon'' during much of the 20 months
the price has been rising. The prices of oil for delivery in future
months, which have been lower than the current month price, have
also been a bad forecaster. The price for crude oil for January
delivery is now $32.87 a barrel. It was $28 a barrel two months
ago.  &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's intention to stabilize the market backfired in large
measure because of the uncertainty about how much so-called new oil
will enter pipelines. Statistics on worldwide oil production,
including OPEC's, are estimates at best, and industry analysts
believe that OPEC produced anywhere from 650,000 barrels to 750,000
barrels a day above the official quota it set at its June meeting,
with most of the extra oil coming from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to quash speculation that the 800,000-barrel rise in
quotas would include current overproduction, OPEC Secretary General
Rilwanu Lukman told a press conference on Monday that the entire
increase would be new.
</P>
<P>
   But most market experts remained skeptical, given that only
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and perhaps Iran now have
the spare capacity to increase output. All other OPEC countries and
their allies such as Norway and Mexico were at or very near maximum
capacity even before the 800,000-barrel increase was negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by the end of the year, if not by October, new oil should
be flowing. Most oil-producing countries, whether members of OPEC
or not, are scrambling to bring new fields on line to take
advantage of soaring prices. ``All the OPEC countries are bringing
new production on line,'' said Roger Diwan, managing director of
the Petroleum Finance Co., a Washington consulting group. ``We
think that by the end of the year, there should be about 500,000 to
700,000 barrels a day of new oil from OPEC.''
</P>
<P>
   Such forecasts are cold comfort to today's market. Adding to the
low inventory problem is the fact that domestic refineries are
running at about 95 percent of capacity, and many are shutting down
for a few weeks in the autumn for seasonal maintenance. The OPEC
crude, because it is heavier in sulfur, is also not the preferred
source of heating oil. ``If this is a problem of heating oil and
refined products in the U.S., I don't know how more crude oil will
help,'' one European analyst said.  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Krenare Abazaga fled Kosovo with her family two years
ago. Things were bad. Her best friend was killed by the Serbs. But
backstage last night in her adopted homeland of the Bronx,
surrounded by a fog of hair spray and glitter and cigarette smoke,
her hair piled in swirls, Abazaga, 16, was not just a refugee.
</P>
<P>
   She was contestant No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody like to kill us, to take our culture and our
language,'' she said as she adjusted her green-and-yellow dress
with the scoop neck. ``But we are still alive and we are proud of
ourselves. It's something that I like to tell the whole world, that
even though we had to separate and go all over the world, we have
come back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Beauty pageants have always been patriotic affairs, but at the
first Miss Albania U.S.A. Pageant in New York, at Lehman High
School, the fervor got a little intense at times.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, when 2 of the 13 contestants, Violeta Nikci
and Elona Prela, marched out carrying the Albanian and American
flags and placed them next to each other, the noise from the 400 or
so spectators jamming the auditorium nearly drowned out the
thundering drumbeats from the recorded martial music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I miss my country so much, the Albanian flag replaces it
somehow,'' Prela, 18, said earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The pageant's organizer, Shureta Povataj, said: ``Because of the
war that's happening, we're trying to restore people's dreams. To
try to bring some attention to the brighter side.''
</P>
<P>
   Povataj, 27, who runs the Midtown showroom of the decorator F.
Schumacher and Co., said she got the idea for the pageant when she
went to Kosovo last October to fulfill her father's dying wish:
that he be buried in the village where he was born, near Pec.
</P>
<P>
   ``I experienced a lot of what the refugees are seeing, homes
burned to the ground, the massive graves,'' she said. ``My
relatives, when they were trying to comfort me, were saying, `At
least your father was able to die naturally, no one massacred him,
you were able to bury him in one piece.' It was very sad. But I
felt proud that people were moving on in life, that with all the
destruction that has occurred, they had the will to move on and
rebuild their homes and their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The contestants, who ranged in age from 16 to 24 and live mostly
in the Bronx, home to about 30,000 Albanian-Americans, were vying
for a $3,000 prize and a slot in the Miss Albania contest in
Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   Povataj said she was trying to strike a blow for the liberation
of young Albanian-American women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albanian culture is very conservative,'' she said, ticking off
the restrictions that Albanian girls in this country chafe against.
Makeup and dating are discouraged, tight clothes considered
scandalous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to break that barrier, and have parents accept that
it's OK to be fashionable, OK to look pretty,'' Povataj explained,
``that there's nothing wrong with your daughter being in a pageant
and showing off her beauty. She's not committing a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Povataj, who recruited contestants through ads in local
Albanian newspapers and over the Internet, said, ``We had
contestants back out because their families were against it.''
</P>
<P>
   The father of one contestant, Erjona Boshnjaku, 17, did not want
her to take part. ``At first my father said, `No way, why do you
want to do that?''' Boshnjaku said. ``But everyone else in my
family disagreed. I wanted to do this to show who I am, and my
personality, and to show I'm proud to be Albanian.''
</P>
<P>
   If it seems odd to think of beauty pageants as a force of
women's emancipation, consider that when the Miss America Pageant
began in 1921, the year after women won the right to vote, it was
considered dangerous and subversive and drew protests from
religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   For all its revolutionary ideology, last night's pageant was
pretty old-fashioned. The girls paraded across the stage carrying
torches. They answered questions about what Albania meant to them,
and spoke of their hopes and dreams. Abazaga, a student at Lehman,
said she wanted to go to college ``and help my country and my
friends and everyone in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In between events, the dressing room was a flurry of grooming
and teasing and cursing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hair looks terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You messed up the dance.''
</P>
<P>
   All that was missing was the bathing-suit competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the community doesn't like to show the girls in
bikinis,'' said the producer, Dajan Sukai. ``Next year they will
trust me for this thing, but this year we have to be serious.''
</P>
<P>
   As the girls came out in Albanian red and black _ red T-shirts
tied at the side and emblazoned with the national symbol, a
two-headed lion, and black short-shorts _ the audience hooted and
shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our flag, our culture,'' said Mark Krasniqi, 24, a real
estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the evening, when Prela, whose career aspiration
is to become Miss America, was crowned queen, the place exploded in
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy!'' the winner gushed, then she marched the
Albanian flag around the stage one more time.

SEARS NAMES LACY CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. has named Alan J. Lacy, a financial
trouble-shooter, to succeed Arthur C. Martinez as president and
chief executive, effective Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy, 46, who climbed the executive ladder after he stanched
losses in the company's credit card business, will add the title of
chairman when Martinez, 60, retires in December. Lacy told analysts
Monday during a conference call that he would build on Sears' core
strengths in retail, after-sale service and credit by ``doing fewer
things better.''
</P>
<P>
   He will take over at a time when the big retailer hopes to
exploit the departure of the Circuit City chain from the home
appliance business. Analysts said Sears, based in Hoffman Estates,
Ill., already had 38 percent of the home appliance market.
Appliance sales helped Sears gain 5.6 percent in sales at stores
open at least a year in August, a lackluster month for many
retailers as clothing sales faltered.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts, who became familiar with Lacy when he was
chief financial officer at Sears in the mid-1990s, praised the
company's choice of an insider for the top position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an excellent, realistic person,'' said Michael Exstein,
a retailing analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``He has seen
the consequences of overreaching in the credit and service
businesses at Sears and he has been able to right many of those
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sears ran into trouble by joining the rush to sign up credit
card customers who, in many cases, were unable to pay their bills.
It has written off losses and tightened its cardholder
requirements, Exstein noted. In the service business, Sears can try
to attract former customers of Circuit City while mainly attending
to its own appliance customers.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Church, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said Sears
would ``continue to lead with their best punch, the home area.''
The goal is to attract young women and young families to the stores
by emphasizing home furnishings, appliances, home electronics,
tools and children's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Sears is experimenting with home goods specialty stories that it
calls The Great Indoors, but analysts said it was too soon to
forecast their prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Sears is the third big retailer this summer to announce a new
chief executive. On May 31, Kmart selected Charles Conaway, who had
been president of the CVS pharmacy chain. On July 27, J.C. Penney
announced the appointment of Allen L. Questrom, chief executive of
Barneys New York and former head of Federated Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy joined the company in 1994 as a senior vice president after
holding finance and strategic planning jobs at Philip Morris and
its Kraft General Foods unit. He was chief financial officer and
executive vice president of Sears from 1995 to 1997, then president
of the credit unit for two years, before adding responsibility for
home services, customer responses and Internet business as
president of services.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who has been chairman and chief executive since 1995,
announced his retirement plans last March. A former executive at
Saks Fifth Avenue, he joined Sears as head of its troubled retail
operations in 1992. Investors applauded as he cut costs,
discontinued the famous but money-losing Sears catalog, closed 100
stores and eliminated 50,000 jobs. The company now has 860
department stores and 2,100 specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
   But Sears stock began to slide in mid-1998 as Wal-Mart, Target
and other discount stores offered low prices on household goods,
and clothing chains like Gap and Ann Taylor captured apparel
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, which has lost almost half its stock value over the last
two years, rose 50 cents Monday, to $35.25, on the New York Stock
Exchange.  &QL;

CALIFORNIA ENACTS NATION'S MOST GENEROUS STUDENT AID PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ California on Monday enacted the most generous
college financial aid plan in the nation, guaranteeing needy high
school students with good grades that it will pay their full
tuition at the state's public colleges and universities, or offer
close to $10,000 a year toward tuition at one of the state's
private institutions. The plan will cost the state more than $1
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with a $12 billion budget surplus and fighting years of
declines in its once-proud public education system, California will
have by far the largest and most financially comprehensive student
aid program for graduating high school seniors, with what amounts
to a new entitlement program nearly twice the size of a similar
program in New York State, for example, and about one-third of the
total spending by all states on student grants and aid combined.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal passed both houses of the State Legislature
unanimously last month, and in signing it Monday on the Los Angeles
campus of the California State University, Gov. Gray Davis
pronounced it ``a historic day for higher education.'' Indeed, the
measure sails against the recent trend in scholarship programs,
including another signed Monday by Davis, that are focused on tax
credits or academic performance without regard to financial need,
which have tended to help middle-class families most.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the so-called Cal-Grants, a vast expansion of a program
that has been in place since 1956, blend merit and financial need.
Starting next year, any high school senior in the state with a
``B'' average who lives in a family of four earning $64,000 a year
or less would qualify for free tuition at any public university in
the state, or $9,700 toward tuition at a private one. Even ``C''
students from families earning less than $34,000 a year would
receive $1,500 a year for living costs and books, intended to help
them catch up at local community colleges and qualify to go on for
four-year degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What California said today was need still matters,'' said
Travis Reindl, a policy analyst at the American Association of
State Colleges and Universities in Washington. ``For the last seven
years, with the emphasis on accountability in education, the
emphasis has been on merit. This says let's look at the need and
merit combined.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials did not hesitate to call the program, which is
expected to cover almost one-third of all graduating high school
seniors, about 100,000 students a year, an entitlement, akin to
Medicare or Social Security, though Davis, a moderate Democrat and
staunch fiscal conservative, did not use that word. He had proposed
a separate measure, also signed into law today, that will award
$118 million a year in merit scholarships of $1,000 to the top 10
percent of scorers in each high school on the Stanford 9
standardized achievement test and $2,500 to the highest performers
on Advanced Placement exams in math and science.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative critics had said that would tend to favor
middle-class students, and the governor eventually bowed to
bipartisan pressure from both houses, which agreed to pass the
bills as a package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to emphasize,'' Davis said Monday, ``these bills are
not a free ride. They are a fair reward for extraordinary
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' interim secretary of education, John Mockler, said in an
interview: ``The beauty of it is you can say to every kid in high
school: You do your part and get the grades and income is not going
to be a deterrent to your going to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1970s, the state offered free tuition to its higher
education system. But it has not had enough money in recent years
to offer Cal-Grants to all students whose grades and family incomes
would make them eligible. When Davis took office two years ago, the
program was spending about $400 million a year, one-third the
amount it will now spend, and last year only about 55,000 of the
137,000 students eligible for aid received it. California ranks
39th in the nation in college-going, with just over half its
high-school graduates going on to college, compared with the
national average of close to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have similar programs, including New York's Tuition
Assistance Program, which provides about $700 million in annual aid
to needy students and was previously the most generous state
program, according to Reindl of the Association of State Colleges
and Universities. But its maximum annual grant is $5,000, and it
fully covers tuition for only the poorest families.
</P>
<P>
   ``This catapults California into the lead,'' Reindl said. Reindl
warned that the risk of creating such a new entitlement is that it
would face intense pressure in lean budgetary years. ``This is a
huge financial commitment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nani Escudero, 19, and Nicolette Birdsong-Gibson, 24, both
juniors at California State at Los Angeles who say they could not
have afforded tuition without the Cal-Grants, said Monday that the
expanded program will greatly help them to persuade other high
school students to apply to college. Both work as interns in local
high schools, answering students' questions about college
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come on a lot of situations where kids say, `I don't want to
go to college,''' said Escudero, whose father, a mechanic, died in
her senior year of high school, ``and I ask why not, and they say,
`I can't afford it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Birdsong-Gibson added: ``Cost is always the major thing. I know
a lot of students with good grades who just don't believe they can
afford it. This should really help.''
</P>
<P>
   John Burton of San Francisco, the Democratic president pro tem
of the State Senate, who pressed hard for the measure, called it
``the biggest thing since popcorn,'' adding: ``What this says to
poor kids in high school is no longer can they say to themselves,
`Why should I study? I ain't going to go anywhere anyway because my
family can't afford it.' It's like the G.I. Bill was.''

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The case of Wen Ho Lee may be resolved, now that
the government has dropped all but one indictment against him. But
the problems underlying the case are unlikely to disappear, and the
government must rethink how it resolves the central conflict
between democratic principles and national security.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese-Americans were quite right to raise alarms about ethnic
profiling in weapons laboratories. The accusations of racism and
ethnic targeting of foreign-born scientists have poisoned the
atmosphere at the National Security Agency and the national
laboratories, including Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore.
Asian-Americans have been leaving the labs, partly because of
higher salaries offered elsewhere, but also because they are
worried about discrimination and heavy-handed new security
measures.
</P>
<P>
   In our laudable determination to avoid racial profiling,
however, we must not damage our national security by painting a
benign picture of China's espionage techniques. It is an
established fact that China tries to recruit ethnic Chinese in the
United States, particularly those who may be vulnerable to
seduction, payoffs, appeals to Chinese nationalism and, in some
cases, coercion. A 361-page book put out by China's intelligence
office in 1991, and obtained by the Far Eastern Economic Review,
described how China maintains a thorough system of gathering
intelligence abroad for military purposes, aimed primarily at the
United States. Rep. Christopher Cox of California updated this
information in his 1999 report on China's espionage efforts. In the
spy business, targeting ethnic groups is widespread; the Soviets
went after Russian emigres for years.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Eftimiades in his 1994 book ``Chinese Intelligence
Operations'' describes China's efforts to collect technology _
information on night vision equipment, blueprints for F-14 fighter
aircraft, for example _ from ethnic Chinese agents in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   China has been accused of recruiting agents in a number of
cases. In 1985, Larry Wu-Tai Chin, a CIA analyst, was charged with
passing secrets to the Chinese Government for 40 years (he
committed suicide in jail). Peter Lee, an American scientist at
TRW, was accused of passing submarine detection technology to
China. Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles said they wanted to
charge Lee with espionage but were unable to, partly because Navy
officials in Washington would not allow testimony about the
technology in an open courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Cox report states that Johnny Chung, a
Chinese-American at the center of the campaign finance controversy
involving the Democratic Party, was given $300,000 by two Chinese
military officials in a purported attempt to acquire American
technology and to help the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fact that China tries to recruit spies doesn't
mean that Chinese-Americans as a group should be suspect. When Cox
released his report, he said the Energy Department had demonized
Wen Ho Lee, and his study did not mention the Los Alamos scientist.
</P>
<P>
   To catch any spy requires good investigative work. Chinese
intelligence methods are complex and arcane, and special skills and
experience are needed to detect them. What seems to be missing on
our side is the painstaking, timely investigative use of wiretaps,
computer access, independent surveillance and informers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the government prematurely leveled a 59-point indictment
at Wen Ho Lee, Chinese-Americans have been harassed and evidence
has disappeared. What is needed to regain trust among
Asian-Americans are fair, scrupulous and professional
investigations; we cannot allow poorly handled cases to alienate a
segment of our population.

 By JANE SMILEY    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago at a party, I asked a woman I had just met how
her Christmas had been. She said, ``First good Christmas in 25
years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why was that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my father died.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that made it good?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, every year for 25 years, he would gather us all around
the Christmas tree and tell us how terrible his life was and how
disappointed he was in everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How did your mother feel, though?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, she was relieved. He'd been telling her for 60 years that
she wasn't pretty or smart enough for him. Now she's planning to do
some of the things she's wanted to do all along.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought this was an excellent example of a
thank-God-for-divorce tale. Here's another one: When the
grandfather of a friend of mine died, his last words to his wife of
50 years were, ``I'm sorry I married you.''
</P>
<P>
   I admit that I am susceptible to such tales. I am the poster
child for the study by Judith Wallerstein et al. of the long-term
effects of divorce on children _ the child of parents who parted
before I was a year old and divorced by the time I was 4. I have
been divorced uncountable times (well, three).
</P>
<P>
   Bad habits? Bad choices? Perhaps it is time to subject myself to
Wallersteinian analysis. But when I do my own little survey, and
come up with the marital histories of my 32 closest friends and
relatives, the picture grows more complex. All of the 32 are baby
boomers or a bit older _ oldest, 58, youngest, 40. Twenty-six are
the offspring of long-term first marriages that ended in the death
of one spouse or the other; six of them come from divorced
families.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 26 whose parents had long-term marriages, 17 have been
divorced at least once.
</P>
<P>
   What does my mini-survey tell me? It tells me the same thing
that any cursory review of the last 50 years of married life in
America tells us _ most baby boomers were born into intact
families. On the surface nearly all adhered to the ideal: Dad
earned enough money so that Mom could stay home and take care of
the 3.2 children and the house. Marital roles were divided by
gender, and Mom was regularly advised by Ann Landers and Abigail
Van Buren, not to mention everyone else, to cater to Dad's sense of
privileged masculinity: (Should she iron his shorts? If he didn't
give her any money of her own, was it permissible to take it out of
his pockets while he was sleeping? If, when she was doing the
laundry, she found lipstick on his collar, should she mention it?)
</P>
<P>
   And most baby boomers, learning how to be married, as
Wallerstein suggests, by witnessing the examples of marriage that
they grew up with, voted with their feet when the time came to
endure or not in their own.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six boomers from 26 intact marriages. Seventeen divorced.
That's about 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the goals of marriage have changed. In the first
half of the century people married to survive, reproduce, join
properties, become a part of the mainstream community of adults.
Individual happiness might have been foreseen and desired, but if
as the marriage wore on happiness came to seem elusive, other goals
dominated. Some marriages did work on both levels: several of my
divorced peers had parents whose marriages I know to have been
happy, compatible and peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons for their parents' marital longevity,
though, the children in my group did not learn from their example
how to choose their own partners wisely or how to stick with it, as
Wallerstein would have expected. Some who were divorced chose to
try again, and have found happiness. Others in second or third
marriages have not. The person I know whose parents had the
longest, happiest marriage recently wrote me: ``We plug along.'' A
thank-God-for-divorce tale, midlife version.
</P>
<P>
   Americans born since mid-century marry for the same reason they
do anything else _ to be happy. Yet literature of all periods tells
us that marrying to be happy is at best an iffy proposition.
Historians of domestic life have suggested that marriages in the
premodern period were usually short _ death did the work of
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Marrying with the overriding goal of being happy for all your
adult life with a single other (since survival, reproduction,
property joining and being part of a community of adults can be
achieved now without marriage) is a new experiment. Divorce is its
corollary. This is an experiment that our children will engage in,
whatever models we give them.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce is a right that took many generations to gain. It is no
more a guarantor of happiness than marriage, but also no less. The
rate of divorce in our country tells us very little other than that
our culture is in transition to new ways of organizing itself.
Given the social and technological changes of the past century,
this can hardly be surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, in spite of the testaments of the Wallersteinians,
I'm glad my parents divorced, and I have been since I first began
to actually think about it. I can't speak for my children, but I do
hope they try more than one way of being happy, rather than turning
around at 84 and saying, ``Free at last.''

 By ROBERT WRIGHT    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ United Nations meetings are famous for
accomplishing nothing concrete, and some observers have cited last
week's millennium forum as a prime example. Still,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan could rightly claim that he gained a
measure of support for one of his most ambitious and controversial
proposals: that the United Nations regularly intervene in civil
wars when the human stakes are high. President Clinton came as
close as he has come to endorsing the idea, and other leaders
embraced, in vaguer terms, a toughened U.N. role in imploding
states.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Annan's idea sometimes argue that intervening in
intrastate conflict is no great departure from the United Nation's
founding doctrines _ that the Charter of 1945 leaves plenty of room
for reaching inside a nation to stop slaughter or the widespread
abuse of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   As Annan himself put it when he unveiled the idea last year,
``Nothing in the Charter precludes a recognition that there are
rights beyond borders.'' Maybe not, but for practical purposes this
sentence comes pretty close: ``Nothing contained in the present
Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters
which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any
state.''
</P>
<P>
   As an unabashed one-worlder, I don't mean to say that the United
Nations should never intervene in a civil war, or that there is no
conceivable legal basis for doing so. The Charter is a sometimes
ambiguous document, and, rather as the U.S. Supreme Court
ultimately decides what the Constitution means, the Security
Council decides what qualifies as a threat to ``international peace
and security'' _ the threshold that justifies the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that the United Nations was designed to
stop war between nations, not within them. Those who want a
systematic broadening of this mandate would do well first to ponder
the logic behind the more modest aims of the organization's
founders. Otherwise, they could wind up further damaging its
perilously low credibility.
</P>
<P>
   One virtue of the founders' focus on interstate conflict is the
relative ease of assigning blame: any nation that violates another
nation's border is subject to collective retaliation. Sometimes, to
be sure, identifying the bad guys in internal conflicts is
similarly simple. (When men are hacking off the arms of children,
raping women and looting homes, that's a clue.) But often things
are murkier. So the consistent punishment of transgressors is even
harder in intrastate wars than in interstate wars.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, actually administering the punishment is no picnic in
either case. But, with interstate wars, it has gotten easier. The
evolution of ``smart'' weapons, by letting an advanced military
force wreak massive damage while sustaining little, has lowered a
longstanding barrier to fulfilling the U.N.'s mission: the
reluctance of even right-minded nations to risk lives when their
territory isn't immediately threatened.
</P>
<P>
   These smart bombs and missiles are much less valuable in the
usual internal conflict. Witness their mixed record in the Kosovo
intervention. Yes, they brought Slobodan Milosevic to his knees by
decimating Serbia's infrastructure. But they had little effect in
Kosovo itself, where the enemy possessed no distinct, sizable
territory and no fixed industrial base _ where, in short, the enemy
resembled the enemy in many intrastate wars.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Charter's focus on interstate war was due partly to
political reality: the need to get the Charter signed in the first
place. It is one thing for a nation to agree not to fight another
nation except in self-defense. It is another thing to agree that,
should internal rebellion arise, the government's response will be
subject to Security Council approval. This tension persists.
Nations that face internal turmoil _ Russia, for example _ may not
back the United Nations in halting transborder aggression if they
consider a strong United Nations a threat within their borders.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the main reason the founders of the United Nations
focused on interstate conflict was their memory of the immediate
past: four years of horrendous world war. But they were also moved
by images of the future: a nuclear world in which war among nations
could make World War II look like a dustup. It is easy to forget,
especially in good economic times, that we still live in such a
world.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that reaching the essential goal of the United
Nations _ collective action to stop cross-border wars _ is more
practical now than during the Cold War. The rollback of Iraqi
aggression in the Persian Gulf war, explicitly authorized by
Security Council vote, showed as much. Still, even this challenge
is hardly mastered. Milosevic's orchestration of savagery in Bosnia
was technically a case of transborder aggression, since Bosnia had
gained its sovereignty and joined the United Nations, but his
campaign met no forceful international resistance for years.
</P>
<P>
   If world leaders want the United Nations to address intrastate
conflict seriously, that's fine with me. But they should brace
themselves. This will involve, for starters, a standing U.N. army
(perhaps an all-volunteer army, to make casualties politically
tolerable at the national level). It will involve not just
``peacekeeping,'' but peacemaking _ deciding who the bad guys are
and then killing them until a white flag appears.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it will involve picking fights carefully. To define a
goal of suppressing all intrastate war is, for both political and
military reasons, hopelessly unrealistic, a recipe for the further
loss of U.N. credibility. And credibility could be crucial when it
comes time to perform the original mission _ to prevent or halt
transborder aggression in, say, the now-nuclear South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humanitarian intervention'' is the name for U.N. involvement
in intrastate wars. But preventing interstate war is also
humanitarian. The founding, thoroughly humanitarian insight of the
United Nations is that, in a nuclear world, ending war between
nations is job one. Today _ when, for the first time in history,
that goal may be reachable _ it would be a shame to lose sight of
it.

 &HT;    Olympic drama will be played out against a dazzling, exotic
backdrop.

<P>
   SYDNEY _ Welcome to the Olympics of Oz.
</P>
<P>
   These Games Down Under, the first of the new millennium, promise
to be strange, magical and wondrous even by Olympic standards.
Marion Jones, Michael Johnson, Maurice Greene, a pack of great
swimmers and thousands of the best athletes from around the globe
are poised to put on a riveting, heart-swelling and heart-tugging
show, the likes of which are staged only once every four years. The
Summer Olympics command world-wide attention like nothing else in
or outside of sports, and this time around the drama will be played
out against a dazzling and exotic backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Oz is an Aussie nickname for their homeland. We're not talking
an HBO show, but a real penal colony experiment begun in 1788 when
11 ships of Britain's First Fleet sailed into the harbor here. This
same port can now glisten as brightly as any Emerald City,
especially when fireworks are cascading over the sail-shaped Sydney
Opera House, as they will when these Olympics begin.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, once a cultural backwater, is now a teeming, bustling,
beach-going, partying polyglot of Pacific cultures. With four
million souls Sydney has more than one-fifth of Australia's
population of 19 million. Oz has about as many people as does
Texas, housed on an arid land mass the size of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic citizens here are hoping that Jacques Rogge was
right when he proudly announced, ``Sydney is ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogge is head of the International Olympic Committee's Sydney
Co-Ordination Committee. Deep down he's got to be about as nervous
as a 100-meter sprinter eyeing Greene while waiting for the
starter's gun to shatter the hush. Just a mere century ago the
modern Olympics were the small, quixotic dream of Frenchman Baron
Pierre de Coubertin, who wanted to bring the youth of the world
together in friendly amateur athletic competition to be faster,
higher and stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes are certainly that these days, although they are
also older and sometimes quite rich. Under the reign of current IOC
head Juan Antonio Samaranch the Olympics have embraced
professionals and the TV-ratings-swelling concept of the best vs.
the best.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch was spotted Saturday impatiently waiting for a bus
that never arrived. His Olympics have become so popular, so grand
and so large that they can now make the most advanced of cities and
countries look inept as they did in the summer of 1996, when only
residents of Atlanta clung to the notion that the city hadn't been
brought to its knees by the enormity of the event.
</P>
<P>
   This time around there's even a couple of quirks to add to the
typical Olympic madness. These Summer Games are almost the winter
games. Australia, in the southern hemisphere, is just coming into
spring. Mornings are so brisk you might need to rub your hands
together for warmth. Days warm quickly as the sun rises in an azure
sky to beat down on palm trees and squawking birds right out of an
old-fashioned jungle movie. But still the temperature never gets
much above 70 degrees and blustery winds seem to kick up in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   That's afternoon here, which would be perhaps the witching hour
in the U.S.'s Central Time zone. Australia lies across the
International Dateline from the U.S., and there's an eight-hour
difference from our time zone. Preliminaries that are run early in
the morning here fall in the evening of the previous day in the
U.S. Nightly finals here wind up finishing on the same day in the
U.S., but in the early morning hours when only people working the
graveyard shift are awake. That kind of time warp is why, even with
all the TV coverage in the U.S., not a single minute of the drama
will be televised live. The warp here will be in the strained
transportation system, as residents have been warned that typical
one-hour trips may stretch to three hours or beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Some Australians fear the worst and have already headed out of
town for the duration. Others remain lukewarm to some events, such
as volleyball, where at last count there were 96,000 unsold
tickets. The Aussies are even downplaying their own medal hopes,
lest they be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   That attempt at distance should last less than a day, once the
Olympic competition begins. The first medal event, the women's
triathlon, is one strategically placed to get the residents of Oz
into a flag-waving frenzy. The U.S. has its own hopes in
triathlon's Olympic debut, led by San Antonio native Jennifer
Gutierrez, who has vowed to swim with the sharks that sometimes
infest the harbor. But the Aussies plan to have something even more
unsettling, a staggering one million fans lining the swimming,
running and cycling course. They're thinking of a gold, silver and
bronze sweep right out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   From there the main action will quickly shift to the dazzling
18,200-seat Sydney International Aquatic Center, one of the
facilities that makes the Olympic Park here arguably the greatest
collection of athletic facilities in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The battle to rule the pool will have a pronounced Aussies vs.
U.S. theme, one that will replace the old Cold War conflict between
the Eastern Bloc and the U.S. that used to emotionally drive the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Aussies chanted, ``Carter's a wanker!'' at a
spirited U.S.-Australia basketball exhibition game at Melbourne,
they were just trying to get NBA star Vince Carter to miss a few
free throws. They don't dislike the U.S., or its athletes, they
just would relish dishing out a little comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   In no sport has the U.S. more dominant than in swimming. The
last time the Olympics were held in Australia in 1956 at Melbourne,
the Aussies won more medals than the U.S. in swimming. No one here
has forgotten that fact. At the recent U.S. Swimming Trials in
Indianapolis there were Australian coaches actually comparing times
with those of their own swimmers and scoring it like a mock dual
meet.
</P>
<P>
   The resurgent Australians have teenage sensation Ian Thorpe.
Propelled by size 16 flippers, Thorpe is thought by bookies here to
be almost as unbeatable as Carter and the rest of the USA Dream
Team of hoopsters. One of the swimmers who'll try to sink the
Thorpedo is the most decorated male athlete of the last Olympics,
three-time gold medal-winner Josh Davis. The Austin resident and
Texas ex will face Thorpe in the 200 meters and figures to anchor a
4X200 meter team that could include current UT swimmers Scott
Goldblatt, Jamie Rauch and Nate Dusing, one that's a decided
underdog to the Aussies.
</P>
<P>
   A much stronger event for the U.S. will be the 100-meter
backstroke where Lenny Krazelberg and Austin's Neil Walker are
expected to medal. Walker is also given a strong shot in the 100
meters, along with the talented Gary Hall. As for the Aussies,
they're looking forward to the 1,500 meter freestyle. Really. A
distance that doesn't produce much more than yawns in the U.S. is
being touted as the biggest thing of these Olympics, a showdown
between Australia's Kieren Perkins and Grant Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   As for the U.S., eyes there will focus on Jones once the track
competition begins midway through the Olympics. Johnson will be
defending his 400-meter crown and Greene will be racing for the
title of World's Fastest Human, but neither is on a quest like
Jones. Ms. Jones, as she's known in Nike ads, is going for an
unprecedented five gold medals. If this is Oz, she's Dorothy.
</P>
<P>
   Jones looked like something out of the 22nd century when she was
decked out in a Swift Suit for the September 11 issue of Newsweek.
One of the cover lines there, ``The Drug Game,'' unfortunately
applies to these Olympics. In spite of hopes and promises
beforehand, tests are still not in place to detect human growth
hormone, rumored to be the drug of choice in the Atlanta Games, and
a host of other performance enhancing drugs that will allow
cheaters to fly beneath the radar of official drug police here.
</P>
<P>
   Once again the Olympics will leave some wondering what was real
and what was a drug-aided illusion. But that never seems to foil
the drama, which is now about to unfold in Oz.

IN WAKE OF KNIGHT FIRING, PLAYERS THREATEN TO LEAVE INDIANA 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indiana University's campus was rainy and calm Monday after a
night of angry demonstrations over Bobby Knight's ouster and
threats against the student whose accusations were a factor in the
dismissal of the legendary basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   But there were signs of more potential fallout from the end of
Knight's three-decade reign at Indiana. Several players demanded
that one of Knight's assistants, either Mike Davis or John Treloar,
be hired as the interim coach; if one of the assistants is not
hired, they said, they will leave the university. Other players,
including Dane Fife, a junior guard, said they were considering
leaving anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things work out the way we want it, we'll stay,'' forward
George Leach, a sophomore, told The Associated Press. ``We are
ready to go if they don't meet our demands. Indiana will not have a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The players' reactions underscored the intense loyalty Knight
inspired. All were somber and some were teary at the news
conference Sunday when Myles Brand, the university's president,
announced Knight's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   When Davis, one of the assistant coaches, was asked Sunday if he
would stay, he said: ``Coach brought me here; he gave me this job.
Whatever Coach tells me to do, whatever the players say, I'm going
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some rabid fans among the students had a similar reaction that
night, calling for the resignation of Brand instead of the
dismissal of Knight, who has a history of abusive behavior.
Thousands of students marched to Brand's home on campus Sunday
night, chanting ``Hey, hey, ho, ho, Myles Brand has got to go,''
while police officers in riot gear watched.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators also handed out flyers with a picture of Kent
Harvey, the freshman who had lodged the most recent complaint
against Knight, with a caption reading: ``Wanted. Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Horns blared across campus. Signs and banners appeared on
dormitories and fraternities. One read ``Bob Knight is God,'' and
another said, ``Knight 4 President.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the protests, Knight met with his team. He then
appeared outside Assembly Hall and addressed a throng of student
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next couple of days, I'm going to get together
somewhere with as many students who want to come out, and then I'm
going to tell you my side of this thing,'' the 59-year-old coach
said. ``And I think you'll be interested in hearing it.''
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing Knight, Brand cited a pattern of ``uncivil,
defiant and unacceptable'' behavior since May that culminated last
week with Harvey's accusation that Knight had manhandled him and
verbally abused him. Knight accosted Harvey because he had failed
to use an honorific when he spoke to the coach, saying only: ``Hey,
Knight, what's up?''
</P>
<P>
   But Brand stressed that the incident with Harvey was just one of
many transgressions by Knight since the university gave him an
ultimatum last May to control his behavior or face dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   On campus Monday, some students expressed anger over Knight's
departure, while others were indifferent or supported Brand's
decision. The ugliness of Sunday night's protests seemed to have
blown over. The campus was full of glum faces and an almost
funereal quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for a campus bus, Micheala Karr, a senior, rolled her
eyes when asked about Knight. ``I didn't come here because of I.U.
basketball,'' she said. ``Anyone who is thinking of leaving I.U.
because of this has whacked-up priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Burton, a graduate student in music, said it was ``time
for Bob Knight to move on, anyway.'' Burton said the protests had
disgusted him. ``That was only a small percentage of the students
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Matt McGregor, a senior, said a less authoritarian coach might
do a better job. ``President Brand did what he had to do,'' he
said. ``I like Bobby Knight, but I'm not sure we could win a
championship under him in this era.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students said they expected many fans to boycott the
season. ``I think a lot of people are going to protest and not buy
tickets,'' Courtney Clark, a junior, said.
</P>
<P>
   Even students who had protested said they were resigned to
losing the coach. Joe Ryan, a junior, said Knight and the
basketball program were one of the main reasons he had chosen the
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most students realize it is a lost cause,'' Ryan said.
``He is already fired.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Hoosier fans said they felt something irretrievably
precious had been lost. ``Bobby Knight is like a god here,'' said
Ian Kara Novich, who described himself as a lifelong Hoosier
fanatic. ``It's not going to be the same.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Quietly, Rocker putting together a solid season
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - In the pro-wrestling dream scenario, John Rocker
spends the 2000 season lifting hitters high over his head and
dumping them at home plate. The umpire declares them down for the
count with a thrust of the right fist, and Rocker gets to growl at
his detractors, his fans and anyone else who can't seem to turn
away.
</P>
<P>
   But Rocker could not stage his baseball season. The reality made
him far from a superhero responding to his infamous Sports
Illustrated story. Instead, it hurt his accuracy with the baseball,
sent him to the minors briefly and split a callous on his thumb.
Now, though, it's September, and Rocker is back to saving the day.
He is throwing strikes, dominating hitters and giving the Braves
the security of facing the Mets six times in their last 19 games
with their closer back. Since Aug. 15, Rocker is six for six in
save opportunities. He now has 20 saves, 10th in the National
League, despite just two each in June and July. And his control
problems finally have subsided. He walked 10 batters in seven
innings over his first eight appearances of August, but in nine
outings since Aug. 16 he hasn't walked anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's throwing strikes again,'' Bobby Cox said. ``His
fastball's clicking, and his curve is good at times. When both are
going, he's almost unhittable, like Randy Johnson. He's working
himself into that form.'' Pitching coach Leo Mazzone points to an
adjustment Rocker made after a film session the two had several
weeks ago. They looked at video of his delivery from this time last
year and compared it with his delivery in early August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, he was much more relaxed on the back side of his
delivery,'' Mazzone said. ``This year, he'd been much more tense.
That's a result of trying to make a pitch do more than you can,
throw harder than you can, throw a breaking ball sharper than you
can and have better control than you have. It takes away from
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker thinks a lot of it has to do with the healing of his
callous and the resulting regular work on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I would make an adjustment within a couple days.
This year, it's been a gradual thing,'' said Rocker, whose ERA is
down to 3.30. ``I'm fixing it piece by piece. ... I'm still on the
verge of having an extremely solid year. (If I end up with) 25
saves and a 2.90 ERA and the team wins, it can still be a very good
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker estimates that 80 percent of his challenge has been
mechanical and 20 percent mental.
</P>
<P>
   What has gotten him through that 20 percent? ``Just time,''
Rocker said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who has helped him the most, Rocker said it has been
his girlfriend, Staci Sutton, daughter of Don Sutton, the TBS
broadcaster and Hall of Fame pitcher. She has been his ``sounding
board.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Braves' trip to New York in late June, the media crush
that was Rockermania has died down. He has managed to keep himself
out of the spotlight, with the exception of St. Louis, where he was
filmed bumping into a local TV cameraman, a move he said later was
unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been more careful,'' Brian Jordan said. ``As far as
changing much, not really. We know (the media attention) will flare
up again when we're in New York. We think and hope he's learned
from all he's been through, the struggles he's had. He's finally
started to calm down and pitch the way he's capable of pitching.
We're all just hoping that little reality check will keep him
grounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker takes credit for the quiet, given his pattern of telling
most members of the media to ``beat it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happened because I've made it happen,'' he said. ``I'll
blow everybody off.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has focused on blowing the baseball past hitters,
such as the Diamondbacks' Greg Colbrunn, who faced him in Arizona
when Rocker was struggling last month and again ast week when
Rocker saved his 19th game to keep Tom Glavine a winner over Randy
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw a lot of strikes (this time),'' Colbrunn said. ``When
a guy throws that hard and has that quality of stuff with good
control, he's one of the toughest pitchers to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   With two runners on, Rocker threw nine pitches to Colbrunn, only
one of which was out of the strike zone. Colbrunn fouled off
several before finally putting a ball in play to the left side of
the mound. Rocker came down off the mound, smothered the ball,
wheeled and fired to first to end the inning on the defensive play
of the night. He let out a roar Braves fans had not heard in a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how I got there, or what I had to go through, I
just expect to get there,'' Rocker said. ``I'm not going to fall
back on excuses. The way this team works, it's so focused on
winning, it's tough to excuse a guy's personal life for why he's
not performing on the field. You get paid to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to enjoy playing more again. Before, I was just
trying to survive.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In her seventh decade, Joan Kennedy, forever memorialized in the
history books and curled newspaper clippings as the drunk ex-wife
of U.S. Sen. Edward M. ``Ted'' Kennedy, seems at last to have come
into her own. Single for nearly 20 years, she has a vast network of
friends and a jammed social schedule. Apparently sober for nine
years, she has completed the course work toward a second master's
degree in education and intends to teach music in the public
schools ``when I get old.''
</P>
<P>
   A regular at the Arch Street Worker's Chapel downtown _ chosen
in part, she confesses, because ``it's near Filene's Basement'' _
she partakes in an eclectic variety of spiritual retreats and
counsels other women in Alcoholics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   There have been resurrections before, it is true, heralded by
bold headlines proclaiming her sobriety, her launching of a new
life. But each time she has fallen, Kennedy has picked herself up.
And she has been standing tall for a long time now.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Kennedy is not young anymore. She is the mother of three
and the grandmother of four, a doting, warm-and-fuzzy kind of
grandmother who hides Easter eggs and plays ``Ring Around the
Rosie'' on the piano. And all the purple eye shadow and high-heeled
black leather boots do not quite dispel a certain tiredness. If age
comes hard to a former model _ one dubbed ``The Dish'' by her
brother-in-law Jack _ it has also brought for Kennedy a certain
peace and sense of self that had long eluded her.
</P>
<P>
   It is a self curiously rooted in being a Kennedy. Nearly two
decades after her divorce, Kennedy, 63, is an integral member of
the clan, her place perhaps more certain now than it has been in
the past. Keenly aware of the potency of her name, she lends it
generously to a host of public causes and is a familiar figure on
the benefit circuit. But while Kennedy is deeply proud of the
family name, she does not abide by all the family rules. She talks
openly. She expresses deep feeling. She cries. Kennedy has never
publicly criticized her former husband and seems more bemused by
the family's failings than angry. She does not live in secret
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a relief now to be free,'' declares Kennedy. ``So
much of my married life was about keeping secrets and pretending
that I was doing great and was happy. I don't have to do that
anymore. It's such a relief to be free. To be a genuine person.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Kennedy is largely recognized for who she was in the past,
but her life is vastly different now than it once was. Watching
Kennedy power-walk along the Charles River in her jaunty blue Ryder
Club cap and stylish black leather jacket or hoisting bulky weights
with her slender legs, it is hard to remember the bad old days.
</P>
<P>
   But once upon a time, Kennedy told family secrets, and the
family was not happy. It was 40 years ago, and Joan Kennedy was the
family's luscious new showpiece in Washington, D.C. She was also a
chatty one and happily revealed to reporters that Jackie Kennedy
wore wigs. And that Jack Kennedy was unable to pick up his children
because of his bad back. The family's press operatives bore down
upon Joan Kennedy swiftly, and she quickly learned to suppress her
instinctive candor and coquettish sense of humor. In the shadow of
the hard-driving Kennedy clan, as well as her husband's notorious
womanizing, Joan Kennedy withdrew and found comfort in a vodka
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Through decades that delivered her three miscarriages, the loss
of her eldest son's leg to cancer, and a grinding post-divorce
loneliness, her drinking worsened. Three times she was arrested for
drunken driving, to explosions of publicity. The last time was in
1991, when she was found weaving along Interstate 93 In Quincy in
her blue Buick with an open vodka bottle at her side.
</P>
<P>
   Before self-help groups like AA were in vogue, Kennedy's
drinking was treated as a shameful condition, and she became
further isolated within the family. One afternoon in the late
1970s, according to ``The Kennedy Women,'' by Laurence Leamer, Ted
Kennedy led a reporter outside the couple's Squaw Island home on
Cape Cod to meet his wife. There, Joan Kennedy lay dead drunk in
the back seat of a car. In 1977, she fled the couple's McLean, Va.,
home and headed to Boston, leaving her children _ then aged 17, 15,
and 11 _ behind. The Kennedys did not divorce for five more years,
but Joan Kennedy had decided to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she hadn't changed her life, if she hadn't left Ted, she
wouldn't be the person she is today,'' says Candy McMurrey, Joan
Kennedy's sister, who lives in Houston. ``She would be dead. Dead
from drinking and the sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston seemed a curious place for her to land. Joan Bennett
Kennedy, after all, had grown up in New York and raised her
children in Washington, D.C. But Joan and Ted had lived in Boston
briefly after they were married, and Joan had a number of friends
in the area. It had a substantial arts and music community. That it
was the throbbing heart of Kennedy country was oddly comforting.
</P>
<P>
   She has lived in the same spacious Back Bay condominium with its
black-and-white-striped awning and sweeping view of the Charles
River for two decades. The apartment was originally a meeting place
for Ted and his political allies, and Joan Kennedy got it as part
of her 1982 divorce settlement, which reportedly also included $4
million and the house on Squaw Island in Hyannis Port. She has
lived alone except for several years when Patrick, her youngest son
and now a Rhode Island congressman, lived with her in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   She will not talk much about Ted, who keeps a home on
Marlborough Street just five blocks away, and she agreed to an
interview only on the condition that neither he nor their past
together be discussed. Some of the old secrets, at least, she still
keeps. Nor will Ted Kennedy talk about her.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol is also a subject Joan Kennedy does not want to discuss,
particularly the arrests for drunken driving, which she wryly
refers to as ``my famous one-nighters.'' But she does, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a drink now for nine years, and after that
amount of time, people start to forget,'' says Kennedy, ``So, I'd
rather not bring it up and have people say, 'Ohhh, Joan. Oh, yeah.
She's the alcoholic.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her new identity is one that springs from many sources. An
accomplished pianist and author of a family guide to classical
music, Kennedy is known for her narration with the Boston Pops and
is a keen supporter of both symphony and opera. From 1995 to 1999,
she served as the chairwoman of the Boston Cultural Council, which
distributes state money to local nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is an overseer at both Children's Hospital and the New
England Conservatory, a member of the Lesley College Corp., where
she received a master's degree in education. An active supporter of
the Pine Street Inn, she has shown up unannounced in the women's
wing to play the piano on several occasions, including one
Christmas Day. She was recently appointed to the board of the
President's Advisory Committee on the Arts of the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Her desk is thick with invitations to benefits and musical
events. Although she attends many, she has two categorical
priorities: fighting cancer and retardation. ``Retardation, because
it's the Kennedy thing,'' she says. ``Cancer, because of Teddy
Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is, clearly, proud of her life. While the pain of her
past has not left, ``it is not what drives her anymore. She has
moved on,'' says Pamela Humphrey, a friend who lives two blocks
away. ``She has rediscovered who she is.''
</P>
<P>
   As her son Patrick, 32, for whom she campaigns regularly,
describes it: ``I think her experience of being kind of isolated
and put into a one- dimensional role as my father's wife obviously
was very debilitating for her. Now, I think she has found ways to
express herself in areas that are of interest to her, and she has
gotten happier, particularly over the past 10 years. She has
perspective over what happened to her. She has survived.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time she fell in love, she fell fast. At 21, she was a
young woman of striking beauty and poise, easily one of the most
popular students at Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y. Reared
in a prominent Catholic family in nearby Bronxville, she had spent
summers appearing in television ads for Revlon and Coca-Cola. And
so, when a young law student named Ted Kennedy came to campus one
afternoon in 1957 to dedicate a new building _ several Kennedy
women had attended the school _ his sister Jean Smith plucked Joan
Bennett from the crowd and introduced her to her brother. They were
married the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The first several years were happy ones, flush with John F.
Kennedy's presidency and the birth of their first two children. But
Ted Kennedy's sexual wanderings, coupled with the Kennedy family's
fierce ambition, began to gnaw at Joan Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Press accounts at the time invariably used the words ``fragile''
or ``vulnerable'' to describe her. ``Oh, it made me mad,'' she
says. ``They would all write about how vulnerable I was, and
everybody felt sorry for me, because I was in a marriage that
wasn't good. If they only knew that I was so strong. I was stronger
than anyone else just to be able to survive. It was very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members also balk at the term. Eunice Shriver, the
Kennedy sister to whom Joan is perhaps closest, says, ``If fragile
means somebody who can't cope, well, Joan coped. I think she had a
life that was very demanding of her. Sometimes she had real
problems in those days. I think she never gave up. She consistently
tried to improve and overcome her problems, and eventually she did.
So that is not a person who is fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious pain of those years, Kennedy does not seem
bitter and, by most accounts, including her own, now has a cordial
relationship with her former husband. Nor does Joan Kennedy, whose
own mother had a drinking problem, seem to blame the senator for
her drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in public life, and I just had to keep everything to
myself,'' Kennedy says. ``Things I knew. I couldn't even tell my
girlfriends. ... Now that I'm well, I look back and think: How the
h-e-1-1 did I make it through.''
</P>
<P>
   And then it got worse. On a hot July night in 1969, Ted Kennedy
drove off a bridge on the island of Chappaquiddick with a young
woman named Mary Jo Kopechne sitting beside him. Kopechne drowned.
Kennedy swam to shore. But his first call was not to his wife,
according to Leamer's book, but to the blond, voluptuous model who
was his girlfriend, Helga Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Kennedy, then pregnant, played the devoted wife, clinging
to her husband's arm through the funeral and beyond. But Kennedy,
who suffered her third miscarriage the following month, knew her
marriage was a sham. After Chappaquiddick, she told Leamer, ``It
became worse. For a few months everyone had to put on this show,
and then I just didn't care anymore. I just saw no future. That's
when I truly became an alcoholic.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s were the hardest years. In 1973, Teddy Jr., then 12,
was diagnosed with cancer and had to have his right leg removed
above the knee. The following year, Joan Kennedy was charged with
drunken driving, and her license was suspended for six months.
Although public opinion had long been sympathetic to her, both
Washington social circles and the press were growing tired of her
behavior. And Kennedy knew it. ``It was time I started taking care
of myself in order for my children to be happy,'' she says. ``I
needed to get myself out of a bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kennedy, moving to Boston meant more than learning to live
on her own. For a woman who had been swaddled in privilege her
entire life, who at one time commanded a French chef, a maid, a
nanny, and a social secretary, it meant learning to take care of
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had a powerful entree into Boston's tight social circles
because of her name. That Ted Kennedy's 1980 presidential campaign
had foundered badly seemed only to add to her appeal. But when
conversations about divorce got under way in earnest after the
campaign, Joan Kennedy found herself looking into the void.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she were no longer a Kennedy, who would she be?'' recalls
close friend Cathy Beatty, who lives nearby and is married to Paul
Beatty, one of Ted Kennedy's former Harvard roommates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible time. Terrible,'' says Muffie Cabot, 65, a
friend for 40 years who was social secretary to the Reagan White
House in the early 1980s. ``But Joan is very disciplined. She kept
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, her achievements became her own, not just those
linked to her famous last name. Although both her sons believe
Kennedy has put drinking behind her, they also know how hard it has
been. ``She has made tremendous strides in addressing the fears and
insecurity she's had in her life,'' says Ted Jr., 38, a lawyer in
New Haven. ``I think she has really come a long, long way, but,
clearly, it's a lifelong struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edmund Molis, a neurologist who dated Joan Kennedy in the
mid-1990s, says that Kennedy drank several times while they were
together. Molis, 45, whose license was temporarily suspended in
1992 after he admitted to being a drug addict, says that sometimes
when he went to take Kennedy to the AA meetings they attended
together, ``she would be plastered. Dead drunk. She's in complete
denial about her drinking.'' But Molis says they broke up for other
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   When Ted Kennedy announced in 1992 that he was going to remarry,
many in Joan Kennedy's circle kept a close eye on their friend. The
old demon insecurities lurked. At 38, Victoria Reggie was
attractive and an accomplished attorney. Joan Kennedy worried to
her friends whether she would be included in Kennedy gatherings.
Would she still be a member of the family?
</P>
<P>
   She is. Eunice Shriver, for one, sees her twice a week in the
summer. But there have been some bumps. After the wedding, the
family rhythms shifted. Joan stopped going to the family home in
Virginia for Christmas, and also stopped going to Thanksgiving
dinner at the compound, at least for a while. But two years ago,
Ted Kennedy asked his daughter to see if her mother would join them
at the compound, and now she does.
</P>
<P>
   The children say Reggie and their mother have a mutual respect.
``Vickie is very cognizant of treating my mother with due
respect,'' says Ted Jr. ``She realizes that my mother deserves
something.''
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of the causes she chooses to endorse, Joan
Kennedy is widely admired. Part of it is that her name adds luster
to the guest list and helps bring in donations. But at some places,
such as Children's Hospital or the Pine Street Inn, just having her
show up is one of the greatest gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women were delighted that someone of her stature would
come spend time with them,'' says Pine Street Inn president Lynda
Downie. ``Her life experience really resonates with them. It makes
them believe that they, too, can move on. That there is hope.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, in a way, a very Kennedy thing to do, as some see it. Ah,
the Kennedy thing. It's always there, hovering over Joan Kennedy's
life like a morning mist draped over Nantucket Sound. Joan Kennedy
shrugs at the notion that she has become the best of them. The best
of what? Who are the Kennedys, anyway? Joan Bennett thinks she
knows, and she has a secret to tell.
</P>
<P>
   It is about her home on Squaw Island, the house she battled to
get from her husband in their divorce. If you look across the creek
that separates the island from the mainland, you can just see a
pair of old clapboard houses. Once upon a time, they were owned not
by Kennedys but by Bennetts, Joan's grandfather and his two
brothers. They bought the property in 1901, nearly 30 years before
the Kennedys came to town. In fact, Bennetts had come to America in
the 1660s, hundreds of years before Kennedys even set foot on
American soil. Joan Kennedy never told her husband that. But when
they divorced, she hung the Bennett family genealogy right in a
front room of the house, for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Kennedys,'' says Joan Kennedy with a smile. ``They're
really newcomers. They're immigrants.''

 &HT;    Defensive faces makeover
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tired after arriving home about 2 a.m. Monday, Falcons coach Dan
Reeves had no more answers than a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But the goals are clear: Rectify and simplify after Sunday's
42-14 thrashing in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (1-1) play at Carolina (1-1) Sunday, the first of
four consecutive games against opponents either vastly improved or
world champions.
</P>
<P>
   After the Panthers, the Falcons are home against the Super Bowl
champion Rams (2-0). Then, they play at Philadelphia (1-1), home
against the Giants (2-0), and then at St. Louis (2-0).
</P>
<P>
   ``The next two weeks are really crucial, with Carolina and St.
Louis being two (NFC West) division games,'' Reeves said. ``We
didn't expect to go undefeated.''
</P>
<P>
   But nobody expected the Falcons to lose so decisively in Reeves'
return to Denver, where he coached from 1981-92.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta trailed 10-0 with 7 minutes, 14 seconds left in the
first quarter, 13-0 with 1:42 left in the period and 20-0 with
12:14 left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Only a 100-yard kickoff return by rookie cornerback Darrick
Vaughn shortly before halftime brought Atlanta to within 34-7.
Atlanta was outgained 291-42 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   A defense ranked No. 26 in the NFL, not including the Monday
night game, is giving up 73 yards and 35 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dug ourselves a huge hole that we couldn't get out of,''
Reeves said. ``Why? I wish I had the answers. My experience on
defense is if you aren't getting the execution, you better pull
back and start doing less things.''
</P>
<P>
   So defensive coordinator Rich Brooks will pull in the reins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're making too many mistakes,'' Brooks said.
``There are some busted assignments, but the major concern is when
you make as many mistakes as we do, you've got to figure you've got
to simplify it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons weren't much better on offense. The Broncos sacked
quarterback Chris Chandler six times. Chandler completed 9 of 22
passes for 128 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Falcons pointed to 1998, when the Falcons took a 2-0
record to San Francisco, fell behind 28-7 in the first half, and
lost 31-20. That team won 12 of its final 13 games, and went to the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Other successful turnarounds have come after blowout losses. In
1989, the Steelers lost 51-0 to Cleveland and 41-10 to Cincinnati.
Then, Pittsburgh won 10 of 14, won a playoff game and then lost
24-23 at Denver to Reeves' Broncos who went to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has happened a lot of times, but that doesn't mean it is
going to happen,'' Reeves said. ``We got beat, and hopefully we
will learn from it and re-dedicate and come back out this week and
play well.''

IN TEACHING SEXUAL ABSTINENCE, GOVERNMENT JOINS THE UNIFICATION
CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ For several years now, a small New York-based
foundation has aggressively spread its conservative message in
China: Sex before marriage is immoral, fidelity in marriage is
essential and abstinence is the only way to prevent AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Offering free seminars and workshops, the International
Educational Foundation has been warmly embraced by a range of
conservative Chinese officials distressed about their country's
slide toward sexual freedom. In partnership with a government
health education institute, the foundation has now worked in every
province, and its Beijing office is in a Health Ministry building.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, the foundation is a strange bedfellow for the
communist Chinese government, which for the last year has waged an
especially harsh campaign against evangelical religious groups and
spiritual movements.
</P>
<P>
   The International Educational Foundation was started by the Rev.
Sun Myung Moon, the ardently anti-communist South Korean founder of
the Unification Church. Its headquarters is in the church's main
building in New York City. And its leaders are prominent members of
the Unification Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Chinese officials are very conservative, and those that
support the ideas being taught by the foundation don't worry too
much about what else is behind it,'' said Qiu Renzong, a specialist
in medical ethics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, who
has criticized the group for undermining China's AIDS prevention
effort with misleading literature.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, critics of the group say that many Chinese supporters _
for the most part loyal communists and atheists _ are only dimly
aware of the foundation's religious roots or what the Unification
Church represents. Moon has said he is a Messiah who at age 16 was
asked by Jesus to continue his divine work; he says that he and his
wife are the ``true parents'' of Church members, and he prefers to
personally select their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   But in China, as in the United States, Moon-affiliated groups
have consistently succeeded in promoting their conservative social
agenda in even the most hostile environments, generally by tapping
into the fears of local conservatives and forming alliances with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Playing down religion and their links to the Moon organization,
the foundation uses its deep pockets to support a number of
conservative social causes, and local allies tend not to ask too
many questions.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu Qi, a Chinese health official who has sponsored the
foundation's work in China, said he was aware that it was a
``church-affiliated group,'' although he said he was unsure which
church it represented. He added that the group was ``welcome, so
long as they weren't doing missionary work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that it's very unusual for Chinese organizations to
cooperate with foreign religious groups,'' he said. ``But I think
the reason we can cooperate is that their Christian values are in
line with traditional Chinese values. Also, they have a degree of
economic strength.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the Chicago school board discovered that a similar
Moon-affiliated group, the Pure Love Alliance, had been given
permission by inner-city principals to teach its abstinence-only
curriculum in classrooms. The chancellor of the Chicago public
schools angrily banned the group when its links to the Moon
organization were discovered.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Though acknowledging their ties with Moon, the foundation's
leaders emphasize that their focus is on ``actualizing virtues that
are universal, like respectability and honesty,'' not on promoting
religious dogma, said Alan Saunders, who is based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders said the group was independent from the church,
supporting itself through its business ventures and donations. He
added that Moon financed only large conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people who work with us are not Unificationists,''
Saunders said. ``In Russia we're in 5,000 schools. Most of the
teachers do not have the Unificationist perspective, so we're not
endorsing religiousity.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics in China complain that the foundation has misled
people, presenting second-rate science to promote a health policy
based on conservative values rather than research. They say the
group's focus on abstinence undercuts the fight against AIDS in
China.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's lecture material denies that condoms can
prevent pregnancy, transmission of HIV _ the virus that causes AIDS
_ or other sexually transmitted diseases. And lecturers tell
students that there is no such thing as ``safe sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When HIV was spreading province-by-province through China, the
Chinese government spent a lot of time working with religious
groups to use morality to defend the people against AIDS,'' said
Wan Yanhai, who runs a Chinese Web site about HIV and recently
co-wrote a report called ``The Foreign Shepherd,'' about the
International Educational Foundation's work in China.
</P>
<P>
   Others criticize the group for obscuring its religious
background and particularly its ties to the Unification Church, a
far-flung group with a controversial history, hundreds of
intertwined businesses and some unconventional religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most Chinese don't have a good idea of what this group
is, even if they have heard it's the Unification Church,'' said Er
Yan, the other author of ``The Foreign Shepherd'' who is also the
general coordinator of the Chinese Society for the Study of Sexual
Minorities. ``They portray Mr. Moon as just another respected
religious leader.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others worry that the Moon organization is using the
seminars to promote its own goals at the expense of sound health
policy. Former members of the Unification Church said that the
group's leader has long wanted to gain a foothold in China, the
world's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group has a 30-year track record of using lots of money to
gain access to high political positions,'' said Steven Hassan, a
former senior member of the church who has since become one of its
critics. ``They create a front group, offer lots of money, set up
conferences. And inveigle their way into whatever can be
inveigled.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the foundation's teaching materials and lectures focus
on secular virtues, the vocabulary and practices of the Unification
Church creep into the curriculum _ with occasional references to
the ``true parents'' (Moon and his wife) and ceremonies in which
foundation teachers perform mass blessings of marriages.

<P>
   The International Education Foundation, with offices in New
York, London, Moscow and Beijing, says it has operations in more
than a dozen countries, although its Web site focuses mostly on
activities in the former Soviet Union, Mongolia and China.
</P>
<P>
   The Moon organization has been cultivating ties to China since
the early 1990s, when Moon's wife, Dr. Hak Ja Han Moon, addressed
the All China Women's Federation at the Great Hall of the People,
the seat of the Chinese government. Mid-decade the Unification
Church tried to set up an automobile factory with the government,
although that business eventually failed.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation first came to China in 1994, said Zhu, who said
he got to know the group's executive director, Tony Devine, at a
conference on sex education two years later. There, they discovered
a common bond: two unlikely kindred souls both bucking the tide in
insisting that sex education should focus on abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with Zhu's help, the foundation generally works directly
with local government bureaus across China to set up seminars on
abstinence and chastity.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign groups are not allowed to operate in China without a
local partner, and the Moon group tends to work with socially
conservative Chinese bureaucrats, generally associated with the
Ministries of Education or Propaganda, or with the All China
Women's Federation; they see the growing number of liberal, often
Western-trained, health officials as the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our views are the views of the masses of ordinary Chinese
people,'' said Zhu. ``There are now a number of academic experts
and others promoting sexual freedom and condoms; they have quite a
following in the Ministry of Health.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Moon foundation is officially housed in the
Ministry of Health, it has little support among the scientists
there.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where all books and magazines are controlled by the
government, the foundation has also gotten involved in several
cooperative publishing ventures. ``Family Ethics and Character
Education,'' a recent book brought out by the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences Publishing House, is co-edited by Shi Junhao, the
foundation's South Korean president, and Wu Yan, a senior official
at the academy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 and 1999, the China Journal of Health Education
routinely carried articles by leaders of the foundation. And the
foundation's Web site proudly announces that it hosted officials
from the Chinese Ministry of Justice and cultural leaders, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   The group has apparently helped overcome any misgivings with
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the All China Women's Federation, who said that
they were aware of the group's ties with the Unification Church,
said that the foundation often lavished money and other perquisites
on officials and cash-poor local governments.
</P>
<P>
   A local government could get the equivalent of $5,000 _ a vast
sum in rural China _ for holding a seminar, said Wan's report. The
group has provided free ``sex education'' teaching materials for
hundreds of middle schools in Beijing. Mid-level officials and,
sometimes, their children have been treated to trips abroad to
attend conferences, a rare opportunity for most Chinese college
students.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the foundation flew more than 100 Chinese students
to a seminar on ``Model Relationships'' at the University of
Bridgeport, in Connecticut, which is owned by the Unification
Church. Er, the co-author of ``The Foreign Shepherd,'' said it was
an offer many Chinese couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they don't believe in the message,'' he said, ``they
see it as a free trip for their kids.''

 &HT;    Bitter history shadows Selma mayoral vote today
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELMA, ALA. _ Nearly every day since August, retired department
store clerk Lillie Brown has stood on street corners waving her
campaign sign _ ``Joe Gotta Go!'' _ while yelling at motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honk if Joe's gotta go!'' the 69-year-old hollers from the
brick and concrete sidewalks of downtown. A cacophony of car horns
beep back.
</P>
<P>
   Joe is 70-year-old Joe T. Smitherman, Selma's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the former segregationist faces a runoff for the first
time in his 36 years in office. If he loses, Smitherman will be
replaced by the city's first-ever black mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The former washing machine salesman has held office since 1964 _
one year before Bloody Sunday, a galvanizing day in the civil
rights movement when state troopers on horseback beat marchers on
the Edmund Pettus Bridge who were demanding voting rights for
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the wrong side,'' Smitherman said, while
chain-smoking a pack of Winstons in his City Hall office, his back
to a cabinet holding an antique cash register, a 1996 Olympic torch
and a houndstooth hat like that worn by legendary Alabama football
coach Bear Bryant. His transformation is authentic, Smitherman
said. Just witness his friendship with Rep. John Lewis, a civil
rights leader branded an outside agitator in the 1960s who now is a
congressman from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Without the calamitous past, Smitherman said his is just another
mayor's race in a middle-of-nowhere city of 22,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selma's a catchy name, and everybody lays the sins of the
nation at Selma's footsteps as far as segregation and voting and
brutality and all of that, when most of that happened in
Birmingham, Montgomery or Mississippi,'' Smitherman said. ``We had
one instance that was outside the city and that was with state
troopers and sheriff's deputies, no city police. And guess who gets
blamed? Me.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Walking With the Wind,'' Lewis' memoir of the civil rights
movement, the congressman writes that the Smitherman of the 1960s
``had to please everyone. And so he wasn't above calling Dr. King
`Martin Luther Coon,' then chuckling at his slip of the tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman has stayed in office because he is adept at floating
with the political current, said Auburn University-Montgomery
political science professor Carl Grafton
</P>
<P>
   ``He's first and foremost a politician. Like George Wallace,''
Grafton said. ``Like George Wallace, they were what they were at
the time. To know whether they've changed deep down in their
hearts, there's no way to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own reckoning, Smitherman will be the last white mayor
the city will ever see.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bloody Sunday, blacks have forged a voting majority in the
city, on the City Council and on the County Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the national office of the NAACP set up a ``Voter
Empowerment Command Center'' near the foot of the Edmund Pettus
Bridge. Other activists from across the country are expected to
arrive today.
</P>
<P>
   Selma had 10,000 white voters and 300 black voters when
Smitherman was first elected in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a hill to climb. I've got to get black voters,'' said
Smitherman, who counts 9,300 active black voters and 5,700 active
white voters in Selma. ``And I've got black workers out trying to
get black voters, mainly through the absentee (ballots), because a
lot of them are intimidated when they go to the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, one of those beaten on the bridge 35 years ago, is among
those hoping today's election ousts Smitherman and replaces him
with black computer consultant James Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Lord. If that were to happen I know I would be singing
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, 47, has lost two previous elections to Smitherman. In
this year's four-man August primary, Perkins actually led
Smitherman before absentee ballots delivered the incumbent a
276-vote plurality.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of change works against him, Perkins said, even
though 60 percent of Selma's population is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can find comfort in oppression as long as they're
comfortable,'' Perkins said. ``The concept of change is a scary
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to rally behind a single candidate, blacks have been
unable to knock Smitherman from power despite becoming a majority
of the population in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Selma City Council President Pro Tem Yusuf Salaam, who is black,
received 11 percent of the primary vote. Since then, the Muslim has
accused Perkins of being disrespectful toward his faith. In ads,
Perkins has underscored his Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman says he needs to win only 400 of Salaam's 1,021
primary votes to secure another victory.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Smitherman has hosted a fish fry complete with beer.
Perkins supporters claim the barbecues and booze target poor,
uneducated black voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who will sell their vote for a fish sandwich is
outrageous,'' said Brown, the campaigner with the ``Gotta Go''
sign.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have fired charges and countercharges of vote fraud
and intimidation. Perkins supporters say their voters have been
offered up to $50 for absentee votes in favor of Smitherman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens in every election,'' Smitherman said. ``Tell
(Perkins) he's got a legitimate choice _ challenge the election,
challenge the vote, whatever. I've got the same charges against
him. They ride around with bullhorns, screaming at my workers and
intimidating them. Same difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman's campaign literature boldly asks ``Why Change?'' His
newspaper-size ad shows nine of 13 city department heads _
including the chief of police _ are black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made some black friends through the years, obviously
through some of these appointments,'' Smitherman said
matter-of-fatly.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins is frustrated that his issues of economic development
and improved education have been sidetracked.
</P>
<P>
   A car with ``Joe Gotta Go'' bumper stickers was found burning at
the law office parking lot of Rose Sanders, a black attorney in
Selma and an activist noted for her strident rebukes of Smitherman.
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman said he ran for re-election because he didn't want
the city run behind the scenes by Sanders, partner in the largest
black law firm in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Grafton said Sanders is an easy target for Smitherman. Sanders
became an active campaigner for the New South Coalition, an
election machine created by Richard Arrington, the first black
mayor of Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, whose office is decorated with a picture of Nation of
Islam leader Louis Afrikaans, once charged the Southern Poverty Law
Center in Montgomery _ a civil rights organization known for
fighting white supremacist groups _ with racist hiring policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose Sanders is a polarizing figure,'' Grafton said.
``(Smitherman's) almost running against her. She's an abrasive,
radical kind of person.''
</P>
<P>
   A block from the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Brown, the retired store
clerk, recalls the day she was trampled by a state trooper's horse.
She is cheered by the prospect of removing from office a lingering
reminder of that day, but she knows there are no guarantees. ``If
we don't get him now, he might stay there for another 30 years,''
Brown said.

SIX-HOUR SPACEWALK PREPARES POWER, COMMUNICATIONS FOR SPACE
STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Spacewalkers Ed Lu and Yuri Malenchenko floated
outside the international space station on Monday, stringing power
and communications cables and zipping through other tasks intended
to ready the orbital outpost for its first resident crew in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The six-hour outing marked only the fifth time that an American
astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut have strolled in space together.
</P>
<P>
   Lu, 37, an astrophysicist, and Malenchenko, 38, a Russian Air
Force officer, made it seem like it had never been any other way.
Wearing puffy spacesuits and loaded down with an assortment of
tools, they made their way more than 110 feet from the airlock of
the shuttle Atlantis along the uneven hull of the space station.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis and its crew of five Americans and two Russian arrived
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spacewalk went very well,'' said NASA's Mike Hess, who
planned Monday's excursion and monitored its progress from the
Johnson Space Center in Houston. ``I think we've made a lot of
headway in working together on the international space station.
This is the harbinger of things to come, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, the Atlantis crew members planned to board the
station for the first time since their arrival, and make their way
through a dozen air tight hatches to reach its most distant point.
</P>
<P>
   Still early in its development, the outpost spans more than 140
feet and includes three major modules. Its latest addition, the
Russian-built Zvezda crew module, arrived in July. More than two
years overdue because of Russian economic difficulties, Zvezda
furnished the living and working space for a crew of three that
made future assembly possible.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing 42,000 pounds, Zvezda was too massive to be launched
with all of its life support systems in place. They followed in an
unmanned Progress cargo capsule that is parked temporarily at one
end of the new module.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis skipper Terry Wilcutt and his crew will spend this week
transferring systems that generate and recycle air, a toilet and
other equipment from the Progress to Zvezda. They will haul large
power storage batteries, an exercise bicycle and treadmill from the
shuttle's cargo hold into the new module as well.
</P>
<P>
   The work will prepare the station for the arrival of American
commander Bill Shepherd and cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei
Krikalev within two months. Their four-month stay is intended to
kick off at least a decade of permanent staffing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of work to do,'' said Milt Heflin, NASA's
mission operations director. ``Basically, it's a cabin we have that
we are trying to get furnished and move into. There is a tremendous
amount of coordination required between now and the end of the
flight to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle crew is conserving electrical power so that mission
managers can extend its visit from Saturday to Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lu and Malenchenko established a fast pace for their colleagues,
finishing Monday's spacewalk 14 minutes early.
</P>
<P>
   Their most important task was the linking of nine utility cables
between Zvezda and Zarya, the propulsion module launched in
November 1998 to initiate the station's construction.
</P>
<P>
   The cabling will permit future exchanges of solar generated
electrical power between the station's U.S. and Russian segments.
It will permit station crews to observe activities in remote
modules over a closed circuit television system. The work will
enable astronauts and cosmonauts flexibility in their choice of
wearing U.S. or Russian spacesuits and using Russian or American
airlocks for future spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   At the most distant point of their spacewalk, Lu and Malenchenko
erected a six-foot mast and equipped it with a magnetometer, a
guidance device. By sensing the Earth's magnetic field, the
instrument enables the station's flight computers to point the
station correctly as it orbits the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Lu also released a no longer needed docking target that had
become an obstruction to future spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Monday, NASA towed the shuttle Discovery to a coastal
launching pad at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Tentatively scheduled for an Oct. 5 liftoff, Discovery will
carry a crew of seven to the station to deliver the first segment
of external truss and four large gyroscopes that are part of the
station's future steering system. The truss will serve as the base
for a large solar power generation module that the shuttle
Endeavour will deliver in late November.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When thousands of car owners complained in the 1980s and 1990s
that their Fords unexpectedly stalled, often on highways and while
making left turns across oncoming traffic, top company executives
repeatedly assured regulators that there was no way to know what
might be causing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the period, Ford documents show, the company's
engineers, safety officials and even its board of directors were
aware of growing problems with one particular part _ a computerized
ignition system attached to the engine's distributor _ that would
shut the engine down if it got too hot.
</P>
<P>
   Even as federal investigators opened and closed five
investigations based on Ford's assurances that it knew of no
particular defect, the company never provided regulators with more
than a dozen documents that would have shed light on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day in 1986 when the regulators closed their second
investigation based on Ford's assurances that there was nothing
defective to warrant a recall, members of the company's board of
directors meeting in a private session discussed the rising number
of service complaints about the part, according to Ford documents.
</P>
<P>
   Also that day, Ford officials prepared a memo raising questions
about the company's plan to continue attaching the system, known as
a thick film ignition, or ``TFI'' module, to the engine in a future
model in light of the problems and complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the notes from the board meeting nor the Ford memo was
ever provided to federal investigators. Ford continued to deny
there were problems for the next nine years, in spite of repeated
internal company studies, consumer complaints, numerous reports of
deadly and other serious accidents, wrongful death and personal
injury lawsuits and warranty claims that topped 40 percent in some
years.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which denies the defect has caused any fatal
accidents, has settled at least four lawsuits involving serious
injuries and at least four deaths. A study prepared for the
plaintiffs in one case asserts that the drivers of the 22 million
cars equipped with the ignition system face a 9 percent greater
chance of being in a fatal crash. Ford contests that finding but
stopped putting ignitions on distributors after the 1995 model
year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's handling of complaints about the ignition system _
detailed in court papers, as well as interviews with witnesses,
safety experts, government officials and lawyers _ has taken on new
significance in light of the recent recall of 6.5 million Firestone
tires after dozens of deadly crashes involving Ford Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, documents have emerged showing that the
companies were aware of problems with Explorers equipped with the
tires several years before the recall.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators are now examining whether the
ignition case is part of a broader pattern in which Ford mislead
regulators by failing to disclose what its engineers and safety
experts know of possible defects.
</P>
<P>
   Alan J. Kam, a recently retired official at the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, said in an interview that in his 21
years as the agency's top lawyer for defects and enforcement
issues, he had never seen a greater deception perpetuated on the
government by an auto company.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at this material I was astonished,'' said Kam,
who has been retained as an expert witness for the victims and is
preparing an affidavit outlining his views that will be filed in a
case in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford Motor Company had obfuscated the existence of the TFI
module problems even though it had problems on a massive basis,''
he said. ``They had concealed signs of failures that were occurring
at an astronomical level, at a figure far beyond any measure I have
seen before. They were telling the agency they didn't know what was
causing stalling while they were doing extensive studies showing
they knew what was causing the stalling.''
</P>
<P>
   The ignition cases have been described in news reports. But
Kam's involvement in the case and many of the Ford internal
documents congressional investigators are now studying have not
been previously disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a state court judge in California concluded in a
tentative decision in a class action lawsuit involving the ignition
system that Ford had engaged in a huge corporate cover-up,
concealing from both regulators and consumers a design flaw
affecting 22 million cars produced between 1983 and 1995, almost 15
million of which remain on the road.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, he makes the decision final in the next few
weeks, the judge will become the first in American history to order
an auto recall. Such a ruling combined with other damages could
cost Ford as much as $3.5 billion in California alone.
</P>
<P>
   Cases are also pending in five other states, and like the tire
recall, Ford faces the prospect of action in countries abroad,
where tens of millions of autos are on the roads with the ignition
part affixed to the distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Ford executives and lawyers say they intend to appeal the
ignition case if the judge's decision becomes final. They said the
judge had no basis for reaching his conclusions of cover-up and
liability and exceeded his authority by ordering a recall. Ford
executives said the only similarity between the ignition and tire
cases is that company officials did nothing improper and took
necessary steps to correct any problems.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Platt, a Ford lawyer, said that in the tire case, Ford
was under no legal obligation to report on problems being
encountered abroad. And in the ignition case, he said, the
company's position is that there were many possible causes of cars
stalling on the road beyond problems with the ignition module.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frequency of the stalls caused by a TFI failure were not
nearly as large as a number of other factors,'' he said. ``NHTSA
looked at the adequacy of our filings and with the exception of
seven documents that Ford didn't produce, it found that we produced
all that was required. It's hard to argue that Ford has been less
than forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In court papers outlining its legal defense, Ford maintained
that the module was far more reliable than earlier ignition systems
and there have not been an inordinate number of accidents caused by
cars that have stalled. The company said there were sound
engineering reasons for putting the module on the distributor, and
that the company corrected any problems by replacing more than 1
million parts under warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while there was a high rate of warranty claims filed
over the ignition module, Ford executives testified that nearly 90
percent of the parts replaced were found not to be defective.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's handling of the ignition complaints points up the
shortcomings of a regulatory system that, short of manpower, relies
heavily on the candor of the auto companies.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties for failing to disclose defects to federal auto
regulators are not onerous. In the ignition case, the highway
safety agency concluded two years ago that Ford had improperly
withheld important documents but declined to impose any penalties
at all, in part because the cars were no longer covered by federal
laws on recalls sponsored by a manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Documents which have been made public in recent months show that
in both the tire and ignition cases, Ford executives knew about
increasing consumer complaints and accidents surrounding the parts.
In both cases, regulators were not immediately told of the
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Although the leadership of the company has since changed hands,
some of the same Ford executives, including the company's top
executive for safety issues, Helen O. Petrauskas, have been
involved in both cases.
</P>
<P>
   And in both cases, the company followed its practice of settling
personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits raising safety concerns
by requiring the cases be sealed and the plaintiffs return all
incriminating company documents to Ford. In some cases, the
settling parties had to also agree that they would take no steps to
assist plaintiffs in other cases who assert similar claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective in both the tire and the ignition cases was to
avoid a costly recall in the United States, to handle costly
defects through settlements in individual cases and then have those
cases sealed,'' said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the
Center for Auto Safety and an unpaid expert witness for the
plaintiffs in the ignition lawsuits. ``In both instances, Ford was
under an obligation to self-report to NHTSA, and in both instances,
Ford failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael E. Ballachey, the California Superior Court judge who
ruled against Ford, blamed Ford for a corporate culture in which
the careers of executives can be ruined by reporting design defects
to higher-ups. The judge said, for instance, that the testimony in
his case of a top Ford engineer's reluctance to convey bad news
about the ignition module had reminded him of ``The Emperor's New
Clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wanted to be the one to deliver the bad news to the
president of Ford,'' Ballachey wrote. ``That reluctance, and Ford's
commitment to failed technology, cannot be accepted as a realistic
attempt to solve the obvious safety problem confronting Ford: the
massive failure of distributor mounted TFI modules due to excessive
heat and thermal stress.''
</P>
<P>
   The ignition cases brought in California do not involve auto
passengers who were injured or killed, but were filed as fraud
lawsuits that accuse the company of deceiving car owners about the
safety of their products.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they decided, as a matter of
strategy, not to pursue claims for death or injury. Engines that
stall can often be restarted after cooling down, making it
difficult to establish to a legal certainty that a particular
accident was caused by an ignition defect.
</P>
<P>
   In the California case, Ballachey ordered Ford to disclose
details of several sealed lawsuits. One of these cases involved an
April 14, 1990 accident. Andy Pham, a 19 year old who rented a 1990
Mercury Sable in San Jose, was driving to Reno with 7 passengers
when his car stalled, hit the center divider and rolled over and
crashed off the road. Pham and two others died in the crash.
Another passenger, Asali Johnson, was left a quadriplegic while the
other passengers suffered less severe injuries.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the case is the TFI module, which Ballachey
described as ``delicate electronic, computer driven technology,''
prone to shutting down at high temperatures. It was placed near the
engine on a number of Ford models, from 1983 to 1995 and including
some makes of the Bronco, Escort, Grand Marquis, Mustang, Sable,
Taurus, Tempo, Thunderbird, Topaz, and Town Car.
</P>
<P>
   (A complete list of Ford vehicles that plaintiffs say have
stalling problems caused by an ignition module is available at The
New York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com/business)
</P>
<P>
   Although some Ford engineers and officials argued that early
electronic ignitions be placed inside the passenger compartment of
vehicles, in part to eliminate exposure to high temperatures, Ford
rejected that approach.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Fazio, the San Francisco lawyer who has been the driving
force behind the cases, said the Ford documents uncovered in the
litigation detail years of concern about the part. Most of the
documents were never provided to federal traffic safety officials
during their investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the documents show, the company decided against
mounting the ignition system away from the engine in future models
``for cost/function reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as April 1982, Ford engineers began to raise concerns
about overheating of the ignition module.
</P>
<P>
   A warranty analysis in January 1984 projected that the ignition
module _ which was supposed to last for the lifetime of the vehicle
_ would fail at a rate of 56 percent at five years or 50,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   In May of that year, Ford engineers compiled a list of
components that could cause a ``quits on road'' condition _ a
failure that causes the vehicle to shut down while being driven.
The document questioned whether a recall was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The company continued to tell the safety agency there was no
``common pattern or cause'' behind the complaints about stalling.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1985, Ford executives were told that a special company
task force was studying why the ignition module and another part
fail in ``hot climates'' within warranty and more temperate
climates after the warranty expires.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1986, federal safety officials, relying on such
Ford's assurances, shut down their second investigation. That same
day, the company's directors began to raise questions about the
high costs of fixing the module.
</P>
<P>
   Although the module was one of 14,000 parts of the car, costs of
replacing it threatened to eat up more than $200 million of the
$350 million that Ford had reserved for all warranty claims.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1986, a month after that meeting, Ford executives
prepared a report on the issue for the company's top management,
including Harold Poling, the chairman of the board. But according
to testimony in the case, Poling never received the report,
although he and other executives learned of many of its details.
</P>
<P>
   The study noted the nodule's high rate of failure at hot
temperatures. It said 4.3 million vehicles in model years 1984 and
1985 were at risk of ignition problems and that about 500,000
already had their modules replaced at the owners' expense.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of Ford customers who reported stalling found that 66
percent had their cars towed because of the module's failure and 29
percent ``experienced a TFI related failure that caused the engine
to quit while the vehicle was in motion.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, company officials recognized that the potential
cost to an across-the-board fix would be staggering, more than $429
million. The company also concluded that such a fix was ``not
feasible'' because they did not have enough replacement parts and
opted for a ``selective notification,'' even though executives
recognized it would leave many cars on the roads that would
continue to ``quit on road.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the limited notification program, which affected
slightly over 1 million cars, executives continued to raise
concerns about the placement of the module on the distributor. In a
July 1988 memo, officials in the electrical and electronic division
said they were ``concerned about long term customer satisfaction
due to the anticipated high TFI module operating temperatures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As you are aware,'' the memo said, ``the failure mode for the
TFI module under these conditions is a quits-on-road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reviewed this subject with you in the past, and we
understand the cost pressures'' it concluded. ``However, this
posture is not consistent with company quality goals.''

 &HT;    Despite Cunningham's strong performance, Aikman still Dallas
starter
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas - One day after reserve quarterback Randall
Cunningham's terrific performance in a 32-31 loss to Arizona, Coach
Dave Campo stressed that Troy Aikman is still the starter for the
Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make it very clear that Troy is our starting
quarterback if he's ready to go,'' Campo said at his Monday press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham made a legitimate bid to become the starter by
hitting on 24 of 34 passes for 243 yards and three touchdowns
against a patched-up Arizona defense. The entire offense, however,
played poorly in the final five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona overcame an eight-point deficit in the fourth quarter.
The final blow was Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer's 17-yard
scoring strike to David Boston with 1 minute, 54 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The scars of this loss were much deeper than the scars inflicted
in the opening-day loss to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Campo heard a familiar tune in closing minutes Sunday. Last year
the Cowboys lost five games when they led in the fourth quarter.
The emergence of a second-string quarterback did not offset the
pain of going 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with what Randall did, but we didn't win the
football game,'' he said. ``My happiness (over Cunningham's game)
is tempered by the result. I think we have two winners here. I've
been here 12 years, and Troy won 90 games in the '90s, the most any
quarterback has had in any decade. Let's not forget that. Troy is
our guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham accepted Campo's decision, saying, ``I pray there's
not a controversy or anything like that. We need unity on this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Cunningham's success came against an Arizona defense
missing two key players. All-Pro cornerback Aeneas Williams
(bruised left thumb) missed the second half, and starting
cornerback Tom Knight (sprained knee) also missed much of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman reluctantly missed Sunday's game after suffering his
ninth career concussion in the loss to Philadelphia. It is unclear
whether Aikman will be ready for Monday night's game in Washington,
though Campo said he hopes to make a decision on Aikman's status by
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On the injury front, middle linebacker Dat Nguyen has a sprained
medial collateral ligament in his right knee and will miss two to
four weeks. His spot will be taken by Barron Wortham, who played in
the Super Bowl this year with Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Campo's biggest concern is improving a defense that gave up 243
yards passing Sunday. Two of the biggest plays of the game were a
37-yard pass-interference call on rookie cornerback Kareem
Larrimore and Boston's 63-yard catch and run against cornerback
Phillippi Sparks on Arizona's game-winning march.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer used a play-action fake, rolled to his right and
connected with Boston on the right sideline. Sparks tussled with
Boston before finally knocking the receiver down at the Cowboys'
22.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks admitted he made a mistake. ``I fell for (Plummer's)
fake, went for the fake, and made a terrible play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Campo described Larrimore as a ``neophyte,'' someone who ``will
have to improve under fire.''

IRAQ REFUSES ENTRY BY U.N. HUMANITARIAN INSPECTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq will not allow independent experts into
the country to assess the living conditions of Iraqis a decade
after economic sanctions were imposed, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan told the Security Council on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the council, Annan also said the Iraqis were
barring another group of experts that Annan wanted to send to
devise ways to improve an oil-for-food program, which was developed
to soften impact of the sanctions on the Iraqi population. Those
experts had planned to set up a system in which Iraq would use some
of its oil-sales money to buy goods locally, a move that was
expected to spur the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   These latest decisions by Iraq not to cooperate with this new
purchasing program or the impact survey come after it also refused
to allow Ambassador Peter van Walsum of the Netherlands, who is
chairman of the Security Council's sanctions committee, to visit
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just on disarmament issues,'' a diplomat said of the
Iraqis' refusal to cooperate, even for their own interests. ``They
claim they can't get things done, but won't let anybody come in and
fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and relief officials say several reasons contribute to
this attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqis say they do not want charity. Saddam Hussein, whose
government is now probably the world's most repressive, wants to
control all contact between Iraqis and outsiders, and can in effect
veto the assignment to Iraq of even U.N. officials. Furthermore,
the government demands the right to decide how aid is distributed
and by whom. If cash is to be made available for local purchases,
the Iraqis want total control of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and international aid workers say Iraqi government has
also been turning down offers of relief from private organizations.
Earlier this year, a British ``flying hospital'' was given
permission by the U.N. sanctions committee to land in Iraq and
provide free medical treatment, but the Iraqis barred it. Iraq has
severely restricted or expelled some groups in recent months,
including representatives of the Middle East Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   However, anti-sanctions protesters, who bring in relatively
small amounts of aid, are welcomed for their propaganda value.
</P>
<P>
   Private aid, a relief official said, ``has not even scratched
the surface,'' although its potential in meeting Iraqi needs is
great.
</P>
<P>
   Another official said the repressive political atmosphere of
Iraq made it almost impossible to work there. Human rights monitors
are routinely barred, and entry has been denied to Yuli Voronstov,
a Russian diplomat who, as a special U.N. envoy, is looking into
the cases of people missing since the invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Since last December, Iraq has been permitted to sell limited
amounts of oil _ at high international prices _ but only to pay for
essential civilian needs under the oil-for-food program. The
embargo cannot be lifted until Iraq meets key disarmament
requirements, but Hussein will not permit arms inspectors to enter
the country, either.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, when Iraq finally agreed to the oil-for-food
program, Hussein has sold $32 billion in oil. Nearly $1 billion in
medicine and medical supplies have been bought, along with more
than $6 billion in food.
</P>
<P>
   Concern is growing that as more goods flow in, close associates
of Hussein will gain from cornering distribution rights, if not
through outright black-marketeering. If no independent collection
of information is possible, Iraq can continue to blame outsiders,
particularly the United States, for illnesses and deaths from
disease or malnutrition, when relief officials say that at least
some of the problem rests with the Iraqi leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iraqi victims of these unjust and unrestricted sanctions
amounted to more than a million children, women and elderly people
during the past 10 years,'' Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq
Aziz, told a summit meeting of world leaders last week. ``The
United Nations cannot escape its moral responsibility for the
consequences of sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   A European diplomat said there were ``pretty solid reports''
that Iraq has been exporting medical supplies, some of which appear
to have found their way to Lebanon, and has sold food from the
oil-sales program to Syria and Jordan. Ships have been intercepted
leaving Iraq carrying wheat and beans. At the same time, Iraqis are
buying large quantities of cigarettes and imported whiskey for the
use of Hussein's associates, a diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say several large aid organizations based in Europe
have been turned away when they responded to Iraqi needs. A
shipment of long-life milk from the Netherlands was allowed to
spoil and had to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council, responding to persistent reports of undue
suffering among the general population because of the embargo,
requested the impact survey in June. The panel's study was to be
submitted by Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to allocate cash for local purchases has been discussed
for nearly two years, and seemed to have the approval of Iraq until
it became clear that the United Nations intended to retain
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the cooperation of the government of Iraq on this
issue,'' Annan said in his report, ``I am not in a position to
submit to the Security Council finalized arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan said he had selected his group of experts to study Iraqi
deprivations and why they persisted despite the larger influx of
money. ``However, in discussions with the United Nations,'' he
wrote, ``the government of Iraq has indicated that it does not
intend to cooperate with or issue visas to such experts.''

RE-ELECTION OF YUGOSLAVIA'S MILOSEVIC MAY HELP DRIVE MONTENEGRO'S
INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Montenegro _ The Clinton administration says it
worries that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia might move
against Montenegro before or after Yugoslav federation elections
scheduled for Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   But in the small republic itself, where Montenegro's president,
Milo Djukanovic, has decided to boycott the elections, there is
less concern. The current situation seems to serve both Milosevic
and Djukanovic, with the boycott protecting the Montenegrin's
political base while effectively handing Milosevic control over the
new federal Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic, a Milosevic understudy who broke with the master and
turned toward the West in 1997, spurned efforts by Washington to
get him to take part.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that his coalition, optimistically named For a Better
Life, might break apart, and that to have the vote would legitimize
constitutional changes that Milosevic rammed through without
consulting Montenegro, Serbia's sister republic in what remains of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic also rejected an American proposal that he run
candidates for the federal Parliament _ even if they vowed not to
serve _ to deny Milosevic an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Djukanovic is afraid of a vote,'' one American
diplomat said. ``He's putting his own interests in Montenegro ahead
of the larger interest, which is to defeat Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says Drasko Djuranovic, the editor of the independent
weekly Monitor, Djukanovic is betting on Milosevic's remaining in
power, which is likely to produce an independent Montenegro in the
next few years _ the same bet being made by Kosovo's Albanian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic is beaten by the candidate of Serbia's democratic
opposition, Vojislav Kostunica, it will be harder to get Western
support for the further breakup of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Kostunica wins, he will offer a decent deal to
Montenegro,'' said Zoran Predic, an editor with the private
television station Elmag. ``If Milosevic disappears, the world's
interest in Milo Djukanovic will also disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Milosevic ``doesn't need a war after the
elections, but a better position for negotiations with the West,''
suggested Ranko Krivokapic, a leader of an independence-minded
party in Djukanovic's coalition. ``He may use Montenegro as a
bargaining chip.''
</P>
<P>
   If the point of the early election is to give Milosevic new
legitimacy, Krivokapic noted, Milosevic would be foolish to throw
it away again by moving openly against Montenegro. The ``American
panic is a bit overblown,'' Krivokapic said. ``The Americans are
more worried about their own elections than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``this is the Balkans and everything is possible,'' he
said. ``Milosevic could need a crisis, even before the election,
and he could decide to do something in just a few days. Everything
is prepared for various options.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is much talk here of the Seventh Battalion of the Yugoslav
Army, about 700 men who seem more like paramilitaries and who, it
is thought, could help provoke civil strife, providing a pretext
for the overthrow of Djukanovic without triggering an overt Western
military response.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milic, an adviser to Djukanovic, said Milosevic ``could
seem completely clean'' and say: ``It's those crazy Montenegrins.
We haven't sent a tank or a plane, so let me see what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Predic, from the independent television station, said the
problem was that ``a significant minority here is fanatically
pro-Milosevic, and another part that hates him wants to stay with
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A referendum for independence remains too risky, said
Djuranovic, the newspaper editor. ``Here in the Balkans the
question isn't the opinion of the majority,'' he said. ``It's what
the minority with guns will do, when they have the support of
another country.''
</P>
<P>
   While Djukanovic's government has officially discouraged the
state media from reporting on the campaign, the president is
allowing Montenegrins to vote in the election, trying to avoid an
open conflict with the 35 percent to 40 percent of the population
that favors unity with Serbia. Nor is Djukanovic pressing for an
early referendum on Montenegrin independence, a vote that would by
itself create security risks and more vividly display the
republic's divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Filip Vujanovic is accustomed to dancing around
the question. ``We need to be very patient and careful, and a
referendum should be taken as a last resort,'' he said in an
interview. But if Milosevic wins, as Vujanovic is convinced he
will, by manipulation if necessary, ``he will continue his
destructive approach to Montenegro,'' he said. ``That's why if he's
elected, in the next four years Montenegro will be at one point
forced to ask the citizens for their answer in a referendum. But
it's not our political decision to do it immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't willingly leave office,'' Vujanovic said of
Milosevic, ``and then the Serbian people and the international
community must work to push him out.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody in Montenegro is against Milosevic. In Herceg
Novi, a coastal town that voted out Djukanovic's coalition in local
elections this summer, opting instead for the pro-Belgrade
Socialist People's Party, there is skepticism about Djukanovic's
real aims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to get the names of the people who vote in the
election, because every vote is like a vote to keep Yugoslavia
together,'' said 50 year-old Jovan, providing only one name, who
said he intends to vote, but for the Serbian opposition candidate,
Kostunica. ``I worry about my pension.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro is divided, and Djukanovic's party and coalition are
divided, said Zeljko Ivanovic, editor of the independent daily
Vijesti. ``It's why Milosevic can sit and laugh. Whatever he's done
to Montenegro, they just issue a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Djukanovic wants independence, Ivanovic said: ``It's clear.
He needs to be able to say, `With Milosevic still in Serbia, we
have no other option.'''
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic is simply being prudent, trying not to give Belgrade
a pretext to provoke a civil war. In the meantime, Montenegro is
building the institutions of statehood, including a banking system
and an army.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the presence of the Yugoslav Army, pressure from
Belgrade includes a blockade of trade, which cuts off Montenegro
from Serbia's price-controlled food and other products, and forces
it to try to export abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's turn to the German mark as its currency has
protected it from the deflation of the Yugoslav dinar, but it has
also made prices more expensive and led to louder grumbling from
the many unemployed in this republic of just 650,000 people. And
not all of the jobless can work in Montenegro's thriving black and
gray economy, where smuggling goods to and from Italy is a way of
life.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are so many stolen cars in Montenegro _ or cars bought
cheaply in Europe and driven here, then declared stolen by their
owners _ that the joke goes: ``Come and visit Montenegro. We have
your car here waiting for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's limbo as a quasi-nation-state _ an independently
minded part of Yugoslavia _ has meant that it cannot get direct aid
from the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. But because
it is perceived as a bulwark against Belgrade, Montenegro does get
millions of dollars in government aid from Europe and the United
States to cover its budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   As many as half of Montenegro's salaried workers are paid by the
state, including the large regular and special police forces, with
their new white Land Rovers, who number up to 30,000 men and have
been built up, in part by trainers from Western armies, to counter
the Yugoslav Army.
</P>
<P>
   There is little international oversight of how the foreign money
is spent, said Arne Jan Flolo of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Everyone agrees that the privatization of
government-run enterprises is anything but transparent or clean.
</P>
<P>
   There is currently a fight within the governing party over a
fuzzy contract with the French hotel chain Accor to manage
Montenegro's nicest seaside hotels.
</P>
<P>
   One huge aluminum plant, with all of its associated industries,
represents half of Montenegro's gross domestic product, and much of
the profit goes to a Swiss holding company that provided loans in
1998 _ a contract that Washington and the aluminum company itself
seemed to be quietly trying to cancel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption is a time bomb ticking under the Djukanovic
government,'' Flolo said. ``But the West doesn't want to hear about
it. The international community is making a big mistake by not
attaching conditions to its aid and letting this go on so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebojsa Medojevic, an economist, is a Djukanovic critic: ``The
line here is that if you criticize Djukanovic you help Milosevic.
It creates space for manipulation and is an excellent pretext to
postpone any real economic reform. The problem is that the
international community supports Djukanovic without reservation,
despite dirty privatization and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Flolo said: ``There are free and fair elections here, but there
is little transparency of decision-making. There is democracy from
a distance, but you dig and there's a long way to go.''

PROTESTS OF RISING GASOLINE COSTS SWEEPING ACROSS EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ By the time George Scott abandoned work, jumped into
his car and steered it to the Shell station on the Old Brompton
Road, most of the gasoline pumps were already festooned with ``Not
in Service'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, a 50-year-old interior designer, was under no illusions
about his motive, or his mood. ``I'm panic-buying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was lucky to find fuel at all. More than 1,000 gasoline
stations across Britain were forced to close Monday as groups of
protesters, furious at high fuel prices, blockaded oil refineries,
cutting off fuel deliveries and sending consumers rushing to the
pumps in a mad race to fill their cars before the gasoline ran out.
</P>
<P>
   The protests _ by truck drivers, farm workers and taxi drivers _
were echoed by similar demonstrations in Belgium, where truck
drivers paralyzed the center of Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; That irate mood was sweeping across Europe. Groups in Ireland,
Italy, the Netherlands and Germany, emboldened by the success of
French protests last week _ which resulted in the government's
decision to lower fuel taxes by 15 percent _ mounted or prepared to
mount their own actions.
</P>
<P>
   The rising cost of gasoline is a huge irritant to consumers, and
a serious threat to some industries in Europe, where enormous
government taxes have resulted in gasoline prices that can be more
than twice as high as those in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But prices in Britain are the highest of all. The current price
of premium fuel is about $4.37 per gallon, of which 76.2 percent
goes to various taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonder anybody can afford to drive in this country,''
said Mark Ostron, 45, who had his gas-buying hopes dashed at the
Old Brompton Shell station Monday afternoon when it became apparent
that there was no more super unleaded. Normally, he said, it costs
him about 55 pounds _ or $83 _ to fill up his Ford Escort.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer anger has presented Prime Minister Tony Blair with
an unpleasant political problem. Monday's events brought unhappy
memories of the dark days of 1973, when fuel was rationed and there
were massive waits at gas stations. The Conservative government
lost the next election.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday Blair said he was determined not to capitulate to
public pressure by lowering the fuel tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot and will not alter government policy on petrol
through blockades and pickets,'' he said, speaking at a conference
on e-commerce in Loughborough, central England. ``That's not the
way to make policy in Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister also denied rumors that Britain's fuel
supplies were in danger of running out. ``The sensible way, the
only way, to deal with this problem is to put pressure on OPEC,''
he said. ``It's not to get them off the hook by caving in to public
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Blair was certainly being faced with signs of discord. In
the center of Liverpool, taxis choked traffic circles and key
roads. On some highways, deliberate slowdowns by truck drivers
resulted in mass delays. Blockades by haulers ground deliveries to
a halt, or severely curtailed them, at refineries and depots
throughout the country.
 &UR;  &LR;  Gasoline was rationed _ $15.50 worth per customer _ in parts of
Wales and the Midlands. In some areas of the country, ambulances
were told to keep to a 55 miles-per-hour speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday night, the Petrol Retailers' Association was
estimating that 2,000 British gas stations had already run out of
fuel or were about to do so. Texaco reported that a third of its
stations had shut down. And in Leeds, suppliers warned that the
city's pumps could be dry by morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, this demonstration has been carried out by haulers
and people in the agricultural sector,'' said Roy Holloway,
director of the fuel retailers' group. ``But this could swing the
motorists behind these two groups and give the government a serious
problem indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  At a Shell station in London, Amanda Brownell was not worried
about traffic slowdowns or protests. She was worried about getting
some gasoline for her Vauxhall Tigra, whose gauge was on empty. And
the unleaded fuel pumps were empty.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Brownell, 30, an Internet designer, said, ``There's only one
other petrol station near here, and I don't think I'm going to make
it.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Dramatically demonstrating that health-care costs are
climbing despite managed care, HMOs will hit senior citizens with
the largest premium increases ever next year and, in some areas,
will quadruple their monthly out-of-pocket payments.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Medicare program, which is expected to approve 2001
premiums this week, was not expected to release the numbers until
Saturday. But in Massachusetts word of extra-strength increases
began to seep out over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The four Massachusetts health-maintenance organizations that
insure most seniors _ Tufts Health Plan, Harvard Pilgrim Health
Care, Fallon Community Health Plan, and Blue Cross's HMO Blue _
will all begin charging monthly premiums or will raise existing
fees, the insurers confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While most HMOs will charge between $25 and $45, Blue Cross will
raise its $25-per-month premium to $85, $95, or $105 depending on
the county. Seniors at all HMOs will be charged co-payments for
prescription drugs and visits to the doctor _ if they can still see
their doctor at all. Some senior citizens will be forced to change
doctors because their HMO will pull out of some counties Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross Executive Vice President Peter Meade said the company
will lose more than $15 million this year on its Medicare HMO,
called Blue Care 65, because of low payments from the federal
government and climbing drug costs. Executives decided the best way
to break even in 2001 was to raise premiums. Medicare, the federal
health insurance program for the elderly, pays HMOs fixed amounts
to insure senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The only other options, he said, were to cancel the program
entirely in some counties, or to cut payments to the hospitals and
doctors who treat its members _ and risk them turning away Blue
Care 65 members. ``We decided we want a stable provider network,''
Meade said.
</P>
<P>
   With the presidential candidates debating the best way to help
senior citizens pay for expensive prescription drugs, some saw the
premium increases as evidence for immediate action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to hurt some people, there's no question about
it,'' said Geoff Wilkinson, executive director of Massachusetts
Senior Action Council. ``It's pretty clear that restructuring
Medicare to provide lots of little options in the private sector is
not going to work. That's not a viable model.''
</P>
<P>
   Others pointed out that the price increases hitting the elderly
are a warning for the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Premiums for employer-provided health insurance rose 8.3 percent
nationally during the last year, the largest increase since 1993,
according to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation. But because
employers are so desperate for workers, most were reluctant to pass
the cost onto their employees and ended up shouldering the burden
instead.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the economy slows down, employers are expected to
start shifting health insurance costs back to their workers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, higher health-insurance premiums are chipping away
company profits and are a reminder that no matter what they
originally promised, HMOs can no longer be counted on to hold down
the nation's soaring medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The late 1990s were the go-go years for Medicare HMOs,'' said
Tricia Neuman, a vice president with Kaiser. ``They were free to
seniors. The benefits were generous. We did focus groups and the
seniors said, `This is too good to be true.' Well Congress decided
it was too good.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act, which reduced
Medicare payments to HMOs by $22 million over the last three years,
according to the American Association of Health Plans.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, HMOs nationwide have pulled out of the Medicare
program, dropping 727,000 seniors citizens in the last two years
and announcing plans to drop another 125,000 next year.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Health Care Financing Administration, which runs
Medicare and pays health insurers to provide HMO plans to senior
citizens, has said that a federal prescription-drug benefit would
help ease the crunch. Presidential candidates Al Gore and George W.
Bush both have plans to expand drug coverage but disagree on just
how to do that, with Gore including a subsidy for medications
through Medicare, and Bush favoring private-sector competition.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Fallon, Harvard Pilgrim, and United Health
Plans all plan to pull out of certain counties on Jan. 1 where they
say they are losing money. Harvard Pilgrim is leaving Barnstable,
Bristol, Plymouth and Worcester counties, while Fallon is leaving
Essex and Suffolk. Senior citizens in those counties can enroll in
another Medicare HMO, or opt for a traditional fee-for-service
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross, which enrolls 32,000 Medicare clients in its HMO,
will remain in all 11 counties where it's developed provider
networks _ a decision that advocates such as Wilkinson applaud.
</P>
<P>
   The insurer will increase its annual prescription-drug benefit
from $500 to $600, and pay $150 a year toward health-club
membership. But Blue Cross will introduce office visit, emergency
room and prescription drug co-payments of between $5 and $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not cavalier about the difficulties that seniors are
facing across the country,'' Meade said. ``But we want fees that
reflect the cost of providing service. These kind of prices are
happening everywhere in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim is reducing its annual drug benefit from $800 to
$600, and eliminating its Medicare dental benefit in the counties
where it will continue to do business _ Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk,
and Suffolk.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts, which as the state's largest Medicare HMO provides
coverage to 101,000 seniors with Secure Horizons, is also adopting
or raising premiums. Tufts will also reduce its prescription drug
benefit, which will remain at $600 a year, but current co-payments
will buy a 30-day, rather than a 90-day, supply of medication.
</P>
<P>
   Secure Horizons, however, is facing difficult contract
negotiations with hospitals, eight of which have told the HMO they
will leave the Medicare network if they don't receive better rates
next year.
</P>
<P>
   That means seniors could be faced with a difficult choice:
paying a higher premium for Blue Care 65 or finding a new hospital
or doctor with Secure Horizons.
</P>
<P>
   As tough as it was, Joan Mahoney, 72, of Chatham, chose the
latter. When Harvard Pilgrim told her its Medicare HMO, First
Seniority, would no longer be offered in Barnstable County as of
Jan. 1, she switched to Secure Horizons _ even though it meant
leaving the oncology team at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
that first diagnosed and treated her uterine cancer in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Secure Horizons requires members to be treated within 30 miles
of their homes. ``It was a blow,'' she said. ``I had to say goodbye
to all my doctors. But maybe it's a blessing in disguise. I won't
have to drive as far.''

CENSUS DATA CONFIRMS `BROWNING OF AMERICA' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Tuesday release is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One out of every ten people living in the United States is
foreign born, the majority of them from Latin America, representing
the highest wave of immigrants in US history, according to Census
data to be released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It means that about 5 percent of the US population hails from
Latin America, a rising trend that's expected to continue for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Call it further evidence of the so-called ``browning of
America.'' Where immigration from Europe has slowed, it's been
quickly growing among people from Mexico, Central America, and
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But as Latinos arrive they are finding the prospects of
good-paying jobs bleak, unlike their European counterparts 80 years
ago. It has sociologists and worker's rights organizations
wondering if the cycle of poverty that ensnared Mexican farmworkers
in California in the past century will be as bad for Guatemalan day
laborers, Brazilian landscapers, and Dominican house cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to pull oneself up by bootstraps when working in a
hotel or cleaning houses,'' said Jason Pramas, associate director
for the Campaign on Contingent Work, an advocacy organization based
in Boston's Chinatown. ``There aren't better-paying jobs they can
aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Among foreign-born residents, Latin Americans had the highest
poverty rate, 24 percent, compared with 12 percent of Asians and 11
percent of Europeans, according to the Census's Current Population
Reports, which is based on a 1999 sampling survey.
</P>
<P>
   Just 6.2 percent of the workers who arrived from Mexico and
Central America, for example, were in managerial or professional
specialty occupations, compared with 38.9 percent of Asians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos arriving in the US don't have kind of education that
allows them to penetrate the higher-paying job market,'' said Miren
Uriarte, interim director of the Mauricio Gaston Institute for
Latino Community Development and Public Policy at the University of
Massachusetts in Boston. ``You are talking about a large number of
Latinos who only have the option of working in the service sector,
cleaning at hotels, working in restaurants. It pegs them at a very
low wage.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey counted 26.4 million foreign-born Americans, the
highest number in the nation's history. They accounted for 9.7
percent of the nation's population in 1999. Of that number, 51
percent arrived from Latin America, 27 percent from Asia, 16
percent from Europe, and 6 percent from other areas of the world.
</P>
<P>
   America saw the highest percentage of foreign-born Americans in
1910, when 14.7 percent of the US population arrived from
elsewhere. But since the population itself was small, the number of
foreign-born Americans was 13.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, most of the immigrants arrived from Europe.
Immigration steadily increased until 1930, when and the Depression
and then World War II slowed immigration. It continued to slow
until 1970, when the US marked the smallest percentage of
foreign-born Americans, 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Changing immigration policy opened the doors to Latin America.
According to the 1990 Census, 42.5 percent of the foreign-born
population arrived from Latin America. Now, it is 51 percent.
Asians now represent 27 percent of the immigrants, up from 25
percent 10 years ago. The percentage of Europeans among immigrants
has fallen to 16 percent of the total, compared with 22 percent in
1990, the census figures show.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Italians, Irish and German immigrants were exploited in
factories, quarries, and sweatshops, immigrants from Central
America, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia are finding themselves
fighting similar problems in restaurants, construction sites, and
on farms.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations have circumvented the gains made by labor unions,
primarily by using temporary workers, outide contractors and by
moving factories overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A perfect example is what's happened at Raytheon. Instead of
bringing new immigrants to work in Raytheon's own plants, they've
outsourced a lot of assembly-line work so they don't have a larger,
unionized workforce with living wages, benefits and a pension
plan,'' said Pramas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the company uses temporary workers in plants
of subcontractors. Those workers, who are predominantly Cambodian
and Dominican, get paid much less and don't receive benefits _
unlike unionized workers, who would make twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   Since many immigrants are mired in low pay, low-skill jobs, many
tend to work two jobs or more, leaving them little time to take
English classes, said Lawrence H. Fuchs, professor of American
Civilization and Politics at Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more language problems parents have, the higher the
dropout rates for their children,'' he said. ``One factor affects
the other.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marat Safin rubbed his glassy hazel eyes Monday
afternoon, attacked by a barrage of flashbulbs for what seemed like
the four billionth time since he won the U.S. Open only 17 hours
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Moscow native leaned in front of a model Kremlin
on the fourth floor of the Russian Tea Room, grinning with his
trophy for a dozen jostling photographers. Moments before, he stood
outside with three giddy middle-aged women holding Metropolitan
Museum of Art bags, obliging their tourist cameras. He had put his
arms up, striking a ``Marat Takes Manhattan'' pose in front of a
taxi, at the driver's request.
</P>
<P>
   Safin's day began only an hour after he went to sleep, the
euphoria from winning his first Grand Slam title almost immediately
mixed in with the heaping obligations. He was afraid to drink
coffee before appearing on CNN Live at 9 a.m, for fear the vodka
still churning in his system would not appreciate such a wake-up
call.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after taping the Charlie Rose show and an MSNBC program,
Safin was gulping caffeinated soda at the Russian Tea Room, picking
at the smoked fish and avoiding the borscht. After posing with four
waiters in costume, Safin finally sighed. ``Please! Make it fast,''
he exclaimed. ``I cannot smile so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Flexing his mouth muscles Monday seemed more difficult, and
lasted longer, than his improbable straight-sets victory over the
esteemed Pete Sampras. Safin could not explain why he dominated the
winner of 13 Grand Slam titles, and he was still unable to
comprehend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't let me,'' he said. ``I need time, at least one
day, to be alone with my friends. I need time to understand what I
did. Right now, this is my job, but I hope I will have time to talk
with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not the only 20-year-old wishing to do so Monday. Venus
Williams, the U.S. Open women's champion who won her second
straight Grand Slam event, was caught in a similar whirlwind,
appearing on three morning shows, and running to appearances before
flying back home to Florida. Tuesday she leaves for the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Williams was chatty with President Clinton on Saturday,
Safin spoke with his new friend by phone Sunday, only a day after
he was honored to meet him in person at Arthur Ashe Stadium. The
Russian president. Vladimir Putin, chipped in with his wired
congratulations Monday. ``A new tennis star has risen,'' he said in
his message.
</P>
<P>
   When Safin finally left the National Tennis Center Sunday, he
went to a dinner at Serafina in Manhattan, followed by the SoHo
club 357, where he met the singer Lenny Kravitz. Monday at 5 p.m.,
Safin taped the ``Late Show With David Letterman'' before taking a
9 p.m. plane to Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievably, Safin has to be back on the court Wednesday in
Tashkent, Uzbekistan, for a tournament to which he committed three
months ago. ``He made an agreement. You have to be professional,''
said his agent, Gerard Tsbobanian. ``It has to be this way now.''
</P>
<P>
   Safin vaulted to No. 2 in the world and has expectations and
responsibilities. He began to realize them this spring, when he
became more disciplined in his practices (leaving the cell phone
behind) and more concentrated, for the most part, on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Already, said Sampras, Safin is more powerful than he was when
he won his first U.S. Open at 19. But Sampras also cautioned that
Safin had to choose to become a legendary champion or just a
one-hit wonder. Safin's advisers, most recently Aleksandr Volkov,
have issued such warnings and Safin knows his duty.
</P>
<P>
   After Tashkent, Safin goes to Sydney to compete in the Olympics
for Russia. Then, he will return home to Monte Carlo, where Safin
hopes his friends will take him out to celebrate, at least when he
is not reflecting on his achievement.
</P>
<P>
   His apartment has no stunning view of the Mediterranean Sea,
though. ``It's a wall. I will change that,'' Safin said, this time
with a real grin.

help ease the crunch. Presidential candidates Al Gore and George W.
Bush both have plans to expand drug coverage but disagree on just
how to do that, with Gore including a subsidy for medications
through Medicare, and Bush favoring private-sector competition.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Fallon, Harvard Pilgrim, and United Health
Plans all plan to pull out of certain counties on Jan. 1 where they
say they are losing money. Harvard Pilgrim is leaving Barnstable,
Bristol, Plymouth and Worcester counties, while Fallon is leaving
Essex and Suffolk. Senior citizens in those counties can enroll in
another Medicare HMO, or opt for a traditional fee-for-service
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross, which enrolls 32,000 Medicare clients in its HMO,
will remain in all 11 counties where it's developed provider
networks _ a decision that advocates such as Wilkinson applaud.
</P>
<P>
   The insurer will increase its annual prescription-drug benefit
from $500 to $600, and pay $150 a year toward health-club
membership. But Blue Cross will introduce office visit, emergency
room and prescription drug co-payments of between $5 and $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not cavalier about the difficulties that seniors are
facing across the country,'' Meade said. ``But we want fees that
reflect the cost of providing service. These kind of prices are
happening everywhere in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim is reducing its annual drug benefit from $800 to
$600, and eliminating its Medicare dental benefit in the counties
where it will continue to do business _ Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk,
and Suffolk.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts, which as the state's largest Medicare HMO provides
coverage to 101,000 seniors with Secure Horizons, is also adopting
or raising premiums. Tufts will also reduce its prescription drug
benefit, which will remain at $600 a year, but current co-payments
will buy a 30-day, rather than a 90-day, supply of medication.
</P>
<P>
   Secure Horizons, however, is facing difficult contract
negotiations with hospitals, eight of which have told the HMO they
will leave the Medicare network if they don't receive better rates
next year.
</P>
<P>
   That means seniors could be faced with a difficult choice:
paying a higher premium for Blue Care 65 or finding a new hospital
or doctor with Secure Horizons.
</P>
<P>
   As tough as it was, Joan Mahoney, 72, of Chatham, chose the
latter. When Harvard Pilgrim told her its Medicare HMO, First
Seniority, would no longer be offered in Barnstable County as of
Jan. 1, she switched to Secure Horizons _ even though it meant
leaving the oncology team at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
that first diagnosed and treated her uterine cancer in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Secure Horizons requires members to be treated within 30 miles
of their homes. ``It was a blow,'' she said. ``I had to say goodbye
to all my doctors. But maybe it's a blessing in disguise. I won't
have to drive as far.''

 &HT;    Feelings at IU mixed over Knight's departure
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. _ Clad in a red T-shirt bearing the name and
likeness of Bob Knight, Deanna Fry literally was wearing her heart
on her sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a member of the family died,'' the
20-year-old Indiana University senior said Monday. ``One of the
reasons I came to IU was Indiana basketball and coach Knight. I
almost feel betrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeri Ryerson, also 20, took the polar-opposite view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some students may think it's a tragedy, but everyone I know
thinks they should have (fired Knight) years ago, because he's a
big joke,'' Ryerson said.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Knight's 29-year coaching reign ended, he proved
to be controversial as ever, with the campus community deeply
divided in its reaction to his firing by IU President Myles Brand.
</P>
<P>
   Classes on this campus of more than 37,000 students resumed
quietly Monday following the massive protest Sunday by thousands of
students at Brand's house, during which Brand was burned in effigy.
Police in riot gear arrested several students, and there were
sporadic incidents of property damage.
</P>
<P>
   Richard McKaig, vice chancellor and dean of students, said it's
too early to tell whether eight students arrested during the
protest will face university sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think there would be action through the campus
judicial system,'' he said, adding that punishments could range
from ``a reprimand to probation to suspension to expulsion.''
</P>
<P>
   There was scattered property damage _ two decorative
streetlights were destroyed, a goal post at the football field was
pulled down, some parking signs were uprooted and some fish
figurines were removed from a fountain, McKaig said. But no
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the students I talked to made it clear their intent
was not violent,'' McKaig said. ``They wanted to have their voices
heard and show support for coach Knight.''
</P>
<P>
   But Candice Lowe, a 30-year-old graduate student in
anthropology, was disturbed by the protest and threats against
Brand and Kent Harvey, the 19-year-old student Knight grabbed by
the arm Thursday, the incident that set the stage for the firing.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Knight was fined $30,000 and suspended for three games
because of his temper. He was allowed to keep his job, but ordered
to follow a ``zero-tolerance'' policy, which Brand said Knight has
violated on several occasions since then, most recently when he
grabbed Harvey and gave him a lecture on manners.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, who has attended IU for six years, said she first became
concerned about Knight's supporters in May after threats were
directed against members of the committee that disciplined the
coach. The events of recent days were even more disturbing, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supporters treat him like he's some kind of Christ
figure,'' Lowe said. ``It bothers me that people would threaten to
kill Myles Brand and this boy (Harvey) over a basketball coach. It
makes me feel unsafe _ and sad. I thought this was a really open
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight supporter Andy Dammeyer, 23, who participated in the
protest, admitted the threats _ including a poster of Harvey
bearing the words ``Wanted: Dead'' that was circulated on campus _
were ``a little too much.'' But ``it's Indiana basketball _ people
just go crazy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wrong, what they did to the man,'' Dammeyer said
of Knight's firing. ``He's been here 30 years. He should have left
on his own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Dick, a 21-year-old junior, said the offenses that brought
Knight down seemed petty. He said it'll be hard for the university
to fill Knight's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does overreact a lot and he does have a bad temper, but
that's part of what makes him the man he is,'' Dick said. ``They're
going to have to bring in a very respectable, high-rank coach to
get the kind of following that Bob Knight has.''
</P>
<P>
   Katie Schoenbaechler, 18, of Louisville, Ky., described herself
as a lifelong Bob Knight fan, following in the footsteps of her
mother, an IU grad and a ``huge'' fan of Knight. She arrived on
campus Aug.23, and feels cheated by Knight's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my freshman year and I was so excited about seeing Bob
Knight as an IU student,'' she said. ``He has a temper, but he's
such an exciting person to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Several university employees declined to be interviewed Monday
about the firing. ``No comment _ I have to go to work again
tomorrow,'' one employee said.
</P>
<P>
   Deanna Fry thinks there could be some serious fallout from the
firing. Players may leave the team, she said, and some pro-Knight
alumni may withhold contributions to the university. ``Bob Knight
had a lot of clout,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Garrett, 67, is one IU alumnus who won't miss Knight.
Garrett, a Bloomington resident since his college days in the mid
1950s, said a Knightless IU will be an improved IU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for it,'' Garrett said as he pulled a copy of the
Indiana Daily Student, with its ``Knight fired'' banner headline,
from a newspaper box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I despise that son of a gun,'' Garrett said. ``He's a big jerk
as far as I'm concerned.''

STRAWBERRY ARRESTED IN TAMPA ON DRIVING VIOLATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry, currently suspended from baseball for
violating terms of his drug program and still recovering from
treatment for a cancer relapse, was arrested Monday in Tampa, Fla.,
and charged with reckless driving and leaving the scene of an
accident. It was the latest setback for the 38-year-old Strawberry,
who missed most of last season, has not played this year and no
longer seems to have a viable future as a baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's incident, Strawberry was taken into custody at
gunpoint shortly after 9 a.m. by an off-duty officer who witnessed
Strawberry's sport utility vehicle hit a street sign and then
strike the rear of another SUV stopped for a red light. Strawberry
was being held without bail in Hillsborough County Jail pending a
court hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Sgt. Anthony Kolka, told The Associated Press that
when he confronted Strawberry, with his pistol drawn, he had to
bang on the window of Strawberry's vehicle to get his attention.
</P>
<P>
   Kolka said Strawberry kept asking, ``What did I do? What did I
do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he didn't know he hit the car or the sign,'' Kolka
added. The officer said he drew the gun for ``my own safety and
everybody else's,'' and that he was not initially aware that the
driver was Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ficarrotta, a lawyer for Strawberry, told The AP that
Strawberry had ``blacked out'' while driving because of a reaction
to prescription medication and that when he visited him later in
the day he seemed ``very weak and very tired.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Hillsborough County sheriff's department
said Strawberry told officers he had taken a sleeping medication,
Ambien, and Ficarrotta said Strawberry also has prescriptions for
two painkillers _ Percocet and Vicodin. A blood-alochol test showed
no alcohol in his system; the result of a urine test was not yet
available.
</P>
<P>
   For Strawberry, the bad news has been unrelenting for much of
the past two years. He was suspended from baseball for most of the
1999 season after he pleaded no contest to charges of possession of
cocaine and solicitation of prostitution. He ultimately rejoined
the Yankees near the end of the season and then served as a
designated hitter as the team went on to win its second straight
World Series and its third in four years.
</P>
<P>
   But Strawberry then flunked an off-season drug test last January
and a month later was suspended from baseball for a full year, his
third suspension for drug use in the last five years. Last month,
Strawberry had surgery for the removal of a stomach tumor, nearly
two years after he had a cancerous mass removed from his colon. In
the latest surgery, one of Strawberry's kidneys was also removed.
</P>
<P>
   News of Monday's incident circulated through the Yankees'
clubhouse Monday afternoon as the team prepared for an evening game
against Boston. Most of the members of the organization did not
know the details of Strawberry's arrest and both Yankees Manager
Joe Torre and Strawberry's longtime teammate, Dwight Gooden,
declined comment. But David Cone, one of the Yankees who visited
Strawberry during his recent hospital stay, was willing to talk
about his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darryl's been through hell,'' Cone said. ``Obviously, we all
feel for him. It's not easy to go through what he's been through _
coming to the realization that his career is probably over. He's
always had baseball to look forward to, and for the first time in
his life, he doesn't have that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Darryl's probably finally coming to that realization.
I think he had always held out hope that he was coming back.
Baseball was always a motivating factor for him, so I'm quite sure
he's probably as low as he's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he tried to understand the path of Strawberry's life _
from the young baseball star to the troubled addict to Strawberry's
bouts with cancer _ Cone said it would be ``foolish of me to even
try.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go back to his background, his upbringing, what
he's had to deal with all the way through, including cancer and a
relapse of cancer and losing his kidney, and all the depression
that comes with that. I think it would be abnormal to think that he
wouldn't have problems, with what he's been through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for the guy,'' Cone said. ``I really do.''

PARTISAN MISTRUST, DOCTORS' PROFITS HINDER MEDICARE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Story moved Sept. 10 and was held; it is now released for
publication.) 
 By ROBIN TONER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush confidently proposed last week
that as president he would put an overhaul of Medicare on the
``fast track,'' directing a new White House task force to send
legislation to Congress within nine months to transform the
35-year-old government insurance program into an efficient, largely
private health care marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   But many health experts _ and sadder but wiser veterans of past
Medicare wars _ say that the last decade has shown the immense
difficulties in accomplishing such reforms. The philosophical
differences between the two parties over how to reshape Medicare
are large and enduring. Health maintenance organizations and other
managed care insurance plans, which could play a central role in
Bush's proposal, are no longer viewed as an easy cure-all that can
both control health care costs and deliver better care.
</P>
<P>
   And the record of HMOs in the Medicare program has been
particularly rocky, with hundreds of thousands of Medicare
beneficiaries dropped in recent years by health plans complaining
that the government does not pay them enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience of HMOs and seniors, and HMOs and very sick
people would leave most analysts cautious about the capacity of the
private sector to care for people who are very sick or very old _
people on whom you might lose money, to put it in the plainest
language I can,'' said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family
Foundation, a health research group.
</P>
<P>
   Altman and others praise Bush for addressing the Medicare issue,
including the need to provide some relief for the cost of
prescription drugs. And many experts agree that Medicare, a program
that was essentially designed in the 1960s, needs to be
reconstructed to reflect the realities of modern medicine _ not to
mention the coming wave of retiring baby boomers, who will double
the number of Medicare beneficiaries in the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore supports a ``modernization'' plan
advanced by the Clinton administration last year, aides say,
although he has focused in his campaign on shoring up the
traditional program and adding a prescription drug benefit to it.
</P>
<P>
   But as is so often the case in health policy debates, the
details of creating a Medicare ``modernized for our times,'' as
Bush puts it, are a matter of intense dispute. ``There's no
consensus view about which direction we should be heading,'' said
John Rother, legislative director for AARP, an advocacy group for
older people.
</P>
<P>
   At its root, the debate over the Bush proposal revolves around
how much Medicare should be turned into a competitive marketplace,
in which beneficiaries are given a fixed amount each year and are
expected to choose among a variety of health plans, much as federal
employees do. Bush is careful to say that the elderly can stay with
the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program if they like, but
critics assert that the traditional program would be inexorably
weakened _ in part because it is likely to retain the frailest and
sickest population.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, partisan mistrust is high. Many Democrats are convinced
that Republicans simply cannot abide a huge, government-run social
insurance program and have always wanted to privatize it. Many
Republicans contend that Democrats are less interested in policy
improvements than in scaring elderly voters every election year
with dire warnings about what the Republicans will do to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Memories are still vivid from the battles of 1995-96, when the
Republicans sought to extract $270 billion in savings from the
Medicare program, and the Democrats used that proposal in a wave of
campaign advertising to devastating effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics are lethal,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who
led a bipartisan Medicare commission that ended in a deadlock in
early 1999. ``Been there, done that,'' he said of Bush's statement
last week that he would convene another Medicare task force to
draft new legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's proposal, the new bipartisan task force would build
on the work done by the earlier commission, considering Bush's own
plan as well as possible improvements. Its recommendation to
Congress would get an expedited final vote by the end of 2001 under
``fast track'' provisions Bush would ask Congress to agree to in
advance, if all went according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's allies assert that the political hurdles can be overcome
with the right leadership in the White House. And they argue that
the real-world problems with Medicare HMOs can be resolved with a
less bureaucratic, heavy-handed approach than the one now exercised
by the Health Care Financing Administration, the federal agency
that oversees Medicare and the HMOs who participate.
</P>
<P>
   The current experience with Medicare HMOs ``is not a good
indicator of potential problems,'' argued Gail Wilensky, a top Bush
health adviser who ran the health care administration under
President George Bush. She said the rules have changed too often,
the regulations are too burdensome and the payment increases to
HMOs are often too low.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is proposing a very different system for private health
plans in Medicare than the one that exists, Wilensky said. ``While
I don't want to pretend that this is going to be easy,'' she added,
``there was a period when many analysts, and members of Congress,
thought the basic idea'' of this proposal ``was something they
could support.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current Medicare system, the government sets prices
and reimburses doctors and hospitals directly for the 33 million
Americans in the traditional Medicare program; for the 6.2 million
elderly Americans who choose HMOs, the government pays their health
plan under a formula established by law.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the Bush proposal, which Wilensky said is broadly
patterned after the work of the Breaux commission, the traditional
fee-for-service program would be preserved, but it would be
required to compete with other plans.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, beneficiaries would decide how to use their
government-allotted premium. Private plans would, ideally, compete
vigorously for the business; beneficiaries could add their own
money to the government premium and buy more generous benefit
packages. This ability to choose from an array of plans is a major
selling point for the program. But critics assert that under such
systems, the government-allotted premium _ particularly if it is
tied to a national average of bids from the major health plans _
will never keep up with the cost of the traditional Medicare
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that would mean is that a lot of beneficiaries would have
to go to managed care because they couldn't afford the premiums of
traditional fee-for-service Medicare,'' said Sarah Bianchi, a Gore
adviser. Wilensky rejected that assertion.
</P>
<P>
   This exchange, though, illustrates the political difficulties of
the Bush approach. while some versions of this competitive model
have support across party lines, some Democrats contend that it
marks a fundamental shift away from the guaranteed benefits, a
35-year-old entitlement, of the Medicare program. Republicans
counter that it would provide Medicare beneficiaries with a range
of new options and benefits _ like a variety of prescription drug
plans _ that the government simply cannot match, while still
guaranteeing every beneficiary a core benefit package.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of the Breaux commission, which is regularly
praised by Bush, is instructive. As a similar proposal took shape
on the commission, the 17-member panel broke down on party lines;
it needed 11 votes to make a formal recommendation. While Bush
often hails the commission's proposal as bipartisan, only two
Democrats on the panel _ Breaux and Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska _
supported it; eight Republicans did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world ought to remember that the bipartisan commission
didn't support it, and the bipartisan support was two Democrats and
eight Republicans,'' said Stuart Altman, a member of the commission
appointed by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Altman of the Kaiser Family Foundation said, ``The reason
it went nowhere is it uncovered all the nerves that divide
Democrats and Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's restructuring proposal also seeks
to encourage more competition among private health plans, but keeps
traditional Medicare out of the competition. In general, Democrats
assert that they have been good stewards of the Medicare program,
noting that its hospital trust fund is projected to be solvent
until 2025. And Gore is campaigning hard on his promise to put
Medicare in a ``lock box'' so that its $400 billion in surpluses
cannot be used for tax cuts or other new spending.
</P>
<P>
   In line with Gore's positioning as the defender of traditional
Medicare, some health advocates expect Gore to pick apart Bush's
plan for Medicare as he picked apart former Sen. Bill Bradley's
health care plan in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare debate, in fact, is infused with the memory of past
health care struggles, including the backlash in recent years to
HMOs and the insurance industry in general, which was immediately
preceded by the backlash toward government stoked by the Clinton
attempt at universal coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dr. Judith Feder, now the dean of policy studies at
Georgetown University, formerly a top Clinton health adviser, said
she found it ironic that Bush would propose another White House
task force, ``given the experience of '93-94.'' She added, ``Surely
that indicates that complex issues are not likely to be dealt with
in a swift way.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if a candidate can survive the election with his health
care proposals intact, Rother of AARP noted, ``People are making so
much money off the health care system that any effort to change it
runs into very well-financed opposition.''

<P>
   Many parents might be surprised to learn that most of the drugs
prescribed for children, from allergy relievers to asthma inhalants
and antidepressants, have never been formally tested on children.
Starting this December, however, a new Food and Drug Administration
rule mandates that any new adult drug that the FDA decides could be
used by children with the same disease must undergo pediatric
study, and its manufacturers must list doses for children on the
label. In addition, if an adult drug already on the market has the
potential to help children with the same disease, or if it is
widely used in children and the absence of labeling seems
dangerous, the FDA can require pediatric tests.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA was, in part, shaped in response to high-profile
tragedies involving children, including the severe birth defects
caused by thalidomide, a sedative given to pregnant women in the
late 1950s. But Dr. Dianne Murphy, associate director of the
agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, says that for a
host of ethical, scientific and economic reasons, the agency has
not mandated drug research on children, until now.
</P>
<P>
   In a major shift of policy, the federal government is now using
a combined carrot-and-stick approach to induce drug companies to
study children. Three years ago, Congress offered a lucrative
financial incentive for drug manufacturers, giving them a six-month
patent and marketing extension on drugs they agree to test in
children at the FDA's request.
</P>
<P>
   With such prodding, more than 275 clinical trials involving
nearly 20,000 children are completed, in progress or about to
begin. Advertisements soliciting children's participation in the
trials are appearing in newspapers, on public transportation and on
the Internet. Already, the new research has led to expanded labels
with clear pediatric dosage instructions for 11 drugs widely
prescribed for children, from painkillers to treatments for
allergies and HIV &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Times spoke with Murphy, 55, a pediatrician with 25 years'
experience who is leading efforts to get medications tested on
children.
</P>
<P>
   Q. At the moment, it seems pediatricians and parents must play a
guessing game with most medications. Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   A. When you go to treat your kid's fever, you want to know that
you're going to make them feel better. Or that you're giving them
the right dose to treat their infection. But up to 81 percent of
all products used on children have not been studied or labeled for
infants and children. We're treating our children without studying
the medicine to the degree that we require these drugs to be
studied and understood in adults.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How is it that the FDA has regulated drugs for adults and not
for children?
</P>
<P>
   A. The laws to mandate that we study drugs often were based on
terrible accidents with children. And yet children have not been
studied because people wanted to protect them from experimentation.
Ironically, that has led to a decades-long experimentation on our
children.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do doctors go about figuring out a dose without adequate
information?
</P>
<P>
   A. Of course they'd check the Physicians' Desk Reference to see
if there was any additional information. Three-quarters of the
time, there isn't. But all pediatricians carry around a little
handbook, called the Johns Hopkins Harriet Lane Handbook, which is
small enough to fit in the pocket of your lab coat. You get it when
you're a resident and you hang on to it for the rest of your life.
It contains all the information about dosages that the pediatric
community has collected, based on experience or studies that were
done in a limited way. I'll tell you what I do on the phone with
parents in the middle of the night: I look it up in my Harriet Lane
and calculate by weight. But parents can't always remember what
their children weigh. And then there's the parents who don't call.
They are guessing, and that clearly isn't the way to take care of
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've heard that weight isn't always the best way to measure
doses in children.
</P>
<P>
   A. That's true. You need to know the right dose for each age
group's metabolic state. At some ages, because of the differences
in enzyme maturation and total body water, kids actually need a
higher dose. With some of the anticonvulsants and drugs for
treating asthma and cancer, kids can tolerate higher doses and
actually need higher doses to get the same blood level you'd get in
an adult with a lower dose.
</P>
<P>
   Infants, on the other hand, don't metabolize medicine as well
because their liver and kidneys are immature in the first months of
life. If you go simply by weight, they're going to end up with
levels of the medicine in their bloodstream that are too high and
can be toxic.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why has it taken this long to get these studies done?
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually, the agency had been on this bandwagon since the
1970s, trying to get products studied in children. But it became
clear that, unless something dramatic happened, all of the pleading
wasn't going to change [the situation). We were asking drug
companies to tell us what they were doing about pediatric drug
development. But those regulations had no teeth; it was a strictly
voluntary thing.
</P>
<P>
   And there were ethical issues as well. Most everybody would
agree that, in general, you don't want to be putting a brand-new
molecular entity into a kid before it's tested first in older
adults. But there's a difference between saying we need information
before we give it to kids and never getting any information.
</P>
<P>
   HIV brought this into glaring focus. For years, the drug AZT was
available for adults with HIV, but not for kids. Children were
dying, and we couldn't use AZT to treat them because it hadn't been
studied in children.
</P>
<P>
   Those studies finally took place, but it took years for the drug
to be available to kids as a regular prescription drug. Today,
because of that experience, in the HIV area we almost always get
studies done on children early in the drug development process.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've heard that, until recently, emergency room doctors who
wanted to use the sedative Versed on kids had to rely on animal
data from beagles.
</P>
<P>
   A. Versed is a drug that's very commonly used to sedate people
before operations. Under our new regulations, for the first time
the [manufacturer of Versed) studied its effect on children,
particularly children with heart disease. And they found that if a
child with pulmonary hypertension was given the same dose, he would
be more likely to have breathing problems. They also found out that
you may need different dosing in obese children. If you did it on a
weight basis, you might overdose the child.
</P>
<P>
   So yes, there are life and death issues here. But the most
common problem is: Parents want to know that if their kids aren't
getting better, it's because the disease is getting worse _ not
because they're giving their kid the wrong dose.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What drugs can parents safely assume have been tested?
</P>
<P>
   A. Most of the antibiotics, all the vaccines and most of the
fever suppressants. And a number of the seizure medicines have been
studied down into younger age groups. Most of the psychotropic
drugs have not been studied in children.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can you safely assume that a child, even a very sick one,
understands the risks involved enough to say that he consents to
being part of a clinical trial?
</P>
<P>
   A. The Academy of Pediatrics suggests that about the age of 7,
children cognitively begin to understand risk. Somewhere around 7,
the kid can begin to understand what you tell them. But that
process is very time-consuming and very difficult and has to be
done by people who know how to put it in language that kids can
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, you have to have to know how to do clinical trials in
children. A kid isn't going to sit there and hold their arm out and
say, ``Oh yeah, go ahead, just take my blood.'' You've got to
create a situation where children don't feel threatened, and where
they understand what's going on. You need one nurse to talk to the
child while the other one is drawing the blood. And you've got to
somehow turn it into a game.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the technology issue. Ordinarily, with an adult,
you'd draw a blood sample at several one-hour intervals. But you
can't take large volumes of blood from a kid over a short period,
unless you want to make them hypotensive. So we had to wait for the
technology to get accurate results from small volumes of blood to
monitor a drug's effect on the liver, kidneys and white cells.
Hospitals for children have had that technology for a couple of
decades now. But until now, not everybody had that.
</P>
<P>
   Also, we are only now starting to pin down, on the molecular,
receptor level and developmentally, how kids are different from
adults. And that whole field is in its early childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So this big, black hole of information is not simply the
fault of pharmaceutical firms who don't want to shoulder the costs
of these studies?
</P>
<P>
   A. I wouldn't say there's no economics here _ these trials are
difficult and expensive. Not many people were interested in doing
pediatric studies until Congress offered drug companies a
[financial incentive). Since then, the interest in studying
products in children has increased dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are these clinical trials going to test drugs on sick kids
only? Or are healthy kids going to be included as well?
</P>
<P>
   A. The FDA has decided that kids in clinical trials have to,
potentially at least, receive a direct benefit. In cancer trials,
that's a really a very well-practiced approach. You would never put
a cancer drug into a person who didn't have cancer. In general, the
kid should have the disease that's being studied.

<P>
   PODGORICA, Montenegro _ The Clinton administration says it
worries that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia might move
against Montenegro before or after Yugoslav federation elections
scheduled for Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   But in the small republic itself, where Montenegro's president,
Milo Djukanovic, has decided to boycott the elections, there is
less concern. The current situation seems to serve both Milosevic
and Djukanovic, with the boycott protecting the Montenegrin's
political base while effectively handing Milosevic control over the
new federal Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic, a Milosevic understudy who broke with the master and
turned toward the West in 1997, spurned efforts by Washington to
get him to take part.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that his coalition, optimistically named For a Better
Life, might break apart, and that to have the vote would legitimize
constitutional changes that Milosevic rammed through without
consulting Montenegro, Serbia's sister republic in what remains of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic also rejected an American proposal that he run
candidates for the federal Parliament _ even if they vowed not to
serve _ to deny Milosevic an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Djukanovic is afraid of a vote,'' one American
diplomat said. ``He's putting his own interests in Montenegro ahead
of the larger interest, which is to defeat Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says Drasko Djuranovic, the editor of the independent
weekly Monitor, Djukanovic is betting on Milosevic's remaining in
power, which is likely to produce an independent Montenegro in the
next few years _ the same bet being made by Kosovo's Albanian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic is beaten by the candidate of Serbia's democratic
opposition, Vojislav Kostunica, it will be harder to get Western
support for the further breakup of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Kostunica wins, he will offer a decent deal to
Montenegro,'' said Zoran Predic, an editor with the private
television station Elmag. ``If Milosevic disappears, the world's
interest in Milo Djukanovic will also disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Milosevic ``doesn't need a war after the
elections, but a better position for negotiations with the West,''
suggested Ranko Krivokapic, a leader of an independence-minded
party in Djukanovic's coalition. ``He may use Montenegro as a
bargaining chip.''
</P>
<P>
   If the point of the early election is to give Milosevic new
legitimacy, Krivokapic noted, Milosevic would be foolish to throw
it away again by moving openly against Montenegro. The ``American
panic is a bit overblown,'' Krivokapic said. ``The Americans are
more worried about their own elections than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``this is the Balkans and everything is possible,'' he
said. ``Milosevic could need a crisis, even before the election,
and he could decide to do something in just a few days. Everything
is prepared for various options.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is much talk here of the Seventh Battalion of the Yugoslav
Army, about 700 men who seem more like paramilitaries and who, it
is thought, could help provoke civil strife, providing a pretext
for the overthrow of Djukanovic without triggering an overt Western
military response.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milic, an adviser to Djukanovic, said Milosevic ``could
seem completely clean'' and say: ``It's those crazy Montenegrins.
We haven't sent a tank or a plane, so let me see what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Predic, from the independent television station, said the
problem was that ``a significant minority here is fanatically
pro-Milosevic, and another part that hates him wants to stay with
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A referendum for independence remains too risky, said
Djuranovic, the newspaper editor. ``Here in the Balkans the
question isn't the opinion of the majority,'' he said. ``It's what
the minority with guns will do, when they have the support of
another country.''
</P>
<P>
   While Djukanovic's government has officially discouraged the
state media from reporting on the campaign, the president is
allowing Montenegrins to vote in the election, trying to avoid an
open conflict with the 35 percent to 40 percent of the population
that favors unity with Serbia. Nor is Djukanovic pressing for an
early referendum on Montenegrin independence, a vote that would by
itself create security risks and more vividly display the
republic's divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Filip Vujanovic is accustomed to dancing around
the question. ``We need to be very patient and careful, and a
referendum should be taken as a last resort,'' he said in an
interview. But if Milosevic wins, as Vujanovic is convinced he
will, by manipulation if necessary, ``he will continue his
destructive approach to Montenegro,'' he said. ``That's why if he's
elected, in the next four years Montenegro will be at one point
forced to ask the citizens for their answer in a referendum. But
it's not our political decision to do it immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't willingly leave office,'' Vujanovic said of
Milosevic, ``and then the Serbian people and the international
community must work to push him out.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody in Montenegro is against Milosevic. In Herceg
Novi, a coastal town that voted out Djukanovic's coalition in local
elections this summer, opting instead for the pro-Belgrade
Socialist People's Party, there is skepticism about Djukanovic's
real aims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to get the names of the people who vote in the
election, because every vote is like a vote to keep Yugoslavia
together,'' said 50 year-old Jovan, providing only one name, who
said he intends to vote, but for the Serbian opposition candidate,
Kostunica. ``I worry about my pension.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro is divided, and Djukanovic's party and coalition are
divided, said Zeljko Ivanovic, editor of the independent daily
Vijesti. ``It's why Milosevic can sit and laugh. Whatever he's done
to Montenegro, they just issue a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Djukanovic wants independence, Ivanovic said: ``It's clear.
He needs to be able to say, `With Milosevic still in Serbia, we
have no other option.'''
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic is simply being prudent, trying not to give Belgrade
a pretext to provoke a civil war. In the meantime, Montenegro is
building the institutions of statehood, including a banking system
and an army.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the presence of the Yugoslav Army, pressure from
Belgrade includes a blockade of trade, which cuts off Montenegro
from Serbia's price-controlled food and other products, and forces
it to try to export abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's turn to the German mark as its currency has
protected it from the deflation of the Yugoslav dinar, but it has
also made prices more expensive and led to louder grumbling from
the many unemployed in this republic of just 650,000 people. And
not all of the jobless can work in Montenegro's thriving black and
gray economy, where smuggling goods to and from Italy is a way of
life.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are so many stolen cars in Montenegro _ or cars bought
cheaply in Europe and driven here, then declared stolen by their
owners _ that the joke goes: ``Come and visit Montenegro. We have
your car here waiting for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's limbo as a quasi-nation-state _ an independently
minded part of Yugoslavia _ has meant that it cannot get direct aid
from the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. But because
it is perceived as a bulwark against Belgrade, Montenegro does get
millions of dollars in government aid from Europe and the United
States to cover its budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   As many as half of Montenegro's salaried workers are paid by the
state, including the large regular and special police forces, with
their new white Land Rovers, who number up to 30,000 men and have
been built up, in part by trainers from Western armies, to counter
the Yugoslav Army.
</P>
<P>
   There is little international oversight of how the foreign money
is spent, said Arne Jan Flolo of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Everyone agrees that the privatization of
government-run enterprises is anything but transparent or clean.
</P>
<P>
   There is currently a fight within the governing party over a
fuzzy contract with the French hotel chain Accor to manage
Montenegro's nicest seaside hotels.
</P>
<P>
   One huge aluminum plant, with all of its associated industries,
represents half of Montenegro's gross domestic product, and much of
the profit goes to a Swiss holding company that provided loans in
1998 _ a contract that Washington and the aluminum company itself
seemed to be quietly trying to cancel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption is a time bomb ticking under the Djukanovic
government,'' Flolo said. ``But the West doesn't want to hear about
it. The international community is making a big mistake by not
attaching conditions to its aid and letting this go on so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebojsa Medojevic, an economist, is a Djukanovic critic: ``The
line here is that if you criticize Djukanovic you help Milosevic.
It creates space for manipulation and is an excellent pretext to
postpone any real economic reform. The problem is that the
international community supports Djukanovic without reservation,
despite dirty privatization and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Flolo said: ``There are free and fair elections here, but there
is little transparency of decision-making. There is democracy from
a distance, but you dig and there's a long way to go.''

 &HT;    Bush tries to gain Florida's 'attention'
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ His campaign in Florida no where near
the sure thing he hoped it would be, Texas Gov. George W. Bush said
Monday he is trying hard ``to gain people's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   He did gain the attention of more than a thousand supporters at
Palm Beach International Airport who heard a few quick words from
the Republican presidential nominee before he left for the home of
Bud Paxson founder of the PAX television network. Bush was there to
raise money for the Florida Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush flew into Clearwater aboard his chartered 757 to begin a
day and half of Florida campaigning. He is courting the older
voters he needs if he is going to stall the rising fortunes of Vice
President Al Gore's campaign in the Sunshine State.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders here are worried that Bush has not spent
enough time in Florida and that he is losing momentum on key
issues, especially those involving older voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I expect Florida to be a battleground state? No,'' said
U.S. Rep. E. Clay Shaw R-Fort Lauderdale. ``But now it has to be a
battleground.''
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with Florida reporters, Bush said that he has
changed his campaign style so that he is giving shorter speeches
and spending more time answering questions from his audiences. In
Clearwater he answered more than a dozen questions on a wide
variety of topics.
</P>
<P>
   It is an effort to better connect with voters, said Bush.
``People need to hear me answer questions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects many voters will tune in to the coming
debates and hat he has already started, ``pepper drills'' with
members of his staff who fire questions at him. He said he would
not contact Gore directly to resolve the remaining issues about the
debates ``because that's best left up to our seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   While winning Florida is going to be tougher than some state
Republican had hoped, Bush said he is convinced that his issues
will click with Florida voters.,
</P>
<P>
   Dangling the promise of lower prescription drug prices, more
flexible Medicare options and guaranteed Social Security payments,
Bush is trying to deflect inroads made by Gore among seniors who
represent a third of Florida's likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd of more than 300 at the On Top
of the World, retirement community in Clearwater, Bush warned them
to ``ignore the old style politics of fear.'' He said Gore is
trying to scare older voters by telling them that Bush would take
away their Social Security if he became president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't campaign by scaring people and then lead them,''
said Bush. ``I'm the kind of fella who does in office what I said I
was going to do on the campaign trail.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said if elected he will modernize Medicare giving seniors
more options for their coverage including prescription drug
benefits for low income seniors. During the first four years of his
administration, Bush said he would spend $48 billion to pay the
entire prescription drug cost for low income seniors. Part of the
money would go to all seniors who spend more than $6,000 a year for
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   He was cheered by the crowd when he promised to abolish
inheritance taxes which the Republicans call ``death taxes.''
Congress failed last week to override President Clinton's veto of
an inheritance tax repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Gore has accepted millions of dollars from
Hollywood, Bush said he was skeptical of Gore's recent promise to
use the FCC to force the entertainment industry to reduce the
violence seen by children. Bush said Gore refused to take a stand
on entertainment violence last year ``until now when we're in the
middle of a campaign,''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would push Hollywood producers to stop ``the
pollution of our children's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure about him but after listening to him I'm very
impressed,'' said Millie Turner of Clearwater, a 74-year old
retiree from Michigan. ``I like Jeb and I just think the Bush's are
a very decent family.''
</P>
<P>
   His younger brother said Bush will have to work hard here to win
Florida's 25 electoral votes in the November election. ``I think
he's going to have to make at least three more trips here. That
would be about the right amount,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor will be back in Florida on Sept. 22 with a
stops in Tampa and Miami. Other locations may be added that day,
according to the campaign. His brother said he hopes ``at some
point he won't have to come here at all.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be the point where Bush was so far ahead of Gore that
he would be certain of a Florida victory. So far, neither campaign
believes that is likely to happen.

   Sometimes two companies can have the same name, and sometimes
news services can make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in PSA Inc., an aspiring broadband services company based
in Los Angeles, trade on the over-the-counter bulletin board under
the ticker symbol PSAX, usually in low volume. By 12:10 p.m.
Monday, 2,500 shares had traded, and the price had risen 6 cents,
to $4.94.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Dow Jones News Service reported that PSA Inc. had filed
for bankruptcy. The report listed its ticker symbol as PSAX.
</P>
<P>
   The sell orders soon poured in, and by 12:35 the share price had
fallen to $1.75, or 65 percent less than the price before the
report. At 12:42, Dow Jones corrected the report, saying that the
company that filed for bankruptcy was a different PSA Inc. That PSA
is an unrelated, privately held company, Dow Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, the publicly traded PSA shares had
recovered to $4.19, down 69 cents for the day. Volume came to
213,700 shares, or more than had traded in the last three weeks
combined.

 &HT;    With sugar, low price does not hike demand
 &HT;    By Jeff Ostrowski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 327 U.S. Sugar workers laid off last week were victims of
supply and demand _ namely too much supply of the commodity they
produce, and not enough demand for it.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar prices have been depressed since last year simply because
there's more of it than soda makers, candy companies and consumers
need, sugar experts say. In explaining the layoffs last week,
Clewiston-based U.S. Sugar said its bottom line has been hurt by
the lowest sugar prices in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic sugar traded for 18.7 cents a pound Monday on the New
York Board of Trade's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   While the price of sugar has risen slightly in recent months,
it's not enough to make the crop profitable. Sugar growers say it
costs 19.5 cents to make a pound of sugar; when the price dips
below that number, they lose money by selling for the market rate.
</P>
<P>
   The annual demand for sugar in the United States is 10.5 million
tons, said Dalton Yancey, executive vice president of the Florida
Sugar Cane League, which lobbies in Washington on behalf of U.S.
Sugar, as well as Florida Crystals, which controls three Palm Beach
County sugar companies.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic growers produce 8.5 million tons, and trade agreements
require the United States to import 1.25 million tons. Add
stockpiles in warehouses and other sugar that enters the country
thanks to import loopholes, and there's a surplus, Yancey said.
</P>
<P>
   Once American consumers and companies such as Coca-Cola and
Nabisco have bought 10.5 million tons of sugar, they won't buy more
no matter how low the price dips. As a result, even a small surplus
hurts prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``An oversupply of 50,000 tons can knock a hole in the market,''
Yancey said.
</P>
<P>
   While lower prices for many goods translate to more demand, that
isn't the case with sugar. Demand for sugar is what economists call
``inelastic,'' meaning users don't buy more when the price drops or
less when the price rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``People hardly ever notice how much sugar costs in the
supermarket,'' said Reg McQuaid, who writes a sugar newsletter for
D.W. Dyer &AMP; Co. of New Jersey. ``You don't postpone your purchase
of sugar, no matter what the price. You just buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The supply of sugar exceeds demand because of increased domestic
production, growing imports and ineffective federal policy that
actually has encouraged more farmers to get into the market.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, depressed grain prices have led grain farmers in
the Dakotas to grow sugar beets instead. Their decision added to
the glut.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a World Trade Organization agreement requires the
United States to import 1.25 million tons a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican Republic is the largest foreign supplier to the
United States, McQuaid said. About half the sugar produced in the
Dominican Republic is the product of Florida Crystals, the company
run by the politically influential Fanjul family of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Growers in the Philippines, Brazil, Australia, Guatemala and
Argentina also export sugar to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government attempts to stabilize prices by limiting
imports, but there are loopholes. A Michigan company avoids sugar
import tariffs by shipping molasses syrup from Canada and
extracting the sugar once it's in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the sugar surplus promises to grow next month, when
the North American Free Trade Agreement allows Mexico to send at
least 250,000 tons of sugar a year to the United States, up from
the 25,000 tons now allowed.
</P>
<P>
   For American sugar companies, exporting the commodity isn't an
option. World sugar prices are even lower than domestic prices;
world sugar traded for 10 cents a pound Monday on the Coffee, Sugar
and Cocoa Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that's because sugar producers dump crops, heavily
subsidized by governments, on the world market.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has been unable to boost prices. In June,
taxpayers paid $54 million for 130,000 tons of surplus U.S. sugar
in an attempt to raise prices.

 &HT;    With sugar, low price does not hike demand
 &HT;    By Jeff Ostrowski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 327 U.S. Sugar workers laid off last week were victims of
supply and demand _ namely too much supply of the commodity they
produce, and not enough demand for it.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar prices have been depressed since last year simply because
there's more of it than soda makers, candy companies and consumers
need, sugar experts say. In explaining the layoffs last week,
Clewiston-based U.S. Sugar said its bottom line has been hurt by
the lowest sugar prices in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic sugar traded for 18.7 cents a pound Monday on the New
York Board of Trade's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   While the price of sugar has risen slightly in recent months,
it's not enough to make the crop profitable. Sugar growers say it
costs 19.5 cents to make a pound of sugar; when the price dips
below that number, they lose money by selling for the market rate.
</P>
<P>
   The annual demand for sugar in the United States is 10.5 million
tons, said Dalton Yancey, executive vice president of the Florida
Sugar Cane League, which lobbies in Washington on behalf of U.S.
Sugar, as well as Florida Crystals, which controls three Palm Beach
County sugar companies.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic growers produce 8.5 million tons, and trade agreements

NRA, DESPITE SUPPORT FOR BUSH, REFRAINS FROM OFFICIAL ENDORSEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defying expectations, the board of the National
Rifle Association declined to endorse Gov. George W. Bush for
president at its final meeting of the year on Saturday. The
development makes it unlikely that Bush will receive the group's
formal approval before Election Day, NRA officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean, however, that the rifle association will sit
out the election. Far from it: The association intends to spend
millions of dollars supporting Bush and trying to discredit his
Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, as a threat to gun
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the rifle association said Monday that they did
not want to provide the Democrats new fodder for attacking Bush, so
had decided to withhold a formal endorsement. Polls suggest that
the NRA, while popular in many Republican areas, is viewed
negatively by large numbers of the independent suburban voters whom
Bush is trying to court, particularly women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to do no harm'' to Bush, one NRA official said,
noting that the group was already pouring money into the race to
help the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has had a good working relationship with the rifle
association in Texas. But he has tried to maintain a polite
distance from the group during the campaign and aides said Monday
that Bush had not sought the group's endorsement or its neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has described the rifle association as ``the
Bush gun-policy team'' and has accused Bush of working ``hip
holster to hip holster'' with the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   And Handgun Control Inc. has been running an advertisement in
several swing states featuring a previously disclosed film clip of
Kayne Robinson, an NRA vice president, telling a friendly audience
that if Bush is elected, ``we'll have a president where we work out
of their office.''
</P>
<P>
   Once averse to getting involved in politics, the 129-year-old
rifle association did not begin endorsing presidential candidates
until the 1980s. But since then, it has been solidly in the
Republican camp, endorsing Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984, and
George Bush in 1988. The group did not endorse Bob Dole in 1996,
because of differences on some issues, but it spent millions of
dollars attacking President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sudbay, political director of Handgun Control, said he was
not surprised that the rifle association had not endorsed Bush,
because, ``they've become a real albatross for candidates,''
particularly among women.
</P>
<P>
   Sudbay added that the rifle association did not need to trumpet
its support for Bush because it was already making crystal clear to
its 4 million members _ through speeches by its leaders, Web site
postings and mailings _ that it wants him elected.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, rifle association officials said Monday that it would
soon be launching a new round of mailings and, perhaps, television
commercials attacking Gore in several important swing states where
gun ownership is high, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Missouri
and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Gore of trying to downplay his support for strong gun
laws, the official said, ``The guy's tried to reinvent himself on
our issue since the convention. He makes statements that even I
could agree with about supporting the Second Amendment. But come
on. Look at the record. And we will certainly be reminding our
members of that record.''

 &HT;    Gore, Lieberman to tour Ohio
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMISBURG, Ohio _ National television cameras and presidential
hopefuls will be focused today on the students of Anna K. Wantz
Middle School in Miamisburg as Vice President Al Gore kicks off a
day of campaigning by greeting students and meeting with parents,
children and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic nominee for president, will be accompanied
by his vice presidential pick Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., at
Wantz and two other southwest Ohio campaign stops where they will
speak on education.
</P>
<P>
   Education has been a key issue this campaign for both Gore and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee. Earlier this
year, Gore stayed at the home of a Columbus-area school teacher and
her family and he has toured schools throughout his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At Wantz Middle School, preparations for the visit added to an
already hectic pace of the new school year. School officials have
been juggling having their building searched and secured by Secret
Service agents and preparing for a previously scheduled open house
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The district learned Wednesday Wantz could be the site of a
campaign stop and learned at 2 p.m. Friday it would be the site,
said Wantz Principal Gary Schomburg .
</P>
<P>
   ``From then on it's been non-stop work, frantically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this school, and the district in general, is an
example that you don't have to be the most affluent in the state to
have a high degree of success,'' he added. ``We overachieve what
our economic level would tend to predict.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Wantz was named a National Blue Ribbon School of
Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   From Miamisburg, Gore and Lieberman will travel to Middletown
High School where they will have lunch with students and speak
briefly with them.
</P>
<P>
   They finish the southwest Ohio tour with a public rally 2:15
p.m. at Cincinnati State Technical and Community College, 3520
Central Parkway. Tickets for the rally are free and available at
the school's main lobby information desk.
</P>
<P>
   Gore on Monday evening was greeted on his arrival at Dayton
International Airport by the Northmont High School marching band.
The vice president shook hands with students in a crowd of more
than 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me his son plays middle linebacker for his school, and
I told him that's the position I play,'' said Ryan Woodie, a senior
football player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the band was really good,'' said Maria Schreel, a
senior flute player who spoke with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the theme of his visit, Gore kept brief his
conversations with the adults in the crowd and instead exchanged
greetings and waves with the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was more into the youth,'' said the band director, Reg
Richwind.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's entourage then moved downtown, as he began a night's stay
at the Doubletree Hotel across the street from Dayton's City Hall.
He had no public events scheduled for Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was scheduled to arrive at Dayton International
Airport around 1 a.m. today. The two are expected to greet Wantz
students as the school day begins.
</P>
<P>
   The visit marks the second local stop in a week by the two main
presidential campaigns. Bush spoke to 400 military veterans last
week during a campaign stop at Wright State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were worried we weren't going to see (the candidates) much
in Ohio, but now their practically living here,'' said U.S. Rep.
Tony Hall, D-Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio, with 21 electoral votes, is considered one of a handful of
key battleground states. A statewide mail poll by the Columbus
Dispatch , published this month, showed Bush leading Gore 49
percent to 43 percent, with 5 percent undecided. The margin for
error was plus or minus 2 percent.

WEB SITE TO STAR CHARACTERS THAT ACT LIKE WE DO 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to fuse entertainment, education and artificial
intelligence, a company in Newton, Mass., is starting a Web site
featuring interactive cartoon characters imbued with behaviors that
mimic human responses.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Zoesis Studios, is seeking to eventually create a
new medium of interactive entertainment parallel to television.
</P>
<P>
   Zoesis was founded in 1996 by Joseph Bates, a Carnegie Mellon
University computer scientist who develops interactive dramas, an
area of artificial intelligence research that tries to create
fantasy worlds and characters with whom humans can interact.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.thelivingletters.com, is scheduled to go online on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The free site, which can be accessed with a Windows-based
personal computer, will present Web users with two cartoon-style
characters with whom they can interact by using a mouse as a
pointer.
</P>
<P>
   The two characters, Otto and Iris, will exhibit behaviors like
fear of the dark, giggling when ``tickled'' by a user's mouse and a
variety of facial expressions. The characters can play tag with a
computer user in one scene, or sing in response to a user acting as
``conductor,'' wielding the mouse as a baton.
</P>
<P>
   Another character _ a ``villain'' _ will appear on the site
later on, the company said, to help build a story line and some
tension into the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Zoesis has initial backing from Fujitsu Ltd., the Japanese
consumer electronics giant. Fujitsu has previously financed
research on the ``virtual worlds,'' which permit users, represented
by figures known as avatars, to move about in fantasy environments.
</P>
<P>
   But the Zoesis project is unrelated to that work. Rather, it is
the outgrowth of research that Bates first did with several other
members of the start-up at Carnegie Mellon over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Oz Project, the research tried to use artificial
intelligence techniques to create a new medium by blending
characters, presentation and drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is broadly an extension that was started in the 1980s on
behavior-based robots,'' Bates said.
</P>
<P>
   The group has worked at creating software ``agents'' whose
behavior appears to be goal-based and who can even be imbued with
emotional qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at other academic centers like the MIT Media
Laboratory and Stanford University have long worked on similar
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Hayes-Roth, a Stanford artificial intelligence
researcher, has also founded a company, Extempo Systems Inc., to
develop interactive software agents. Extempo has developed its
agents for Internet customer service applications, in which, for
instance, a character might answer questions from computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Some social scientists and industry executives say that
interactive drama has the potential to replace the television
sitcom as an entertainment medium.
</P>
<P>
   Bates said he believed that such a transition was possible, but
he was not certain how quickly the interactive entertainment medium
might evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear what will make this more compelling than
sitcoms,'' he said, ``but certainly if you have character and story
you're in the right ballpark.''

GORE EMPHASIZES DEVOTION TO FAMILY IN VISIT TO OPRAH WINFREY SHOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVILLE, Ill. _ Oprah Winfrey knew that it might be a rough
day at the office. Before introducing Vice President Al Gore to her
audience Monday, television's high priestess of self-revelation
told her fans that she had always ``stayed away from politicians''
as guests because she never felt she could have an honest
conversation with them. ``After 15 years,'' she said, ``I thought,
OK, I need to try to penetrate that wall.''
</P>
<P>
   But after an hour with Gore seated beside her in a yellow
leather armchair, Winfrey had done little more than chip away at
the mortar. In the interview, which was broadcast from Winfrey's
studio in Chicago, Gore revealed little that was new, though
viewers did learn that his favorite book is ``The Red and the
Black'' by 19th century French novelist Robert Stendahl; that his
favorite movie is the 1983 Scottish film ``Local Hero,'' and that
his favorite cereal is Wheaties.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Gore may have achieved much of what he wished in the
interview. On a show with 22 million viewers a week, three-fourths
of them women, the Democratic presidential nominee portrayed
himself as a sensitive and devoted family man.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite indulgence, he said, is water skiing with his
family on a Tennessee lake. If the demands of the presidency became
toxic for his family life, he said he would simply ``change the
nature of the job.'' When Winfrey asked him how he responded when
he first learned that his wife, Tipper, suffered from depression,
he said, ``To feel the love and search for the healing.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey also asked Gore about the lengthy kiss he gave his wife
at the Democratic Convention, and twice showed videotape of the
prolonged smooch. Gore then explained that ``this is a partnership
and she is my soulmate,'' a choice of words that elicited
appreciative applause from the largely female audience.
</P>
<P>
   Gore appeared at ease with Winfrey, who will interview his
Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush, on Sept. 19. But for most of
the show, Gore stuck closely to his campaign script. When Winfrey
asked him why she should vote for him, he responded, ``I'm for the
people, not the powerful.'' When she relayed a question from an
online viewer about the greatest problem facing the country, he
replied that ``we need more meaning in our national life.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his least scripted responses came after the cameras
blinked off, when Gore lingered in the studio for about 20 minutes
to take more questions from Winfrey and the audience. When a woman
asked about Bush's ``problems'' with alcohol, Gore said he did not
make any judgments about his opponent, that he took Bush at his
word that ``he's had a personal transformation and a period of
growth.'' Bush, 54, has said he drank more than he should have
until he swore off alcohol 14 years ago, but that he never
considered himself an alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey also asked Gore after the taping whether there were
things he could say now about President Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky that he could not say at the time. ``Did you and
Tipper talk about it over dinner and say, `Can you believe?'' she
asked. ``I'm not giving you any exact quotes,'' Gore said. ``You're
in the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   In the broadcast, Winfrey had fun playing a game of ``favorite
things'' with Gore. Favorite subject in school, she asked. ``Hmmm,
science,'' he responded. Favorite teacher: ``Dean Stambaugh, who
was my art teacher.'' Favorite quote: ``Hmm, ah, Bob Dylan: those
who are not busy being born are busy dying.'' Favorite time of
year: ``Springtime.'' Favorite thing to sleep in: ``A bed,'' Gore
responded in an instant. All-time favorite musical group:
``Beatles.'' Favorite indulgence: ``Hmm, oh, going to the lake near
our home in Tennessee on a houseboat and just waterskiing with the
kids and floating and swimming.'' Favorite meal: ``Chinese.''
Favorite childhood memory: ``Playing baseball with my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Chicago, Gore flew to Belleville, Ill., for an
open meeting on education at Westhaven Elementary School. There, he
repeated his ultimatum, first issued on Sunday, that the
entertainment industry immediately stop marketing violent films,
recordings and video games to children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Monday told reporters that Gore was ``short of credibility
on the issue'' because the Democrats have received more than $13
million in contributions from the entertainment industry. The
Republicans have received nearly $9 million from the same source.
Bush said that as president he would ``absolutely talk with CEO's
in Hollywood, those who produce the products that oftentimes
pollute our children's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at the school forum, Gore was asked by a woman about what
he could do as president to bring prayer back to the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   After joking that there would always be prayer in schools as
long as there are arithmetic tests, Gore said that ``in some school
settings the impression is given that it's wrong if a student wants
to exercise or display his or her faith or engage in a truly
voluntary prayer that the school employees have nothing to do
with.'' Supreme Court prohibitions against organized school prayer,
he said, have sometimes been ``taken to an extreme that actually
discriminates against some people of faith who wish to bring faith
into their school life.''

FORMATION OF SUPPLY WEB SITE FOR BIG AUTOMAKERS IS APPROVED 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal antitrust regulators Monday approved the
establishment of an online venture that would allow five major
automakers _ including the top three in America _ to buy supplies
through a single Internet portal.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission approved the formation of Covisint,
the business-to-business Web site, which proponents said would
streamline the annual purchase of as much as $300 billion in parts
for the Ford Motor Co., the General Motors Corp. and
DaimlerChrysler AG
</P>
<P>
   On the proposed site, automakers are expected to list parts they
seek from suppliers, who will then offer bids to secure a contract.
The procedure is commonly referred to as a reverse auction.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, automotive suppliers, who spend $500 billion a
year, could turn to the site for everything from engine parts to
office supplies, the proponents said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nissan Motor Co. of Japan and Renault of France are also
parties to the exchange, as are two information technology
companies, Commerce One Inc. and the Oracle Corp. The Toyota Motor
Corp. is negotiating to join the joint venture, Covisint officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   American automakers praised the FTC's long-awaited ruling in
favor of Covisint, which they said would enhance efficiency and
yield significant savings by streamlining the procurement process.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kelley, Ford's head of electronic commerce, said the
exchange would ease online price quoting and collaboration on
product designs, which in turn will ``drive productivity throughout
our supply network.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC decision ended a six-month investigation in which
regulators explored concerns that the exchange might enable the big
automakers to collude to force down the prices of suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The commission _ which voted 4 to 0 in favor of the exchange _
warned that it will remain vigilant against such anticompetitive
maneuvers and said it ``reserved the right to take such further
action as the public interest may require.'' Commissioner Thomas B.
Leary did not take part in the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it is not yet operational, and because its founders
represent such a large share of the automobile market, the
commission cannot say that implementation of the Covisint venture
will not cause competitive concerns,'' the FTC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas T. Stallkamp, an expert on automobile industry
purchasing, said Monday's ruling was a ``good step forward'' for
the formation of the site. But he added, ``There is still a long
road to getting Covisint up and running.''
</P>
<P>
   Stallkamp, a former president of Chrysler, said the developers
of Covisint would have to demonstrate their ``true neutrality,'' so
the exchange is accepted by suppliers and not seen as weighted in
favor of the major purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the developers to grant suppliers some ownership in the
Internet site. Automakers have so far ruled that out, attempting to
lure dozens of suppliers into the network by offering them the
chance to link their sites to the portal's vast revenue pool.
</P>
<P>
   By sharing equity, the automakers may allay concerns that they
might use Covisint ``as a cost-reduction tool against suppliers,
rather than a communications tool for the suppliers,'' said
Stallkamp, who now is chief executive of MSX International, a
Michigan company that helps businesses hire engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Covisint officials have yet to name a chief executive, define
who will own the portal's data _ a potentially valuable trove of
purchasing information _ or devise safeguards to protect suppliers'
proprietary information.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange also must still receive approval from Germany's
antitrust regulatory agency, which is expected soon. Alice Miles,
Covisint's interim co-chief executive, predicted the electronic
marketplace will be operational within a month of that final
approval.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters, Miles, a Ford employee, said Covisint
might pursue an initial public offering next year after at least
two quarters of operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Covisint is poised to create a leading global e-business
trading exchange,'' Miles said. ``The completion of the FTC review
represents a significant milestone in our efforts to establish a
transformational business-to-business entity.''
</P>
<P>
   Covisint is the first business-to-business venture to be
reviewed by the FTC. Such Internet sites are seen as a boon to
global trade with implications that reach to all sorts of
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Business-to-business electronic marketplaces ``offer great
promise as means through which significant cost savings can be
achieved, business process can be more efficiently organized and
competition may be enhanced,'' said Robert Pitofsky, the FTC
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned, however, that his agency would scrutinize
additional ventures to ensure they ``are organized and implemented
in ways that maintain competition.''

BUSH SAYS HIS HEALTH PLAN WOULD AVOID GORE'S `GOVERNMENT-RUN HMO'

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ Gov. George W. Bush told elderly people in
Florida on Monday that his plans for changing Medicare and
providing prescription drug benefits would give them control over
their health care, while Vice President Al Gore would give them
only ``a government-run HMO.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like to me we need to trust seniors to be able to tailor
a plan to meet each person's needs,'' Bush said during a town
hall-style meeting at a large retirement complex early Monday
afternoon here. ``The federal government ought to be humble enough
to allow you to make choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visit was intended to help sell the proposal he unveiled
last week to coax Medicare recipients to select from a variety of
government-subsidized private health insurance plans that include
prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But it also underscored the potency of the threat that Bush is
suddenly experiencing from Gore. Although his aides once talked
about Florida, where Bush's brother Jeb is governor, as an almost
certain win, recent polls classify the state as a toss-up, and Bush
was scheduled to spend part of Tuesday and the end of next week
here as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan quite a few visits here,'' Bush said on the tarmac of
the St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport, where he
arrived from Austin, Texas, at about noon. His brother greeted him
at the airport and later introduced him at the retirement complex,
a campaign stop that reflected the disproportionate number _ and
influence _ of elderly voters in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In his talk at the retirement center Bush offered a broadly
drawn portrait of Gore's plans for prescription drug coverage. ``My
opponent's point of view,'' he added, was to create ``only one
government-run HMO. You'll be thrown into it _ in a government-run
HMO.''
</P>
<P>
   With his description of a big, scary, arrogant federal
government, Bush sought to distill the policy differences between
him and Gore, who has called for strengthening Medicare and adding
prescription drug coverage within the entitlement program.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was also providing a hint of how he might _ and might
not _ incorporate the copious and often unsolicited advice that his
campaign has been receiving from Republican strategists and other
political analysts ever since Gore emphatically erased Bush's lead
in polls.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those experts maintain that Bush should float above the
details of issues, like health care, on which Democrats in general
and Gore in particular seem to enjoy more voter confidence.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Bush heeded that counsel, using health care as a
prism through which he wanted voters to see the philosophical
disagreement between him and Gore about the role of the federal
government. Bush essentially cast himself as the genuine populist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't have this concept that the federal government is
all wise and all knowing,'' he said. He also said that his Medicare
plan could and would actually happen, an allusion to failed
health-care initiatives during the Clinton administration and an
assertion that he could be more effective in office than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also waded into the brambles of the issue itself,
telling his audience in Clearwater that under Gore's plan, they
would have to make binding decisions about their coverage before
they turned 65 and would, in some cases, pay more for prescription
drugs than they currently do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell your friends and neighbors to use the calculator to make
sure you look at the fine print _ the fine print _ before people
buy into a program that's going to mean more of the same,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said that
Bush's characterizations of Gore's proposal were misleading or
erroneous and that Gore, in strengthening Medicare, would be giving
elderly people a guarantee of benefits that Bush would not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush puts seniors off on the tender mercies of the insurance
companies,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's focus on health care marked the beginning of a week in
which his aides said he would confront Gore repeatedly and directly
on issues, like the environment and education, that are typically
considered Democrats' strong suits.
</P>
<P>
   They said that their goal was to remind people that Bush is ``a
different kind of Republican,'' one of the campaign's longstanding
catch phrases, and that Bush is armed with ``real plans for real
people,'' the campaign's newest slogan. The Bush campaign's target,
clearly, is the pivotal group of undecided centrist voters without
predetermined allegiances to either party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's stylistic efforts to reinvigorate his candidacy were also
on display. Instead of looking down at his audience of several
hundred from a stage or podium, he stood at eye-level with most of
them, pivoting this way and that as he answered questions about a
variety of issues.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed more relaxed and confident, and he talked for about 50
minutes, easily triple the time of a standard stump speech just a
week and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just before his remarks, Bush met privately with three elderly
women who, according to campaign officials, would fare better under
Bush's proposals for Medicare and prescription drug coverage than
they would under Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   This represented the campaign's newly aggressive attempt to put
human faces on Bush's policy proposals. But while Bush's aides
cited facts and figures to buttress their claim about the trio of
elderly supporters, reporters did not meet or have access to them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was acutely conscious of the age and political interests of
his audience in Clearwater, making a point of telling them that he
would protect their Social Security benefits and that those
benefits would not be endangered by his sweeping tax cut proposal.
He moved through the arithmetic of that equation more fluidly than
he had in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   To his aides, it was proof that their campaign was flying along
just fine. En route to Florida, Karen Hughes, the director of
communications, told reporters that ``after our much-publicized
retooling efforts last week, I thought you all would be glad to
know that we're going to be on Top of the World today _
literally.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes was right. It was the name of the Clearwater retirement
complex.

STUDY REPORTS RACIAL, GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITY IN FEDERAL DEATH
SENTENCING 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAYMOND BONNER AND MARC LACEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the first official review of the federal death
penalty since it was reinstated in 1988, the Justice Department has
found disturbing disparities by race and geography, according to
officials who have seen the report.
</P>
<P>
   In 75 percent of the cases in which a federal prosecutor sought
the death penalty in the last 5 years, the defendant has been a
minority, and in more than half of the cases, an African-American,
according to the report, which officials said the Justice
Department would release on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a lack of geographic uniformity in the application of
federal capital punishment, the Justice Department has found that a
handful of the 93 U.S. attorneys account for nearly half of the
cases that had been sent to the Justice Department for review,
according to officials who have seen the report.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, about 20 U.S. attorneys did not file a single
death penalty case since 1995. SInce there are more than 40 crimes
for which the federal death penalty is a potential punishment, the
lack of cases in those jurisdictions raised the question of the
equitable application of death penalty prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's troubling,'' said an administration official who has
reviewed the findings. ``The president has expressed concern about
the problem, and this backs that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the report was a compilation of about 400 pages
of data, and that it contained almost no analysis. Justice
Department officials were still writing the report's introduction
late Monday evening, officials said. They added that at a news
conference on Tuesday, Attorney General Janet Reno will announce
more studies to provide analysis of the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The report is expected to increase calls for a moratorium on the
federal death penalty. The American Bar Association, which does not
have a position for or against the death penalty, sent a letter to
President Clinton on May 2 asking him to impose an executive
moratorium pending a thorough review of the federal capital
punishment system. An association official said Monday that Clinton
had not responded.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and Rep. Jesse Jackson
Jr., D-Ill., introduced legislation calling for a national death
penalty moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the Justice Department report has been given to
lawyers for Juan Raul Garza, who is scheduled to be executed on
Dec. 12. His lawyers are planning to file a clemency request with
the Justice Department on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He was originally scheduled to be executed on Aug. 5, but
Clinton granted him a reprieve so that his lawyers could use new
clemency rules drafted by the Justice Department for capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   While a death penalty for at least some federal crimes has been
on the books since 1988, it has yet to be carried out. The last
federal execution was 37 years ago, when Victor Feguer was hanged
in Iowa for kidnapping and killing a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   After the Supreme Court declared in 1972 that the death penalty,
as it was then being applied, was unconstitutional, states quickly
adopted laws that the court upheld. In 1988, Congress adopted what
has become known as the drug kingpin statute, which allows for the
death penalty against an individual who commits murder as part of a
larger drug running enterprise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, in 1994, Congress enacted the Federal Death
Penalty Act, which greatly expanded the number of crimes for which
a defendant can be executed.
</P>
<P>
   They range from murder of the president of the United States, to
large-scale drug trafficking even when no one is killed, and
include drive-by murders, sexual abuse resulting in death, murder
during a bank robbery, carjacking and destruction of a plane, train
or motor vehicle resulting in death.

DEMOCRATS SEE, AND SMELL, `RATS' IN GOP AD

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first glance, the Republican television
commercial on prescription drugs looks like a run-of-the-mill
attack advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   The announcer starts by lauding Bush's proposal for dealing with
prescription drugs, and criticizing Vice President Al Gore's plan.
Fragments of the phrase ``bureaucrats decide'' _ deriding Gore's
proposal _ then dance around the screen.
</P>
<P>
   But then, if you watch very closely, something else happens. The
word ``RATS,'' a fragment of the word ``bureaucrats,'' pops up in
one frame. And though the image lasts only one-thirtieth of a
second, it is in huge white letters, larger than any other word on
the commercial. The tagline of the advertisement declares, ``The
Gore Prescription Plan: Bureaucrats Decide.''
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, though, in a tightly contested
presidential race, the Democrats have given the 30-second
advertisement more than a quick glance. After being alerted by an
eagle-eyed Democrat in Seattle, aides to Gore examined the
advertisement frame by frame, spotted the suspicious word, and gave
a copy of a slowed-down version to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Castellanos, who produced the 30-second commercial for the
Republican National Committee, insisted that the use of the word
was ``purely accidental,'' saying, ``We don't play ball that way.
I'm not that clever.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked, then, when he noticed the word in the commercial,
Castellanos said, ``That's all I want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But several Republican and Democratic admakers who were told of
the commercial, as well as many independent academics, said they
were startled that such a word would appear and said it appeared to
be a subliminal attempt by the Republicans to discredit Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's chief media consultant, Mark McKinnon, who signed off on
the advertisement, said he had not noticed ``RATS.'' Told of the
word, he said the commercial should be corrected because it
``certainly might give reporters or anybody else who looked at it''
a reason to stir up attention.
</P>
<P>
   But after reviewing the ad, he amended his comment.
</P>
<P>
   ```Rats' is not a message,'' McKinnon said. `` `Bad plan' or
`seniors lose' might be. But `rats?' We're just not that clever. I
just watched it five times in a row. Hard as I looked, couldn't see
`rats.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every professional admaker interviewed said that given
the technology by which commercials are assembled frame by frame,
it was virtually impossible for a producer to not know the word was
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way that anything Alex Castellanos does is an
accident,'' said Greg Stevens, a veteran Republican admaker here.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Baker, chief of the office of political programming at the
Federal Communications Commission, said if the word was
deliberately inserted in the commercial, that would be ``an
extraordinary development'' and reflect ``reckless'' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   While he said the commission does not explicitly prohibit
subliminal advertising, Baker explained that ``we have policy
statements and public notices that indicate they are inherently
intended to be deceptive and might be contrary to the public
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell West, a political scientist and expert on political
advertising at Brown University, said: ``It is really extraordinary
that something like this would appear. This is the first time I've
heard of anything like this in a presidential campaign ad. The risk
of a major voter backlash from something like this could be very
high because, above all else, voters don't like to be fooled.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Ferguson, the president of Young &AMP; Rubicam, who heads the
Bush campaign's group of Madison Avenue advertising consultants,
seemed astonished when told of the ad. ``Are you serious? That's
unbelievable,'' he said. ``I hope we haven't stooped to that.
That's pretty bad. I thought that was illegal anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The party has spent an estimated $2.5 million on the commercial,
which is still being broadcast in 33 markets. The advertisement has
run roughly 4,000 times.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Strother, the president of the American Association of
Political Consultants and a veteran Democratic admaker, said,
``There is absolutely no way this can be an accident. I'd be
stunned if it was a mistake. If that's an accident it's counter to
everything I know about political consulting. When you're running a
presidential race, you're really, really super sensitive to every
frame of that spot. You're looking at what words are on the
baseball cap that people wear.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that subliminal messages embedded in advertisements
could influence people became popular in the 1950s, when James
Vicary, an advertising executive, reported that he had increased
the sales of Coke and popcorn during a moving by flashing ``Drink
Coke'' and ``East Popcorn,'' on the screen. (Vicary's report turned
out to be a hoax.)
</P>
<P>
   Three decades of research on subliminal advertising, however,
have convinced the majority of psychologists that the public is not
so easily manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subliminal advertising and psychotherapuetic effects from
subliminal tapes are ideas whose scientific status appears to be on
a par with wearing copper bracelets to cure arthritis,'' wrote Dr.
Timothy E. Moore of York University in Toronto in The Skeptical
Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   But Ronald C. Goodstein, a marketing professor at Georgetown
University's business school who has studied subliminal advertising
extensively, said the word ``RATS'' could have the effect of
``making people feel more negative toward Gore'' although he said
there was ``no way that people are going to switch votes because of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Gore campaign, the word was first spotted by
Gary Greenup, a 64-year-old retired Boeing technical writer in
Seattle. Greenup taped the commercial soon after it was first
broadcast in late August and slowed the tape down to reveal the
word. ``It somehow caught my eye,'' he said. Usually, he added, ``I
don't look this closely at ads _ mostly I'd just as soon not view
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenup called the King County Democratic Party, which alerted
the Gore campaign. Greenup said that while he was a Democrat he was
not active in local politics. ``I'm not working in the party,'' he
said. ``I contribute a little annually _ it's very very small.''
</P>
<P>
   One Republican admaker who defended Castellanos was Sal Russo.
``I'm not as conspiracy minded as everyone else is,'' he said. ``I
can't imagine that that's deliberate. I've got to think it's
inadvertent.''
</P>
<P>
   Castellanos is a veteran advertising strategist who is known as
one of the toughest in the business. His most infamous
advertisement, broadcast in 1990 for Sen. Jesse Helms of North
Carolnia, showed the hands of a white man tearing up a letter he
received from a prospective employer. The advertisement was
intended to stir resentment among white voters toward Helms' black
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   When Castellanos worked for Bob Dole's presidential campaign
four years ago, he produced some hard-edged commercials that
campaign officials rejected. One featured a montage highlighting
President Clinton as corrupt set to the song, ``You Cheated, You
Lied.''

BUSH SAYS HIS HEALTH PLAN WOULD AVOID GORE'S `GOVERNMENT-RUN HMO'
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ Gov. George W. Bush told elderly people in
Florida Monday that his plans for changing Medicare and providing
prescription drug benefits would give them control over their
health care, while Vice President Al Gore would give them only ``a
government-run HMO.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like to me we need to trust seniors to be able to tailor
a plan to meet each person's needs,'' Bush said during a town

afternoon here. ``The federal government ought to be humble enough
to allow you to make choices.''

health-care initiatives during the Clinton administration and an
assertion that he could be more effective in office than Gore.

MEDICARE DIRECTOR WILL QUIT FOR HARVARD TEACHING JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Health
Care Financing Administration, the federal agency that runs
Medicare and Medicaid, announced Monday that she was resigning on
Oct. 1 to take a temporary job teaching at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle said she would become a fellow at the Institute of
Politics, which is affiliated with the John F. Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Her resignation comes near the end of a presidential campaign in
which Medicare is a major issue.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle said she had known Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic candidate for president, for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of his biggest fans,'' said DeParle, who, like Gore,
is from Tennessee. ``I want to do everything I can to help him be
elected and to do a great job with the Medicare program. The vice
president is a friend. But I don't have any plans to join a Gore
administration. I feel ready to get back to the private sector, and
that's what I'll be pursuing over the next several months.''
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Financing Administration helps pay medical bills
for more 75 million Americans and has a budget of more than $330
billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   DeParle worked at the White House Office of Management and
Budget from 1993 to 1997. She became deputy administrator of the
Medicare-Medicaid agency in July 1997, and four months later she
was confirmed by the Senate as head of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message to agency employees Monday, DeParle said:
``Through your hard work, we have accomplished some of the Clinton
administration's most important policy goals. We extended the life
of the Medicare trust fund through 2025 and began significant
initiatives to modernize Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   DeParle supervised the first years of the Children's Health
Insurance Program, created by Congress in 1997. She supervised
hundreds of changes in the way Medicare pays doctors, hospitals,
nursing homes and other health care providers. Her top priority
last year was to fix government computers for the year 2000, so
benefit payments would not be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put beneficiaries first in everything we've done,'' DeParle
said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress of both parties worked closely with DeParle.
But Republicans, some Democrats and many health care providers have
criticized the agency as a heavy-handed regulator.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said the agency had been slow to recognize two major
problems in the last few years. Officials initially underestimated
the importance of decisions by health maintenance organizations to
pull out of the Medicare program, forcing hundreds of thousands of
elderly people to make other arrangements for health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials were also slow to notice that hundreds of
thousands of poor people had been improperly deprived of Medicaid
coverage when they lost welfare benefits. In the 1996 welfare law,
Congress tried to restrict eligibility for cash assistance while
preserving access to Medicaid, but many states inadvertently cut
off Medicaid for people leaving the welfare rolls.

AS PLEA BARGAIN OF LOS ALAMOS SCIENTIST SNAGS, U.S. RE-EVALUATES
SPY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: See also LEE-RELEASE) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   with WILLIAM J. BROAD and NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An investigation that began eight years ago to
determine how China obtained classified information from American
weapons labs about one of the country's most advanced nuclear
warheads appears to be back where it started, with the mystery
still unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wen Ho Lee, a nuclear weapons scientist at the U.S.
government's Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New Mexico, became
the leading suspect in the investigation of the alleged theft of
warhead data, he was never charged with espionage or accused of any
crime connected with the loss of information for a device known as
the W-88. Nor did the government ever obtain any direct evidence
linking Lee to the suspected theft of W-88 data.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said on Monday they were prepared to accept
a plea bargain in which Lee would plead guilty to a single count of
improperly downloading secret information. The material Lee
downloaded was unrelated to the suspected warhead design theft that
triggered the government's investigation of possible Chinese
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement effectively means that prosecutors have ended
their pursuit of Lee as a possible source of any stolen warhead
data, once described by government experts as ``the crown jewels''
of America's nuclear secrets. It also leaves them with no clear
answer about how the Chinese obtained the warhead data, or from
whom.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year ago, when questions were raised about whether the
Justice Department had focused prematurely and unfairly on Lee,
Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh ordered
what law enforcement officials described as a top-to-bottom
re-investigation of the suspected W-88 theft. But intelligence
experts and scientists said they had made little progress.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the expected release of Lee was canceled as
prosecutors and defense lawyers in Albuquerque, who had signed a
plea agreement on Sunday, backed away from the settlement. But U.S.
District Judge James Parker said he would reschedule a hearing for
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must regretfully say that we cannot proceed with the hearing
this afternoon,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers following the case said later that Lee's lawyers were
unsettled about a document in which Lee outlined the admissions he
was prepared to make in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear precisely what aspect of Lee's prospective
admissions had jeopardized the deal, or how serious the dispute
might be. Both sides said they hoped the issues could be resolved
by Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1999, Lee was charged in a 59-count felony
indictment with gathering a massive amount of research and design
data from the computers at Los Alamos ``with the intent to secure
an advantage for a foreign power.''
</P>
<P>
   In trying to explain how the case collapsed, government
officials acknowledged in interviews Monday that they had no clear
idea what Lee intended to do with the information he downloaded.
This proved an almost insurmountable problem, because many of the
offenses with which Lee was charged would have required prosecutors
to prove Lee's motives.
</P>
<P>
   The officials who spoke about how the case was viewed from
inside the government as it evolved during the last several months
said that prosecutors on the trial team had concluded recently that
the case was flawed, and that they would never be able to
demonstrate convincingly at a trial why Lee had downloaded the
information, or what he had done with it.
</P>
<P>
   After interviews and polygraph examinations, FBI agents searched
Lee's office and home in early 1999. They discovered that he had
downloaded 806 megabytes of information, which law enforcement
officials said, amounted to 400,000 pages of information. Lee
transferred the data to computer tapes which he said he either
saved or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the turning point that led them to agree to
the plea bargain was the realization that they would never fully
know Lee's motives in downloading the information.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, government officials said, prosecutors and
investigators had competing theories as to which government Lee
might have been aiding. Some investigators had theorized that Lee
might have been aiding China, where he had visited and where he had
made contacts with local scientists. Others reasoned that because
he was a native of Taiwan, he might have been helping that
government.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time doubts and misgivings were mounting within the
government, prosecutors became concerned as the case started to
unravel in the courtroom. And just as importantly, according to law
enforcement officials, the prosecutors realized that public opinion
about the case had begun to shift against the government and in
favor of Lee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lee's supporters, with his daughter serving as an effective
spokeswoman, mounted an aggressive effort to portray the
government's tactics against him as a racist campaign against
Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, prosecutors began to grow more receptive to overtures
to settle the case _ especially after an embarrassing appearance by
a senior FBI agent at a bail hearing last month who said that he
had testified falsely that Lee lied to a colleague about the
purpose of his downloading.
</P>
<P>
   According to law enforcement officials, the 59 felony charges in
the indictment were a tactical step aimed at pressuring Lee into
pleading to what some officials suggested could be far more serious
charges.
</P>
<P>
   A number of government officials who were convinced that Lee
provided classified information to the Chinese government remain
unpersuaded of his innocence, although they acknowledge as one
former senior government official did Monday that, ``There was
smoke but nothing you could hang your hat on.''
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   The effort to investigate Lee for espionage began to unravel
almost as soon as it began in 1995 when Energy Department officials
turned over to the FBI a list of people, including Lee, who they
said might be responsible for a sudden and unexplained advance in
Chinese nuclear warhead technology.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department investigators concluded that the Chinese could
have only obtained the crucial information about the W-88 warhead,
the most advanced American nuclear weapon, by stealing it from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the investigation was hobbled by internal
disagreements whether China might have obtained the information
from other sources. Some counterintelligence officials accused the
FBI of failing to take the allegations seriously enough, and FBI
agents became embroiled in time-consuming debates with the Justice
Department over whether the agents could legally justify
wiretapping to collect evidence against Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said that Lee has agreed to cooperate fully and
has promised to tell them in more detail what he did with the
tapes. But the officials said that they are not optimistic that Lee
is likely to add much to his statements that he downloaded the
information for personal use.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   What remains of the inquiry is an investigation into whether
there exists another explanation or suspect for the loss of the
W-88 technology, which began with a government effort to pinpoint
the source of the leak. The new investigation included looking for
any possible clues and textual ``finger prints'' on a Chinese
document that the CIA had obtained in 1995 and had long resided at
the heart of the spy case.
</P>
<P>
   It has previously been reported that its Chinese text cited five
key attributes of the W-88 warhead, including two measurements
accurate to within four-hundredths of an inch. That information was
the smoking gun that proved beyond a doubt that the Chinese had
obtained national secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, experts said, a federal panel made up of people
from the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence
Agency, the State Department and the Energy Department and its
weapons laboratories was surprised to learn that such secret
information on the W-88 had been distributed widely beyond Los
Alamos, intelligence experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of one detailed description of the warhead were
distributed to 548 addresses, including ones in the Defense
Department, the military services, the National Guard, federal
agencies and contractors like the Lockheed Missile and Space Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the lost secrets, it appeared, were available to
thousands of individuals scattered throughout the nation's arms
complex and thus available from myriad sources.

   McLEAN, Va. _ With his ``pitchfork brigades'' gone the way of
his gall bladder, Pat Buchanan, the persistent presidential
candidate, was feeling well on the mend from surgery on Monday when
his front doorbell rang and he was greeted with another subpoena
from the tireless antagonists he has stirred in the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Ross Perot people,'' Buchanan fairly sighed at the
pains of fate. After four weeks of medical recuperation and not a
single day of campaigning, the candidate is laboring to regain his
edge. Yet he must resume a fight not so much against the major
party nominees as within his fractious adopted party.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh Reform steed Buchanan envisioned saddling for himself
has behaved more like a dragon threatening to devour his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's nine-month struggle for the Reform nomination is
continuing into a chaotic campaign homestretch. He must deal with
state-by-state skirmishes over ballot legitimacy that he never
foresaw when he left the Republican Party last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Perot's funding all this,'' Buchanan said of the
flurry of court challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else are they getting the money?'' Buchanan asked as he
put the subpoena aside and focused on sweeter possibilities this
week that might resurrect his candidacy, now moribund at 1 percent
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vote Lazarus!'' the combative conservative exulted grimly. His
laughter cracked forth here in his home in a sylvan enclave
neighboring the Central Intelligence Agency's suburban compound.
</P>
<P>
   A touch of the old pugilist's gleam returned to a figure
harrowed by hospitalization. He anticipates a firm victory on
Tuesday from the Federal Elections Commission. The commission,
which is to rule on a challenge from anti-Buchanan Reformers, has
already received a staff recommendation that Buchanan is the
legitimate nominee and deserves the party's $12.7 million in
federal campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also hopes for favorable word soon in his own lawsuit
challenging the decision to bar him from the presidential debates.
He concedes that this national arena is his last chance to salvage
something from the third-party defection that followed his long
career as the Republicans' hard-right gladiator. If he is barred
from the debates, he said, ``any chance to achieve something
dramatic probably fades away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he wins the funding and debate victories, Buchanan
expects court fights all the way to November from the Reform
minority that bolted his nominating convention and endorsed John
Hagelin, an Iowa physicist.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Buchanan maintains that he has no regrets about
quitting the Republican Party only to plummet in the polls. Four
years ago, he electrified his supporters _ the ``pitchfork
brigades'' _ with his upset victory in the New Hampshire primary.
He switched parties last October after his renewed quest flatlined
as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas moved for the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you watch this year's Republican Convention?'' Buchanan
asked about a party he feels has abandoned conservative bedrock to
ape President Clinton's centrist techniques. ``Bush would have put
me down in the basement with all the other conservatives. I still
feel liberated.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve pounds lighter than his usual trim as a polemical
slasher, the candidate is promising his best shot for the remaining
eight weeks _ providing he can get noticed. ``In American politics,
that's a lot of time,'' he said. But he acknowledged that he had
been unable to afford advertising and that all the court fight fees
would cut into the federal subsidy even if he could gain it soon.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan concedes that he never imagined such a year as this has
been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, if we had gotten our money the day after the convention
and I'd have been healthy, we'd be about 5 percent now in the
polls,'' he said. ``And if we got into the debates, we'd get far
more than Ross Perot got in 1996,'' he added. Perot won 8 percent
of the vote in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan paused as he scratched behind the ears of Gipper, his
15-year-old house cat. ``Yeah, well, of all the words of tongue and
pen,'' he said, ``The saddest of these is `might have been.'''
</P>
<P>
   He quickly substituted optimism for regret. ``Hey, Gipper, we
may have the Secret Service back out in the driveway again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a history buff, cited the case of Frederick the Great
suddenly delivered by absurd political accident to triumph after
failing steadily at multiple wars. (A rival monarch died and was
succeeded by a great admirer of his, who immediately signed a peace
treaty.) ``And what did they say about Calvin Coolidge? His career
was the clearest example ever seen of `Providential
intervention!'''
</P>
<P>
   The recuperating candidate grinned; the cat purred.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who don't want us to be alive,''
Buchanan said, conspiring with Gipper at Providential intervention.
``At least that's a good feeling.''

LASORDA RELISHES JOB AS OLYMPIC COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Five in the morning and the house in Fullerton was
dark when Jo Lasorda was awakened by a noise in the den. At first
there was shouting, then a few gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't a prowler or a gang fight. It was John Wayne, so
Jo went back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, she has gotten used to the booming voice
of the Duke from the 1948 film ``Sands of Iwo Jima'' that plays at
all hours on the family's big-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
   And she said she still smiles, remembering the footsteps on the
nearby treadmill that quickened every time the Marines took the
hill and raised the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen so much of John Wayne around here, you'd think he
was a relative,'' Jo Lasorda said with a giggle. ``These days, our
house has been that treadmill and John Wayne movies. Tommy was
getting in shape for the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question might be whether the Olympics is in shape
for Tom Lasorda, the blustery former Dodgers manager who will run
the U.S. team at the upcoming Summer Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans hit the ground in Australia after a 17-hour flight
from San Diego with three consecutive victories in a pre-Olympic
tournament. Lasorda met his team of minor-league players just last
Saturday, but with the renewed zeal of the manager who led the Los
Angeles Dodgers to two World Series titles, Lasorda has them
believing they can defeat the mighty Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are unbelievable but not unbeatable,'' Lasorda bellowed
into the phone recently. ``We did not come 6,000 miles to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ In the spotlight, again
</P>
<P>
   For Lasorda, who will turn 73 on Sept. 22, the day the U.S.
faces his beloved Italy, the victory might already be at hand
regardless of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than four years since then-Dodgers owner Peter
O'Malley coaxed him into retirement after the manager suffered a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has had the second of two heart operations, an
ulcer and both knees replaced. He briefly became the Dodgers
general manager in the summer of 1998 and came under fire for
trading away many of the team's top prospects. He languished in a
senior vice president role that was undefined and unfulfilling.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, Lasorda was forced to watch as his successors
helped tear down an organization that won four pennants and eight
division titles during his 20 years on the job. Although he
received huge ovations at Dodger Stadium when introduced from time
to time, Lasorda, for the most part, was becoming forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all bad. He was inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame
in 1997 and got a chance to watch his only granddaughter, Emily,
grow from a toddler. Lasorda remained a busy public speaker and
also rediscovered on scouting trips through the Dodgers farm system
his love of nurturing young talent.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Olympics. Lasorda, the son of an Italian-immigrant
father, always has had plenty of reasons to wave the flag. At his
induction speech to Cooperstown, he told the crowd he was proof of
the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy likes everything he does, but managing is what he does
best, it's what he is,'' said New York Mets manager Bobby
Valentine, who played for Lasorda in the minors 30 years ago and
remains a close family friend. ``He has come through a period in
his life that always hasn't been great, but he never complained.
This is his reward.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ Reinventing himself
</P>
<P>
   Although his naming to the manager's post with the Olympic team
took place last spring, the reinventing of Tom Lasorda actually
began in the summer of 1996 after he stepped down as manager of the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   He reluctantly retired due to his heart condition, which
required a second angioplasty in October of that year. He also was
being treated for an ulcer and his knees were a source of constant
discomfort. Atlanta manager Bobby Cox, whose team was headed to the
World Series, urged Lasorda to follow his lead and undergo knee
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda resisted for two more years, but under the care of
Dodgers internist Michael Mellman and cardiologist Anthony Reid, he
began some radical changes.
</P>
<P>
   His eating was legendary, as the restaurants in Australia are
beginning to discover. But the scare of another heart attack was
not enough to bring down a cholesterol level well over 300.
</P>
<P>
   Reid didn't care how Lasorda exercised, he just wanted him to
keep moving. Into the den went the treadmill that he walks on 45
minutes a day, five times a week. He also swims regularly and does
some light weight training. Most important, he maintains the
regimen in hotel weight rooms on his trips around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda had dropped 38 pounds in 1988 on a bet by players Kirk
Gibson and Orel Hershiser. With the aid of dietary supplement
Slim-Fast, he became a spokesman for better eating. But he gained
all the weight back within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Reid got him to cut out the yo-yo dieting, plus most steaks and
creamy sauces. More impressively, Reid taught him moderation. When
Lasorda underwent his pre-Olympic physical three weeks ago, his
cholesterol was 152.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a major heart attack, but it certainly was a wake-up
call,'' said Reid, who is headed to Sydney to watch the Games. ``He
always has been an incredibly motivated person and he has channeled
his energy toward his health and the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he struggled in adjusting to life beyond the dugout,
Lasorda's reduced stress levels probably helped get him to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, Lasorda took over for fired Fred Claire as general
manager. It was a job he coveted in the late 1980s and was
devastated when Claire was named to replace Al Campanis.
</P>
<P>
   But the late-'90s GM job was a pressure cooker. He and his wife
did not even have a telephone-answering machine until last year,
but Lasorda found himself glued to a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   At the All-Star break, he traded first base prospect Paul
Konerko and pitcher Dennis Reyes to Cincinnati for closer Jeff
Shaw. He learned two days later that Shaw could demand a trade at
the end of the season if his contract was not renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   He worked feverishly at the trade deadline to acquire Mark
Grudzielanek and Carlos Perez for prospects in an attempt to reach
the playoffs. The Dodgers faltered anyway and Lasorda was left
drained.
</P>
<P>
   ``His health worried me a lot more during his time as GM than it
does now,'' Dodgers president Bob Graziano said. ``I think he did a
good job. We needed a closer and he got us a good one, but he took
a lot of heat and it took a lot out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda stepped aside at the end of the 1998 season, but Jo
remembered the experience as perhaps the low point of his life
after managing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough time,'' she said. ``That really wasn't his
cup of tea. He would rather scout and work with players. The other
thing was hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ `I feel like it's 1968'
</P>
<P>
   Jo Lasorda laughed at the thought of her husband's retirement.
Never good with the lawn mower or vacuum cleaner, Lasorda tried to
find his niche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a manager, I love the field, and the players and the
game,'' he said. ``And the chance to do it for your country. With
these kids, I feel like it's 1968 again and I'm in Ogden, Utah.''
</P>
<P>
   His center fielder that year was Valentine. Steve Garvey and
Bill Buckner also played on the team.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the U.S. is using professionals for the first time,
but they are not expected to beat Cuba, which has won gold the past
two Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of 37-year-old Pat Borders, a former World
Series MVP with Toronto, few have major-league experience. Cuba
lost international tournaments to Japan in 1997 and Australia last
year but clearly is the team to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his background in player development, Lasorda was not
the overwhelming choice when USA Baseball, an arm of the
commissioner's office, went looking for a manager.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Watson, co-general manager for the team with former Angels
GM Bill Bavasi, favored the younger Terry Collins, who managed the
Angels last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, at the urging of old friend and two-time Olympic coach
Rod Dedeaux, lobbied hard. He had the support of commissioner Bud
Selig and baseball's executive vice president, Sandy Alderson, who
liked the media coverage Lasorda could generate.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the third time baseball will be a medal sport at
the Olympics and it lags behind track and field, swimming and
basketball for exposure. But this year NBC, along with its cable
affiliates CNBC and MSNBC, have more than doubled the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings a unique quality to the Games that haven't been
there before,'' Bavasi said of Lasorda. ``But Tommy is more than
just an ambassador or a curiosity. He always has connected well
with young players. He gives us the best chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Fullerton, the house and the treadmill will be quiet for
the next three weeks. A little lonely, too.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Lasorda decided last spring during an illness that she
wouldn't make the trip to Sydney. She's fine now but said she knows
her husband's place is with his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how you make a team,'' Jo Lasorda said. ``It's been
that way with Tommy for as long as I can remember.''
</P>
<P>
   And as long as anyone can remember, they've been a team,
celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary last April. In 1950,
Buzzie Bavasi, Bill's father and general manager of the Brooklyn
Dodgers, lent Lasorda $500 to get married.
</P>
<P>
   Buzzie is still waiting for his money. Bill is hoping he'll get
paid back in gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me what was my greatest accomplishment,'' Lasorda
said before leaving for Sydney. ``They ask if it was the World
Series games or All-Star games or induction into the Hall of Fame.
In 1949 there were 680 players and 26 managers in the Dodgers
spring-training camp. The greatest thing is that Jo and I are still
together and I am the only Dodger left from that group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that could top that is winning a gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't, Tom Lasorda can lay claim to comeback player of
the year. If he does, he can hang his medal on the treadmill with
an inscription.
</P>
<P>
   ``For, Jo, Tommy and the Duke.''

   DOCUMENTS SHOW FORD KNEW ABOUT A FAULTY PART
</P>
<P>
   When thousands of car owners complained in the 1980s and 1990s
that their Fords unexpectedly stalled, top executives repeatedly
assured regulators that there was no way to know what might be
causing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the period, Ford documents show, the company's
engineers, safety officials and even its board were aware of
growing problems with one particular part _ a computerized ignition
system attached to the engine's distributor _ that would shut the
engine down if it overheated.
</P>
<P>
   TIGHTER CONTROL OF FIRESTONE VOWED
</P>
<P>
   In his first public appearance since the recall of 6.5 million
Firestone tires, Yoichiro Kaizaki, the president of Firestone's
Japanese parent, Bridgestone, acknowledged that the company had not
paid proper attention to quality control. He said the company would
exert stronger control over its American subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford has resisted a higher pressure for Firestone tires on
Explorers in the United States, it switched to a different
Firestone tire with higher pressure for Explorers in Venezuela
during the 1999 model year.

   BIG BRANDS AVOID `DR. LAURA' SHOW
</P>
<P>
   The premiere episode of the Dr. Laura Schlessinger syndicated
television series clearly suffered from protests by gay and lesbian
activists as well-known advertisers mostly shunned the show. Only a
handful of recognizable brand names were spotted among the sponsors
of the initial episode. Protesters, complaining about remarks made
by Dr. Schlessinger about gays and lesbians on her syndicated radio
program, urged mainstream advertisers to steer clear of her foray
onto TV.

   STOCKS SLIDE ON PROFIT CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   Stocks slumped on worries about sagging corporate profits after
an analyst lowered expectations for IBM because of the strong
dollar. The Nasdaq composite index fell 82.06 points, or 2.1
percent, to 3,896.35. The Dow Jones industrial average also moved
lower, falling 25.16 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,195.49, while
the broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.24 points, or
0.4 percent, to 1,489.26.

   HEWLETT CONFIRMS CONSULTANT TALKS
</P>
<P>

   GOLDMAN SACHS SHARES RISE ON DEAL

   Goldman Sachs Group confirmed that it planned to make its most
expensive acquisition by paying as much as $7.4 billion to buy
Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg, the biggest trading firm on the floors of
the nation's stock and options exchanges. Buying Spear, Leeds would
give Goldman a much bigger presence in some businesses it seemed to

driving condition, General Motors said. The carmaker has not
recalled the vehicles because it does not have the parts, but it
plans to begin replacements by the end of the year.

CONTENTION OVER PLEA DETAILS DELAYS RELEASE OF LOS ALAMOS
SCIENTIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (With LEE-SPY-CHARGES) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ A last-minute dispute between the government
and defense lawyers over a plea agreement for Wen Ho Lee, the
former Los Alamos weapons lab scientist accused of mishandling
nuclear secrets, delayed for at least two days a guilty plea that
would allow him walk out of court a free man.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would explain the delay, which left members of
Lee's family looking despondent. The U.S. District Court judge
hearing the case, James Parker, said the hearing was scheduled to
resume on Wednesday morning, but ``we may have and may not have it
depending on what happens in the interim.''
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen supporters of Lee stood briefly in shock, and then
someone shouted out, ``Hang in there Dr. Lee!'' That prompted
applause for several minutes in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   It was a surprising twist to what was already a surprise ending
to this important national security case. A 2 p.m. hearing had been
scheduled Monday to conclude a plea agreement worked out in secret
in recent weeks and reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Lee, a former Los Alamos scientist, had been
investigated on suspicions that he had spied for China. But when he
was arrested last December, he was charged in a 59-count indictment
with illegally downloading a trove of data about weapons secrets
with the intent of harming the United States, but he was not
charged with espionage. He was denied bail because of government
assertions that he posed a threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, lawyers said that the government had agreed to
abandon almost its entire case after several courtroom reverses.
They said Lee had agreed to plead guilty to one felony charge that
he illegally gathered and retained nuclear weapons secrets, and to
cooperate with investigators trying to determine why he downloaded
the secrets and what he did with them.
</P>
<P>
   In return, they said, the government had agreed to drop the
other 58 charges, which could have resulted in a life sentence.
Under the agreement, Lee would be released immediately, pay no fine
and serve no probation, lawyers familiar with the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's family and supporters insisted from the time of his arrest
that he was innocent, and that he had been singled out because he
was Chinese-American. A party was planned on Lee's street near Los
Alamos, and several dozen supporters showed up in court to cheer
his expected walk to freedom after nine months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted Americans to see Wen Ho Lee come home,'' said
Jean Marshall, one of his neighbors and an organizer of the party.
</P>
<P>
   But the expectant mood in the courtroom slowly turned into
exasperation after a series of delays. Parker twice recessed court,
each time saying that the two sides had requested a one-hour delay
to conclude some details.
</P>
<P>
   When Parker recalled the court to session at 5 p.m., a glum
Parker said only that the terms had not been completed and that the
hearing would resume Wednesday. But then he added that resumption
would depend on whether the lawyers had reached an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few details to work out,'' said John Cline, one of
Lee's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorneys would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously very upset,'' said Lee's son, Chung. ``We
don't know what's going on. We hope and expect to see our Dad on
Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she was frustrated, Lee's daughter, Alberta, who seemed
near tears as the hearing ended, remarked, ``I think it shows on
our faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung Lee said the applause had heartened his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a strong guy and he's very encouraged, and he was
encouraged by all the supporters,'' Chung Lee said. ``I think it
was very heartwarming for him to see all the supporters out
there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lawyers insisted that Parker had told both sides not to discuss
the problems and they would provide no information on what was
holding up the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, lawyers for the government and defense lawyers had
said a deal had been completed and the terms agreed upon in detail.
</P>
<P>
   When Lee was arrested in December, the government claimed that
he had improperly downloaded the ``crown jewels'' of the nuclear
weapons program onto an unsecure computer and then onto 10 computer
tapes. The downloading was discovered after Lee was fired from his
job at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in March 1999. The
government found just three of the 10 tapes, and Lee later said
through his lawyers that he destroyed the other seven.
</P>
<P>
   But the government said that uncertainty over the fate of those
tapes, and the prospect that Lee might try to spirit them to a
foreign power, required his incarceration pending his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Parker agreed, but he reversed his decision last
month after an FBI agent recanted testimony about Lee's supposed
deceptive behavior. Also, defense experts disputed the value of the
information Lee downloaded, saying most of it was already in the
public domain and all but useless to another country.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said in Washington on Sunday that those
reverses had not motivated them to negotiate a plea deal, but it
was clear that the case was looking weaker. The trial had been
scheduled for November.

   (NYT31) UNDATED -- Sept. 11, 2000 -- BUSH-AD -- Toward the end
of a 30-second commercial against Al Gore, which was produced for
the Republican National Committee but approved by the Bush
campaign, fragments of words dance around the edges of the screen.
But the only full word that pops up -- right after Gore's face
appears -- is ``RATS,'' for about three frames. Republican and
Democratic admakers who were told of the commercial, as well as
several independent academics, agreed that the message appeared to
be part of a subliminal effort to discredit Gore and his
prescription drug program. They said it was similar to the attempts
decades ago by movie theaters to flash images of popcorn on the
screen to entice audiences to buy more popcorn. Frame grabs from

withheld many documents from the regulators that would, in fact,
have shed light on the problem. Alan Kam, a former official with

For the first time in at least a century, a member of the primate
order, the taxonomic group to which human beings belong, has gone
extinct, scientists say. Debate has not yet ended on whether Miss
Waldron's red colobus, the loud-mouthed, red-cheeked dweller of the
rain forest canopy of West Africa, deserved full status as a
species in its own right or should have remained a colobus
subspecies. But now that debate is moot, a team of primatologists

of a 30-second commercial against Al Gore, which was produced for
the Republican National Committee but approved by the Bush
campaign, fragments of words dance around the edges of the screen.
But the only full word that pops up -- right after Gore's face
appears -- is ``RATS,'' for about three frames. Republican and
Democratic admakers who were told of the commercial, as well as
several independent academics, agreed that the message appeared to
be part of a subliminal effort to discredit Gore and his
prescription drug program. They said it was similar to the attempts
decades ago by movie theaters to flash images of popcorn on the

hundreds of millions of these butterflies migrate from the United

   (NYT31) UNDATED -- Sept. 11, 2000 -- BUSH-AD -- Toward the end
of a 30-second commercial against Al Gore, which was produced for
the Republican National Committee but approved by the Bush
campaign, fragments of words dance around the edges of the screen.
But the only full word that pops up -- right after Gore's face
appears -- is ``RATS,'' for about three frames. Republican and
Democratic admakers who were told of the commercial, as well as
several independent academics, agreed that the message appeared to
be part of a subliminal effort to discredit Gore and his
prescription drug program. They said it was similar to the attempts
decades ago by movie theaters to flash images of popcorn on the
screen to entice audiences to buy more popcorn. Frame grabs from

company executives repeatedly assured regulators that there was no
way to know what might be causing the problem. Even as Federal
investigators opened and closed five investigations based on Ford's
assurances that it knew of no particular defect, the company
withheld many documents from the regulators that would, in fact,
have shed light on the problem. Alan Kam, a former official with

For the first time in at least a century, a member of the primate

extinct, scientists say. Debate has not yet ended on whether Miss
Waldron's red colobus, the loud-mouthed, red-cheeked dweller of the
rain forest canopy of West Africa, deserved full status as a
species in its own right or should have remained a colobus
subspecies. But now that debate is moot, a team of primatologists

Starting this December, however, a new Food and Drug Administration
rule mandates that any new adult drug that could be used by
children with the same disease must undergo pediatric study, and
its manufacturers must list doses for children on the label. Dr.

 &HT;    Glitches, jams greet Games visitors
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ By now you probably know about shrimp on the barbie,
about the magnificent harbor and opera house that frame this
gorgeous Olympic City.
</P>
<P>
   But just three days before the 2000 Games begin, as the picky
world press begins its 17-day camp-out and athletes and sponsors
start to crowd this vast Australian metropolis, Sydney itself is on
the barbie.
</P>
<P>
   The first whiff of smoke came from no less than International
Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch, who was left
waiting 25 minutes for a bus that never came the other day. Oops.
Won't happen again, said Sydney 2000 Chief Executive Officer Sandy
Hollway in an apology.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the fire caused by an Opening Ceremony dress
rehearsal. No worries, mates. Just a few firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday, there were more headlines and heartaches.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-town bus drivers said they weren't getting enough
training, sleep or food. Visiting journalists had to help lost
drivers navigate their routes. A conductor on a stalled train told
passengers he had no idea what was wrong, thus creating a
mass-transit jam that turned the 45-minute downtown commute into a
two-hour ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Early morning temperatures continued to feel like February in
Atlanta, and one foreign journalist was seen lugging a down
comforter back to the Media Village, a warren of trailers on the
grounds of a cheery-looking Victorian insane asylum.
</P>
<P>
   In a less worrisome world, it would simply be enough that Sydney
is one of the great wonders of the world, that the torch is making
its triumphant journey through a city draped with banners of red,
orange, blue and green, that 14 of the 28 sports are being played
in a pedestrian-friendly complex of venues that looks like a
science-fiction film set.
</P>
<P>
   But like Atlanta four years ago, Sydney is anxious about its
ambitious Olympic experiment and the 8 million visitors it will
bring.
</P>
<P>
   Will public transportation run on time?
</P>
<P>
   Will the weather be nice?
</P>
<P>
   Will Australia ``cringe'' when it sees itself in the mirror at
Friday night's Opening Ceremony?
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is ready,'' Lord Mayor Frank Sartor boasted Monday at
a press conference for the torch relay, which this week makes its
way around the Sydney suburbs, Bondi Beach, the opera house and
onward to Friday's caldron lighting at the Olympic Stadium. ``In
case you haven't noticed, it's ready, it's sparkling.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic organizers trotted out weather forecasters to assure
visitors that the 50-degree early mornings will turn into perfect
70-degree afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage, the weather looks good for Friday,'' said Kevin
O'Loughlin, director of the region of New South Wales' Bureau of
Meteorology. ``We expect a clear day with cool temperatures in the
morning and again in the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's the sort of temperature that will cause
angst to athletes,'' said Milton Cockburn, spokesman for the Sydney
Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the bus that stiffed Samaranch _ and some early
reports that drivers were getting lost _ Cockburn said: ``We've had
some concerns in terms of the transportation system. .... But I
don't think anyone is slashing their wrists yet in relation to
that. It's a good wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a California manager of one of the marching bands
that will play at Friday's opener was injured in a car crash.
``He's apparently got some broken ribs and being airlifted to a
hospital,'' Cockburn said. ``It's not a life-threatening situation
at all.'' The band manager was identified as Bill Lutt, head of
World Projects Corp. of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's subway delay stalled travel to Olympic Park Station,
the only one serving the rambling park of venues, press offices,
concession stands and souvenir stores. During the Games, 50,000
people will use the platform every hour, a number that ``puts a
huge strain on our rail resources,'' Cockburn said.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing Sydneysiders seem relaxed about is Opening
Ceremony, whose cast of 12,700 outnumbers the 11,000 athletes.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday night's dress rehearsal, the Sydney Morning
Herald called the event ``tasteful, sophisticated, humorous,
spectacular and inventive.'' While the news media are heeding
Olympic orders to keep details of the ceremony secret, pundits are
reassuring the country that it won't suffer the embarrassment of
four years ago, when kangaroos on bikes filled the stadium at
Atlanta's Closing Ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   G'day, mates. It's going to be an interesting 17 days.

   (NYT31) UNDATED -- Sept. 11, 2000 -- BUSH-AD -- Toward the end
of a 30-second commercial against Al Gore, which was produced for
the Republican National Committee but approved by the Bush
campaign, fragments of words dance around the edges of the screen.
But the only full word that pops up -- right after Gore's face
appears -- is ``RATS,'' for about three frames. Republican and
Democratic admakers who were told of the commercial, as well as
several independent academics, agreed that the message appeared to
be part of a subliminal effort to discredit Gore and his
prescription drug program. They said it was similar to the attempts
decades ago by movie theaters to flash images of popcorn on the
screen to entice audiences to buy more popcorn. Frame grabs from
the video sequence just before and after the word appears. (The New

company executives repeatedly assured regulators that there was no
way to know what might be causing the problem. Even as Federal
investigators opened and closed five investigations based on Ford's
assurances that it knew of no particular defect, the company
withheld many documents from the regulators that would, in fact,
have shed light on the problem. Alan Kam, a former official with

For the first time in at least a century, a member of the primate

Waldron's red colobus, the loud-mouthed, red-cheeked dweller of the

species in its own right or should have remained a colobus
subspecies. But now that debate is moot, a team of primatologists

SOME AIR BAGS IN 2 MODELS ARE FLAWED, GM REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The driver-side air bags on 115 Oldsmobile and Buick cars have
inflated spontaneously when the car was started or during normal
driving condition, and 268,000 cars in the 1995 and 1996 model
years are vulnerable to the problem, General Motors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the carmaker has not recalled the vehicles because it does
not have replacement parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is taking longer than would be optimal,'' said Terry
Rhadigan, a spokesman for the company, who said GM was working with
new suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Rhadigan said the company had received 60 reports of injuries,
``primarily abrasions and bruises.'' None of the injuries had been
serious, he said, and no crashes had resulted from the air-bag
deployments, which were caused by corrosion on a wire linked to the
air-bag inflator.
</P>
<P>
   The company hoped to be ready to begin replacements by the end
of the year. In a letter to its dealers, GM said the inflator
modules were ``complex, precision devices with many parts,''
explaining why it would take months to build replacements.
</P>
<P>
   The problem affects 1995 Buick Regals and 1995 and 1996
Oldsmobile Cutlass Supremes, according to GM, which sent letters to
car owners in July explaining the situation.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing a driver can do to prevent the air bag from
deploying, the company said, although in some cases there may be a
warning: the red ``air bag'' light on the dashboard that usually
flashes when the car is started may come on and stay lighted. In
that case, GM said, the driver should stop and have the car towed.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal rules, a driver can apply to the Transportation
Department to have an on-off switch installed on the air-bag
system, but GM thinks that driving without an air bag would be an
even greater risk, Rhadigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers should follow the instructions in the owners' manual and
sit as far back from the air bag as possible, according to GM.
</P>
<P>
   The problem does not affect passenger-side air bags, he said.

   In honor of the 27th Summer Olympics, we've had a shot at
compiling 27 things you should know about Sydney and its Games that
might or might not be as useful as a third armpit. It's nothing any
conchie journo (conscientious journalist) wouldn't do:
</P>
<P>
   1. Host Australia is one of only three countries _ along with
Great Britain and Greece _ to have attended every Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   2. Sydney won the right to host the 2000 Summer Olympics by one
vote over Beijing. Melbourne won the right to host the Games the
first time they were held in Australia, in 1956, by the same slim
margin over Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   3. In announcing Sydney's triumph in 1993, outgoing
International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch
mispronounced the city's name, calling it ``Sidinee.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Homebush Bay, where most of the sports venues are located, is
a reclaimed industrial wasteland located nine miles northwest of
the central business district, as downtown Sydney is called. The
1,900-acre site once harbored the largest slaughterhouse in the
Southern Hemisphere. At its peak, 20,000 animals a day were killed.
</P>
<P>
   5. There are an estimated 40 million kangaroos in Australia,
which is twice the country's human population. Australia has a land
mass comparable to the continental U.S. but boasts only six cities
with populations exceeding 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   6. Nearly one-third of Sydney's residents were born in another
country. Roughly 25 percent of Sydneysiders speak a language other
than English at home.
</P>
<P>
   7. The Sydney International Aquatic Centre is no ordinary bogie
(swimming hole). Twelve world records in individual Olympic events
have been set at the Olympic facility over the past two years,
including two by Studio City's Lenny Krayzelburg.
</P>
<P>
   8. The Sydney Olympics have been coined ``The Green Games''
because of the Australians' commitment to making this the most
environmentally friendly, energy-efficient Olympics. Event
organizers, in partnership with Greenpeace, drew up rigid
guidelines relating to the ozone layer and global warming.
</P>
<P>
   9. The Olympic Village is the largest solar-powered suburb in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   10. Sydney's most identifiable landmark, the 25-year-old Opera
House, was supposed to take six years to build at a cost of $7.3
million. It took almost 15 years to complete, cost $102 million and
caused its stressed-out architect, Dane Jorn Utzon, to resign
midway through the project.
</P>
<P>
   11. Australia has less than one percent of the world's
population but more than 20 percent of the world's slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   12. For exercise-addicted Olympic visitors in need of a
Stairmaster fix, there's always the AMP Tower. Rising 1000 feet,
it's the tallest building in the Southern Hemisphere. Its
observation deck can be reached by climbing 1,474 steps _ or taking
an elevator that ascends 76 floors in 40 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   13. Stadium Australia, the site of the opening and closing
ceremonies, seats 110,000. It is the largest facility built for an
Olympics. In February, the 80-year-old Samaranch proclaimed it
``the best Olympic stadium''and managed to pronounce Australia
correctly (see No. 3).
</P>
<P>
   14. It is a punishable offense in Australia not to vote in a
national election.
</P>
<P>
   15. Only 15 percent of Australian households have cable
television, compared to nearly 80 percent in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   16. Ten thousand athletes in 28 sports will compete in Sydney,
making it the largest Olympics in history.
</P>
<P>
   17. The Australian government has spent $327 million in taxpayer
money on sports, with 88 percent of that money earmarked for the
care and training of its Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
   18. ``Rainbow Six,'' a recent Tom Clancy thriller, contains a
subplot in which terrorists scheme to spike a mist cooling system
during the Sydney Olympics. Australians immediately recognized it
as an act of fiction given that the weather in Sydney in September
_ average temperature: 51 to 67 degrees, with capricious winds _
precludes any need for a cooling system. Indeed, Olympic visitors
are advised to rug up (dress warmly).
</P>
<P>
   19. Australia has 7,000 beaches. Included among those are three
in and around Sydney in which swimsuits are optional. Beaches are
patrolled on a voluntary basis by members of the ultra-prestigious
Manly Surf Lifesaving Club.
</P>
<P>
   20. The world's first beauty contest to feature competitors
being judged in swimsuits took place at Sydney's Maroubra Beach in
February of 1920. The first Miss America was crowned the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   21. Australia will celebrate the 100th anniversary of its
federation in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   22. A recent survey by an Australian airline revealed that
560,000 of Sydney's 4 million residents were planning to leave town
during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   23. Australia is home to 166 of the world's 370 species of
sharks. A few boldly showed their fins a few months ago in Sydney
Harbour, the site of the one-mile swim that kicks off the inaugural
Olympic triathlon. The water in September is considered too cold to
turn triathletes into shark brekkie (breakfast).
</P>
<P>
   24. She'll be apples (everything will be OK); the last time a
shark killed a swimmer in Sydney Harbour was 1963.
</P>
<P>
   25. Between August of 1999 and August of 2000, Australian
customs officials made a record 1,125 seizures of
performance-enhancing drugs. The good oil (truth)? It wouldn't be a
modern Olympics without a furphy (rumor) being spread about the
illegal drug use of some prominent performer.
</P>
<P>
   26. The water in the pools at the International Aquatic Centre
contains only trace amounts of chlorine and not because Aussie
swimming sensation Ian Thorpe is allergic to the stuff. As part of
a ground-breaking ozone filtration system, the water is cleansed
with special filters.
</P>
<P>
   27. The world's 10 most poisonous snakes all are indigenous to
Australia; 11 if you count media mogul Rupert Murdoch.

ANAN ENLISTS WEST AFRICAN COALITION TO HELP KEEP PEACE IN THE
REGION 
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As the Security Council prepared to expand the
U.N.'s peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan met on Monday with a group of nine West African countries to
coordinate efforts to resolve the crisis created by a brutal
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Annan used the meeting to seek their help in defusing tensions
between two of their members, Guinea and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   The nine countries in the Economic Community of West African
States, known by its acronym Ecowas, also include Burkina Faso,
Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The group previously fielded its own intervention force to help
the Sierra Leone government fight the rebels of the Revolutionary
United Front. Member countries have since contributed troops to the
U.N. peacekeeping mission and want a voice in the future of Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting on Monday, Annan expressed concern at the latest
border clashes reported between Guinea and Liberia, two neighbors
of Sierra Leone affected by the maelstrom of refugees fleeing the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust that Ecowas will do all it can to prevent any
deterioration in this situation, which could have an adverse effect
on Sierra Leone,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released later, Annan said he was ``distressed at
the loss of life and injuries sustained by innocent villagers'' on
Guinea's border with Liberia and Sierra Leone. The Guinean
government reported that about 80 people have been killed in
clashes and others are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Guinea has rounded up more than 1,000 refugees from Liberia and
Sierra Leone and blamed them for contributing to the rising
instability, according to news reports. In retaliation, Liberia's
president, Charles Taylor, deployed troops at Guinea's embassy in
Monrovia, purportedly to protect Guinean nationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The humanitarian implications of the continued instability in
the sub-region cannot be underestimated,'' Annan told the West
African group on Monday. ``Various crises in the region seriously
affect the civilian population.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 300,000 people have been internally displaced in
Sierra Leone since renewed fighting broke out last May, he said.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had registered
nearly 15,000 refugees from Sierra Leone in Guinea since then.
Another 37,000 Sierra Leonian refugees in Liberia cannot return
home because of precarious security, Annan said.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; At Annan's request, the Security Council this week is
discussing a new resolution that would expand the size of United
Nations' peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone to 20,500 troops, from
the current 13,000. The force already constitutes the largest
contingent among the peacekeeping missions deployed by the United
Nations. Annan said on Monday that he expected the resolution to be
adopted by Sept. 20.

RE-ELECTION OF YUGOSLAVIA'S MILOSEVIC MAY HELP DRIVE MONTENEGRO'S
INDEPENDENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia _ The Clinton administration says it
worries that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia might move
against Montenegro before or after Yugoslav federation elections
scheduled for Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   But in the small republic itself, where Montenegro's president,
Milo Djukanovic, has decided to boycott the elections, there is
less concern. The current situation seems to serve both Milosevic
and Djukanovic, with the boycott protecting the Montenegrin's
political base while effectively handing Milosevic control over the
new federal Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic, a Milosevic understudy who broke with the master and
turned toward the West in 1997, spurned efforts by Washington to
get him to take part.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that his coalition, optimistically named For a Better
Life, might break apart, and that to have the vote would legitimize
constitutional changes that Milosevic rammed through without
consulting Montenegro, Serbia's sister republic in what remains of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic also rejected an American proposal that he run
candidates for the federal Parliament _ even if they vowed not to
serve _ to deny Milosevic an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Djukanovic is afraid of a vote,'' one American
diplomat said. ``He's putting his own interests in Montenegro ahead
of the larger interest, which is to defeat Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says Drasko Djuranovic, the editor of the independent
weekly Monitor, Djukanovic is betting on Milosevic's remaining in
power, which is likely to produce an independent Montenegro in the
next few years _ the same bet being made by Kosovo's Albanian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic is beaten by the candidate of Serbia's democratic
opposition, Vojislav Kostunica, it will be harder to get Western
support for the further breakup of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Kostunica wins, he will offer a decent deal to
Montenegro,'' said Zoran Predic, an editor with the private
television station Elmag. ``If Milosevic disappears, the world's
interest in Milo Djukanovic will also disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Milosevic ``doesn't need a war after the
elections, but a better position for negotiations with the West,''
suggested Ranko Krivokapic, a leader of an independence-minded
party in Djukanovic's coalition. ``He may use Montenegro as a
bargaining chip.''
</P>
<P>
   If the point of the early election is to give Milosevic new
legitimacy, Krivokapic noted, Milosevic would be foolish to throw
it away again by moving openly against Montenegro. The ``American
panic is a bit overblown,'' Krivokapic said. ``The Americans are
more worried about their own elections than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``this is the Balkans and everything is possible,'' he
said. ``Milosevic could need a crisis, even before the election,
and he could decide to do something in just a few days. Everything
is prepared for various options.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is much talk here of the Seventh Battalion of the Yugoslav
Army, about 700 men who seem more like paramilitaries and who, it
is thought, could help provoke civil strife, providing a pretext
for the overthrow of Djukanovic without triggering an overt Western
military response.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milic, an adviser to Djukanovic, said Milosevic ``could
seem completely clean'' and say: ``It's those crazy Montenegrins.
We haven't sent a tank or a plane, so let me see what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Predic, from the independent television station, said the
problem was that ``a significant minority here is fanatically
pro-Milosevic, and another part that hates him wants to stay with
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A referendum for independence remains too risky, said
Djuranovic, the newspaper editor. ``Here in the Balkans the
question isn't the opinion of the majority,'' he said. ``It's what
the minority with guns will do, when they have the support of
another country.''
</P>
<P>
   While Djukanovic's government has officially discouraged the
state media from reporting on the campaign, the president is
allowing Montenegrins to vote in the election, trying to avoid an
open conflict with the 35 percent to 40 percent of the population
that favors unity with Serbia. Nor is Djukanovic pressing for an
early referendum on Montenegrin independence, a vote that would by
itself create security risks and more vividly display the
republic's divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Filip Vujanovic is accustomed to dancing around
the question. ``We need to be very patient and careful, and a
referendum should be taken as a last resort,'' he said in an
interview. But if Milosevic wins, as Vujanovic is convinced he
will, by manipulation if necessary, ``he will continue his
destructive approach to Montenegro,'' he said. ``That's why if he's
elected, in the next four years Montenegro will be at one point
forced to ask the citizens for their answer in a referendum. But
it's not our political decision to do it immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't willingly leave office,'' Vujanovic said of
Milosevic, ``and then the Serbian people and the international
community must work to push him out.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody in Montenegro is against Milosevic. In Herceg
Novi, a coastal town that voted out Djukanovic's coalition in local
elections this summer, opting instead for the pro-Belgrade
Socialist People's Party, there is skepticism about Djukanovic's
real aims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to get the names of the people who vote in the
election, because every vote is like a vote to keep Yugoslavia
together,'' said 50 year-old Jovan, providing only one name, who
said he intends to vote, but for the Serbian opposition candidate,
Kostunica. ``I worry about my pension.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro is divided, and Djukanovic's party and coalition are
divided, said Zeljko Ivanovic, editor of the independent daily
Vijesti. ``It's why Milosevic can sit and laugh. Whatever he's done
to Montenegro, they just issue a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Djukanovic wants independence, Ivanovic said: ``It's clear.
He needs to be able to say, `With Milosevic still in Serbia, we
have no other option.'''
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic is simply being prudent, trying not to give Belgrade
a pretext to provoke a civil war. In the meantime, Montenegro is
building the institutions of statehood, including a banking system
and an army.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the presence of the Yugoslav Army, pressure from
Belgrade includes a blockade of trade, which cuts off Montenegro
from Serbia's price-controlled food and other products, and forces
it to try to export abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's turn to the German mark as its currency has
protected it from the deflation of the Yugoslav dinar, but it has
also made prices more expensive and led to louder grumbling from
the many unemployed in this republic of just 650,000 people. And
not all of the jobless can work in Montenegro's thriving black and
gray economy, where smuggling goods to and from Italy is a way of
life.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are so many stolen cars in Montenegro _ or cars bought
cheaply in Europe and driven here, then declared stolen by their
owners _ that the joke goes: ``Come and visit Montenegro. We have
your car here waiting for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's limbo as a quasi-nation-state _ an independently
minded part of Yugoslavia _ has meant that it cannot get direct aid
from the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. But because
it is perceived as a bulwark against Belgrade, Montenegro does get
millions of dollars in government aid from Europe and the United
States to cover its budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   As many as half of Montenegro's salaried workers are paid by the
state, including the large regular and special police forces, with
their new white Land Rovers, who number up to 30,000 men and have
been built up, in part by trainers from Western armies, to counter
the Yugoslav Army.
</P>
<P>
   There is little international oversight of how the foreign money
is spent, said Arne Jan Flolo of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Everyone agrees that the privatization of
government-run enterprises is anything but transparent or clean.
</P>
<P>
   There is currently a fight within the governing party over a
fuzzy contract with the French hotel chain Accor to manage
Montenegro's nicest seaside hotels.
</P>
<P>
   One huge aluminum plant, with all of its associated industries,
represents half of Montenegro's gross domestic product, and much of
the profit goes to a Swiss holding company that provided loans in
1998 _ a contract that Washington and the aluminum company itself
seemed to be quietly trying to cancel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption is a time bomb ticking under the Djukanovic
government,'' Flolo said. ``But the West doesn't want to hear about
it. The international community is making a big mistake by not
attaching conditions to its aid and letting this go on so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebojsa Medojevic, an economist, is a Djukanovic critic: ``The
line here is that if you criticize Djukanovic you help Milosevic.
It creates space for manipulation and is an excellent pretext to
postpone any real economic reform. The problem is that the
international community supports Djukanovic without reservation,
despite dirty privatization and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Flolo said: ``There are free and fair elections here, but there
is little transparency of decision-making. There is democracy from
a distance, but you dig and there's a long way to go.''

TROJANS HAVEN'T USED SHOTGUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So far, Trojans haven't pulled the trigger on
shotgun &QL;
</P>
<P>
   USC's game-winning drive against Colorado was nearly perfect
Saturday, but nowhere to be found in that sequence was the shotgun
formation that was supposed to be integrated into the offense
following last season.
</P>
<P>
   In the Trojans' first two games, no plays have been run out of
the shotgun, including the last-minute drive against the Buffaloes,
which seemed a natural situation for it.
</P>
<P>
   But USC coach Paul Hackett is reluctant to switch to the
formation, especially this early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you're young at the quarterback position, the
more things familiar that you can do, the better off you are,''
Hackett said. ``It certainly proved itself on that drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett stressed he hasn't ruled out the shotgun, although it
probably won't be used soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a definite place for it. We might use it
later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Waiting for an answer: Hackett said after the victory he
still isn't sure what kind of team the Trojans are, two games into
the season. But with another bye this week, and then a game against
San Jose State, Hackett was asked if he might not have a firm
handle on the Trojans a full month into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely possible,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ford update: Defensive lineman Lonnie Ford (twisted back) is
expected to be OK for the San Jose State game.
</P>
<P>
   USC remains hopeful cornerback Kris Richard (sprained knee)
could be back in two weeks, although three weeks remains a good
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   __ The best of Carson: Quarterback Carson Palmer attributed his
25-for-30 performance against Colorado to the blocking of his
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got touched maybe two or three times the whole night,''
Palmer said. ``I could have stayed back there for 12 or 13 seconds
on some of those throws.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett believed that Palmer was sharper mentally than during
his subpar effort against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very focused and completely different on the
sideline,'' Hackett said. ``He got into a rhythm that he didn't
have against Penn State.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Top 10: USC, which is ranked 10th in the Associated Press Top
25 poll, is ranked in the top 10 for the first time since 1996,
when the Trojans were ranked seventh entering the season opener
against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Recruit watch: Notable recruits at Saturday's game included
linebacker Austin Jackson of Serra High in Gardena, linebacker
Michael Craven of Palm Desert and safety Jabril Raymo of Beverly
Hills. There were no new commitments over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   __ Opponent record: Colorado tailback Marcus Houston's 150 yards
rushing were the second-most gained by a freshman against USC. The
record is 180 yards by Mike Mosley of Texas A&AMP;M in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   __ Newbury honored: USC kicker David Newbury was named the
Pacific-10 Conference's special-teams player of the week after
making the game-winning field goal against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Newbury, who made 1 of 3 field goals, wore new shoes in the
Colorado game, after having the sole on his old shoe glued on
before the season-opener against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get those two misses out of my head,'' Newbury said.
``It wasn't like me to miss like that. My brother would have killed
me if I had missed that last one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be the hero or goat as a kicker, but you have to love
those last-second opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Mr. Confident: Wide receiver Kareem Kelly, who played at
traditionally strong Long Beach Poly High, said he wasn't nervous
when the Trojans were given a final chance with 1:14 remaining
against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``No nerves,'' Kelly said. ``I've played in big games. I was
more anxious than anything.''

 &HT;    Lieberman taps Texas for $1 million at fund raisers
 &HT;    By Gary Susswein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Vice-presidential candidate Joe Lieberman knows
he and Al Gore probably won't get any electoral votes from Texas in
the upcoming election. But on Monday, the Connecticut Democrat came
to the Lone Star State to collect something almost as valuable in
an election year _ money.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman helped raise raise more than $1 million for the
Democratic Party in Gov. George W. Bush's home state, including
$725,000 at a pair of Austin fund raisers. Most of that money will
be shipped out-of-state, where the party will run advertisements
intended to boost the Gore-Lieberman campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a close contest right to the end,'' Lieberman
told a group of about 125 supporters who paid $1,000 each to attend
the first fund raiser, a lunch at the One World Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an enormous amount of money on the other side. So what
you've done here today in these two events in Austin, I couldn't
really thank you enough because this will allow us to remain
competitive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman recounted a childhood memory of watching his
working-class parents count his father's income each evening to
figure out if they ``had a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I talk to my mother tonight I can tell her we had a
good day,'' he told his cheering supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The day was especially good for Lieberman because of the second
fund raiser, a $2,500-per-plate lunch at the Westlake Hills home of
former Dell chief financial officer Tom Meredith and his wife,
Lynne. The lunch brought in $600,000 and attracted such supporters
as former first lady Lady Bird Johnson and former Dallas Cowboys
star Hollywood Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent politicians and Austin business leaders
co-hosted the event, which demonstrated political candidates'
growing reliance on contributions from high-tech leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``To raise that kind of money in the Lone Star State capital is
really a remarkable indication of the support we have here,'' said
U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D_Austin. ``There's no doubt that Texas
will provide financial resources for both these parties. What (the
Democrats) are doing in being here is they're not letting the
Republicans have all the resources of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lieberman said he still hoped for a ``November
surprise'' in which Gore wins Texas and it 32 electoral votes, he
acknowledged several times that the state is Bush country.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to differentiate between the Democratic and Republican
tickets, saying that the Republicans would dedicate most of the
federal surplus to tax cuts while the Democrats would use it pay
down the national debt, increase education spending and fund
targeted tax cuts for the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating a recurrent theme of the Gore campaign, Lieberman
criticized Bush's record in Texas and questioned why 1.4 million
children don't have health insurance in the state.
</P>
<P>
   And he said Gore would propose legislation to allow the
government to sue entertainment companies that target adult
products to children.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokesman said Lieberman was ``playing it fast and
loose'' with the truth when discussing Bush's tax cut proposals and
record on health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting that Sen. Lieberman spends most of his days
trashing Texas and some of his nights looking for Texas money,''
said Bush spokesman Ray Sullivan. ``The truth is that Gov. Bush and
our state have a good record on children's' health, the governor
signed a law creating (a health insurance) program to cover
children whose families earn up to 200 percent of poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats said Lieberman's visit would help energize
Texans to vote for the Democratic ticket for president and support
other Democratic candidates once inside the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush hasn't historically had very long coattails and I think
he'll have less this election than he had the last two elections,''
said Garry Mauro, who lost to Bush for governor in 1998 and is now
the state co-chair of Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential campaigns are now relying on their parties to
raise money since the campaigns, which receive $67.56 million in
federal matching funds, have raised the maximum amount allowed by
law.
</P>
<P>
   The parties are expected to raise $500 million in soft money
this election cycle, twice as much as 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman have said they support campaign finance
reform but will not curb their party fund-raising efforts until
both parties are required to do so.

ARAFAT'S TASK: NEGOTIATING SACRED GROUND
</HEADLINE>
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During a critical 90-minute meeting in his
Manhattan hotel suite last week, President Clinton listened for
productive ideas from the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to
help the badly flagging Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Arafat suggested that the Jerusalem Committee of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference be given sovereignty over
Haram al-Sharif, known to Jews as Temple Mount, the holy site in
Jerusalem that has become the make-or-break issue of the talks,
senior Clinton Administration officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his advisers thought that Arafat's idea was pretty
much a nonstarter, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They interpreted the notion, which they said was only vaguely
sketched by Arafat, as an attempt to pass to a group of Arab
countries the weighty question of sovereignty over an ancient space
that is sacred to Muslims and Jews and a cradle of both religions.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Iran and Iraq, which oppose the very existence of
the peace talks, are among the group's 56 members. The chairman of
the Jerusalem committee is Morocco, and its 16 members include
moderate Arab nations, like Egypt and Jordan, as well as Iran, Iraq
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his role as a mediator, told Arafat what Israel's
objections would be, an aide said. Roughly stated, Clinton
explained that if the Israelis could not accept exclusive
Palestinian sovereignty, they would not accept the sovereignty of a
group of Islamic countries. The essence of the message was that
Arafat's solution met his own needs, but not those of the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The general atmosphere in the president's suite at the Waldorf
Astoria was, as always, quite civil and proper, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the moments before meeting with Clinton, Arafat had
stalked out of a session in the hotel with the Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, saying he had to consult with his delegation
waiting down the hall. Earlier in the day, Arafat became quite
heated in an interview on CNN, in which he and the journalist
Christiane Amanpour tested each other's wills on every point.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's theatrical behavior was interpreted by some officials
as a desire on his part to show to his people, and the Muslim world
at large, that he was in a struggle to the end on a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear exactly what Arafat's timetable is and
whether the critical political situation in Israel, which is likely
to end the Barak government in its current form, is part of his
calculations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After Arafat left New York last Friday, one of his senior aides
said that the Palestinians would start intensive talks with
Israelis and extend the informal deadline for the next five weeks,
but there appeared to be little optimism within the administration
or by the Israelis that those steps would produce much.
</P>
<P>
   Following the decision on Sunday by the Palestinians to defer a
declaration of statehood for at least two months, Arafat flew to
Egypt on Monday for a 90-minute meeting with President Hosni
Mubarak that appeared to confirm the generally gloomy
prognostications for the new talks. The meeting followed a
longstanding pattern of Arafat conferring with the Egyptian leader
at critical moments in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's information minister, Safwat al-Shareef, told reporters
after Arafat's plane left on the return journey to the Palestinian
headquarters in Gaza that Arafat had given Mubarak an extremely
pessimistic report on the talks in New York.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that there appeared to be one enticing
element of Arafat's presentation to Clinton, though. It showed,
some said, that Arafat knew he could not get an agreement with the
Israelis if he continued to insist on sole Palestinian sovereignty
of Haram al-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's proposal also came as the Americans were trying
desperately to move the discussion away from any form of exclusive
sovereignty and toward the concept of shared sovereignty between
Israel and the Palestinians, or better still, the concept of
``divine sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   According to this idea, the two Muslim shrines at the site, the
Dome of the Rock and Al Aksa, and the area under the earth where
the First and Second Jewish temples stood, would be under the
sovereignty of God, an idea that was once broached by King Hussein
during his reign in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, accepting the sovereignty under God as a solution
would keep the status quo at the site, which is run on a day-to-day
basis by Muslim clergy and guarded by Arab security. Jews rarely
visit the site.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of Arafat's visit to New York, administration
officials were somewhat dismayed, seeing momentum of their summit
meeting six weeks ago all but frittered away.
</P>
<P>
   In his frequent diplomatic encounters since the Camp David
summit meeting, where the history of Haram al-Sharif and the Temple
Mount were first discussed by senior Israelis and Palestinians,
Arafat has denied that the Jewish history of the site exists,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By trying to move toward a solution that suggested sovereignty
under God, the administration hoped that the deep and bitter
arguments of religious identity and the history of thousands of
years _ an exercise that could go on indefinitely _ would not have
to be opened.

FORD DOCUMENT CITE'S DIFFERENCES IN EXPLORER TIRES FOR U.S. AND
EXPORT MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ While the Ford Motor Co. has resisted recommending a
higher pressure for Firestone tires on Ford Explorer sport utility
vehicles in the United States, the automaker was moving by 1999 to
start using a slightly different tire with higher pressure for
Explorers in Venezuela, according to a document obtained by
congressional investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The document, a one-page table listing various tire
specifications for a variety of Ford models in export markets, also
shows a difference in quality between the tires that Ford chooses
for cars and the tires that it chooses for sport utility vehicles
and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The tires on Ford and Lincoln cars and even Ford Windstar
minivans can be safely driven for up to half an hour at a time at
top speeds of 130 mph to 149 mph. That allows an ample safety
margin because few of these cars can actually go that fast,
according to the Ford document.
</P>
<P>
   But the tires on most Ford light trucks _ sport utilities and
pickups _ are only designed for a temporary top speed of 106 mph to
112 mph. That provides a small safety margin because some of these
models can go close to 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Light trucks have been built differently and regulated
differently from cars for decades, a reflection of their origins as
commercial vehicles driven slowly in cities by small business
owners. But with growing evidence that many Americans view sport
utilities as cars and drive them like cars, regulators have begun
looking at whether sport utilities should be regulated more like
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Although the document does not provide tire speed ratings for
vehicles in the United States, these tend to be similar to the
speed ratings for exported models, which are often produced in the
same factories.
</P>
<P>
   The steps taken in Venezuela are significant because as
Firestone proceeds with the recall of 6.5 million tires in the
United States, Firestone and Ford have disagreed publicly over the
recommended pressure for the recalled tires. Ford declined to
comment on the document.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Karbowiak, a Firestone spokeswoman, said Firestone
stopped supplying new Explorers with tires in Venezuela in
September 1999, when Goodyear began supplying them.
</P>
<P>
   Higher pressure makes these tires less likely to fail and allows
them to carry more weight. But higher pressures also make the ride
bumpier and can make a vehicle more likely to roll over, even
without a tire failure.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the introduction of the Explorer in late 1990, Ford
has recommended that owners inflate the tires to 26 pounds per
square inch. That is a lower pressure than most automakers
recommend for rival midsized sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone did not publicly question the pressure recommendation
in the United States for 10 years, but did so when the recall was
announced on Aug. 9, surprising Ford executives by suddenly
suggesting that Explorer owners inflate their tires to a pressure
of 30 pounds per square inch until they could find replacement
tires. Ford officials subsequently recommended a range of pressures
from 26 to 30 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, Ford chose new tires with a recommended pressure
of 30 pounds in 1999, according to the document obtained by
investigators that is dated June 6, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The new tire was the same size as the tire being recalled in the
United States _ Firestone's P235/75R15 _ and the new tire was
certified as usable for the same top speed as in the United States,
112 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Before the new tires were introduced, Ford had been using
Firestone tires of the same size, but rated for a top speed of 106
mph and a recommended pressure of 28 pounds per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Explorers sold in the United States have computerized
engine controls that limit their speed to 99 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who is the chairman of the House
Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, has emphasized tire
pressure in his investigation, while Ford has called it a ``red
herring.''

TRIATHLON TRIES TO SHED ITS EXTREME IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Whether you make the pilgrimage by way of
Circular Quay or by way of the Royal Botanic Gardens, the Sydney
Opera House with its jutting shells is the first-day objective of
most tourists here.
</P>
<P>
   The Opera House will also be a major destination on Saturday,
the first day of competition at the Summer Olympics, but the crowds
will not be gawking at the unconventional architecture. They will
gather on the shores of one of the world's more picturesque harbors
to watch 48 women swim in the ocean, bike on the street and run
through the park. The woman who does them fastest will be awarded
the first gold medal of the Sydney Games, and it is no coincidence
that she will probably be an Australian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australia's strength in triathlon was a pretty good factor in
the scheduling,'' said the race director, David Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter who wins the competition, this will be the
triathlon's Olympic debut. ``You couldn't ask for a better
showcase,'' said Nick Radkewich, one of three Americans who will
compete in the men's race on Sunday. ``I really hope this brings us
out into the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC plans to feature both the women's and men's races
prominently in its first two nights of Olympic coverage from
Sydney, but the mainstream may be too much to hope for in the
United States, where the triathlon began. It is already a
mainstream sport in Australia, where the best triathletes, like
Michelie Jones and Miles Stewart, routinely earn six-figure annual
incomes and routinely appear on cereal boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I get recognized in airports here,'' said Radkewich, a
29-year-old Notre Dame graduate who is ranked 55th in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The general perception of the triathlon may be that it is an
oxygen-busting, masochist's delight. The Olympic event, though, is
not nearly as full a day's work as the Hawaii Ironman, the extreme
version of the triathlon that was first contested in 1984 and has
grabbed most of the early attention devoted to the new sport. The
Ironman includes a 2.4-mile swim, followed by a 112-mile bike race,
followed by a marathon (26 miles and a few hundred yards more). In
comparison, the Olympic triathlon is a sprint. In conventional
Olympic style, it is based on the metric system: a 1,500-meter
swim, followed by a 40-kilometer bike race and a 10-kilometer run.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic distances were chosen to correspond to existing
events in swimming, cycling, and track and field. ``It was a
challenge for us in the early years of trying to get into the
Olympics, because we were fighting the perception of triathlon as a
freak sport,'' Tim Wilson, the executive director of Triathlon
Australia, said.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the demands and the distances, the goal remains the
same: cross the finish line first. The decision to have Olympians
cross it in front of one of the world's most famous buildings was
made shortly after the triathlon received provisional Olympic
status in 1994. That was too late to get on the Olympic program for
the 1996 Games in Atlanta but just right for Sydney, which had
already been awarded the 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
   The initial plan had been to contest the triathlon in Homebush
Bay and finish the event in the Olympic Stadium. Les McDonald, the
president of the International Triathlon Union, thought the Opera
House and the harbor would be an ideal backdrop, however, and he
convinced the Sydney organizers and NBC, which was already planning
to devote airtime to the Danish architect Joern Utzon's masterwork.
</P>
<P>
   Six World Cup triathlon events have already been held on site,
and 11 of the 12 winners were Australians, most recently Peter
Robertson last April. The favorite in the men's race at the
Olympics, though, is Simon Lessing, a South African who left home
at age 18 because he was disenchanted with apartheid and who now
represents Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The women's favorite is Jones, an Australian who is now based in
Carlsbad, Calif., The other two Australian women in the field,
Loretta Harrop and Nicole Hackett, are also medal contenders. Like
Jones, both women are former world champions. Unlike Jones, who
clinched her spot on the team by winning here in April, Harrop and
Hackett were not certain they would be on the team until last
Tuesday, when the Court of Arbitration for Sport finally dismissed
the appeal of Emma Carney, another former Australian world
champion. Carney believed she had not been treated fairly in the
selection process and that either Harrop or Hackett should cede
their place.
</P>
<P>
   There is clearly a glut of Australian triathlon talent, one that
has inspired at least a dozen of the country's elite triathletes to
compete for other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes competing on Saturday and Sunday will begin by
diving off a pontoon next to the Opera House into Farm Cove. After
swimming, they will then bike and run through and around the lush
gardens nearby. Because it is spring, not summer, in Sydney, water
temperatures are cool enough (64 degrees on Sunday) to require
wetsuits. Since triathletes rarely compete in them, the wetsuits
make the transition from water to bike all the more awkward.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much discussion about sharks in the harbor,
although Australian researchers say that cool water reduces the
number of sharks. An increase in shark sightings and aggressive
behavior by sharks earlier this year forced the Sydney organizers
to adopt measures for the April triathlon to soothe the concerns of
foreign competitors. During the Olympics, a team of divers equipped
with anti-shark sonar devices and pods will patrol the water
throughout the swim leg. But in reality, the chance of an attack is
virtually nil. According to Hansen, there has not been a shark
attack in Sydney between the months of May and November in 208
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess NBC will provide the sharks,'' Radkewich joked. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: AMERICANS CAST INTO ROLE AS VILLAINS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ It was a good scrum, a spirited encounter
between an Australian basketball legend and perhaps the most
breathtaking player in the world. Andrew Gaze versus Vince Carter,
for everything in the national-pride kitty.
</P>
<P>
   The enduring image from their altercation during an exhibition
game in Melbourne last Saturday night featured Carter standing over
Gaze, a 35-year-old man with gray flecks near his temples, about to
compete in his fifth Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   No punches were thrown and no one was ejected in the 89-64
United States victory, but the incident immediately thrust the
Americans into the role of international hoops villains _ as
opposed to the hardwood heroes originally scheduled for glory in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The highlights played out badly on Australian television the
next day. It was not just Carter pictured standing over Gaze, like
Ali over Liston, or Alonzo Mourning berating an Australian female
referee called in as a replacement for an injured official; during
one inadvertent and later-corrected call made beside the American
bench, every reserve and assistant leaped up incredulously, as if
the Russians had again been given extra seconds in Munich.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men are 40-0 since National Basketball Association
players were first allowed to compete in 1992. But the 15,000
people who turned out for the pre-Olympic doubleheader _ American
men and women versus Australia _ saw David Stern's newest marketing
tool malfunction on occasion, showing its age. They watched
inferior players get under the skin of the Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   Gaze admitted to instigating the mess, which began with him
hooking Carter's arm while trying to draw a foul in the opening
minutes. The two went to the floor and rolled to midcourt, locked
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince was running at me and I tried to draw a foul, and I
probably grabbed him to try to exaggerate a foul,'' Gaze said.
``There was no malice in it. Certainly not. Unfortunately, he
interpreted it as I was having a go at him or something like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The hot-headed Australian point guard Shane Heal got in Carter's
face and made him more enraged. It took a low-key Ray Allen to calm
Carter down and avoid deportment.
</P>
<P>
   In that one emotionally charged moment, the Preen Team had
arrived Down Under, for an ugly night of American Rules Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you rather worry about that fine line and possibly get
beat?'' Carter said afterward. ``Or would you rather be aggressive
and deal with it?''
</P>
<P>
   Either Australia and other parts of the world are co-opting the
game enough to make America sweat, or some of the greatest
entertainers on earth need to deal with some fear-of-failure issues
soon, before they come across as insecure kids unable to realize
their place in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies are indeed growing up with the game. The men
finished sixth in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992 and fourth in Atlanta
in '96, just missing a medal. The women, who won a bronze in
Atlanta and may push the United States for gold, gave Lisa Leslie
and Sheryl Swoopes a competitive run before the men played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the basketball is so fantastic in the U.S., it's quite
often hard for them to realize what goes on in the rest of the
world,'' Gaze said. ``There is an enormous amount of talent around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if the American men could be beaten. ``It would
have to be an extraordinary set of circumstances for that to
happen,'' he said. ``It's highly unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans' composure causes more concern than the
competition. Gary Payton and Tim Hardaway feed off the bully role,
always talking and instigating.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Garnett is more playful, but he can't just win; he needs
to dominate to feel good about himself. Zo is Zo, always ready to
blow _ whether it's New York or New Zealand. Level-headed souls
like Allen, Allan Houston, Jason Kidd and Steve Smith are almost
obscured.
</P>
<P>
   At the world championships in Toronto in 1994, a team featuring
Shawn Kemp and Larry Johnson made Stern wince in disgust. On an
international stage, they yakked and then cracked, grabbing their
crotches, taunting inferior nations.
</P>
<P>
   With Charles Barkley elbowing an Angolan and his teammates
refusing to wear Reebok's team apparel because of endorsement
conflicts in 1992, even the authentic Dream Team was good for an
international incident or two.
</P>
<P>
   In their own cocoon before the exhibition on Saturday night, the
Americans somehow felt disrespected by the host nation. Several
players said they were emotionally wounded by a pregame article in
a Sydney newspaper that said, essentially, that they were a team of
nobodies, instead of lauding them as the world's greatest players.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they felt that the Southern Hemisphere had to be
eternally punished. ``My motto is, you don't wake a sleeping dog,''
Mourning said after the game. ``I felt a little disrespected.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Tomjanovich, the U.S. coach, actually went along with this
theme proving, sadly, that even overseas you must feel slighted and
have your guys back to maintain respect in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, too, often created artificial motivation, using
the most innocuous comments to juice himself up for a game. He
could be ornery and mean for no justifiable reason. But he also
comported himself well internationally, understanding that he was
the show rather than a bull imported for the local matador to slay.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 team, with an average age of 27.6 years, is made up of
youngsters in many ways, players who do not yet fully grasp their
role as celebrity ballplayers who deigned to come to Sydney and
compete against mortals. Like the league today, they simply do not
yet have the pedigree, experience or the tools of some of their
mature and classy Olympic predecessors.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least they have three weeks to grow up. &QL;

FAMILIES OF SLAYER, VICTIM CAUGHT UP IN MISSOURI'S DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ One man is dead. Another is waiting to die.
</P>
<P>
   One mother mourns a son murdered 11 years ago. Another couple
prepares to lose their son to Missouri's death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Lifelong residents of Kansas City, the Harris and Willoughby
families had never seen one another until after George Harris
killed 20-year-old Stan Willoughby in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the trial, at which Harris was sentenced to death by
lethal injection, the families never met.
</P>
<P>
   Late tonight, they will be together in the Potosi Correctional
Center in southeastern Missouri. Unless a last-minute stay of
execution spares Harris, his family and the Willoughbys will watch
prison authorities strap him to a gurney and inject an intravenous
poison that will kill him a few minutes after midnight. He will be
the fourth Jackson County resident executed by the state since
Missouri reinstated the death penalty in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' death will provide closure for Minnie Willoughby,
Stanley's mother, and an additional measure of pain for Edward and
Carrie Mae Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard on his mother, just like it was for
me,'' Willoughby, 62, said last week. ``She's going to hurt just
like I did. I got nothing against that family. No, his execution's
not going to change anything, but it's going to help me. I want him
executed. If you can't give a life, don't take a life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harrises say they feel for Willoughby but want their son's
life spared.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you can prepare yourself for that,'' said
Edward Harris, 66, on his son's approaching execution. ``I'm just
trying to cope with it. I feel for Mrs. Willoughby. I imagine she
feels like we do about our son. She misses him. We sure do miss
ours. When young men and young girls make mistakes, it hurts two
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 300 miles away from Kansas City, alone in his cell on
death row, George Harris tries to push aside thoughts of his
family, his two children and Stanley Willoughby. Instead he focuses
on his law books, looking for an angle that might save his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to lie on the gurney, it will hurt me to see my
parents over there,'' said Harris, 41.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke into a telephone receiver, his words echoed faintly
from behind the bulletproof glass in the prison's visiting room.
``I apologized in the course of the trial. Mrs. Willoughby don't
have no remorse for me. I understand how she feels. I can't change
her feelings. I got to be strong. I wish I could change the pain.''
Family ties
</P>
<P>
   In the face of death, a parent's love is stubborn.
</P>
<P>
   Minnie Willoughby remembers her son as a generous young man who
helped those in need. The fact that he died in a house considered a
crack den by authorities has no bearing on who he was, she
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that,'' Willoughby said.
``People're going to lie and say what they are going to say. But it
doesn't matter. Stanley had a very good attitude. If he had
something you needed, he'd give it to you. That's how I raised my
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Harrises describe their son as ``just as normal
as can be. He's nice,'' his mother said. ``He wouldn't harm a hair
on your head. You'd like him. Nice person. Very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Donn-e, 17, called her father a ``good man. He
tells me to carry myself as a young lady.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was another side to Harris. He had five felony
convictions between 1976 and 1989. He also was accused of four
armed robberies, but the charges were later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Then on March 11, 1989, Harris killed Stanley Willoughby.
</P>
<P>
   According to evidence presented in the trial, Harris shot
Willoughby with a .41 caliber-Magnum revolver at Willoughby's house
on Chelsea Avenue. Prosecutors said Harris killed Willoughby
because he was too slow in fetching machine guns that Harris had
asked him to hide.
</P>
<P>
   The defense countered that Willoughby and others in the house
had tried to steal the Thompson and Uzi machine guns that belonged
to Harris and, in the resulting argument, Harris killed Willoughby
in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody else saw the victim with a gun,'' said Patrick W.
Peters, who prosecuted Harris. ``Harris was well known for robbing
and shooting people. This is a cold mother. You don't have guns?
Bam! Go find them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner Davis, an attorney representing Harris, claims to have
found an ``impartial third-party witness who saw (Willoughby)
advancing with a weapon at Harris. That would have been of critical
importance. The jury would have benefited from hearing that
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis filed petitions for a stay with the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the 8th Circuit and the Missouri Supreme Court, which were
denied Friday. He filed another petition with the U.S. Supreme
Court on Monday.
Death row
</P>
<P>
   George Harris has spent his 10 years at Potosi studying the law
and regretting the day he laid eyes on those machine guns. To him,
what happened that day stemmed from a simple business transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in the streets, you're hustling,'' Harris said.
``You deal with hot stuff.'' As he spoke, he slapped the palm of
his left hand or tapped the bulletproof glass to emphasize a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a salesman out to make a profit. The guns were pawned to
me for $500. I could sell them for $2,000. That's what I'm looking
at. It's like real estate. You buy a house for a certain amount,
fix it up and sell it for more. See what I'm saying?''
</P>
<P>
   He dismisses any characterizations of him as a violent man. In
his mind, they are exaggerations of people who have set him up so
they wouldn't have to go to jail. He continues to assert that he
shot Willoughby in self-defense. He regrets his fondness for
gambling that first drew him to the streets. He says he is now a
practicing Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in somebody more powerful than me and you,'' Harris
said. ``If the execution takes place, I believe I will meet my
higher power. I know I got a good heart. He knows. Nobody's
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   He first learned that his execution had been scheduled when he
was removed from the general prison population last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come and get you and handcuff you and then they tell
you,'' he said. ``It hit me. I wasn't going to do something silly.
I wasn't going to cry. My attitude _ where you going to take me?
Let's go. That's how I look at it. Let's go.''
Home front
</P>
<P>
   Edward and Carrie Mae Harris blame the judicial system for their
son's plight. In their view, George Harris should not have been
charged with first-degree murder for a shooting they say resulted
from an argument and was not premeditated.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they catch themselves talking about him in the past
tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never talked back or cursed me,'' Edward Harris said last
week from his home on East 58th Terrace, off Swope Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of our children,'' Carrie Mae Harris said sitting near
her husband in the living room. ``We've been lucky on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Harris estimated that he has spent almost $40,000 in
legal fees on behalf of his son, mortgaging his house to raise the
money. With interest, he said he owes $66,000 on the loan, a huge
amount for a man who earns only $1,900 a month from a retirement
fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to be a parent when you're poor and have to
work,'' he said. ``We had to work nights. Your kids are supposed to
be home, but might not be. They might just beat you home five
minutes before you arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Mae Harris looked at a faded wedding photograph of her
daughter. It is a group portrait. George Harris stands near his
sister wearing a white shirt, blue vest and matching slacks. He
looks directly at the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my son,'' Carrie Mae Harris said.  &LR; brk:Wrongs
</P>
<P>
   Harris' execution is the talk of the 4600 block of East 46th
Terrace, where Willoughby was raised. It's a dead-end street dotted
with boarded-up homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he get a choice how he dies?'' a man asked about Harris.
``He get to choose how he's going to die?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't kill him,'' a woman said. ``It would be torture
to stay there for life. Only Jesus can take a life. You think he
found Jesus?''
</P>
<P>
   Minnie Willoughby doesn't participate in the street gossip. She
spends her days at her fiance's house on Prospect Avenue and her
nights working at a group home.
</P>
<P>
   Most afternoons, she sits on the porch in slippers, shorts and a
tank top, away from the hot kitchen where she bakes bread. She
thinks about Stanley Willoughby and another son who was killed when
a man tried to rob him. Like Stanley Willoughby, the other son was
just 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, still another of her surviving three sons
suffered a leg wound in a shooting. So commonplace is the violence
around her that she can't recall the month he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two sons dead and gone,'' Willoughby said, returning
from the kitchen where she had checked her bread. ``It's not easy _
especially holidays. You have good days, bad days. I'm used to
being around my boys. We had good times together.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her son was planning to go to college in Arkansas but
became a father when he was 16 and scrapped his education plans.
When he died, he had four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Stanley got shot, I was in bed asleep,'' Willoughby said,
staring across the street at a garbage truck. The truck drove off,
but her gaze didn't waver. ``Somebody called me on the phone. I was
stuck, in shock, couldn't move. I sat there and finally a doctor
called from Truman. `Is my child dead?' `Mrs. Willoughby we need
you to sign some papers.' I had a feeling he was dead. They didn't
have to tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, prison officials informed Willoughby that an
execution date had been set for Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought they had forgotten about me,'' she said. ``I
don't feel they should have kept him on death row so long. I work
every day. My taxes feed him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   She expects to feel relief when she sees Harris strapped to the
gurney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked in the nursing field for 25 years,'' Willoughby
said. ``I've seen things every day _ gunshots, stab wounds, you
name it. It won't disturb me to watch him die. When you are in this
world, you got to be part of the world and not do things that is
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have feelings for everybody, but wrong is wrong and he was
wrong.''

SPORTS COLUMN: AMID BUMPS AND SPIKES, A LABOR OF FRIENDSHIP 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ On a gorgeous morning at Bondi Beach, two
solitary figures stepped inside the 10,000-seat arena built for
Olympic beach volleyball competition. They stood and looked.
</P>
<P>
   All was quiet. High sun, deep blue sky and the Tasman Sea
serving as a backdrop for the surfers riding the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Annett Davis and Jennifer Johnson-Jordan looked around the
stadium, soaked up sights and sounds of a place that soon would be
crazy with cheering and tension over a competition.
</P>
<P>
   For now there was peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really beautiful here early,'' Davis said Monday. ``I
want to enjoy it, and remember this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Johnson-Jordan, along with Misty May and Holly McPeak,
are vying to become the first American women to win a gold medal in
beach volleyball, a sport that made its Olympic debut at Atlanta in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   They are like thousands of other Olympians who have persevered,
shouldered burdens and broken barriers to get here.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many in the sport, Davis and Johnson-Jordan have made the
trip as an unbroken unit. They also represent a bridge that links
families, generations and memories. Davis' father is Cleveland
Buckner, who played one season with the Knicks. But Buckner is part
of enduring history. His claim to fame is that he once scored 33
points against Wilt Chamberlain in 1962 in Hershey, Pa.
Unfortunately that was the afternoon Chamberlain scored 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson-Jordan's father is Rafer Johnson, who won the gold medal
in the decathlon in 1960 Rome Games. The fathers have made it clear
that these Games are about their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased and excited,'' Buckner said from California.
``But this is really about Annett and how hard she's worked. Who
knew that it would ever get to this level? From getting her
involved in something to keep her busy to reaching the Olympics,
that's pretty special.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from UCLA, where they were teammates, roommates
and best friends, Johnson-Jordan and Davis decided to play beach
volleyball rather than seek a spot on the United States women's
indoor team. The two started out in the beach team format and
played a handful of two-women tournaments in 1997 before switching
full time in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport defined by frequent breakups and mercenary alliances,
the greatest achievement of this tandem is having stayed together
for nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial decision to get together was not based on results
or competition because we never played together,'' Jordan-Johnson
said. ``We made the commitment before we had even played a
tournament together. We didn't want to have to worry about being
dumped or having to dump some one else. We just wanted to be able
to relax in our environment. Making that commitment allowed us to
do that. The commitment makes you more comfortable and trusting.''
</P>
<P>
   The international experience tested faith, friendship and
commitment. In their first season on the world outdoor tour in
1997, they finished 93rd over all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to hang in,'' Davis said. ``Financially we
weren't making any money. I was in the hole, but every month
something would come along right on time that allowed us to pay our
bills. I knew this was where I was supposed to be. I wasn't
supposed to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkably short span of three years, they have risen to
the upper echelon of their sport. By 1999 they were ranked No. 2.
Now they have a chance to be the first American women to win an
Olympic medal in beach volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when Johnson-Jordan still can't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each step that we've taken, ever since we knew we had
qualified, this becomes a little more real,'' Johnson-Jordan said.
``It started with making the team and then getting our gear, going
through processing, getting on the plane now arriving here at the
venue. It's going to take more and more steps to feel like its here
as we go to opening ceremonies, as we put our uniforms on for the
first time.''
</P>
<P>
   The circle will be complete when her father and mother arrive in
Sydney Monday. Johnson won his first Olympic medal in Melbourne in
1956; in 1984 he ignited the Olympic flame in Los Angeles. This
week he will effectively pass the torch to his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that motivates me,'' Johnson-Jordan said
``It makes the whole experience that much more special. To be on
the 2000 Olympic team 44 years after my dad won a medal in the same
country is sentimental. It is.'' &QL;

WEAK BREWERS OUTMUSCLE THE STRUGGLING METS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bad teams are supposed to be dangerous in September.
They are relaxed, the thinking goes, with nothing to play for but a
chance to spoil a good team's season. The Mets are finding that to
be true.
</P>
<P>
   They lost two of three over the weekend to the Philadelphia
Phillies, who had baseball's worst record. Monday night, they
played host to the Milwaukee Brewers, another also-ran, and again
the Mets crumbled. They managed only seven hits in an 8-2 defeat,
with bases-empty home runs accounting for all their offense at Shea
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lost for the eighth time in 10 games in September,
dropping to three games behind the Atlanta Braves in the National
League East. Their wild-card lead over Arizona was cut to four
games before the Diamondbacks played at Los Angeles later Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   A weak team is weak for a reason, and the Brewers have
baseball's worst batting average and have issued the most walks.
But Monday night they banged 12 hits, the final one a 425-foot
homer over the left-field bleachers by Charlie Hayes, whom the Mets
released this spring. And when walks got the Brewers in a
bases-loaded jam in the third inning, the Mets could not take
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets played without one of baseball's best bases-loaded
hitters, third baseman Robin Ventura, who was benched by Manager
Bobby Valentine in favor of Matt Franco. They also played without
an effective starter in Rick Reed.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had won 8 of Reed's last 10 starts, but he was not
sharp Monday night. Richie Sexson muscled a homer to right-center
on the first pitch of the second inning, and Mark Loretta doubled
in two by outlasting Reed on a nine-pitch at-bat in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Reed (9-5) worked a perfect fourth and fifth, but Geoff Jenkins
doubled off the top of the right-field wall to lead off the sixth,
and Hayes singled him in. With one out and the bases loaded, the
pitching coach Dave Wallace visited Reed on the mound. One pitch
later, Raul Casanova lifted a sacrifice fly to the warning track in
left, and the Brewers led by 5-2. After a strikeout to end the
sixth, Reed's evening was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' runs had come on bases-empty homers, by Franco in the
second and Benny Agbayani in the third. Franco's homer was his
second this month _ no Met has three _ and of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Franco struggled for four months with the Mets, partly because
he thought he could be a power hitter. In a two-week stint at Class
AAA Norfolk in August, he shortened his swing and has gotten back
to hitting line drives. Two of those have gone over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   But none of Franco's 13 career home runs have come with the
bases loaded, and he batted in that situation in the third. After
Agbayani's two-out homer, Milwaukee starter Paul Rigdon wavered,
allowing a single to Derek Bell and two walks. Franco came up and
lined sharply to short, but Loretta caught it on one hop and threw
out Franco to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rigdon lasted until the seventh, when David Weathers relieved
him with two outs and a runner on, and got Agbayani to fly out.
Rigdon improved to 4-4 over all with the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura almost always starts against right-handers, and he
seemed dumbfounded to be out of the lineup for the third time in
five games. Like most players, Ventura seems to believe he can best
fight a slump by playing through it. Valentine had given him that
chance until this month, when the slump has worsened.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine rested Ventura last Wednesday because a ball had
deflected off the top of the batting cage and struck his elbow in
batting practice the day before; Ventura said he was healthy enough
to play. Ventura got a routine off-day Sunday but was benched again
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said that Ventura needed the extra day to give him
time to work on his swing. ``You don't hit with theory _ you hit
with feeling,'' Valentine said. ``And he needs to have a good
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, whose .222 batting average is about 50 points below his
career mark, accepted Valentine's decision, though he sounded a bit
bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what's going to happen, so that's what I'm going to
do,'' Ventura said. ``I understand it. I don't blame him at all.
All I'm doing is trying to work to get better, and when he wants to
play me, he's going to play me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has 3 hits in his last 43 at-bats and no hits in his
last 23. He has essentially been in a season-long slump and has
tried subtle adjustments in his stance all year. On Sunday, he
said, he learned of a new flaw to correct, and he took an extra
round of batting practice Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to see the ball a little bit longer, really,''
Ventura said. ``Instead of hitting ground balls to the right side
all the time, just staying up the middle a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said the hitting coach Tom Robson and another coach
noticed this flaw on videotape on Sunday. Robson said it was ``not
a new revelation.'' In any case, he said, Ventura has been too
often standing with his front shoulder turned toward third base in
an effort to reach the outside pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Robson said Ventura needed to stand upright at the plate and get
back to driving the ball to all fields, especially to center and
right. ``It's just controlling your center of gravity,'' Robson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine would not commit to starting Ventura Tuesday night,
but he did say this was not an audition for Franco to take over at
third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a productive third baseman, that's for sure,''
Valentine said. ``But this isn't any plan for that. Robin's going
to be the guy.'' &QL;

BACKERS CONFIDENT INTERNET WINE SALES CRACKDOWN WILL PASS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Utah)   By CARL HULSE   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Backers of a federal crackdown on
direct-to-consumer sales of wine and spirits remain optimistic
Congress will this year enact legislation that would give states
new authority to block such interstate shipments.
</P>
<P>
   Though the bill aimed primarily at the growing market in
Internet sales has been stalled in the Senate since March, its
supporters say it is likely the ``21st Amendment Enforcement Act''
will be attached to one of the sweeping catch-all measures that
will move through Congress in the next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very hopeful it is going to be passed this year,'' said
a spokeswoman for Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the Judiciary Committee
chairman who has championed the initiative for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, a
powerful lobbying force behind the effort, expressed a similar
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very confident,'' said David Dickerson, a spokesman for
the group. ``Senator Hatch has not backed down one iota and he is
not a member to be taken lightly. He has assured us it is very high
on his agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Even wine industry lobbyists leery of the legislation conceded
there is a good chance the measure will be part of the flood of
legislation likely to clear Congress in the final pre-election
surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see some pretty massive bills in the next
couple of weeks and I think it will go through on one of those,''
said Simon Siegl, head of the American Vintners Association.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate passed separate shipment restrictions
last year, but the latest Senate version has been mired in
unrelated political fights.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, state legal officials would be granted
the power to go into federal court to block shipments made
illegally into states that bar such transactions. The 21st
Amendment lifting Prohibition gave states broad authority to
regulate sale and transport of liquor within their borders.
</P>
<P>
   Some state attorneys general joined liquor distributors in
complaining to Congress that the Internet was enabling shippers to
bypass legal channels and making it easy for minors to buy alcohol
via the Web. States said they needed access to federal courts to
pursue out-of-state sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The wine lobby disputed the underage access claim and said
wholesalers were simply trying to protect their financial interest
as middlemen. Vintners say the Internet presents a substantial new
marketing opportunity for smaller wineries that don't produce
enough wine to make them attractive to the wholesalers that control
the national distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   But the vintners association and the California-based Wine
Institute dropped their opposition to the legislation after the
Senate Judiciary Committee last March added a provision that
narrowed the reach of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of Internet sales say such limiting language could be
important in court, where they believe the issue will ultimately be
decided.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in New York last week ruled that a challenge
could proceed to that state's prohibition on direct shipments of
out-of-state wines to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Judge Richard Berman, saying times and technology had
changed, refused to grant a request by wholesalers to dismiss the
suit on the grounds that the ban had been previously found
Constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technological advancements facilitate _ as never before _ the
commerce between and among states,'' wrote Berman in clearing the
way for possible trial in the suit brought by the Washington-based
Institute for Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson warned against reading too much into the initial
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point he has heard almost no facts in the case,'' said
the spokesman for the wholesalers. ``This decision isn't based on
the merits of the case as much as it is simply he was in a position
where he felt like it had to move forward.''

DEADBEAT DOT-COMS UP FOR BID 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD WALLACK  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Going ... going ... dot-gone.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest trend in online auctions, money-losing Internet
firms are now putting themselves on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Philip Kaplan, founder of an irreverent Web site with
a profane name that skewers failing Internet enterprises, put
F_company.com up for sale on EBay.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to more than 27,000 subscribers, Kaplan said he
decided to put the 3-month-old site up for auction because he was
``bored.''
</P>
<P>
   The site, a play off the trendy business magazine Fast Company,
trumpets itself as a ``dead pool'' for dot-coms, awarding game
points to surfers who most-accurately predict the demise of
e-commerce firms.
</P>
<P>
   By yesterday afternoon, the auction attracted more than 70 bids,
with the top bid just under $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the auction has all the appearance of a prank since
Kaplan's site, after all, pokes fun at the Internet economy. Sure
enough, the person who placed a $10 million bid, Edward Reed,
turned out to be a college sophomore at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a joke,'' Reed said of his bid. The bid was later
removed, and some other bids appeared to be made in jest. Although
EBay requires people who place bids of more than $15,000 to give
their credit card numbers, there is usually no financial penalty
for placing phony bids, though users can be suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kaplan told Cnet that he was serious about the auction.
He said he didn't have time to convert the site into a profitable
business. And he said auctioning the site on EBay was easier than
negotiating with individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan isn't alone. Other dot-coms are also trying to sell
themselves online.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, Freewebstuff.com, which paid people to surf the
Web, put itself up for auction on EBay. Spokesman Bill Johnson said
the San Jose firm initially asked for a minimum bid of $2.5 million
and expected the business to fetch as much as $10 million. But the
company didn't get any takers, even after lowering the minimum
threshold bid to $650,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the site has since shut down, Johnson said the
investors will likely try to sell the Internet address on EBay
again. ``A lot of people watch EBay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, a Maryland online auction house, Bid4assets,
successfully sold the assets of a failed dot-com, Civiczone.com.
The auctioneers sold that plus more than 100 other Internet
addresses and some computers for about $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bid4assets Chief Executive Officer Tom Kohn said his company has
10 other dot-com-related sales in the pipeline. The company
concentrates on selling assets for distressed firms. Kohn also said
the average auction on his site is worth $31,000. By contrast,
analysts in the past have pegged EBay's average final bid at
between $25 and $30. An EBay spokesman said that is probably low
now and that it has handled auctions where the final bid was more
than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to sell a Beanie Baby or an autographed
basketball, EBay is the way to go,'' Kohn said. ``We are a site for
investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, though, dot-coms aren't fetching as much money as
they once did.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for instance, MotherNature.com, an online vitamin and
health retailer based near Boston, had a market value of more than
$200 million. Now it is considering a tender offer for $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jonathan Gaw, an analyst with International Data Corp.,
said Kaplan's Web site could be valuable because it is widely read
by venture capitalists, technology journalists, Internet executives
and recruiters. Such audiences are normally coveted by advertisers,
though the vulgar name could scare some away.
</P>
<P>
   Gaw also said an online auction ``makes sense'' for a company
that owes its existence to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Internet is also a haven for pranksters, he
noted, most people still ``go to a reputable auction house when you
auction things off of high value.''

REELING AWAY: CRITICS SAY OUTDATED TAX BLOWS AWAY INHERITANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ARTHUR M. LOUIS  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although the federal inheritance tax has
survived the Republican Party's latest attempt to kill it, its days
may be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Republican-controlled Congress failed to override
President Clinton's veto of a bill that would have phased out the
tax out  &LR; within 10 years. The issue, though, is certain to come up
again throughout the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 82-year-old tax, originally designed to help pay for U.S.
participation in World War I and to ``break up the swollen fortunes
of the rich'' _ as its fervid authors put it _ is becoming an
anachronism.
</P>
<P>
   We're not just talking Bill Gates and Larry Ellison here.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the booming real-estate and stock markets, the
inheritance tax has begun to impinge on the assets of middle-class
citizens who have never attended a $10,000-a-plate fund-raiser and
can't tell you the difference between a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, because of soaring housing prices and
extraordinary investment success, people who thought of themselves
as working Joes are being surprised by this tax,'' says Norm Boone,
a San Francisco financial planner.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, even a Democratic president could find it
politically perilous to support a high-percentage tax that puts the
squeeze on growing legions of his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 65 of the 212 Democrats in the House of Representatives
sided with the Republicans when the bill was passed. The House
failed to override the veto only because several Democrats reneged
on their original votes for the sake of party unity in an election
year.
</P>
<P>
   The tax, which brings the government about $23 billion in
revenues annually, takes a bite out of estates whose value exceeds
$675,000. (There are special exemptions or postponements when
assets are passed along to a spouse.)
</P>
<P>
   The bite starts at 37 percent on assets that exceed $675,000 and
is graduated upward to 55 percent on multimillion-dollar estates.
</P>
<P>
   While the $675,000 cutoff is scheduled to be raised in stages to
$1 million by 2006, the notion that $675,000 today constitutes a
``swollen fortune of the rich'' ought to provoke a few horse laughs
from just about anyone living in the San Francisco Bay Area _
particularly those who have bought or sold a house recently.
</P>
<P>
   Around here, $675,000 will buy you a reasonably spacious,
decently maintained suburban house on a street where it's safe to
walk your dog at night.
</P>
<P>
   In vetoing the bill to terminate the inheritance tax, Clinton
noted that only 2 percent of estates are required to pay it.
</P>
<P>
   He added that while he might be inclined to parcel out tax
breaks from the $4.6 trillion budget surplus projected for the next
decade, he doesn't particularly want to give them to ``the
wealthiest few.''
</P>
<P>
   That viewpoint is echoed by Michael Ettlinger, tax-policy
director of Citizens for Tax Justice, which ardently supports the
inheritance tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to give tax cuts, let's give tax cuts to
people who are most in need,'' he remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the inheritance tax reply that it indirectly has
adverse effects on far more than 2 percent of all estates.
</P>
<P>
   Many people whose estates would otherwise be vulnerable to the
tax manage to avoid it by giving money away or by establishing
foundations and trusts that limit their control of their assets.
</P>
<P>
   Says Dan Blankenburg, manager of legislative affairs with the
National Federation of Independent Business in Washington, D.C.:
``More people deal with this on a daily basis than you can
imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Galina Knackwurst _ not her real name because she
requests anonymity _ an 84-year-old widow living in Corte Madera,
Calif. Her house, which she and her husband built for $30,000 in
1959, now is worth around $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   She worked for many years, but is long retired and living
``comfortably _ as long as I stay well'' off her pension and other
assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, I wouldn't have given the inheritance tax any
thought,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she feels compelled to play the legal angles, which
includes making gifts of up to $10,000 per person per year _ the
tax-exempt limit _ to her son, daughter and their children.
</P>
<P>
   If she doesn't stay well, perhaps her heirs will give some of
the money back to meet any extra expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are all those venturesome high-tech entrepreneurs who
have been fortunate enough to carve out a niche for their new
products and services in this receptive economy.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their reward, they must seek the services of
high-powered tax attorneys _ collectively, perhaps, the biggest
winners as long as the inheritance tax stays on the books.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Golec, 35, an engineer by training, co-founded a software
firm called Supplybase in San Francisco four years ago with two
buddies. Early this ,year they sold the company for about $300
million in stock to I2 Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Golec won't say how much he cleared on the deal, although he
indicates that venture capitalists who financed the firm before the
acquisition got the lion's share.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he has now been introduced by his lawyer to a
brave, new world of revocable trusts and probate avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   He says it is quite a culture shock for someone who, not so long
ago, was ``living off my credit cards.''

GRANDMA BETTY LEFT VALUABLE LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHLEEN PENDER  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Politicians who think estate taxes only impact
oil tycoons, tech millionaires and San Francisco Bay Area
homeowners never knew my grandmother Betty, or thousands of people
like her.
</P>
<P>
   Betty died two weeks ago, just shy of her 95th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her long and frugal life, she accumulated a nest egg
that will probably _ depending on her final medical expenses _ be
subject to estate taxes, which start at 37 percent on anything over
$675,000.
</P>
<P>
   Her small fortune was not built on inherited wealth or real
estate; the condo she lived in until this summer is worth perhaps
$40,000.
</P>
<P>
   She earned her money the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of Austrian immigrants, she grew up on the South
Side of St. Louis, where her job as a girl was cleaning the family
outhouse.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of high school, she went to work as a
stenographer. Although her real and preferred name was Elizabeth,
her boss shortened it to Betty, saying that, ``Elizabeth was too
long a name for such a small lady.'' This being the days before
women's lib, my 4-foot-11-inch grandmother kept her mouth shut and
Betty she became.
</P>
<P>
   At age 21, she married my grandfather, a presser in a tailor
shop. She quit work and had two daughters. But her husband died
suddenly, without life insurance, on my mother's 13th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The next week, she went into the American Red Cross office to
have word sent to relatives in Austria that her husband had died.
Turned out the Red Cross needed a secretary, and my grandmother
needed work. She took the job and held it for 26 years, until she
retired at age 65.
</P>
<P>
   So how did she amass such an ample estate, and put her two
daughters through college, on a secretary's salary?
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and 1970s, she bought 100 or 200 shares in a dozen
or so blue-chip companies. Her brother, a knowledgeable investor
who took big risks with his own money, advised her to stick with
solid companies she knew something about.
</P>
<P>
   Her investments were mostly in St. Louis companies _ like
Anheuser-Busch, Union Electric and Laclede Gas _ and in Fortune 500
outfits such as Exxon and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   She rarely sold a share. She was happy to collect her dividends
and watch her stocks split again and again, and spin off other
companies. The 220 shares of Anheuser Busch she bought in 1979 have
split into 2,640 shares today.
</P>
<P>
   Later in life, Betty invested mainly in certificates of deposit
and Treasury bills. Whenever a CD came due, she would make my mom
drive her to whatever bank in town was offering the best rate.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, she also managed to tuck away money for her eight
grandchildren. After the funeral, my mother handed me an envelope
full of U.S. savings bonds my grandmother began buying for me in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   Until her death, she handled all of her own finances. She would
occasionally call me when a company sent her an incomprehensible
document about a messy merger or a poison-pill plan. I usually
couldn't understand it any better than she could.
</P>
<P>
   Although Betty never took a stock market course or had a
financial adviser, her portfolio looked like a textbook example of
how to invest for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   But our current tax policy does not reward that kind of
behavior. In fact, it discourages it.
</P>
<P>
   Subject to certain exclusions, the government taxes money we
earn, it taxes income from money we save and it taxes money we
leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular opinion, there are not a lot of ways
ordinary people can reduce estate taxes. My grandma could have
spent or given away more money while she was still alive. But then
she would run the risk of outliving her assets. Most people don't
live to be 95, but some do.
</P>
<P>
   Betty's goal in life was to never be dependent on anyone,
including the government, and she never was.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Wallack, one of my younger colleagues at The Chronicle, is
not opposed to estate taxes. He thinks $675,000 is a huge amount of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Many people would agree. Invested entirely in conservative,
income-producing assets (not a house), it might yield 6 percent, or
$40,000 a year. Add Social Security and a pension, and most people
could live quite comfortably _ as long as they didn't suffer a
serious or lingering illness or go into a nursing home. One
ambulance trip cost my grandmother $550.
</P>
<P>
   Todd also figures that if you have to tax somebody, you might as
well tax the dead. After all, most of them don't vote.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the dead that shoulder the estate tax, it's their
heirs.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother's heirs are not rich, and they're not
enthusiastic about estate taxes. My mom, at age 69, still works
full time. Her sister is a retired schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   They're middle-class, Middle Americans. And they vote.

PE RATIOS ARE HARD TO FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ARTHUR M. LOUIS  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have heard stock commentators say that if a company's
earnings are growing at 10 percent per year, its stock should sell
at a price-earnings ratio of 10. If it is growing at 15 percent per
year, the price should be 15 times earnings per share. And so on.
How do they make this calculation?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: That calculation is bogus. It is a superficial rule of
thumb, cobbled together by people who can't or won't think deeply
about such things. Its only merit is to affirm that fast-growing
companies deserve higher price-earnings multiples than slow-growing
companies.
</P>
<P>
   For stocks in general over the course of many decades, 10
percent to 12 percent annual growth is about average. Because stock
prices tend to track earnings in the long run, you could conclude
that a company growing at 10 percent to 12 percent annually
deserves an average price-earnings ratio.
</P>
<P>
   But the average price-earnings ratio varies greatly from year to
year, hinging on such circumstances as the Federal Reserve's
interest-rate policies and expectations about the overall economy's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the average stock among the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 is
selling at a price-earnings ratio of close to 30 times earnings for
the latest 12 months. In years gone by, however, the average
price-earnings ratio has occasionally fallen well below 10.
</P>
<P>
   In calculating an appropriate price-earnings ratio for a stock,
you also have to consider how far ahead a company's present growth
rate is likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
   If Company A and Company B start out with the same earnings, but
A's growth rate is a middling 10 percent and B's is 15 percent,
Company B's earnings will increase by 25 percent more than Company
A's during the five-year period. On that basis, you might conclude
that Company A deserves a middling PE _ say, 25 _ and Company B
deserves a PE in the low 30s. (This assumes that you aren't scared
off by today's historically high PE levels.)
</P>
<P>
   If the same growth rates were to continue for 25 years _ a
scenario that is possible, but extremely dangerous to predict _
then at the end of the quarter-century, Company B's earnings would
increase to three times Company A's. You might therefore conclude
that Company B today deserves a PE of 75 if Company A deserves a PE
of 25.
</P>
<P>
   So, even using this plausible method of appraisal, you get
widely differing results, depending on the prevailing level of PEs
and how far ahead you can confidently predict.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrating? That's investing for you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Long-Term Inheritance
</P>
<P>
   Q: My mother died in April, and I am about to inherit her stock
portfolio. I know that the cost basis of the stock for tax purposes
is the price on the day that she died. But I don't know what the
acquisition date is for tax purposes. Is it the day she died, or
the day she bought the stock?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: You don't have to worry about that, says Internal Revenue
Service spokesman Jesse Weller. If you inherit stock, your capital
gain or loss when you sell is treated as long-term. It doesn't
matter how long you hold the stock, nor does it matter when the
stock was bought by the person who willed it to you _ even if the
purchase was made the day before the death occurred.
</P>
<P>
   When you fill out IRS Schedule D, where capital transactions are
reported, simply write the word ``inherited'' in the column where
you are asked to indicate the purchase date, Weller says. That
automatically signifies that the gain (or loss) was long-term.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
No Deduction on IRA Loss
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several years ago, I invested the $6,000 in my individual
retirement account in a real-estate investment trust. The
investment turned out to be a bad one and is now worth only about
$3,000. Can I convert my traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and then
claim the $3,000 loss as a tax deduction?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you have a deductible IRA, then the answer is an
unequivocal no.
</P>
<P>
   You already deducted your contribution from your income when you
put the money into the account, so you don't have what tax people
call a ``cost basis.'' Or, to put it another way, your cost basis
is zero.
</P>
<P>
   So, anything you remove from the IRA _ whether by taking it out
directly or rolling it over to a Roth _ is treated as ordinary
income, taxable at your usual rate.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you have a nondeductible IRA, then you do
indeed have a cost basis _ the amount of your nondeductible
contributions. Your question doesn't make clear what that amount
is, so I'll assume that it is the $6,000 you sank into your
regrettable REIT investment.
</P>
<P>
   I also have to assume that this is your only IRA. If it is not,
then the situation becomes vastly more complicated, and I would
refer you to IRS Publication 590, ``Individual Retirement
Arrangements.'' You can download a copy from the Internet at
www.irs.gov or call (800) 829-3676 for a hard copy.
</P>
<P>
   IRS spokesman Weller says that if you are converting a
one-and-only IRA to a Roth, and if you later liquidate the Roth,
you may be able to claim a tax deduction. That could be the case if
the value of your Roth account stays below the $6,000 you
originally invested.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose that you close out the Roth and receive proceeds
of $5,000. Then you report a $1,000 deduction on IRS Schedule A, in
the section set aside for ``miscellaneous deductions.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a hitch. If the total of all your
miscellaneous deductions does not exceed 2 percent of your adjusted
gross income, then none of your miscellaneous deductions can be
subtracted from your income. Only the amount above the 2 percent
threshold is deductible.

BAY VIEW CAPITAL SALE POSSIBLE AFTER LENDING UNIT CLOSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM ZUCKERMAN  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bay View Capital said yesterday it will shut its
troubled franchise lending unit and take a restructuring charge of
$14 million, paving the way for the sale of one the largest San
Francisco area banks.
</P>
<P>
   The San Mateo bank, which has about $6 billion in assets, said
it will close its money-losing Franchise Mortgage Acceptance Corp.
by the end of the month. About 140 employees of the unit will lose
their jobs, most of which are in Southern California and New York.
Few are in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   With the unit's fate resolved, ''what we're going to be doing is
evaluating strategic options,'' said Bay View chief executive
Edward Sondker. The phrase is corporate jargon for putting a
company up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The bank should attract plenty of bidders drawn by Bay View's
strong position between San Francisco and San Jose, one of the
richest banking markets in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a very attractive branch network,'' said Joseph
Morford, an analyst with the brokerage Dain Rauscher Wessels. ``I
could come up with a whole laundry list'' of potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the banks that might want to buy Bay View are Wells Fargo,
Honolulu's Bank of the West and Minnesota's US Bancorp, Morford
said.
</P>
<P>
   FMAC, as the Bay View's franchise unit is known, is one of the
nation's largest lenders to buyers of gas stations, restaurant and
other franchises. To make money in the business, Bay View has to
sell FMAC's loans to institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bay View bought the company 10 months ago, that market has
dried up. As a result, the bank has had to slow the unit's lending
to a crawl while still paying its overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Bay View hired the investment bank Merrill Lynch earlier this
year to find a buyer for FMAC, but the offers that came in were
disappointingly small, people familiar with the matter said.
</P>
<P>
   The meltdown at FMAC happened with stunning speed. Bay View paid
about $230 million in cash and stock for it in November 1999. The
bank said it may now have to write down virtually that entire
amount, not counting the recent sale of some of unit's assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible deal,'' said Sondker.

 ESTATE:  Although the federal inheritance tax has survived the
Republican Party's latest attempt to kill it, its days may be
numbered. The 82-year-old tax, originally designed to help pay for
U.S. participation in World War I and to ``break up the swollen
fortunes of the rich'' _ as its fervid authors put it _ is becoming
an anachronism.  By Arthur M. Louis.  
 
 NETWORTH:  Politicians who think estate taxes only impact oil
tycoons, tech millionaires and Bay Area homeowners never knew my
grandmother Betty, or thousands of people like her. Betty died two
weeks ago, just shy of her 95th birthday. Throughout her long and
frugal life, she accumulated a nest egg that will probably _
depending on her final medical expenses _ be subject to estate
taxes, which start at 37 percent on anything over $675,000. Her
small fortune was not built on inherited wealth or real estate; the
condo she lived in until this summer is worth perhaps $40,000.

listen to some rap, usually something like  &UR; Tupac &LR; , something hard

</P>

Harper's wanted to present to the public _ an actress 10 pounds

</P>
<P>
   A magazine representative said the decision didn't have to do

GENENTECH'S BREATH OF FRESH AIR &HT;    By KELLY YAMANOUCHI
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   Myrtle Potter's recent arrival at Genentech Inc. filled a
glaring need for the South San Francisco, Calif., biotech company:
marketing know-how.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing traditionally has not been a major focus of biotech
firms, which tend to be driven by research and development.
</P>
<P>
   But that's changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good indicator that they're recognizing the
commercialization side of the business as equally as important as
research and development,'' said Cynthia Robbins-Roth, a founding
partner of BioVenture Consulting in San Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Potter, Genentech's new executive vice president of commercial
operations and chief operating officer, arrived earlier this year
after moving from pharmaceutical firm Bristol-Myers Squibb.
</P>
<P>
   At Genentech, she is planning the marketing strategy for the
company's next pharmaceutical product, an asthma treatment known as
Xolair.
</P>
<P>
   ``What got me to come to Genentech was coming here and meeting
the people,'' Potter said. ``The people are some of the brightest
and most committed people I've ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   Potter's background is quite different from the extensive
science and research backgrounds of its top executives. Genentech's
last chief operating officer, William D. Young, had a background in
engineering and manufacturing. He departed from the company a year
ago to become chairman of the board and chief executive officer of
ViroLogic Inc., another South San Francisco biotech firm.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hellmann, then senior vice president of development, was
named executive vice president of development and product
operations. She had joined the company as a clinical scientist.
Chief executive Art Levinson began his career at Genentech as a
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Potter took a different route into the pharmaceutical business.
To pay her way through college at the University of Chicago, she
got a job at a hospital. At that time, she was interested in health
care but didn't want to be a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   She found her true passion during an internship at IBM through
the business school. ``I loved the business milieu. I thought it
was stimulating, it was cutting edge, it was fast-paced, it was
innovative,'' Potter said.
</P>
<P>
   She decided to start her career on the business side of health
care. Her first job after graduation was in the patient care
products division of Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has always been on the business side, first with
pharmaceutical company Merck &AMP; Co. for 14 years and then with
Bristol-Myers Squibb for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Potter said managing the high-growth cardiovascular and
metabolics business at Bristol-Myers Squibb prepared her to take on
Genentech's pipeline of products. Potter said she was one of the
lead architects at Merck of the business plan that established
Astra Merck, a joint venture with a Swedish firm that has since
been sold and is now called Astra Zeneca.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Coles, an area vice president at Bristol-Myers Squibb,
has praised Potter for having ``a passion for the business and the
people without compromising on either.''
</P>
<P>
   To Sue Markland Day, president of the Bay Area Bioscience
Center, Potter's move from Bristol-Myers Squibb to Genentech just
means that ``she's seen the light and started to see where all the
action is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the biotech industry, Potter is among only a few African
American women in senior executive positions.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech executives say to be successful, they need diversity in
their leadership and boards of directors, said Robbins-Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Some biotech firms have social circles that perpetuated hiring
of the same types of people to lead the firm _ predominantly white
males _ which could indirectly lead to a stagnation of ideas, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Potter declined to discuss her strategies for bringing Genentech
products to the market. She would say only that it requires ``very
stealth marketing'' to tell physicians how the product is used
before patients come to their offices asking about it.

DISPARITY BETWEEN HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS EXTENDS TO HEALTH, TOO
(COLUMN) &HT;    By TOM ABATE
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week psychologist Nancy Adler will take the wraps off a
guerrilla scientific group that is questioning biotechnology's
governing premise, namely that the best way to fight disease is by
finding and fixing the mechanical breakdowns that plague us.
</P>
<P>
   Adler would agree that when illness does gum up the body's
works, researchers should design drugs or devices to treat the
ailment.
</P>
<P>
   But as the director of the Center for Health and Community at
the University of California at San Francisco, Adler says we put
too much emphasis on mechanical medicine, and too little effort
into addressing issues like income, race and social status that can
also spell the difference between sickness and health.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to health than your genes and organs,'' said
Adler. ``Who you are, where you live and how you live makes a huge
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Health and Community is a group of 250
researchers, many of them anthropologists, sociologists and other
social scientists, who are amassing evidence to support the view
that disease has a social dimension. Working out of UCSF, one of
the bastions of biotechnology, has left Adler and her allies
feeling somewhat beleaguered.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, people (like us) have felt like a band of
outcasts,'' she said, as the glory _ and research funds _ flowed to
scientists who tinker with the body's molecular machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of money to figure out what makes us sick,'' she
said. ``But there's not a lot to study what makes us well.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Adler's social scientists have been toiling away for a
couple of years at UCSF, she plans to christen the center's offices
at the Laurel Heights campus Thursday to raise the visibility of
their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center is one of those places that will be very important
if we hope to eliminate the disparities in health between different
racial, ethnic and economic groups,'' said Surgeon General David
Satcher, who will officiate Thursday's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   These disparities are enormous. Consider infant mortality.
African American babies are 2.5 times more likely than Caucasian
children to die during their first year, Satcher said. Native
Americans and African Americans both suffer diabetes more
frequently than the general populace. Vietnamese women have five
times the rate of cervical cancer as women of other ethnic groups,
and the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these differences can be tied to income. Poor people
have less access to insurance and medical care, nutrition and
exercise. But social status has been shown to affect disease in
ways that seem to confound the view of man as a machine whose
breakdowns are primarily caused by malfunctioning parts.
</P>
<P>
   One influential study of thousands of British civil servants _
all of whom had access to the same socialized health care _ found
that their status in the hierarchy was the single best predictor of
health.
</P>
<P>
   Even after controlling for age, weight, family history and other
medical variables, people in the top rank were healthier than those
in the second rank, and so on down to the ninth and lowest tier of
officials who were the sickest of the lot.
</P>
<P>
   It would be as if BMWs driven in Richmond evidenced more engine
and transmission breakdowns than the same cars driven in Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``One rheumatologist described two patients, one a truck driver
and the other an insurance executive, who had such similar
arthritis indications that their charts could have been
interchangeable,'' Adler said. ``A year later the truck driver was
flat on his back, while the executive was still working and playing
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for such different outcomes in two similar
patients, treated by the same physician? Adler postulates that
people who feel in charge of their lives are healthier. They have
greater disease resistance, and when they do get chronic conditions
like arthritis, they are more apt to have milder symptoms than
people who feel they are being ground underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   Social analysis can also be applied to the health status of
ethnic and minority groups, although such efforts are likely to
raise eyebrows or touch nerves. For instance, one group of center
researchers is puzzling over why Latino women have fewer postnatal
problems than African American women of comparable economic status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latino women, despite their poverty, have fairly good birth
outcomes,'' Adler said, leading researchers to ask, ``What is it
about Latino culture that is protective'' of pregnant women?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the flip side of the question carries an implicit
criticism of African American culture, imparting a preachy and
judgmental tone to the social school of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say I'm guilty of that, but I don't think it's
preaching,'' said Satcher, who added that he believes individual
choice is constrained by the circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people should exercise five days a week, but if we
don't have parks that are safe to walk and jog in,'' Satcher said,
then it is society that is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers like Adler say the best way to improve health is
through community organization. Consider lung cancer, a top killer
and one that disproportionately affects the poor. Finding a new
treatment for lung cancer would be great. But eliminating cigarette
billboards and undertaking aggressive anti-smoking campaigns could
prevent the cancers before they start. Likewise, Adler would target
the surplus of liquor stores in poor neighborhoods to lessen the
problems of alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But such organizing impulses must come from the grass roots.
They can't be imposed by visiting do-gooders. ``Two things have
failed in the past,'' Adler said. ``Academics have failed when they
parachuted into a community, and communities have failed when they
didn't have the expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   What the center hopes to do is help community groups tackle
their own public health problems by linking the groups to
foundation grants and government programs to pay for public health
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Social health advocates hope to do more than bemoan the problem.
``We have set a 10-year goal of eliminating disparities in health
care between different racial, ethnic and economic groups,''
Satcher said.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem wildly optimistic. After all, haves and have-nots
are the oldest rivals in history.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems to me that a nation smart enough to crack the
genetic code, and bold enough to redesign plants, animals and even
people, should have the moral courage to make sure that all its
people get the same basic health care.
</P>
<P>

health effort, contact Susan Garritson at (415) 476-7408 or visit

EMERSON COUNTED ON BY KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ As the Los Angeles Kings' first-round
playoff series vs. Detroit was slipping away last spring, no one
felt more helpless than Nelson Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   He had been brought in at the March 15 trade deadline along with
Kelly Buchberger to provide scoring and character. Against the Red
Wings, the Kings showed neither.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, a five-time 20-goal scorer, was sidelined with a broken
finger, suffered just five games after he joined the team from
Atlanta. He got back for the fourth and final game against Detroit,
but his Kings career really began last Friday with the opening of
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think about the improvements we made over the summer, I
count Nelson in there,'' said coach Andy Murray, an assistant in
Winnipeg during the 1993-94 season when Emerson scored a
career-high 33 goals for the Jets. ``He has looked terrific in our
first few practices, great timing and instincts. We didn't get to
see much of him last year, but you're going to hear a lot about
this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson will be teamed on the second line with center Bryan
Smolinski and winger Glen Murray. With the contract holdout of
first-line center Jozef Stumpel expected to drag on, the
performance of the second unit could become even more critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I played only five games last year before the
injury, I got back for the last game of the playoffs and that made
me feel like part of the team,'' Emerson said. ``I didn't come in
this week feeling like a stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be a stretch to say Emerson, 33, has felt that way
the past few years. He has played for five organizations since the
end of the 1998 season. The next year began with 33 games for
Carolina, 27 games with Chicago, three more with Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson signed a four-year deal with expansion Atlanta last
summer that will pay him $1.8 million this year and also has an
option year in 2002-03 at $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   By joining the Kings in a deal that sent Donald Audette and
Franticek Kaberle to the Thrashers, Emerson was reunited with Rob
Blake, a friend from childhood outside Toronto and a college
teammate at Bowling Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent a lot of time together since I`ve gotten here,''
said Emerson, who moved his family to Southern California last
month.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: No movement on the Stumpel front. The Kings have
offered a three-year contract for more per season than the $1.75
million he made in 1999-2000. . . . Newcomer Mathieu Schneider
missed practice with a hip pointer. Fourth-line center Bob Corkum
will skip today's workout with the same injury.

LATEST USE FOR ONE'S DNA: THWARTING COUNTERFEITERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CAROLYN SAID
</P>
<P>
   &LR; c &LR; .2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
</P>
<P>
   Syd the platypus, Millie the echidna and Olly the kookaburra
have a secret weapon to foil counterfeiting crooks.
</P>
<P>
   The furry mascots of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney _ as
well as an avalanche of caps, T-shirts, mugs, pins and other
official Olympics merchandise _ are being tagged with invisible ink
containing DNA strands from an unidentified Australian athlete.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to thwart increasingly sophisticated forgers trying
to get a piece of the $389 million market for Olympics keepsakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-quality infringements have increased during the past
couple of months leading up to the games,'' said Catherine McGill,
legal counsel and brand protection manager for the Sydney
Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games. Detail-oriented
counterfeiters ``copy the swing tags, sewn-in labels and packaging.
That is where the DNA comes into its own as being the absolutely
foolproof, sure way to determine if something is fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ways to combat counterfeiting, such as holograms, can be
duplicated by determined bootleggers.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA-laced ink is being applied to most of the 3,500 official
souvenirs _ some 50 million individual items. It's the largest
deployment ever of DNA as a security device.
</P>
<P>
   McGill oversees a team of 60 ``logocops'' equipped with special
scanners that can detect the DNA ink. The logocops will roam Sydney
and other Australian cities, pouncing on street vendors and retail
outlets to determine whether their merchandise is authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Australian customs officials have already seized more than
120,000 phony Olympics souvenirs worth millions of dollars that
were being sent into the country from overseas, largely from Asia,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   DNA Technologies of Los Angeles is the company behind the
initiative, which reportedly costs about 5 cents per item.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Outwater, president of DNA Technologies, said the process
involves extracting DNA from a blood sample, taking a fraction of
it, then amplifying it and adding a small amount to the invisible
ink. Some ``junk DNA'' is also thrown into the mix as a red
herring, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way someone could take (a sample tag) and reproduce
the mark,'' he said. ``Imagine standing outside the New York City
Public Library and challenging a counterfeiter: `I'm using one
sentence from one book inside that library; you find that
sentence.' That's how daunting it would be for someone to figure
out what the code is.''
</P>
<P>
   Using DNA, the unique biological signature of each human, for
such a commercial purpose signifies how society has come to view
DNA as a magic potion, said Susan Lindee, co-author of ``The DNA
Mystique: The Gene as a Cultural Icon,'' a 1995 book. ``It's the
commercialization of the genome to the most ridiculous degree,''
she said. ``Promoters have been successful at weaving into popular
culture the idea that DNA is the ultimate arbiter of what's true,
authentic, real.''
</P>
<P>
   She challenged Outwater's assertion that a DNA security code
would be counterfeit-proof. ``Most people don't have that kind of
technical expertise, but if they're only using a sequence there are
plenty of individuals who could be hired (to duplicate it),'' she
said. ``If it became truly profitable _ let's say all designer
clothing were tagged with DNA _ there'd be somebody who had a
financial stake in figuring out how to copy the DNA and fake it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outwater said some well-known designer brands have adopted the
technology on sewn-in labels, but prefer not to publicize it. He
hopes to extend the technology to such areas as pharmaceuticals and
cosmetics, and to secure documents and financial instruments,
including passports, currency and ID cards.
</P>
<P>
   A reliable, duplication-proof means of authenticating goods is
sorely needed. Counterfeit goods in the United States amount to
some $200 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Fine arts and sports collectibles are areas where authentication
is crucial. Artist Thomas Kinkade incorporates some of his own DNA
into the signatures inked on his artwork.
</P>
<P>
   PSA/DNA Authentication Services of Newport Beach, Calif.,
licenses the DNA Technologies product to authenticate sports
memorabilia and autographs. After starting with Mark McGwire's
record-setting 70th home-run ball, it next tagged Hank Aaron's
715th home-run ball and bat, and now broadly uses the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major League Baseball asked us to authenticate all the game
balls used during the World Series,'' said Jason Meyerson, PSA/DNA
president. ``We can apply the DNA onto the surface of any
collectible with a custom-made felt-tip pen.''
</P>
<P>
   The company will provide representatives to stand next to Joe
Montana as he signs autographs and mark each one with the invisible
DNA ink, Meyerson said. ``What's beautiful about it is that it's
permanent, nontransferable and invisible.''

YANKEES ARE KILLING TIME UNTIL PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even with the Yankees in control of the American
League East, Manager Joe Torre qualifies comments he makes about
postseason plans with the disclaimer that his team has not actually
clinched a spot.
</P>
<P>
   But it is probably only a matter of time now, and the Yankees'
priorities for the final weeks of the season are changing. With
their starting pitching strong and their offense generating ample
runs, the Yankees need to stabilize their middle relief before the
playoffs begin.
</P>
<P>
   They took a major step in that direction Monday night, even
though they lost to the Boston Red Sox, 4-0, at Yankee Stadium.
After Orlando Hernandez surrendered four runs in six innings, the
struggling left-hander Mike Stanton struck out the side in the
seventh, and Jeff Nelson allowed one hit and no runs in the eighth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Rolando Arrojo allowed five hits and no runs in seven
and one-third innings in helping to snap the Yankees' four-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   In their final meetings with Boston during the regular season,
the Yankees took three of four games from the Red Sox over the past
four days, pushing their lead over Boston and Toronto to eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   Torre would never suggest that the Yankees are in a position to
coast a little bit, but Torre does have the luxury of discretion
when he determines his lineup every day; the Red Sox are fielding
Nomar Garciaparra, Trot Nixon and Pete Schourek and others with
nagging injuries out of necessity. Torre rested David Justice and
his sore right leg Monday night, and the Yankees are easing Bernie
Williams (strained rib cage) back into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Yankees clinch, Torre can manage the way he might
in spring training. He can limit the starts of his position
players, the pitch counts of his starters, and regulate the way he
uses his relievers.
</P>
<P>
   The sort of situation presented itself Monday night. The Yankees
trailed, 4-0, after six innings, and even though the game was not
close and Arrojo did not appear to be in jeopardy, Torre summoned
Stanton to pitch the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton, who had allowed home runs in four consecutive outings
in one stretch in the last month, struck out Nixon, Jose Offerman,
and Carl Everett, throwing high fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than leave Stanton in for the eighth, Torre called for
his other setup man, Nelson, to pitch the eighth, and Nelson threw
well, whiffing Brian Daubach to end his stint.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and Stanton are the linchpins in the late innings, after
the starter tires and before Mariano Rivera takes over. If the
Yankees were to play Cleveland in the first round of the playoffs,
which is what would happen if the playoffs began today, then Nelson
would pitch to the likes of Manny Ramirez and Travis Fryman, and
Stanton would be needed against the switch-hitters Kenny Lofton,
Omar Vizquel and Roberto Alomar, as well as the slugger Jim Thome.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest games Hernandez pitched in Cuba, he said last week,
were the games he pitched against Rolando Arrojo. El Duque pitched
for Industriales and Arrojo was the ace of Villa Clara, and the
stadiums filled and the atmosphere was tense.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo was better Monday night, his stuff sharper, more
explosive. Hernandez's fastball was exceptional in his previous
start, in Kansas City; some of his teammates said they had never
seen him use his fastball as aggressively as he did against the
Royals, a good offensive team.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez's fastball had far less zip Monday night, and the
Red Sox hitters swung lustily, bashing about a half-dozen foul home
runs, along with a couple that stayed fair. Hernandez walked Nixon
leading off the game, after getting ahead in the count no balls and
two strikes, and Offerman ripped a fastball for a two-run homer _
the first home run allowed by the Yankees since Sept. 3, a span of
66 consecutive innings, including the entire seven-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez looked frustrated in the Yankee dugout after the
half-inning, shaking his head, sweeping the air with his hand in
remorse. Jorge Posada, the catcher who would be the first to
recognize that El Duque's stuff was lacking, walked over and began
chattering at Hernandez, seemingly challenging him, for each time
El Duque turned his head, Posada repositioned his own body to stay
close to El Duque's face.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's first fastball in the second inning was clocked at
91 miles an hour, about 3 or 4 MPH faster than the previous inning,
before he regressed. Brian Daubach singled leading off the second,
and with one out, Manny Alexander drove a breaking ball over the
left-field wall, increasing Boston's advantage to 4-0.

MUSINGS ON MODO, CLIE, CLEARTYPE (COLUMN) &HT;    By HENRY NORR
 &HT;    c.2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week, odds and ends from here and there.
</P>
<P>
   I reported in Friday's Chronicle that Scout Electromedia's Modo
_ a new $99 device that uses paging technology to deliver local
``lifestyle'' and entertainment information ``targeted to a
socially active 18- to 34-year-old demographic'' _ made a splash at
the DemoMobile 2000 conference in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't have enough space in the story for some details
that give more of the flavor of the Modo, which Scout founder and
CEO Geoff Pitfield said is ``designed for the 260 million people in
the U.S. who don't use PDAs.''
</P>
<P>
   First, Pitfield and his team seem to have done a remarkable job
in designing both the hardware and the software for the Modo.
Although the paging network transmits only text, the Modo combines
it with icons stored permanently in the device to create an
easy-to-use graphical interface, controlled by a scroll-wheel and
buttons on the side of the device. The hardware comes in three
colors: Neptune, Moon and Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Since the service, which is free forever to those who spend $99
to buy the hardware, will be supported mainly by advertising, Scout
naturally hopes to have lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   But in the demo I saw, the ads on the device's main screen
consisted of only a few unobtrusive words at the very bottom of the
screen, and company officials told me they'd stay that way. (Only
if the user presses a dedicated ``Ad button'' on the front of the
device do ads expand to fill the full 105-by-140-pixel screen.)
</P>
<P>
   The Scout team also insists that they will maintain a strict
separation between advertising and editorial content. Unlike many
directory publishers, Scout won't charge a fee for including a
club, restaurant or theater in its listings. Raw data for the
listings in the San Francisco version will be provided by the Bay
Guardian, but a staff of four full-time editors, plus freelancers,
will select their own favorites and write the reviews, according to
Marc Vogl, the company's content director.
</P>
<P>
   A feature called Gambles will offer randomly chosen dining and
entertainment suggestions. And in keeping with the current mania
for ``reality-based'' entertainment, Modo includes a feature called
``Characters,'' where nonprofessional writers from its target
audience will provide personal commentaries on the local scene.
</P>
<P>
   Through auditions Scout has already selected four local
``twentysomethings'' to take on this role in San Francisco. Olivia
Ongpin owns Fabric8.com, an online clothing store that also
features a digital haiku generator. Alexa Merrill is an instructor
at a South-of-Market yoga school. Justin Segal runs a technology
``incubator.'' And Jude Herrera, according to Vogl, is ``a waiter
by day and an aspiring drag-show actor by night.''
</P>
<P>
   What exactly are they going to write about? Here's how Scout
answers that question on its Web site,  &LR; www.modo.net &LR; : ``Tap into
the days and nights of the city's coolest hipsters, freaks and
other major and minor cultural icons. Find out what club they'll be
at tonight, whether that crush ever amounted to anything, how much
that nipple-piercing hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Forbes, a one-time colleague of mine who's now producer of
DemoMobile, declared that ``Modo defines a new category.'' He
wasn't just kidding.

   PUTTING ON THE RITZ: The hotel where the conference was held,
the Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel in Pasadena, was built in 1907,
but that didn't keep it from offering the best connectivity for
guests I've ever experienced in a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the phone in every room, apparently, is a modem-sized
device provided by a company called STSN. It has three ports _ one
that's just a standard phoneline jack, but one for a USB (Universal
Serial Bus) connection and another for an Ethernet networking
cable. Color-coded cables for each hang in a plastic bag in the
closet.
</P>
<P>
   If you lift the lid of the device, you find clear, simple
directions explaining the options: Use the Ethernet cable and port
if your notebook has a networking adapter; USB if you have that but
not Ethernet; and the phone plug only if all else fails.
</P>
<P>
   When I found a CD-ROM in the bag with the cables, I thought I
was in trouble, because my 3-pound ultraportable doesn't have a
built-in optical drive; its external expansion unit has a DVD
drive, but I hadn't bothered to bring that along.
</P>
<P>
   But I tried connecting to the Ethernet jack anyway, and to my
delight I was online instantly _ no reconfiguration required. My
browser opened to the hotel's home page, where a large button was
labeled ``High-speed Internet access.'' Then all I had to do was
click another button authorizing a charge on my hotel bill of $9.95
for 24 hours' worth of unlimited access _ and I was off to the
races.
</P>
<P>
   The connection wasn't nearly as zippy as what I get with DSL at
home. According to the 2Wire Bandwidth Meter 2.0
( &LR; bm.2wire.com/bandwidthv2/bmv2.asp &LR; ), downstream throughput
fluctuated between 155.7 kilobits per second and 546.1 Kbps,
depending partly on the time of day.
</P>
<P>
   But that was plenty fast for my purposes _ checking mail and Web
news sites _ and the connection never failed me. Compared with the
modem madness I usually have to deal with on the road _ I hardly
ever get a reliable dial-up connection on the first try _ it was
bliss.
</P>
<P>
   And even though $10 a day may seem a little steep, it's easily
worth it if you're under time pressure _ especially when you
consider that many hotels have decided to supplement their already
hefty rates by charging $1 or even $1.50 for each and every local
call, whether or not you successfully establish a connection.
</P>
<P>
   To top that off, Wayport, another company that specializes in
high-speed Internet access for hotels, airports and conferences,
set up 802.11b wireless Ethernet access points, connected to the
Internet, in and around most of the meeting rooms where the
conference was held.
</P>
<P>
   I'd brought along my Dell wireless card, but for some reason I
couldn't get it to work, even though the access hardware was made
by the same company that made the Dell card (Aironet, now part of
Cisco Systems).
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, IBM had brought along a stack of Lucent-made,
IBM-branded 802.11b cards to lend to attendees. After a few quick
tweaks to my configuration by a Wayport technician _ basically just
replacing the name of my home wireless LAN in a couple of places _
I got that connection working, too.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was a terrific taste of what travel should be
like in the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   SONY STUMBLES OVER PALM: I haven't yet gotten my hands on the
Clie, Sony's new Palm OS-based handheld, but judging by the product
Web site ( &LR; www.sony.com/clie &LR; ), I'm sorely disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The company headlined its press release about the product ``Sony
brings entertainment and electronics leadership to handheld
market,'' and that's just what I expected of it. Given the
company's history of fine design, I figured this product would put
Palm and Handspring to shame in this respect. I was sure it would
have a gorgeous color screen, too, particularly after company
officials said as much back in June.
</P>
<P>
   And because Sony has been associated _ at least since the first
Walkman appeared decades ago _ with portable audio, and its
executives blather at every opportunity about what they call the
convergence of AV and IT, I assumed the product would be the first
Palm OS device with built-in ability to play digital music.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, I was looking forward to a killer product.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what Sony announced is a $400 product that promises all
the excitement of watching video clips on a 160-by-160-pixel
 &LR; monochrome &LR;  _ not even grayscale _ screen. And in silence at that
_ apparently the product has no more audio capability than any
other Palm device.
</P>
<P>
   Even the industrial design looks pretty pedestrian to me, at
least in the pictures posted online.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the latest Pocket PC devices _ Compaq's iPaq
handheld, Casio's Cassiopeia E-100 and-115 and Hewlett-Packard's
Jornada 540 series _ all offer excellent hardware and software
support for digital music.
</P>
<P>
   Given the market-share numbers, I suppose the Palm camp doesn't
take the competition very seriously. But given the excitement
generated particularly by the iPaq, that could be a shortsighted
miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   SUB-PIXEL RENDERING EXPLAINED: In last week's column I mentioned
ClearType, a Microsoft technology that improves the legibility of
text on LCD screens.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of readers asked for more details about what it does
and how. You can find some information on Microsoft's ClearType
page ( &LR; www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/default.htm &LR; ) and the
other documents linked there.
</P>
<P>
   But the clearest explanation of the core technology I've seen is
at a site created almost two years ago, shortly after Bill Gates
first announced ClearType, by Steve Gibson, the hot-shot programmer
whose work on PC security I've commended in several previous
columns. Gibson's discussion of what he calls ``sub-pixel font
rendering'' begins at  &LR; grc.com/cleartype.htm &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In addition to illustrating his explanation with screen captures
and photographs, Gibson wrote a 35-kilobyte application that
displays the same text with and without this advanced rendering
technique. You can enter your own sample text and vary the font,
size and style to see how it works with various kinds of onscreen
type.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing ClearType at a Comdex keynote, Gates touted it as
a major breakthrough and said that Microsoft would seek patent
protection on it. But Gibson, among others, notes that Steve
Wozniak used the same basic approach in designing the Apple II's
display subsystem almost a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, some differences, and I don't doubt that
Microsoft's researchers have added some refinements of their own.
But it was interesting to search the best patent database I know of
( &LR; www.patents.ibm.com &LR; ) and find no sign of any patent issued to
Microsoft in this area.

CABLES CROSSED
</HEADLINE>
  By TODD WALLACK
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; c &LR; .2000 SANFRANCISCO CHRONICLE
</P>
<P>
   Jason Frankovitz figured it would be a breeze to sign up for
AT&AMP;T's superfast cable modem service.
</P>
<P>
   Frankovitz, a 29-year-old technical consultant, already has
AT&AMP;T's digital cable service. He lives in Berkeley, where AT&AMP;T has
upgraded its equipment to deliver both speedy Internet service and
local phone service. And AT&AMP;T mailed him a full-color brochure
promising to install the service within a week.
</P>
<P>
   But Frankovitz, who has called AT&AMP;T six times during the past
two months to order the service, said customer service
representatives keep telling him he's out of luck. The company
can't serve his home yet, on the second-floor of a duplex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's massively ridiculous,'' Frankovitz said, pointing out
that the service is available to his landlord downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   Frankovitz is hardly alone. AT&AMP;T spokesman Andrew Johnson
estimates that ``tens of thousands'' of potential customers in
duplexes and apartment buildings in the Bay Area cannot order
Internet or phone service from AT&AMP;T _ even in towns where AT&AMP;T has
upgraded its lines to offer the products. AT&AMP;T is the dominant
cable company in the region, controlling the wires in 2.6 million
Bay Area homes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the problem could become especially critical in coming
months as AT&AMP;T rolls out the high-tech services in more-densely
populated neighborhoods in San Francisco and Oakland. Nearly 69
percent of San Francisco households and 53 percent of those in
Oakland are in multidwelling units, compared with 35 percent in
AT&AMP;T's Bay Area territory overall. (So far, AT&AMP;T has upgraded only
one neighborhood in San Francisco _ Bernal Heights _ and none in
Oakland.)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson blamed two main culprits for the lack of service:
</P>
<P>
   DATABASE ERRORS: Johnson said it's difficult hard enough to keep
keeping track of individual addresses, but logging every individual
apartment unit, including houses that have been recently divided,
can be nearly impossible. Some households also aren't in the
database because they have tapped into neighbors' cable wires
without permission.
</P>
<P>
   UNCOOPERATIVE LANDLORDS: AT&AMP;T needs written permission from
every landlord to offer the new services. But Johnson said many
don't return phone calls or respond to mailings. Some have
exclusive agreements with satellite companies. Others don't want to
make space for AT&AMP;T's equipment. to offer the service. Many are
simply busy and don't consider AT&AMP;T's calls a priority, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the California Apartment Association, which
represents building owners, blamed AT&AMP;T for trying to lock
landlords into 10-year contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bannon, executive vice president of for the group, said most
apartment building owners would be willing to let AT&AMP;T offer new
services if they would settle for verbal permission or a short-term
deal. But Bannon said landlords are were leery about getting stuck
in a long-term contract, because the technology and market are is
changing so rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they need to do is talk to the property owner,'' Bannon
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bannon insists that AT&AMP;T is focusing on
single-family housing and larger luxury units, while ignoring many
smaller apartment buildings in poorer neighborhoods. ``They're
going for the low-lying fruit,'' Bannon said. ``We would be
delighted if they would respond to all our members.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T denied the statements. accusations. ``We want to serve
everyone,'' Johnson said. Also, Johnson said the 10-year contract
is just a standard opening offer, and it is willing to negotiate a
shorter contract.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that AT&AMP;T has successfully delivered the cable
modem and phone service to many apartment residents.
</P>
<P>
   And AT&AMP;T is not the only cable company having trouble serving
every apartment unit. Seren Innovations, for instance, said it has
been shut out of more than a quarter of apartment buildings in
Concord and Walnut Creek because the building owners believe they
have an exclusive agreement with AT&AMP;T or a satellite provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will become a real problem in the next 90 to 120 days,''
said Bob Stice, a sales director for Seren, pointing out the
company in coming months plans to launch the service in
neighborhoods in coming months with dense concentrations of
apartment buildings. So far, it has only lit up only areas
dominated by single-family houses.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, AT&AMP;T said it is willing to renegotiate its
exclusive agreements to give other cable companies access, and
probably would not go to court to force landlords to abide by the
pacts. AT&AMP;T said the exclusive deals were signed by TCI, the cable
company it bought last year, and said it no longer signs exclusive
deals. In addition, the Public Utilities Commission passed a rule
guaranteeing cable companies access to buildings to provide phone
service, which some cable executives say feel makes the exclusive
pacts void.
</P>
<P>
   But Stice said AT&AMP;T isn't advertising the fact that it won't
enforce its exclusive pacts. And Stice said many landlords will
abide by the agreements anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `I have a handshake agreement with AT&AMP;T and I am not
going to let you in,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies typically give landlords about 6 to 8 percent of the
revenue in exchange for access to the building, Stice said. And
even when landlords give Seren access to wire their buildings,
Stice complains that they often aren't allowed to sell their
service door-to-door. Stice said Seren's service _ selling a
package of phone, television and Internet service in one package _
is so novel for most customers that they typically need to spend 90
minutes an hour and a half with each customer in person to sell the
service.
</P>
<P>
   Stice said the company has signed up about 30 percent of the
residents it has contacted, two-thirds of whom are buying all three
services.
</P>
<P>
   Other cable companies insisted the problem is minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Cox Communications said it can serve ``99
percent'' of apartment buildings in Orange County. Marty Zajic said
the company signed agreements with apartment owners several years
ago to offer cable modem and telephone service, so it was already
prepared when it started launched the new services.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, RCN Communications, which has rolled out service in
northern San Mateo County and has its sights set on San Francisco,
promised that it can serve nearly all apartment dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Spiegleman, director of regulatory government affairs for
RCN, said the company is willing to spend the time necessary to
sign up every building in the city. He also pointed out that RCN
has experience serving densely populated areas laden with
apartments, such as New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, from AT&AMP;T, said he believes the cable company will have
fewer problems in the future because it plans to roll out the
service more gradually, one neighborhood at a time, giving its
sales department a chance to blanket the area. In Berkeley, by
contrast, AT&AMP;T lit up the entire city ``in one fell swoop.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Johnson has two pieces of advice for tenants having
trouble ordering service. First, he advises them to check with
their landlords to find out if they have an agreement with AT&AMP;T in
place. Second, he suggests residents write to AT&AMP;T at P.O. Box
5147, San Ramon, CA 94583. Frankovitz, the Berkeley resident who
couldn't get cable modem service, offered another solution: If AT&AMP;T
doesn't respond to his request soon, he plans to order DSL, an
equally fast Internet connection that works over phone wires.

   - ``A caller reports that a car on College Avenue with its door
open appears to be vandalized inside,'' says the St. Helena Star
Police Log, in an entry forwarded by  &UR; Vera Trinchero Torres &LR; . ``The

   &UR; - Lourdes Livingston &LR; , who was in New York last week, e-mailed
her pal  &UR; Doug Morgan &LR;  that between the U.N. summit meetings and the
MTV video music awards at Radio City Music Hall, the streets were
packed with limousines. The only way she could tell a rock star's
motorcade from a presidential motorcade, she said, was by ``the
faint scent as they rush by.'' Morgan said the rockers' scent is of
Mendocino-grown matter, while the diplomats waft vapors of
Colombian gold.

   - Shiseido has sent word of its new fragrance (perfume is such
an outmoded word): Zen. Amen and pass the atomizer. This innovation
should open the market to new lines of smelly stuff named after
other forms of religious observance: Seventh Day Adventist, Jew,
Christian Scientist and, for the incurably romantic, Anabaptist.

   - The Llama Poop _ $7 for two pounds _ sold at the Working
Gardener in Healdsburg is superior to your everyday poop because
``it's not as acidic as some manures can be,'' says owner  &UR; Merede &LR; 
 &UR; Graham &LR; , ``it's been composted, so it doesn't contain any weed
seeds'' and ``it doesn't contain any burning agents.'' Not everyone
agrees. ``You've got to be careful who you ask because gardeners
are very particular'' about their manure, says Graham.

that the senator's secretary asked him to get Lieberman two apples.
He should wash the apples, he was told, and hold them by their
stems when carrying them back to the office, in order to keep them
kosher.
</P>
<P>
   When he brought the apples back to the secretary, she said she'd

MISSING FLAG RETURNS TO GLORY, COURTESY OF A PRANKSTER; SHOT-PUTTER
PULLS OUT: A REASON TO SMILE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Harry Prieste took the dare. Challenged by
his friend, the swimmer Duke Kahanamoku, Prieste shinnied up a
15-foot flagpole at the end of the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp,
Belgium, and stole the official flag. The Irish linen flag came
home with Prieste to Los Angeles, the fruit of his athletic prank
and further evidence of his presence at the seventh Summer
Olympiad, where he won the bronze medal in platform diving.
</P>
<P>
   For 77 years the flag was stored in a suitcase during Prieste's
years in swimming and diving shows, as a vaudeville comedian, a
tumbler, a banjo player, a circus juggler and an Ice Follies
performer.
</P>
<P>
   He did not regard the flag as valuable or worth returning until
a reporter told him at a U.S. Olympic Committee banquet three years
ago that the International Olympic Committee had been unable to
find the missing Antwerp flag, the first one with the five rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can help you with that,'' he said. ``It's in my suitcase.''
</P>
<P>
   Prieste, 103 years old, legally blind and severely deaf,
returned the slightly faded and tattered flag to the IOC Monday as
the organization began a session leading up to the start of the
Summer Games on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving it to them,'' Prieste said. ``I ain't going to be
around long. I had it a long time. A lot of my friends have seen
it. You can't be selfish about these things. It's no good to me. I
can't hang it in my room. People will think more of me by giving it
away than by keeping it.''
</P>
<P>
   When told that he would be giving the flag to Juan Antonio
Samaranch, the IOC president, Prieste said, ``What's he going to do
with it?''
</P>
<P>
   Prieste was born in 1896, the year of the first modern Olympics
in Athens, with the name Haig Prieste. Before the Olympics, he was
a stunt man and a Keystone Kop in Mack Sennett's silent comedies,
then entered the 1920 Olympics under the name Harry Prieste. In his
subsequent show business career, he was Hal Haig Prieste.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he wanted to make sure that the plaque beside the
Antwerp flag in the Olympic museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, will
identify the man who returned it as ``Hal Haig Prieste.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm informed by my friends in Belgium that the statute of
limitations has run out on Prieste,'' said William Hybl, the
president of the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   Prieste is the oldest living U.S. Olympian and possibly the
oldest one in the world, said Cindy Stinger, who directs the USOC's
alumni relations department. ``The IOC wanted him to come to Nagano
but it didn't happen,'' she said. ``I was worried, and the
committee was worried, about someone this old traveling to
Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   But Prieste got medical approval and arrived at the IOC session
dressed in a blue blazer, white shirt, colorful tie, white cap and
white pants, sitting in a wheelchair he did not need until last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Prieste, who learned to ice skate in his 40s and continued until
he was 96, met Carolyn LaMaina at the Coliseum rink in Voorhees,
N.J., where the Philadelphia Flyers used to train, and he was still
performing on-ice tricks with a hockey stick. -- RICHARD SANDOMIR  &QL; 
SHOT-PUTTER PULLS OUT
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Hunter, the reigning world champion in the shot-put and the
husband of the sprinter Marion Jones, became the latest in a
growing number of athletes to withdraw from the Sydney Olympics
Monday, a week after undergoing orthoscopic surgery on torn
cartilage in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed the injury has forced me to withdraw from the
Olympic Games,'' Hunter said in a statement. ``Marion and I had
looked forward to competing together in Sydney. But I'm a
professional athlete. Unfortunately, injuries are part of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who grew up in Hyde Park, N.Y., will be replaced on the
American team by John Godina, who won a silver medal in the
shot-put at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Godina has already been
training in Australia for the discus, at which he will also compete
in the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's withdrawal comes only two days after Regina Jacobs of
Oakland, a gold-medal favorite in the women's 1,500 meters, dropped
out with a respiratory viral infection.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter injured his knee last month and attempted to throw at a
Grand Prix meet in Brussels, only to withdraw after several throws
because of persistent pain. He underwent surgery last Sunday and
said that he still hoped to compete in Sydney. He has withdrawn,
however, apparently feeling he would not be a contender.
Twenty-seven athletes were withdrawn from China's Olympic team
after a number of them had suspicious results on blood tests that
detect the presence of the performance-enhancing drug EPO. -- JERE
LONGMAN  &QL; 
A REASON TO SMILE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Samaranch chuckled twice in public Monday,
evidence, perhaps, that he is comfortable that the IOC he leads is
past being in a perpetual state of siege.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch's cheerful gesture came early in the opening day of a
three-day IOC session leading up to the opening ceremony of the
Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Games have not begun but the IOC is faced with doubts about
the credibility of a new test for the performance enhancer EPO,
chastened by the Australian government's refusal to admit members
of its ``family'' from Uzbekistan and Hong Kong and constantly
under scrutiny about the efficacy of reforms enacted last year
following the Salt Lake City bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beleagured? Beleaguered by whom?'' said Francois Carrard, the
IOC's director general. ``We are experienced in seeing stories
raised in anticipation of more important things to happen. It is
quite normal. We do our job. The media does their job.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days are not entirely normal for the IOC _ and not
just because Samaranch was stranded the other day by an Olympic van
outside the Regent Hotel, where he is staying. In the IOC's attempt
to be more egalitarian and transparent, the president and his
delegates have given up limousine transport for something more
plebeian.
</P>
<P>
   A local transport official apologized to Samaranch and the error
has not been repeated since. -- RICHARD SANDOMIR

MTV video music awards at Radio City Music Hall, the streets were
packed with limousines. The only way she could tell a rock star's

stems when carrying them back to the office, in order to keep them
kosher.
</P>
<P>
   When he brought the apples back to the secretary, she said she'd

EBERSOL LIVES AND DREAMS THE OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Olympics come to American television Friday, the
maestro overseeing the five-hour nightly extravaganza will be Dick
Ebersol.
</P>
<P>
   No sports television executive has held as much power in the
Olympics as Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports. No one has spent
as much for the TV rights or is as close to Juan Antonio Samaranch,
the embattled president of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And no one has had the opportunity since Ebersol's mentor, Roone
Arledge, to shape so completely how Americans will view the Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the idea of being in the middle of a 28-ring circus,''
said Ebersol, who persuaded General Electric, NBC's parent, to
underwrite his passion with $3.5 billion for the rights to televise
the Olympics from 2000 to 2008. ``I love being the guy in the
center of all that, sorting out what we're doing and what the
viewer is going to see. There isn't anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol has been closely identified with the National Basketball
Association and with deals that coincided with the ascent of
Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. But his legacy rests with the
Olympics, as a deal maker and an executive producer, roles played
by Arledge at ABC from the early 1960s to the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he came to us as an Olympic freak,'' said
Arledge, who hired Ebersol in 1967 as the first Olympic researcher
at ABC Sports when Ebersol was 19 and a sophomore at Yale. ``But he
became one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol's Manhattan office features a giant photograph of
Muhammad Ali lighting the Olympic caldron at the 1996 Summer
Olympics in Atlanta and a coffee table painted with images from the
1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything I love more than the Olympics,
other than family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is not likely to see much of his wife, the actress Susan
Saint James, and their 10-year-old son, Teddy, the only one of
their children who will be in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   By 6:15 each morning, Ebersol will begin his 20-hour day at the
NBC compound after lifting 15-pound weights and running three and a
half miles on a treadmill, a regimen he started four years ago
after he suffered a mild heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   From his ``Captain Kirk'' chair inside NBC's control room or
from a seat in an adjacent office, Ebersol will control what
Americans see from Sydney. He will view what is happening on more
than 100 monitors, make suggestions to his chief producers, Tommy
Roy and David Neal, speak to commentators arrayed across Sydney or
ask a deputy, Peter Diamond, how one change in each evening's
preset formats would affect the rest of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be shocked if we didn't change the formats by as much as a
third, as we go along,'' Ebersol said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Olympic events beamed to American viewers will be
taped, Bob Costas, the prime-time host, will be live in the studio
in Sydney, introducing events, providing reports and delivering
commentary. Ebersol will occasionally speak into his earpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually guidance,'' Costas said. ``I may say something,
and he'll say something amusing. He's a very calm presence no
matter the circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   In their third Olympics as a unit, Costas, the production crew
and most of the commentators know Ebersol's Olympic formula.
``Storytelling is king,'' said Bucky Gunts, who directs the
prime-time show.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol takes the work so seriously that he bans all
nonessential personnel from his Olympic workplace, including his
wife and Jack Welch, the G.E. chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so annoying,'' Saint James said. ``I'm from the business.
I know how to be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol explained: ``This job requires 100 percent
concentration. When air traffic controllers let families in to
watch them work, I'll let Susan in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol, 53, is the most vocal and image-conscious of the four
networks' sports division leaders. Like Arledge, he is a
producer-executive who revels in being his division's public
relations specialist. But primarily he is a pragmatic executive
protecting his self-interest, never more so than in his vigorous
defense of Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't care what was said against him,'' said Ebersol,
referring to criticism that Samaranch personified the hidebound IOC
bureaucracy that led to the Salt Lake City corruption scandal last
year. ``There is no question in my mind that there was no way back
from the abyss without Juan.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol, whose strong ties with the Olympic committee were
enhanced by his appointment to its reform commission, recalled
flying to Lausanne, Switzerland, in March 1999 after reading an
article in which Samaranch scorned American politicians who were
threatening to sanction the IOC if it did not overhaul the way it
did business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right or wrong, I told him, `You get nowhere taking on the
American political system,''' Ebersol recalled. ``But I said, `If
you want me to, I'll spread the word about what you'll do to key
Washington politicians.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said he had met with Sen. John S. McCain, R- Ariz, a
harsh IOC critic, and George Mitchell, the former senator whose
commission recommended an overhaul of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said he had stewed for months as David D'Alessandro,
president of John Hancock Financial Services, an Olympic sponsor,
lambasted Samaranch. Then in June 1999, Ebersol exploded during a
conference call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick of watching this two-bit bully get on his soapbox,''
he said of D'Alessandro. ``His actions demanded a response and that
response is, `Shut up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol's tongue-lashing heartened the international committee,
which needed to assuage sponsors' worries that the scandal was
diminishing the value of their Olympic investments. Having
Ebersol's passionate faith meant the IOC was blessed by its largest
benefactor, who was protecting both his friend and his investment.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, an IOC vice president, said, ``It was important for
someone to speak out in favor of what the Olympics were all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Ebersol quietly met with D'Alessandro for
the first time in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us felt this was a rocket that was getting away from
both of us and it was getting personal,'' D'Alessandro said. ``But
part of the issue is that we'd never met. I've learned over time
that it's easier to throw shots at somebody you didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said, ``We got through the frostiness and talked for two
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro said they found more common ground than he had
expected. Several months later, Hancock renewed its IOC sponsorship
for the Sydney Games and then committed to spend as much as $15
million to advertise on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   That strain of pragmatism and getting what he wants are themes
throughout Ebersol's tenure at NBC Sports. This is his second
go-round at NBC; in 1975, he helped create ``Saturday Night Live,''
and he produced it from 1981 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He left to become an independent producer, creating shows like
``Friday Night Videos,'' ``Later with Bob Costas'' and ``Saturday
Night's Main Event,'' in partnership with the World Wrestling
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Arledge recalled Ebersol's return to NBC as president of NBC
Sports in 1989. ``Everybody thought he was a politician, including
their top people,'' Arledge said. ``I said, `Wait till you see him
in action.' He is a bit of a politician, which is part of the job
of getting rights.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1995 Ebersol publicly savaged Major League Baseball for
the collapse of the Baseball Network, a joint venture of NBC, ABC
and baseball, and vowed not to make another deal with the leaders
of the sport until the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Yet four months later, he sat in a box seat at the World Series
beside Bud Selig, then baseball's interim commissioner, discussing
a new deal. Ebersol admitted afterward that Welch, the G.E.
chairman, told him to ``get over your extreme displeasure'' and
pursue a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Selig recalled that time. ``The more we talked,'' he said, ``the
more we talked about history, and in the end, Dick is a very
reasonable, very decent person.'' They agreed to a five-year deal
worth $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1998, when he decided that the National Football League
was demanding too much from NBC for its rights, Ebersol pursued
``Monday Night Football.'' When that failed, he tried to create a
new football league with Turner Sports. When that died, he teamed
up in March with the WWF to form a new spring football league, the
XFL, which he said would be legitimate despite its pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his tenure at NBC Sports, Ebersol's closeness to
Welch and Bob Wright, the president of NBC, has enabled him to make
quicker financial decisions than his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's willing to take risks,'' said Neal Pilson, an industry
consultant who once competed against Ebersol as the president of
CBS Sports. ``Welch and Wright believe in him. He's earned their
respect. It took courage to chase the Olympics, and frankly I think
he made a terrific deal for NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his most pragmatic maneuver will be on view from Sydney:
the Olympics on basic cable. MSNBC and CNBC will carry 171 original
hours of Olympic coverage, featuring sports that NBC has ignored in
the past, like soccer, softball, boxing, weight lifting and
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had CNBC, and MSNBC was still America's Talking, and I
thought, we could do this,'' Ebersol said. ``I didn't check with
anyone, I just told Samaranch we'd commit to X hours.'' &QL;

HEWLETT-PACKARD IS IN TALKS TO BUY CONSULTING UNIT
</HEADLINE>
  By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard and PricewaterhouseCoopers confirmed Monday that
they were discussing the sale of PricewaterhouseCoopers' management
and information technology consulting practice to the computer
maker.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard said it expected to pay between $17 billion to
$18 billion in cash and stock if the deal was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said such a deal would move Hewlett-Packard rapidly
down the strategic path of less dependence on hardware sales,
following the lead of rivals like IBM. But some said that an
alliance rather than an outright takeover might achieve many of the
benefits for Hewlett-Packard with fewer risks and that the sheer
magnitude of the purchase worried investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an argument about a bigger push into services,'' said
Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. ``It's a question of
how much magnitude, how quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard shares closed down $6.63 at $114.75 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   For PricewaterhouseCoopers, formed by the 1998 merger of Price
Waterhouse and Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, the deal would respond to
concerns voiced by the Securities and Exchange Commission and
others about potential conflicts of interest between its consulting
arm and its traditional accounting and auditing practices. And
although PricewaterhouseCoopers declined to discuss the potential
financial rewards of the deal to its partners, industry observers
said they would be extremely lucrative and hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most partners will say it's a wonderful idea if they are
getting this valuation,'' said Jon McKenna, editor of Public
Accounting Report, an industry journal.
</P>
<P>
   The management consulting practice includes 31,000 employees and
about 1,500 partners out of Price-waterhouseCoopers' worldwide
total of 150,000 employees and 10,000 partners, according to David
Nestor, a company spokesman. Nestor said PricewaterhouseCoopers
would not discuss how any agreement with Hewlett-Packard would be
voted on at the giant partnership or how the takeover spoils would
be divided.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard cautioned Monday that some terms of the
transaction had not been agreed upon, and significant issues remain
to be resolved, leaving open the possibility that the deal may yet
unravel. The company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said it expected
the acquisition to add to the 15 percent revenue growth rate it has
forecast, and to dilute to its cash earnings per share mildly in
fiscal year 2001. It said there would be no significant effect on
earnings per share in fiscal year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The steep price reflects the growing pressure on Hewlett-Packard
as computer hardware becomes more and more like a commodity product
with low profit margins. Hewlett-Packard has been hiring 200
consultants a month, according to some outside estimates, in the
effort to build its consulting business. It hired Steven Hahn away
from IBM. to run the business. But it would take a deal like adding
PricewaterhouseCoopers' 30,000 consultants to its homegrown force
of 6,000 or to quickly push the company into the front ranks of the
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the business has changed because the customer is
really paying for the solution, not the PC, minicomputer or
mainframe,'' said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research. ``So
the top of the food chain is the services and consulting business,
and companies that were box providers, like HP, have belatedly
realized they were being left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is completed, Hewlett-Packard's consulting arm would
be roughly comparable to the Compaq Computer Corp.'s Global
Services group, which has 38,000 consultants around the world.
Compaq built its consulting arm in large part through the
acquisitions of the Digital Equipment Corp. and Tandem Computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that what these guys are going to find, as Compaq
did, is that everything doesn't just fall into place,'' said
Jeffrey Lynn, vice president and general manager of Compaq Global
Services. ``But I think it's a clear confirmation of what we, IBM.
and others have concluded, that they way you got to market with
your enterprise solutions is a blend of technology and services.''

WHIRLPOOL TRAINING PROGRAM TAKES A CUE FROM POP CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENTON HARBOR, Mich. _ Tony Barbee has never enjoyed household
chores. Even in college, he regularly brought his laundry home to
mother, and he shunned the stove in favor of the local Burger King
or Kentucky Fried Chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he knew so little about what goes on in the kitchen that
when he applied for a job at Whirlpool, one of the world's largest
makers of household appliances, he checked off the box that
indicated the lowest level of cooking expertise: Hamburger Helper.
</P>
<P>
   But for two months this summer, Barbee, now 30, and six other
young recruits took part in an unusual training program that might
be considered the corporate equivalent of realty-based television.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to create a better work force, Whirlpool essentially
sentenced a group of new hires to live together in a large house,
where during the course of their stay they prepare more than 900
plates of food; wash no fewer than 120 bags of laundry; and perform
countless hours of loading and reloading of the company's
refrigerators, dish washers and dryers.
</P>
<P>
   They smear white bags with mustard, relish and other
stain-generating condiments, just to see if they can bleach them
out; they prepare three times as much pasta as they need, simply to
see how microwave and convection oven cooking differs from that of
a traditional oven.
</P>
<P>
   With breaks for only a couple of weekend trips home, the
learning experience is intense.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives insist the reality-based training program is
not a gimmick. Rather, they say, it is a more pragmatic and
effective way of preparing its youthful marketing representatives
than the lectures and slide shows that make up so many corporate
initiations. Forcing the recruits, a diverse group of men and
women, to use the full range of Whirlpool products night and day
will produce a better informed and more consumer-friendly sales
staff, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to have a better appreciation of what a consumer
goes through,'' said Jackie Seib, the company's national training
manager.
</P>
<P>
   In a case of life imitating art _ or, at least, television _
Whirlpool modeled its program after ``The Real World,'' the popular
MTV series that chronicles the experience of seven young people who
live together for five months. Whirlpool's version is called ``The
Real Whirled.''
</P>
<P>
   The undertaking may be one of the earliest indications of ways
that pop culture, already a potent force in the advertising world,
is now being mined for new management and training techniques, even
at an 89-year-old company not often thought of as trendy. With a
tight labor market and workers mindful of more relaxed cultures at
dot-coms, some traditional companies are trying to be hip to retain
and motivate employees.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch and McDonald's, for example, turn training
sessions into mock versions of television game shows like
``Jeopardy'' or ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire,'' complete with a
cheering section, a host and buzzers. There are also corporate
training videos whose titles _ ``Alien Encounter'' and ``Hunt for
T-Rex,'' for example _ reflect popular Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three times a year, Whirlpool selects a group of seven
young people from around the country to live together for eight
weeks in a leased, seven-bedroom house not far from its corporate
headquarters here in Benton Harbor. The recruits will eventually be
dispatched to train sales staffs at retailers like Sears and Lowe's
to sell the company's appliances.
</P>
<P>
   And they had better be good. At the end of August Whirlpool said
that weakening demand for home appliances in the U.S. and Europe is
cutting sharply into profit margins. The recent decision by Circuit
City stores to stop selling big appliances has also shaken up the
company's profit forecasts. Whirlpool's stock has been down
sharply, but has recently recovered somewhat, closing yesterday at
$40.88.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is expected to build team spirit at Whirlpool,
and also trust. At the house, there are no restrictions on the
recruits' relationships with one another, no legal documents laying
out guidelines for living together. But the most recent cadre
formulated a makeshift list of house rules as they settled into
cohabitation early this summer. Among them: ``Say what you feel,''
``Don't let problems simmer,'' and ``If you make a mess, clean it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The participants do, however, have to agree to one important
condition. They enter the program _ and accept the approximately
$35,000-a-year training jobs _ not knowing until just days before
their ``Real Whirled'' stint ends where they will be working. They
only know that they will be based near a major American
metropolitan center.
</P>
<P>
   The recruits spend their days mastering the company's household
appliances, which are periodically swapped for different models,
even that of a competitor, for comparison testing. There are
written tests, oral presentations and almost daily quizzes on
attributes and idiosyncrasies of washers, dryers and microwave
ovens.
</P>
<P>
   Under the supervision of Kurt Gersonde, a training manager often
on site from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m., they visit local stores to
determine how well or not so well others are selling the company's
appliances. They are sent out on house calls with a repair crew; to
the company's manufacturing facilities; and they visit research
facilities, to catch a glimpse of the future.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, they stay at home. They cook up dishes to test the
new Accubake oven. They splatter food on linens to determine if the
Catalyst washing machine really does give clothes ``the whitest
whites.'' And they leave pasta sauce and sticky noodles on plates
when they load the new Kitchen Aid dishwasher to see how well it
cleans away leftover bits of food.
</P>
<P>
   No other major appliance maker has anything like ``The Real
Whirled.'' Maytag, for example, has a more traditional training
program in which new employees watch videos, study manuals and are
given instructions on using appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The idea emerged from a brainstorming session with James H.
Gilmore, a consultant who has encouraged corporations to ``embrace
theater'' in the workplace and create ``unique experiences'' that
can transform the work force. Someone mentioned ``The Real World,''
and the idea of Whirlpool's own live-in training program was born.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ideal way to train new hires, Seib said, because ``we're
hiring kids right out of college, and their expertise is lugging
their clothes home to their mother.''
</P>

<P>
   The Whirlpool program is set here in the western part of the
state, in a big, white clapboard home more Disney than MTV. There
are green rooms, candy colored fixtures, shades painted with
butterflies, and lots of nooks and crannies.
</P>
<P>
   The first group shared a different house in late 1998. The
fourth _ four men and three women, racially diverse and in their
mid-20's _ finished up its tour of duty late last month.
</P>
<P>
   There was Lindsey Williams, a 22-year-old graduate of Texas
Christian University, who realized after college that her political
ambitions would take longer to achieve than she wanted to wait.
``You can't graduate from college at 22 and become a
congresswoman,'' she said. Instead, she followed her father, a
longtime employee in the sales division at Whirlpool.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Federico, 25, is the only recruit who is married. He
also has two children, one of whom is proudly displayed on the
screen saver of his laptop computer. After graduating third in a
high school class of 10 people in Maine, he went to Liberty
University, the school founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell in
Lynchburg, Va. After graduation, he decided to go into retailing
and heard about the program through a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Salena Barone, a 24-year-old from Philadelphia, was the gourmet
in the group. She doled out daily advice on how to make the
prescribed dishes right. And Tony Barbee, who botched a cake on day
three, still managed to be a class favorite.
</P>
<P>
   There were mishaps _ a television on the blink during the video
session on sexual harassment, for instance _ and some laughs: about
Federico's ability to consume steaks and the time Barone was
targeted on the beach by sea gulls. There was the puerile, like the
time Lindsey, during preparations for a test, was asked the main
advantage of the Catalyst washer. Someone in the room blurted out
that it was an aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
   And though there were some minor conflicts among the
participants, they insist that real bonding took place. They
studied for tests together, went to the beach, played volleyball
and talked about race and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person brings something to the table,'' said Brian
Clark, 22, a recent graduate of the College of the Ozarks in
Arkansas and one of the participants.
</P>
<P>
   While there are usually a lot of budding romances on ``The Real
World,'' that level of engagement did not take place here. ``I
don't need to be sidetracked,'' one recruit said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the bosses at headquarters were not exactly clueless
about the goings on at the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's observing us,'' Barone said. ``I think that's what
this is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   To the outside observer, the recruits could have been mistaken
for ordinary roommates. One day in July, the group huddled in the
kitchen to prepare a huge lunch. Williams chopped cucumbers, Barbee
pulled chocolate chip cookies out of the oven and Barone prepared
pasta. One dish of noodles was placed in the convection oven,
another in the microwave. The results surprised even the cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to admit it,'' Barone confessed, `` but the
microwave dish tastes better.''
</P>
<P>
   After the experience not only of cooking and cleaning but also
of building relationships, the raw recruits of two months ago are
now ready, they say, to take their ``Real Whirled'' experience to
the, well, real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is about relationships anyway,'' Clark said. ``And
being here, living with real people is the genuine article.''
Besides, he added: ``I cooked tangy cauliflower the other night and
everybody loved it. My mom's freaking; she's like, `This is
excellent.''' &QL;

UNDECIDED VOTERS HOPE N.Y. SENATE FACE-OFF CLARIFIES OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE GROSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tom Smith is one of many undecided voters counting on
the Senate debate Tuesday night to clarify a murky situation. A
fusillade of critical advertising by both candidates has angered
him, Smith said, and he remains as confused as ever about the
voting record of Rep. Rick A. Lazio, the Republican latecomer to
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has reservations about Hillary Rodham Clinton's character,
as he has since the beginning of this pivotal contest. But his
intense dislike of the first lady has mellowed during the course of
what he describes as her diligent, if sometimes plodding, campaign.
And her positions on the issues are perfectly clear to him.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio remains an enigma to Smith, who works the overnight
shift at a Wal-Mart near his home in Saugerties, N.Y. ``I still
don't know much about him,'' he said. ``And the ads don't help at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio asserts, in his advertisements and stump speeches, that he
has a record of congressional achievement while the first lady is a
blank slate. But Smith, and most of the other voters who have been
sharing their decision-making process with The New York Times since
February, do not see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the first lady, she's been vocal about the things that
are near and dear to her heart,'' said Smith, citing Clinton's
longstanding interest in health care, education and children's
issues. ``But I need to know what he's going to do for me.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Lazio, he said: ``Sure, he has a record. But it all
depends on how you read it. I can't tell if he voted his mind
because of the needs of his constituents or if he was protecting
himself and kissing up to whoever was in control. With the debate
on Wednesday, maybe I'll get lucky and find out what he believes
in, what he'll fight for.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and his wife, Barbara, cannot afford cable television, and
thus get nothing but snow on all but a few channels, so they will
watch the debate at the local firehouse. Broadcast from Buffalo,
the debate will be on NBC affiliates in New York at 7 p.m. and
replayed on MSNBC at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is not alone in pinning his hopes on the debate. In
interviews in recent days, a panel of undecided voters said the
debate had major significance as the first face-to-face, unscripted
moment of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to see it,'' said Cathy Harrison, a nurse from
Amsterdam, N.Y., who was close to committing herself to Lazio two
months ago but has since shifted her tentative allegiance because
of Clinton's more emphatic comments about the flagging upstate
economy. ``It's a big one for me. I'm going to pay more attention
to that than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison will tape the debate for her husband, Bob, a social
studies teacher, so he can watch it when he gets home from
back-to-school night. Doug Taggart's wife, in Cortlandt Manor in
Westchester County, will do the same, since he has a late meeting
at the financial services firm on Wall Street where he is a vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Schwartz, a freelance computer consultant from Staten
Island, says he plans to take notes, especially if the topic turns
to medical research, his primary concern these days as his wife
battles cancer.
</P>
<P>
   These six voters remain undecided as the race enters its final
lap, all with their own pet issues, but all disheartened by the
tone the campaign has taken since the withdrawal of Mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani and the substitution of Lazio on the Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   They are the holdouts on a panel of 11 undecided voters, culled
from early New York Times/CBS News polls. Two voters dropped out of
the project in May, and three others say they have already made
their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The first to decide, as soon as the Republican candidate
changed, was Tom Beck, a guidance counselor on Long Island, in the
district that adjoins Lazio's, who had been a longtime admirer of
the young congressman for a voting record that Beck said defies
party stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two others have cast their lots with Clinton: Charlene
Clinton, a Buffalo woman who recently returned to public assistance
after losing her first job in many years, and Dave Temkin, a
telecommunications expert from Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Both are lifelong Democrats who counted themselves among the
undecided for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, by her own admission, has no interest in politics and
did not even know who was running until the recent spate of
television commercials. Now that she has the candidates straight,
and their party affiliations, she will vote party-line as she
always has, and as her parents did before her.
</P>
<P>
   Temkin, by contrast, is avid about labor and social issues,
history and government, and delayed what he now says was an
all-but-inevitable decision until he had carefully considered the
Republican opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fairness and intelligence require that,'' he said, especially
when the Democratic candidate, in this case Clinton, is ``someone
you don't have any particular trust and affection for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to see if Lazio was something other than I thought he
was: an undistinguished congressman with an undistinguished record,
doing his party's bidding,'' Temkin added. ``I gave him a chance,
but I sort of knew the answer all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Clinton, he said, ``I don't think her character flaws will
prevent her from being an effective senator,'' echoing others among
this group who continue to dislike the first lady but no longer in
a disqualifying way. ``When you look at what's going to come down
the road in the Senate for the next four years, working-class
people will be a lot better off with the conceivable Clinton voting
record than the conceivable Lazio voting record.''
</P>
<P>
   Taggart, while still undecided, is also less concerned about
Clinton's flaws and more concerned about Lazio's blurry persona
than he was two months ago. He said that the ``amount of vitriol''
directed at the first lady has left him with ``sort of a protective
feeling'' toward her.
</P>
<P>
   He also has questions about Lazio, whose voting record in
Congress, Taggart has read, shifted from middle of the road to more
conservative when the Republicans won control of the House in 1994.
``Is that for personal gain, to make his way up the leadership
charts?'' Taggart asked. ``Is he a conciliator or is he a panderer?
Is he a malleable go-along-to-get-along kind of guy, or does he
have convictions? And if so, what are they?''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Several of the undecided voters say questions like these have
been totally obscured by the barrage of advertising, which has come
from both sides but seems to be hurting Lazio more than Clinton
among this small group. All the voters complained bitterly of the
``mudslinging'' and said it made them ever more disdainful of the
political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of it,'' Schwartz said. ``Hopefully, other people
are, too. Issues are too complex to be evaluated this way. It
should be illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   A voter like Schwartz, with a single-minded interest in cancer
research, will cast his ballot for whichever candidate cares more
about that, no matter how disgusted he is by the advertising. For
the moment, he said, that looks like Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, with the Harrisons, who are shopping for a senator with
a plan to reverse the hemorrhaging of the upstate economy. Right
now, Clinton has the edge, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Taggart, on the other hand, has a palette of interests, among
them the general state of political discourse in America. The last
time he was faced with this ``ugly'' a campaign, he said, was when
Robert Abrams challenged Alfonse M. D'Amato for his Senate seat in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view my vote as a reward, something to be won,'' Taggart
said. After much agonizing, he did not cast a ballot in that race,
because neither was ``worthy of it,'' he said. ``And that's not
outside of the realm of possibility this time.''

LAZIO'S EDUCATION PROPOSAL: $97.7 BILLION OVER 10 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMIRA, N.Y. _ Rep. Rick A. Lazio Monday night proposed new
spending of $97.75 billion on education over 10 years if elected
senator, with a substantial amount devoted to disabled students and
programs to make teachers more accountable.
</P>
<P>
   In a 30-minute speech at Elmira College, Lazio, the Republican
nominee for Senate from New York, laid out a far more ambitious
plan than that of Gov. George W. Bush, who wants to spend $13.5
billion over five years. Lazio's plan would come close in cost to
the one proposed by his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, whose education proposals call for $123 billion in new
spending in the next decade, her aides said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from cost, Lazio drew sharp distinctions between his plan
and Clinton's, firmly declaring his support for federally financed
vouchers _ although he avoided using that word, instead calling for
``opportunity scholarships,'' which would provide money to parents
in struggling school districts for their children's enrollment in
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The largest chunk of his plan _ $60 billion _ would go toward
financing federally mandated programs for the disabled, the only
part of his plan that drew applause from the 100 or so parents,
politicians and mostly college students attending the speech. And
Lazio said he would encourage the federal government to make some
financing to states contingent on the testing of teachers for
competency every five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If accountability means asking more of students, it also means
asking more of teachers as well, by challenging our teachers to
keep learning and improving and putting their own skills to the
test,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's speech came as he sought some momentum before his first
debate with Clinton on Wednesday. Some Republican Party officials
reportedly have complained that he has not maintained a rigorous
enough campaign schedule lately and has not been clear enough about
what he would do if elected. And it follows within a few days
Clinton's tour of public schools late last week, and new Clinton
television advertisements stressing her commitment to education and
criticizing Lazio's legislative record of voting for cuts in
education funds. This is Lazio's second major policy address; the
other, to unveil a tax-cutting proposal, came Aug. 24 in Buffalo
and prompted a flurry of criticism over the validity of his
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio and his aides left promptly after Monday night's speech.
He answered only two questions as he hustled out, declaring
education the top concern in the election and saying his
tax-cutting plan would help finance the education plan. An
assistant explained later that Lazio would propose using some of
the budget surplus to finance both.

NEW YORK'S GIULIANI CRITICIZES GOP SENATE CANDIDATE FOR ARAFAT
HANDSHAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Monday that it was a
mistake for Rep. Rick Lazio to have enthusiastically shaken the
hand of Yasser Arafat during an official visit to the Middle East
nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little confounded by it,'' Giuliani said at a news
conference in Harlem, adding, ``I don't particularly like to shake
hands with murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor also said that Lazio's handshake was ``not a big
deal'' and that maybe he ``doesn't have the background and
understanding of Arafat that I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's remarks about his fellow Republican, who replaced him
in the Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton, were not well
received by Lazio's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is perfectly welcome to have his opinions,'' said
Dan McLagan, Lazio's chief spokesman. He added that Lazio's
handshake ``was appropriate at the time'' and that ``the mayor
apparently wants no contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's comments came in response to questions about a
picture released by the White House during the weekend showing
Lazio grabbing the hand of Arafat in a reception line while on a
trip to the Mideast nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they released the official
White House photograph because Lazio criticized President Clinton
last week for shaking hands with President Fidel Castro of Cuba
during the U.N. Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, the White House officials said, also criticized Hillary
Clinton for kissing Arafat's wife, Suha, during a visit to the West
Bank last year. On Monday, Giuliani repeated his own criticism of
the kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio and Clinton are in a tight race, and Jewish voters are
viewed by both sides as crucial to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's comments were consistent with the mayor's longtime
view of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Giuliani expelled Arafat from a concert for world
leaders at Lincoln Center, even though the Palestinian leader had
been invited to the White House and had been embraced as a
peacemaker by the Israeli and U.S. governments.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said his distrust of Arafat went back to his days as a
federal prosecutor, when he investigated several terrorist
incidents linked to the PLO, including the 1985 hijacking of the
Achille Lauro cruise ship, in which an American was killed.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Giuliani likened the Palestinian leader to Hitler and
Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot forget that this man is a dictator and that he's a
murderer and that he's murdered Americans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani acknowledged that the Clinton administration needed to
negotiate with Arafat, but he also said that, ``I'm not going to
romanticize him the way we romanticized, for a period of time,
Stalin, the way we romanticized Hitler, the way we romanticized
other dictators small and large during the last century.''

THIS YEAR ON THE RUNWAYS, STARVATION CHIC IS OUT
</HEADLINE>
 By GUY TREBAY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there is one look that won't be hitting the
runways during the spring 2001 collections in New York, which begin
on Thursday and run through Sept. 22, it's that of the
exaggeratedly thin models who reached a kind of apogee (or nadir,
depending on your viewpoint) during the eras of heroin chic, grunge
and the waif. Fashionable standards of beauty fluctuate _ within a
narrow range _ but among the largely unremarked, and salutary,
changes in the modeling business, insiders say, is a renewed
appetite for women who do not look fundamentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing everyone is looking for is a more natural,
sexier look,'' said Annie Veltri, president of T Management, the
year-old model agency owned by Donald Trump. ``There are curves
again and there are bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit Gisele Bundchen and her fellow Brazilians _ that amazing
influx of beautiful cynosures who captivated the United States with
their ripe, often biracial features and with their authentic (well,
most of the time) bosoms and hips. And don't discount the effects
of the first Body Image Summit, a meeting convened this June in
London by European editors and the British Medical Association to
consider the relationship between the largely unrealistic images of
women's bodies represented by most fashion models and an escalation
of eating disorders in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years, styles in models have caromed from prom
queens (Christie Brinkley) to blank-eyed androgynes (Kate Moss),
from surgically enhanced supermodels (let's not say) to anonymous
nobodies, from athletic all-Americans (Nikki Taylor) to gorgeous
slackers who wear septum rings when they're not in front of the
camera (Sybil Buck).
</P>
<P>
   From the supply side, the consensus on the coming season's
models is that the Brazilians are not a phase, and that ``health''
is so ubiquitous a buzzword you couldn't give a waif away. ``I want
girls who, when they walk into a go-see, you can tell they're
models,'' said Bob Dean, who books runway models for the Click
agency. ``They have to look very clean, very fresh, very natural,
and with a presence, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Following what Ashton Hundley, a Ford agent, called the
``supermodel sexy moment'' of the mid-90s, there came an
interesting and less traditionally sexy time, essentially the era
of Kate Moss. Now, Hundley said, the look is ``a little more
diverse and much more natural.''

SURPRISE: McCANN TO START AT QB THIS WEEK 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Ryan McCann showed up at school Monday
morning to lift weights, he was summoned to see UCLA coach Bob
Toledo in his office. If McCann was searching for a some good news,
he might have noticed that he wasn't told to bring his playbook.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore quarterback from Agoura High had played poorly
enough in his first start of the season that he was benched at
halftime in favor of Scott McEwan in UCLA's eventual 24-21 win over
Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   McCann had missed open receivers, made poor reads and called
audibles into plays he shouldn't have.
</P>
<P>
   So, with UCLA poised to play No. 3-Michigan on Saturday at 12:30
p.m. at the Rose Bowl, McCann trudged into Toledo's office like a
brave soldier. He stood at attention as Toledo cleared his throat
and informed McCann that he would be . . . starting?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was ready for me to tell him he wasn't going to be the
starter,'' Toledo said. ``When I told him he was going to be the
starter, he wanted to get out of my office real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann said later Monday he wasn't surprised _ either that he
was starting or that Toledo made a decision between himself and
McEwan so early in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can play,'' said McCann, who described his
performance against Fresno State as subpar. ``I've demonstrated
that. Against Alabama I did OK. The more experience I get the
better I'll be.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely what Toledo is counting on.
</P>
<P>
   A victory over Michigan propels a team coming off a 4-7 season
into the thick of the national-championship hunt. A loss and poor
quarterback play send the Bruins to Oregon for their conference
opener with shaken confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's important that Ryan starts performing better
because we need him to perform better,'' Toledo said. ``We've got a
good football team. I also said this when season started _ as the
quarterback goes, so goes the Bruins. I told (McCann) that this
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of McCann's faults, he has a stronger arm, is a running
threat and poses more concerns for a defense than McEwan, who
completed 5 of 10 passes in the second half for 29 yards with no
touchdowns and no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand,'' said McEwan, a junior from Thousand Oaks whom
Toledo praised for his poise Saturday in the most extensive action
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan just didn't perform like he was capable,'' he added.
``But I knew that he was better than that and he knows that he's
better than that and I think the coaches know he's better than
that. There's a reason why Ryan was starting on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo came to a decision Sunday after reviewing game film and
meeting with his coaches. He moved just as quickly Monday to help
restore McCann's confidence, which, he added, could be shaken from
his play but not from being pulled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concern,'' Toledo said. ``It's probably a concern with
his teammates, too. Potential is great, but performance is what
counts. I like the kid, he's great kid, he's got a lot of ability.
I don't want to be ripping him in the paper, he's a great kid. He
knows he didn't perform well.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann has made just two career starts, but he's played
virtually all of the Bruins last four games dating back to last
season and Toledo is clearly searching for a way to get through to
him.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was frustrated with McCann, Toledo replied,
``Probably. He's not a freshman or a redshirt freshman. He's a
sophomore who's been in the program three years. Yeah, I get a
little frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann's teammates, such as linebacker Ryan Nece, are rallying
around him. He had breakfast Sunday with Nece, who encouraged him
not to lose faith in his ability.
</P>
<P>
   __ Michigan update: Michigan will definitely be without starting
quarterback Drew Henson, the Detroit Free Press reports.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Wojtys, the team's physician, said there was no
chance he would clear Henson to play Saturday. Wojtys performed
surgery on the broken fifth metatarsal in Henson's right foot on
Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   So far, backup John Navarre has performed extremely well _ he
leads the nation in pass efficiency with a 238.81 rating. But he
has done it against Bowling Green and Rice, neither of which is on
the same talent level as the Bruins.

RETURNS TO TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE POLLS: FOR NOW, A TOSS-UP
</P>
<P>
   Four new national polls _ those for Time, Fox News, CNN/USA
Today and NBC/The Wall Street Journal _ showed little change in the
presidential race since Vice President Al Gore closed the gap with
Gov. George W. Bush after the Democratic National Convention. None
of the polls, released over the weekend, has Gore ahead by more
than three points, about the same spread that many polls released a
week earlier showed. So with about eight weeks until Election Day,
the race appears to be a toss-up _ at least for the moment. One
caution: A fifth poll, conducted for Newsweek, has Gore ahead by a
more-comfortable eight percentage points. In individual state polls
released, a Marist Institute survey had Gore ahead of Bush in New
York by 25 percentage points, a gain of 14 points from the last
Marist poll, and a Rocky Mountain News/KCNC-TV poll in Colorado
indicated that Gore had pulled to within three points of Bush, a
gain of 11 points since the last poll. In Missouri, a state in
which Gore and Bush ran neck and neck for months, a new Zogby Poll
has Gore now ahead by 5 points. Likewise, in Illinois, where the
race has been a toss-up, a Zogby Poll has Gore 15 points ahead.
</P>
<P>
   THE REPUBLICANS: TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE LANGUAGE Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas has demonstrated a sometimes tortured relationship
with the English language, saying ``hostile'' when he meant
``hostage,'' ``terrier'' when he meant ``tariff'' and ``vile'' when
he meant ``vital.'' An article in Vanity Fair magazine that is
about to hit the newsstands offers an possible explanation,
suggesting that Bush has dyslexia and is being skewered by
reporters for a tendency beyond his control. Karen P. Hughes, the
director of communications for the Bush campaign, said that the
magazine's sympathy for the ribbing that Bush has taken is
misplaced. Hughes said that while one of Bush's brothers, Neil, has
dyslexia, the Republican presidential nominee does not. ``In the
case of this story,'' Hughes said, ``fiction is stranger than
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   FUND-RAISING: LIEBERMAN RETURNS TO TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in four days, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut traveled to Texas, this time not to embarrass Gov.
George W. Bush in one of the state's poor neighborhoods, but to
reap campaign cash in some of its wealthiest. Lieberman, the
Democratic vice-presidential nominee, spoke at four events on
Monday in Dallas and in the Austin area, raising $1.7 million for
the Democratic National Committee. ``Some people may have different
ideas about Texas, but I feel I'm in Gore-Lieberman country,'' he
told contributors in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Lieberman held a forum in a low-income part of
Houston to attack Bush's record on children's health care. On
Monday, he traveled to the Westlake Hills neighborhood outside
Austin. At the home of Thomas J. Meredith, who directs Dell
Computer's venture capital fund, Lieberman spoke to 150 people at a
$5,000-a-couple luncheon.

GOLDMAN SACHS TO ACQUIRE TOP FIRM ON TRADING FLOORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Goldman Sachs Group confirmed Monday that it
planned to make its most expensive acquisition to date by paying as
much as $7.4 billion to buy Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg, the biggest
trading firm on the floors of the nation's stock and options
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, one of the biggest securities firms on Wall Street,
said it would pay $4.4 billion in stock and $2.1 billion in cash to
acquire Spear, Leeds from its 54 partners. Goldman also will set
aside another $900 million of its stock to retain Spear, Leeds
employees after the purchase, which Goldman expects to complete by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Spear, Leeds would give Goldman a much bigger presence in
some businesses it seemed to have written off. Less than a year
ago, Goldman officials were pushing for a restructuring of United
States stock markets that would have hurt Spear, Leeds, and just a
few months ago a Goldman executive called one of the main functions
of Spear, Leeds ``unsustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, Goldman's most senior executives are saying that Spear,
Leeds will put Goldman Sachs at the forefront of a global boom in
stock trading, no matter which direction the markets take. ``We
think it's got the best technology,'' said Henry M. Paulson,
Goldman's chairman and chief executive. ``We're assuming the
markets are going to keep changing, and we're assuming that the
U.S. market is going toward more electronic trading.``
</P>
<P>
   That trend has been in place for many years as trading on the
all-electronic Nasdaq stock market has exploded, raising doubts
about the future of auction markets like the one housed in the New
York Stock Exchange's cavernous building at the corner of Broad and
Wall streets in lower Manhattan. Late last year, Paulson himself
called for changes in the way stocks are priced and traded, moves
that would have threatened the existence of auction markets and the
firms that keep them running.
</P>
<P>
   Spear, Leeds, one of the biggest private partnerships on Wall
Street, is the biggest specialist, or operator of trading posts, on
the floors of the New York and American stock exchanges as well as
on the major options trading floors. In the nonstop auctions at
those exchanges, specialists are responsible for maintaining
orderly markets by matching up traders who want to buy certain
securities with those who want to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the operating profit of Spear, Leeds comes
from making markets on those trading floors, according to Goldman
Sachs. But, in a cover story in Forbes magazine in May, Duncan
Niederauer, a Goldman executive, described specialist-based
auctions as unsustainable in an era of low-cost electronic
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman officials have not recanted those statements. But they
clearly think there still is plenty of profit to be made in trading
the old-fashioned way until it becomes clearer how and when the
markets will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as a real bargain'' among the best
financial companies, Paulson said, adding that Goldman ``wanted to
pay a full and fair price.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts applauded the deal as a smart strategic move for a
firm that is committed to being a leading provider of financial
services to big customers.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Solotar, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, was
not concerned that the deal would increase Goldman's dependence on
trading. ``They're not running the firm to smooth earnings,'' she
said. ``If an investor wants a smooth earnings stream, he shouldn't
invest in brokerage stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors also seemed to approve of the transaction: Goldman's
shares rose $8.06, to $132.31.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson said that Goldman might buy other specialist firms. He
also said that Goldman would consider purchases that would add heft
to its money-management operations. But he said the firm had little
interest in acquiring either a brokerage firm, like Charles Schwab,
or another investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman has always prided itself on its culture and Paulson said
that Spear, Leeds was a close cultural fit, despite its history of
violating the rules of the exchanges on which it trades. Spear,
Leeds has repeatedly been fined and censured by exchanges and
securities regulators for assorted transgressions, including
failing to file timely reports of its short positions, or
securities that it had sold but did not own.
</P>
<P>
   In one case in 1998, the National Association of Securities
Dealers fined a unit of Spear, Leeds $950,000 and censured it after
finding that the unit had intentionally delayed reports of some
trades ``to secure a competitive advantage, protect its interests
and maximize its profits or minimize its losses,'' according to
NASD records.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cader, a co-chief executive of Spear, Leeds, said that it
was ``not surprising that we have fallen short of perfection,''
given the size of the firm's trading businesses. But he said the
firm's management was ``very proud of its regulatory record, and we
assume our new partners are.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulson expressed no concern. ``We feel very comfortable with
the people and their standards,'' he said.

U.S. REQUEST FOR ANTISMOKING DATA SLOWS BRITISH DRUG MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE KAPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham said Monday that
their merger into one of the world's largest pharmaceutical
companies is again facing delays as U.S. regulators examine their
products to stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission in Washington has requested
additional information about Glaxo's prescription drug Zyban and
SmithKline's over-the-counter Nicorette and Nicoderm products, the
companies said. As a result, the completion of the $75 billion
merger has been pushed back to year-end from Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time that the two British drugmakers have
faced regulatory requests. Last month, they agreed to sell $2.9
billion worth of products to satisfy regulators. European antitrust
authorities have since approved the merger.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that deal, Novartis of Switzerland is buying
SmithKline's herpes treatments Famvir and Vectavir/Denavir for
$1.63 billion, while another Swiss-based company, Roche Holding, is
paying $1.23 billion for Kytril, a nausea-treatment drug for cancer
patients.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that the current round of scrutiny is
coming from Washington, since the American market for
smoking-cessation products is far larger than Europe's, said Nigel
Barnes, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. What is surprising, he said,
is that the FTC is asking for more information at this late stage.
Glaxo and SmithKline announced their merger in January and had
originally expected to complete the deal by Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Combinations of pharmaceutical companies are often complex for
antitrust regulators, who examine not only products on the market,
but also products in development that may not come to market for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the delays, shareholders seemed not too pessimistic that
the deal would in time be completed. Both stocks recovered some
early losses here, with Glaxo ending 10 pence lower at 19.10
pounds, or $26.89. SmithKline fell 9.5 pence, to 8.635 pounds, or
$12.16.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't major areas of fundamental concern,'' Barnes
said. ``They are not deal-breaking issues. It's an irritation.''
</P>
<P>
   As mergers grow larger and more aggressive, regulatory agencies
are playing an increasing role in what a combined company will look
like as well as whether the deal is approved. How companies
interact with regulators can often spell the difference between
success and failure.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the speedy sale of the herpes and nausea
drugs showed regulators that the two companies were willing to
cooperate. Other areas that could come under scrutiny, analysts
said, are antibiotics and drugs used against AIDS.
