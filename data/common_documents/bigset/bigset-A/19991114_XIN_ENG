<HEADLINE> Iraq to Open Shipping Line to Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is to open a shipping
line in December linking a southern Iraqi harbor to Bahrain, said
an Iraqi official on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of the Iraqi Transport and Communications
Ministry Jameel Ibrahim said in a statement that Iraq and Bahrain
had agreed to facilitate preparations for the opening of the
shipping line.
</P>
<P>
The southern Iraqi Umm Qasr harbor is ready for receiving
passengers coming from Bahrain, the Iraqi News Agency quoted him
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim said that his ministry has provided modern means of
transportation in the harbor to bring in passengers from Bahrain
to other Iraqi provinces, especially to those sacred religious
shrines.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the idea of opening the shipping line had been
welcomed in Bahrain and other Arab Gulf states because it will
ease the burdens of long-time travel by land to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed air ban on Iraq following its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, which forbids air flights from and to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Since then, except U.N. weapons inspectors who flew to Iraq by
helicopters, the 1,000-kilometer-long Iraqi-Jordanian road has
become the only passage to Iraq for those who visit or work in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, under the permission of the U.N.
Sanctions Committee on Iraq, the United Arab Emirates opened the
first shipping line to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Sanctions Committee has approved recently the opening
of two shipping lines linking Iraq to Bahrain and Qatar to
transport passengers.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urged Continued Palestinian, Israeli Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Saturday urged the Palestinians and Israel to continue working
toward peace.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parliament, the People's Assembly, which
reconvened in the day after a month-long recess, Mubarak said the
signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum in September was "an
important step" and urged the two sides to continue implementing
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The latest peace deal that provides for ambitious goals for the
two sides to achieve permanent peace within one year has rapidly
unfolded after the signing and gone more or less smoothly so far.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed Egypt's keenness on helping realize a just
and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the driving force behind the peace process is
the end of Israel's occupation of Arab lands, including
Palestinian territories, Syria's Golan Heights and southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the Egyptian president also underlined the need
to create more jobs for the youth and increase exports.
</P>
<P>
"Exporting our products is a matter of life and death," Mubarak
said, referring to Egypt's annual trade deficit which stands at 12
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He has said that Egypt needs to create about 500,000 jobs a
year to bring down unemployment. The official unemployment rate is
10-13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also, Mubarak expressed profound pain and grief for the 217
victims in an EgyptAir passenger plane crash last month, off the
eastern coast of the United States, and requested a one-minute
silence for the dead.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Syria, Israel to Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine Saturday called on Syria and Israel to exert more
efforts to realize the resumption their peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel have yet to solve the difference over the
resumption of the negotiations, so the two countries should step
up efforts in this regard, said Vedrine at a joint press
conference with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Real peace would never materialize in the Middle East without
an agreement between Syria and Israel, said the French minister.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks were stalled in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Syria demands Israel commit in principle to returning the
entire Golan Heights it captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast
War before resuming talks. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said
he is willing to discuss concessions, but that all issues should
be solved through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Since Barak's election in May, leaders of the two countries
have said they were interested in re-starting the talks, but
failed to translate the words into actions.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine on Saturday wound up a three-nation regional tour after
meeting Moussa. He had held talks with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad before travelling to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
France has long wanted to play a greater role in the Mideast
peacemaking, especially as regards the Syrian-Israeli track. But
Israel has not expressed enthusiasm for a wider French or European
role, preferring to stick with the U.S. mediation and direct
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Moussa said Israel's settlement policy
contradicted its commitment to the peace process with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The contradictions will lead to question marks regarding
Israel's commitment to the peace process and the possibility of
reaching a final settlement within a year which Barak spoke
about," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
While Israel has dismantled 12 settlements, Barak has
retroactively approved 30 other settler encampments set up in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is critical of Israel's settlement activities in the
occupied Palestinian territories. The future of the Jewish
settlements is one of the thorniest issues in the
Palestinian-Israeli final status talks that started on September
13.
</P>
<P>
France keeps close coordination with Egypt, the first Arab
country to sign a peace treaty with Israel as well as an active
mediator between Arab countries and Israel.

<HEADLINE> At Least 362 Killed in Quake in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Health Ministry
announced Saturday that 362 people have been confirmed killed and
near 2,000 others injured in a 7.2-magnitude quake that hit the
northwestern province of Bolu on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey faced a bitter reality of having to cope with a second
major earthquake disaster in three months, but this time both
rescue and relief efforts were well organized and the state
functioned well, winning praise from the public.
</P>
<P>
After working through the night with floodlights, rescue teams
combed the rubble in northwestern Turkey for survivors.
</P>
<P>
The quake was centered in Duzce town, near the area wrecked by
a powerful tremblor on August 17, which left at least 17,000
people dead.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has promised a full
response from the government and military. "The state is there
with all its means," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government and military were accused of responding slowly
to the August disaster.
</P>
<P>
This time, the response was prompt. Military and official
rescue and relief teams rushed to the disaster zone and many lives
were saved thanks to the speedy action.
</P>
<P>
In the town of Duzce, hundreds of people huddled around fires
of wood and old tires in a park as temperatures fell to 3 C.
</P>
<P>
Just one day before Friday's quake, a smaller earthquake
measuring 5.7 on the open-ended Richter scale shook the nearby
town of Adapazari, in which two people died and 171 others were
injured.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, a passenger bus carrying 30 people was
crushed as a building collapsed onto it Friday and all the 30
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
But the summit of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will be held on November 18-19 as
scheduled in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, a summit
spokeswoman said on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns Attack on Its Journalists in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry
Saturday condemned the recent beating of several Russian TV
journalists in London while they were attending a meeting of
radical Islamic groups on the situation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Judging by the videotape, the authorities remained absolutely
idle while our colleagues were being beaten," Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
It is strange that this incident occurred "in a country known
for its traditions of civilized treatment of journalists, and
which is quite willing to teach others how to treat
representatives of the press," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not let this outrageous incident simply pass. We will
ask for an official explanation from the British side. Measures
should be taken against those obnoxious hooligans," he said.
</P>
<P>
Days ago, journalists of Russia's ORT and NTV television
networks were fiercely beat up in downtown London as they started
to shoot a meeting of local Islamists whose watchword is
"declaring a jihad on Russia".
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, the fanatics inflicted
severe injuries on four journalists and smashed or seized their
cameras.
</P>
<P>
"Attackers kicked us heavily and beat us with sticks. Blows
rained from all sides and aimed to injure our internal organs,"
said Alexander Panov, one of the attacked journalists from the ORT
television station, cited by the Itar-Tass.
</P>
<P>
Now all the wounded are still in bed. The Russian Foreign
Ministry spokesman said Moscow will act and he wishes the
journalists a speedy recovery.

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Mayor Cancels Plan to Proclaim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The mayor's office of San
Francisco recently decided to cancel a plan to issue a
commendation letter to Falun Gong cult leader Li Zhongzhi and
proclaim July 23 as "Li Hongzhi Day".
</P>
<P>
The mayor's office made the decision after understanding the
evil features of Falun Gong, a cult which was banned by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Mayor Willie L. Brown, in a statement, said he
decided to cancel such a plan because he did not hope the
proclamation would be misunderstood and taken as interference into
China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to incomplete statistics, Falun Gong cult has claimed
the lives of more than 1,400 practitioners, with many others
becoming insane and families ruined.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of
China issued an anti-cult law on October 30, 1999 to prevent and
combat cults such as the banned Falun Gong cult.

<HEADLINE> Primakov's Bloc Not Opposed to Putin, Says Luzhkov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The large center-left
Fatherland-All Russia (OVR) coalition, led by former Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, is not opposed to current Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin, said Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, second
OVR leader Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We do not speak against Putin, we meet him periodically," said
Luzhkov at an election campaign meeting.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov said he suggested "a formula of increasing the pace of
real production growth" during a meeting with Putin on Friday and
the latter "met these proposals with interest."
</P>
<P>
"If one talks about Putin's single-mindedness and persistence,
they are worthy of respect," the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
In regard of the government's operation in Chechnya, Luzhkov
said "it is unacceptable to impede and criticize Putin's policy in
Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov expressed hope that the Chechen operation would have a
different outcome than did the 1994-1996 Chechen war, in which
"diametrically opposite orders were dropping on the military and
led to the Khasavyurt agreements."
</P>
<P>
He described the Khasavyurt pact as a "Russian mistake and
defeat."
</P>
<P>
Putin "takes a respectful attitude to our organization (OVR)
and to Moscow," Luzhkov said. He wished the prime minister
"success."

HARARE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Minister of Zimbabwean
Health and Child Welfare David Parirenyatwa Saturday urged people
to change their behavior in the face of the AIDS pandemic which
he said was claiming about 1,700 people every week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of Cranborne Park Medical Centre, he
said the rate at which people were dying of AIDS showed that
people were not taking seriously the infection.
</P>
<P>
"As much as people now feel that we should not continue talking
about AIDS because it has been said for a long time, I still urge
people to change their attitudes and behavior towards AIDS
because the number of people dying of the infection continue to
rise," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is the second after Botswana on the world list of
countries worst affected by AIDS. About 1.4 million adults, 25.8
percent of sexually active adults aged between 15 and 49 are
thought to be infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
Parirenyatwa asked people to go for voluntary AIDS testing,
particularly those who were about to marry, so that they would
know their HIV/AIDS status and take responsibility of their
health.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry was going to set up voluntary counselling
and testing centres to ensure that people had the chance to be
tested and know their health status.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin Saturday said cardinal changes have occurred in the
situation in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Radical changes have been occurring in that republic since
yesterday.The Chechen people joined Russian forces in action
against the guerrillas in Gudermes, bringing about a turning point
in the war," said Putin at a meeting of Russia's Security Council
in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
"The Chechen people have joined the Russian armed forces in
liberating their republic from bandits," he stressed, thanking the
residents of Gudermes, second biggest city of Chechnya and calling
them "bold and courageous people who have made the right choice."
</P>
<P>
Putin said federal troops have "finished the mopping-up of
Gudermes."
</P>
<P>
Russia would seek a political solution to the Chechen problem,
he said. But "we will never sit at the negotiating table with
bandits."
</P>
<P>
Moscow takes an "absolutely open position for the world public
on the situation in Chechnya," said the premier, adding that
Russia "does not reject cooperation and help from international
organizations."
</P>
<P>
"We are solving the questions concerning the situation in
Chechnya on our own, but if the international community wants to
know how things stand, it has such a right," said Putin.
</P>
<P>
However, "peace must triumph in that land and there must be
conditions for normal life and for the normal operation of
government bodies," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Economy Shows Signs of Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's economy is showing
signs of recovery in 1999 thanks to the kingdom's efforts to
attract more foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Overall investments in the desert kingdom during the first
eight months of 1999 amounted to 337 million Jordanian dinars
(471.8 million U.S. dollars), up by 20 percent over the same
period of 1998, according to the latest statistics available on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital accounted for 45 percent of the overall
investments for the first eight months of this year, said Haidar
Murad, chairman of the Jordanian Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom's economy is showing positive signs of recovery
from a zero or negative growth rate registered in 1998, said
Haidar.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the positive signs to King Abdullah Bin
Hussein's policies to improve the country's economic performance
as well as the government's efforts to encourage the private
sector to attract investments and open up new markets for
Jordanian goods in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan is striving to increase its trade with other
Arab countries and to establish a pan-Arab free trade zone that
would facilitate the free movement of capital and workers in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's trade volume with other Arab states accounted for some
27 percent of its overall trade volume, and 25.3 percent of the
kingdom's exports went to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain,
Oman and the United Arab Emirates in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's exports to the Gulf states stood at 229 million
dinars (320.6 million dollars) and imports from those countries
at 151 million dinars (211.4 million dollars) in 1998.

differences over the second-stage troops redeployment maps
prepared by the Israeli side, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat rejected the maps presented to
him by Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran and Head of the Planning
Branch of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Shlomo Yanai in Gaza
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said some of the populated Arab areas east of Hebron
were not included in the maps for the incoming Israeli IDF
redeployment slated for Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the maps, the lands slated for transfer include
2.2 percent territories east of the West Bank city of Hebron,
which will be turned into a natural reserve, and other areas in
the north of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the lastest peace deal signed on September 5 by Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Arafat, Israel should withdraw from
18.1 percent of the West Bank in three stages, ending in
January.
</P>
<P>
In 11 percent of the targeted land, Israel previously had sole
control, while the remaining 7.1 percent, it ruled jointly with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The first land transfer of 7 percent to the Palestinian
administrative rule was carried out on September 10, three days
ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
During the incoming second stage, Israel will transfer 3
percent of the West Bank territories under full Israeli control,
or Area C, to joint jurisdiction, or Area B, and 2 percent from
Area B to full Palestinian rule, or Area A.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet approved the maps Wednesday by a vote of
17-1, with one abstention.

ADDIS ABABA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and
one seriously injured in a bomb blast Saturday in a passenger
train going from the Ethiopian second largest city Dire Dawa to
the capital of Addis Ababa, police said.
</P>
<P>
The drivers of the train were killed instantly while its
co-driver was seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
All of the passengers survived the explosion, which happened at
a point 12 kilometers from an area called Melka-Jebdu, and
severely damaged the engine of the train.
</P>
<P>
Nobody has claimed responsibility for the latest terrorist
attack on the train which belongs to the Ethio-Djibouti Railway
Company.
</P>
<P>
A team comprising the Dire Dawa Administration Council, police
and national army has begun investigation.
</P>
<P>
This is the second train bomb blast in Ethiopia since August
this year.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Opposition Group Prefers Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- One of the Burundi
opposition groups, the National Council for the Defense of
Democracy (CNDD-FDD), has called on the nomination of a Tanzanian
to replace former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere as the
mediator for the Burundi conflict.
</P>
<P>
An aide to leader of CNDD-FDD Colonel Jean Bosco said here
Saturday that a Tanzanian mediator stands a better chance to
perform his role positively as the country is impartial and its
close geographical location to Burundi makes most of its officials
aware of most of the events taking place in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal for the sake of finding a lasting solution to the
civil strife in Burundi which in turn has affected not only
Burundians but also neighboring states, espes assistants in Arusha
talks to succeed him," he said.
</P>
<P>
The aide said, the appointing of a mediator from outside the
Great Lakes region will mean the new mediator has to be briefed
and spend time to keep himself aware of the conflict in Burundi,
it will not be of much help to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the leaders of the region and the new
mediator to create an environment which will enable his group and
other shut-outs of the Arusha peace talks to be invited.
</P>
<P>
The CNDD-FDD is a splinter faction from the main CNDD led by
the former Burundi Agricultural Minister Leonard Nyangoma during
the brief rule of President Melchior Ndadaye in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Since Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first Hutu
president in October 1993, an estimated 200,000 people, most of
them civilians, have been killed in fighting between Hutu rebels
and the Tutsi-dominated army.
</P>
<P>
The year long peace talks aimed at ending the conflict have
come to a standstill following the death of former Tanzanian
President Julius Nyerere last month.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Interests Must be Protected in Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Miniter Abdel
Rauf Rawabdeh stressed Saturday that Jordan's interests must be
protected in the ongoing final status negotiations between Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during talks with Palestinian chief
negotiator, Culture and Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo,
who arrived here Saturday morning to brief the Jordanian side on
the developments of the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh said Jordan will not be a part at the negotiating
table, but Amman has to watch the talks closely as it has
interests to be protected, particularly with regards to issues on
refugees, water, security and borders.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated Jordan's support for the Palestinians in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the Palestinian minister told reporters that
his talks with Rawabdeh had been "constructive and held in a
brotherly atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
He said a host of common issues should be discussed profoundly
between Jordan and the Palestinians to serve the final status
negotiations and the whole peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and for years
it has been actively promoting the peace process between the
Jewish state and its Arab neighbors, particularly the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom has used all possible occasions to voice its
support for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state,
with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The West Bank and east Jerusalem had been part of Jordan, which
were captured by Israel in 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Jordan severed its legal and administrative ties with
the West Bank, paving the way to some extent for the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are some 1.2 million registered Palestinian
refugees in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Amman supported the rights of the refugees for either returning
to their homeland or asking for compensation from parties
concerned, though most of the refugees had been given Jordanian
citizenship.

the Document of Execution of the 1929 Treaty and its Complementary
Protocol, solving in this way the border problem between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the historical documents was witnessed by
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Peru's and Chile's
foreign ministers, Fernando de Trazegnies and Juan Gabriel Valdes,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Chile will deliver to Peru in Arica, in no more than 90 days, a

The talks for settlement of the historic dispute between the
Peruvian and Chilean foreign ministries lasted almost one year.

commissions, led by Peruvian ambassador Carlos Pareja, and his
Chilean counterpart, Maria Teresa Infante, completed the

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British State Minister
for Defense Procurement Baroness Symons Saturday met with Jordanian
King Abdullah Bin Hussein, discussing defense cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The talks highlighted bilateral defense cooperation, the
defense need of the kingdom and means of developing its defense
capabilities, Jordan's official Petra news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Symons arrived in Amman Friday evening on a two-day visit to
attend a delivery ceremony for 14 British-made Challenger-1 tanks,
the first batch of 288 free tanks promised by Britain to be
delivered in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The Challenger-1s, which will replace Jordanian army's outdated
Centurion tanks, were promised by Britain after the death of King
Hussein in February as a reward of his role in promoting the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Symons also met Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel
Rauf Rawabdeh, Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah al-Khatib and senior
defense officials on bilateral military cooperation and the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Rawabdeh reaffirmed Jordan's support for a
just, durable and comprehensive peace in the region. He also
called for closer cooperation between Jordan and Britain,
particularly in the military field.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Symons expressed appreciation for Jordan's
contributions to maintaining peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been actively pushing forward the peace process
between Israel and its Arab neighbors after it signed a peace
treaty with the Jewish state in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Reveals U.S. Letter Against 9th Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Cuba on Saturday revealed to
the press a letter from U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
against the 9th Ibero-american Summit.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Albright asked heads of state of the
Ibero-American countries to prevent the incoming Summit from
becoming an international success for the host country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said as he presented the
document that it is one more proof of the United States of trying
to boycott the 9th Ibero-american Summit and meddle in a forum of
which it is no part.
</P>
<P>
Albright said in her letter that the heads of state who will
attend the Summit in Havana have a duty to question the Cuban
government for alleged incompliance with the Vina del Mar Summit,
held in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official also expressed her desire that every chief of
delegation speaks during the plenary sessions of the summit and in
related meetings "about the need for Cuba to start a process of
political reforms."
</P>
<P>
She also called on them to meet with the so-called defenders of
human rights, religious organizations, and political activists in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"The political significance of the site for the Summit is not
exclusive of the Cuban government, which could use the event as a
proof of the international success of its policy, said Albright.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government denounced recently that the U.S.
International Development Agency invested this year more than six
million dollars to finance the so-called independent groups who
respond to the Washington policies.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of 16 of the 21 countries
that form the Ibero-American community will attend the summit in
Havana next Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Chile and Argentina will be absent for
reasons unrelated to Cuba; and those of Nicaragua, El Salvador,
and Costa Rica will be absent because of disagreements with the
policies of the host country.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Hails Peace Dividends Between Jordan, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. First Lady
Hillary Clinton Saturday called for increased dividends of peace
between Jordan and Israel to bring more benefit for the peoples of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
She made the appeal during the official launching ceremony of
the Bridging the Rift Foundation, a charitable foundation set up
by U.S. entrepreneurs to help develop the desert region that
constitutes the south of both Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Clinton said that Washington stands staunchly behind
peace accomplishments between Jordan and Israel, and she hoped
that the establishment of the foundation would help bring more
economic gains and benefits for the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the only two Arab states that signed a peace
treaty with Israel. Egypt signed a peace treaty with the Jewish
state in 1979 and Jordan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
At the launching ceremony, Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
thanked the first lady for attending the event, and said her
presence itself was a reminder of a positive and instrumental role
by the U.S. in promoting the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Washington takes Jordan as an ally in the Arab world and had
provided some 271.6 million U.S. dollars of military and economic
assistance to the kingdom during the fiscal year ending on
September 30.
</P>
<P>
Hillary, who left here Saturday night for Washington, arrived
in Amman Thursday evening as part of her Middle East tour, which
had taken her to Israel and Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
During her stay in Jordan, Hillary also toured the ancient
city of Petra, 250 kilometers south of Amman, and attended two
seminars on microfinance and early child care and development.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Cracks Australia 2-0 in Soccer Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Brazil whipped down Australia
2-0 in a friendly soccer match in Sydney on Sunday even though
their big star Ronaldo was absent.
</P>
<P>
Goias defender Alvaro and Alex, of Palmeiras, scored Brazil's
goals, both coming after attacks down the left wing in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
The match was played in front of 50,325 fans at Stadium
Australia, the main venue for next year's Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The attendance was boosted when organizers made all tickets
free because of the absence of top stars Ronaldo and Harry Kewell,
who were prevented from playing in clashes between their clubs and
national federations.
</P>
<P>
Brazil led the game in the 32nd minute when Ronaldinho crossed
from the left corner and defender Alvaro rose above the
Australians' defense to head powerfully into the bottom right
corner of Mark Bosnich's net.
</P>
<P>
Brazil made it 2-0 in the 40th minute when captain Denilson
sent in a curling cross from the left flank and Alex sneaked in
front of defender Tony Vidmar at the near post to poke the ball
past Bosnich.
</P>
<P>
The second game between the two teams will be played Wednesday
at Melbourne Cricket Ground.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Leaders to Meet IT Private Sector Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The 10 heads of state and
government of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
will meet leaders of the information technology (IT) sector on
November 28 to discuss measures to implement a Southeast
E-Community (E-ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The meeting will mark the first time that the ASEAN will meet
with the captains of industry in the region to discuss IT
development and the setting up of an ASEAN Information
Infrastructure (AII), said former Philippine Foreign Secretary
Roberto Romulo in a statement issued here Sunday by the
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
During the 45-minute dialogue that will take place before the
ASEAN Informal Summit, representatives from the world's leading IT
companies will present a white paper outlining their findings and
recommendations on how the ASEAN can continue to become a magnet
of IT investments and speed up the implementation of its AII, said
Romulo, who heads the private IT sector meeting with the ASEAN
leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The white paper will focus on the required policy and
regulatory reforms to attract investments on information and
communication technology infrastructure. This white paper is
expected to be the basis for the exchange of view between the
leaders and the industry representatives," said Romulo.
</P>
<P>
The private sector recommendations that will be presented to
the ASEAN leaders were developed by a core group from the IT
industry that has been meeting since early this year to examine
the state of IT development and use in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The group, Romulo said, has agreed that private-sector
participation in building the AII can be ensured "if ASEAN
governments undertake appropriate policy reforms, institute a
market-friendly regulatory framework and develop human capital."
</P>
<P>
During last year's informal summit in Hanoi, ASEAN leaders
approved the implementation of the AII, which aims to create the
E-ASEAN by linking the national information infrastructure of
member economies.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN has laid out specific target dates for AII's
implementation. Its timetable calls for the development of
networks of science and technology centers of excellence by 2001
and the forging of agreements on inter-connection by 2001,
according to Romulo.
</P>
<P>
By 2004, he said, the ASEAN is expected to have developed the
content of its information infrastructure, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN-private sector dialogue forms part of a series of
meetings during the Third Informal Summit of ASEAN leaders to be
held here on November 28.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN comprises the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia,
Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Airlines Incurs Huge Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned Biman Bangladesh
Airlines has incurred huge losses especially in its domestic
sector for buying aviation fuel at the world's highest prices, The
Financial Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The price of the fuel in Dhaka is 48 U.S. cents per liter, a
price which was fixed during the Gulf War in 1992 when the price
of crude oil shot up to 35 U.S. dollars per barrel. Since then,
the price of aviation fuel remained unchanged although the price
of crude oil until recently stayed at around 10 dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
As a result, foreign airlines operating flights to and from
Dhaka are getting only the essential amount of fuel from Dhaka.
This is reportedly 48 percent less than their actual requirement.
</P>
<P>
Biman is the biggest buyer of aviation fuel from Bangladesh and
its expenditure on this account is about 30 percent of the
operating cost.
</P>
<P>
The tendency of earning a disproportionately high profit
through the sale of aviation fuel at the highest rate is retarding
the growth of civil aviation through Dhaka's Zia International
Airport and depriving the country of substantial foreign revenue.
</P>
<P>
The report said a reduction in the aviation fuel price
rationally will encourage other carriers to lift more fuel from
Dhaka and encourage many others to use Zia International Airport
for technical landing. In that case, Bangladesh would sell more
fuel and earn more profit and the Civil Aviation Authority of
Bangladesh and Biman will be able to earn extra money from
landing, handling and other charges.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Shuttler Ready For New Challenge After Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- After one year of suspension,
Indonesian men's doubles shuttler Sigit Budiarto is ready to face
the tough competition in the badminton world by testing himself in
the China Open starting Monday with new partner Halim Heryanto.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to restart my career. I feel a bit worried as I have
been absent from competition for one year and something's missing
inside me. I'm traumatized with the doping test," he said after
training session at the Indonesian Badminton Center in East
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Sigit was banned by the International Badminton Federation from
competition for using anabolic steroid.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Badminton Association (PBSI) expects Sigit and
Halim to qualify for the Olympics next year. With seven
tournaments to go -- China Open, Hong Kong Open, Chinese Taipei
Open, South Korea Open, Switzerland Open, All England and Swedish
Open -- they have to reach, at least, semi-finals of all
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
"I have a mounting motivation to win all my matches as I used
to be. But Halim and I have never partnered in real tournaments
before. The most difficult thing is to gain the competitiveness
spirit. It's important to deal with the pressure on the court. The
China Open will be our first test. If we can overcome the barrier,
I'm optimistic we can qualify for the Olympics," said Sigit, who
was born in Yogyakarta.
</P>
<P>
"I have learned that people have to be patient when they are
being suspended. It's really important to me. To be frankly, I
felt as an outsider in the center," he was quoted by the Jakarta
Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sigit won the world champion title together with former partner
Candra Wijaya two years ago.
</P>
<P>
In August last year, they won the Singapore Open title but
Sigit was tested positive for consuming nandrolone, which was
included on the International Olympic Committee's list of banned
substances.
</P>
<P>
Halim, who formerly partnered Tony, said he and Sigit have
tried to communicate better after practice to improve their
performance.
</P>
<P>
Halim and Sigit have prepared for two months to compete in the
China Open.
</P>
<P>
PBSI training director Christian Hadinata said both Halim and
Sigit were expected to make spectacular performances in all
tournaments they compete.
</P>
<P>
PBSI official n charge of athletes development Mangombar
Ferdinand Siregar expressed optimism that Sigit and Halim were
ready to face the tough challenge.
</P>
<P>
"Sigit has turned into a new person. He's more disciplined than
before and he never hangs out every night anymore. He keeps
exercising not only technically but also physically," he added.

<HEADLINE> Hingis, Davenport Reach Philadelphia Tennis Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis and Lindsay
Davenport each needed less than one hour to record semi-final
victories today, setting up a showdown between the world's top two
players in Sunday's final of 520,000 U.S. dollars Advanta
Championships in Villanova, Pennsylvania, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, the 19-year-old from Switzerland who holds the No. 1
ranking and is the top seed, dispatched fourth seed Nathalie
Tauziat of France, 6-4, 6-2, in 55 minutes tonight to reach her
tour-best 12th final of the year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Davenport, the second seed, crushed fellow
American and third seed Venus Williams, 6-1, 6-2, in only 50
minutes. The 23-year-old Californian will be appearing in her
seventh final of the year and her third straight at this event.
</P>
<P>
Hingis droppped the first two games of the match, but broke
Tauziat in the third game and again in the ninth game of the match
to go up 5-4. She held serve at love in the following game and
closed out the set with her second ace of the match.
</P>
<P>
A pair of service breaks helped Hingis race to a 5-1 lead in
the second set. The key point of the set came in the fifth game as
Hingis survived three game points on Tauziat's serve and broke at
deuce to go up, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, the reigning Wimbledon champion, lost the last two
meetings against Williams but was overpowering today. She has won
three of five meetings with Williams this year and improved her
overall series lead to 9-3.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who is competing in her first event since
aggravating a wrist injury last month in Filderstadt, Germany,
pulled out of the doubles semi-finals tonight due to a mild sprain
of her right wrist.
</P>
<P>
Hingis defeated Davenport, 7-5, 6-7 (7-9), 7-6 (7-4), in the
1997
final and has won three of four indoor meetings between the two.
Overall, the head-to-head series is tied 7-7 with Davenport
winning the last meeting earlier this year in the final at Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who lost to Steffi Graf in last year's final, has
won five titles this year with her last tournament victory coming
at the Princess Cup in Tokyo in late September. Hingis has won a
WTA Tour-leading seven titles including last month's Porsche Grand
Prix.

MADRID, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Spain were held to a
disappointing goalless draw by Brazil in an international friendly
soccer tournament in Vigo, Spain on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jose Antonio Camacho's Spanish team came into the game on the
back of a 40-goal spree from seven successive European
Championship qualifying wins. However, their attack let them down
against the Brazilians as a host of early chances were missed,
with Real Madrid strike pair Fernando Morientes and Raul Gonzalez
profligate.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Morientes twice headed wide from close range, while
his Real Madrid strike partner Raul Gonzalez hit a post when well
placed.
</P>
<P>
Brazil offered little going forward, with Rivaldo having a
quiet game, and the closest they came to scoring were two long
shots from Marcos Assuncao and Cafu in the closing stages.
</P>
<P>
"We can't be disappointed with the performance," said Camacho.
"I'm just looking for the side to play well and create a lot of
chances. Sometimes you can play well and not win."

<HEADLINE> Jamaica Panel Judges Ottey Clear of Doping Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion
Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey was cleared of drug cheating
charges on Saturday by a panel of the Jamaica Amateur Athletics
Association (JAAA), according to reports from Kingston, Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
JAAA president Adrian Wallace, speaking on Radio Jamaica on
Saturday evening, said that the panel had decided that "Merlene
Ottey is not guilty of a doping offense".
</P>
<P>
Wallace said his organization would soon have a meeting to
discuss the panel's written decision, following which it would
pass on its findings to the International Amateur Athletics
Federation IAAF.
</P>
<P>
Ottey, who arrived in the island on Friday evening, met with
the eight-member JAAA panel amid tight security at the Hilton
Kingston Hotel.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old track star, the most decorated athlete in world
championship history, tested positive for the banned steroid
nandrolone at a July 5 grand prix meeting in Lucerne, Switzerland
That result was later confirmed when a second urine sample also
came up positive.
</P>
<P>
Ottey, who had denied taking banned substances, was assisted in
presenting her case by a team of lawyers and doctors.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is going to be how the panel came to its
decision. I'm sure the IAAF will want to know the details of how
they came to their decision," Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
The five-time Olympian, who has claimed seven Olympic medals,
reportedly has been tested close to 100 times during her long
career. The July test was her first positive result.

WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- American Lindsay Davenport
reached the final for the third consecutive year at the 520,000 U.
S. dollars Advanta Tennis Championships in Pennsylvania on
Saturday with an easy semi-final victory over her compatriot Venus
Williams.
</P>
<P>
Davenport set a showdown in Sunday's final with world number

World number two Davenport romped Williams 6-1, 6-2 from the

"That was one of the best matches I've served, probably," said
Davenport, who lost in the 1997 Advanta final to Hingis and in
1998 to Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
"When you're serving well, you can take chances, because all
the pressure is on her to hold her serve."
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Davenport will be playing in her seventh final
of 1999. She has a 5-1 record in her previous six finals this year,

BELGRADE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Ministry of

peacekeeping force KFOR to cooperate with the Yugoslav bureau of

the plane flying in Kosovo before the crash, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said KFOR totally ignored Yugoslavia's sovereignty and
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. KFOR obstructed
the Yugoslav bureau of navigation in the course of exercising its
duty and should be held wholly responsible for the crash, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Yugoslavia had more than once advised KFOR
to quickly establish a joint administration system with Yugoslavia,
but received no response.
</P>
<P>
It also said Yugoslavia was ready to take the responsibility
for the whole Yugoslavian territorial sky at any time.

WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian leaders and U.S.
diplomats Saturday vowed to meet goals of the 1995 Dayton Peace
Accords after a two-day private talks in Dayton, Ohio, where the
accords were signed.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, the participants recommended to
establish a commission to fight corruption, and accelerate the
economic development in Bosnia, an Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik and Bosnia Prime Minister
Edhem Bicakcic agreed to establish a joint anti-corruption group.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, U.S. Ambassador Robert Frowick
stressed that reducing corruption is essential to Bosnia becoming
economically self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
"Before we can get to this kind of self-sustainability,
corruption has to be rooted out and brought under control to the
maximum extent possible," Frowick was quoted as saying. "It has
been too rampant during the war and since then," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian government has lost millions of dollars and the
country's economy is still very weak despite a huge financial aid
from the international community. About 5.1 billion U.S. dollars
has been pledged for the reconstruction of the country.
</P>
<P>
The participants also suggested that Bosnia rebuild its economy
by focusing on the strengths of the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorian President Pledges to Eliminate Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian President Jamil
Mahuad said on Saturday that he will eliminate the country's
financial deficit by 2003, when his presidency concludes.
</P>
<P>
President Mahuad at the same time admitted that this year's
deficit will account for 4 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (
GDP).
</P>
<P>
Mahuad said that when he took office in August 1998, the
deficit was 7 percent of the GDP and threatened to rise to 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
Followed by a further reduction of deficit to 2.5 percent and 1.
5 percent of GDP in 2000 and 2001 respectively, his government
will manage to completely balance the budget in 2002, said Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that his government needs approval of the
proposed budget figures from the Congress to meet the targets for
a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
The Congress will discuss next week the budget project of 4.4
billion dollars, and according to Mahuad, there is a political
agreement in that forum to approve the state account.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad said that the approval of the budget is not only the
precondition of a 400 million U.S. dollar loan from the
International Monetary Fund, but also the access for more than one
billion dollars promised by other multilateral organizations.
</P>
<P>
He explained that if the Congress approves next week the budget,
the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) will grant the country a
first disbursement of 80 million dollars for a credit that will
relieve a big part of the country's debt.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador, in its worst economic crisis in decades, says it
cannot repay its 13 billion U.S. dollar debts, which take up more
than half of its annual budget.

" the report said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. consumers are empowered with types of information
previously unavailable to them, especially in areas of real estate,
the report said. What were proprietary databases only a few years
ago are now available to anyone 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, real estate professionals are becoming technological
savvy to be able to work efficiently and quickly with home buyers
and sellers. Since 1997, the number of the NAR members with
Internet access has risen from 26 percent to 71 percent of members.
Nine out of 10 realtors own or lease a computer. The association
has a membership of 750,000.
</P>
<P>
NAR surveys show the number of home buyers using the Internet
as a search tool has increased 20-fold, from only two percent in
1995 to 23 percent in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, three out of five realtors use e-mail
for their business; 72 percent of real estate firms generate at
least some of their business online while three percent generate
more than 20 percent of their business online; and nearly three
out of five real estate firms have a Web site.
</P>
<P>
But the NAR said that while the Internet can significantly
speed the transactions process, it cannot replace many of the
functions that realtors provide their customers. There are still
customers who are intimidated by technology and information
overload. Specialized skills and knowledge of neighborhoods and
government regulation, together with communication skills and the
ability to negotiate terms and conditions for a client's benefit,
mean the human element cannot be replaced, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that technology will complement but not
replace real estate professionals, and at the same time, real
estate brokers and agents must harness the forces of change to
meet the future needs of buyers and sellers.

<HEADLINE> Peru Losses One Fifth of Mountain Ice in 35 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Peru has lost one fifth of the
ice in its highest mountains in 35 years because of the climate
change, said a study of the National Environment Council (CONAM)
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The study shows the biggest glacier surface between the tropics
of Cancer and Capricorn of the world is in the Peruvian mountains,
which according to satellite images, has decreased by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said that Groggi, Uruashraju and Yanamarey glaciers in the
Blanca mountain range and the Santa Rosa in the Raura mountain
range have lost more than 188 million cubic meters of water
reserves in the last 50 years, which will affect the contribution
of water resources to the Santa and Huaral river basin.
</P>
<P>
All this is caused by the climate change originated in the
excessive increase of greenhouse effect, gases generated by the
burning of fossil fuels, like coal and mainly oil and in a lesser
measure by deforestation.
</P>
<P>
The most severe events foreseen for the next century because
the climate change are the reduction of biodiversity, the change
of the composition of 30 percent of the forests, the increase of
the temperature in the deserts and semiarid zones, and the
disappearance of 30 percent to 50 percent of the glacial mass,
among others equally serious effects, says the CONAM study.

<P>
HAVANA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Enrique Cardoso arrived here Saturday for the 9th Ibero-American
Summit to be held on November 15-16.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to pay an official visit to Cuba before the
summit and to start the visit with a private meeting with Cuban
President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian president and his Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe
Lampreia, coming from an informal forum on Latin American issues
in the Dominican Republic, were welcomed by President Fidel Castro
at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian president is the first leader coming here for the
Ibero-American summit, which will be attended by leaders and
foreign ministers from 21 Ibero-American countries.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio and Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo are expected to arrive later in the day and to be

</P>
<P>
The leaders are expected to discuss globalization among other
issues at the meeting aimed at promoting cooperation among
countries of the bloc, the Cuban news agency "Prensa Latina"
quoted Bolivian President Hugo Banzer Suarez as saying on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bolivian president, globalization has posed
threat to smaller economies rather than addressing their demands
and concerns.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called for the establishment of protection
mechanisms to prevent or limit the effects of any future financial
crisis in the region.

<HEADLINE> Late Penalty Lifts Turkey 1-1 Draw with Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A late penalty put Turkey a 1-1
draw with Ireland in their Euro 2000 play-off in Dublin, Ireland
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Robbie Keane's goal in 79th minute had lighted the hopes of the
Irish for a victory, but four minutes later midfielder Lee Carsley
pushed the ball away with his hand while lying on the pitch and
Swedish referee Anders Frisk had no hesitation pointing to the
spot.
</P>
<P>
Defender Tayfur Havutcu stroked his penalty past Ireland's
second-half substitute goalkeeper Dean Kiely for the draw and the
result put Turkey, runners-up to Germany in group three, firmly in
the driving seat.
</P>
<P>
With away goals counting double if the scores are level at the
match on Wednesday Ireland may come to regret Carsley's late
rushness.
</P>
<P>
Ireland had been seconds away from automatic qualification from
group eight before a last-minute Macedonian equalizer saw
Yugoslavia grab the top spot.
</P>
<P>
The Irish coach said: "We are disappointed with the result. But
we were playing a very good side."

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A research institute on the
famous Shaolin culture, which includes study of martial arts and
religious painting, has been set up in the Shaolin Temple near
Zhengzhou, capital of central China's Henan province.
</P>
<P>
The institute will conduct a series of research projects on
Shaolin culture, said Wen Yucheng, a famous Chinese archaeologist

<HEADLINE> Acimovic Stunner Keeps Slovenia's Euro 2000 Dream Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- An amazing 50 meter goal by
substitute Milenko Acimovic gave Slovenia a surprise 2-1 victory
over Ukraine in the first leg of their Euro 2000 play-off in
Ljubljana, Slovenia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With six minutes remaining Acimovic intercepted a clearance
from Ukraine keeper Olexander Shovkovsky and banged the ball all
the way back into the net as the keeper scrambled back to his goal
from near the touchline.
</P>
<P>
AC Milan striker Andrei Shevchenko had put hot favorites
Ukraine ahead in the 33rd minute when he cut in from the right and
fired home a left foot shot high in to the corner.
</P>
<P>
However, Zlatko Zahovic equalized 20 minutes later with a low
shot after Vytaly Kossovsky allowed a throw-in to roll under his
foot into the path of Slovenia's leading striker. It was his 20th
goal in 41 internationals..
</P>
<P>
Ukraine ended the match with nine men as Dmitry Parfenov was
sent off for a second bookable offense on the hour and Andriy
Gusin followed him in the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, who finished behind world champions France in their
qualifying group, were hot favorites and will still fancy their
chances of progressing.
</P>
<P>
"Slovenia absolutely deserved the victory, but I am not going
to comment on the second goal, it is something that rarely happens,
" Ukraine coach Josef Szabo said.
</P>
<P>
Slovenian coach Srecko Katanec said cautiously: "I am very well
aware of how narrow a victory this is," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is only the first half and despite playing very well
today we must keep our feet firmly on the ground until Wednesday,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Scholes Goals Help England Sink Scotland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Paul Scholes of Manchester
United broke Scottish hearts with a first half double strike at
Hampden Park Saturday afternoon to put England within touching
distance of the Euro 2000 Finals.
</P>
<P>
Scholes' expertly-taken efforts in the 21st and 41st minutes
have put Kevin Keegan's side firmly in control going into
Wednesday night's return at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
His finishing was the difference between the two old rivals and
Scotland had their chances, but failed to take them.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Gallacher and Michael Owen went close in the opening
minutes before Scholes put England in charge.
</P>
<P>
His first goal was created by Sol Campbell, who caught the eye
playing out of position at right-back, and the Tottenham defender
crossed for him to control the ball on his chest and then finish
right-footed past Neil Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
The Scots should have equalised a minute later when a mix-up
between Martin Keown and Paul Ince put Kevin Gallacher clean
through only for David Seaman to justify his selection ahead of
Nigel Martyn by making a great blocking save.
</P>
<P>
Scholes, who netted a hat-trick against Poland in March, struck
again just before half-time when he timed his run to perfection to
meet David Beckham's free-kick at the near post and nod home his
ninth international goal.
</P>
<P>
Again Scotland had a chance to score within a minute, but luck
was not with them.
</P>
<P>
Billy Dodds curled a beautiful shot over Seaman's head only for
the ball to come off the underside of the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
The scoreline might even have been worse for Scotland and
Scholes had a strong penalty appeal turned down just after the
interval when David Weir caught him in the area.
</P>
<P>
To complete Scotland's afternoon of woe Gallacher picked up a
booking, which rules him out of the second leg.
</P>
<P>
It was the 109th match of the "auld enemies", in which England
had 45 wins, Scotland 40 with 25 meetings drawn.
</P>
<P>
It was also the first time they had met at Hampden since 1989
when England also won 2-0, and their first meeting since England
beat Scotland 2-0 in Euro'96.
</P>
<P>
Keegan was delighted with the performance, especially of his
defenders. "We played fantastic today. The attitude all week has
been first class."
</P>
<P>
"Scholes has got everything. He is a very impressive player and
just because he doesn't talk a lot means he is probably one of
those whose actions speak louder than words.
</P>
<P>
"But Sol Campbell, Martin Keown, Tony Adams, Phil Neville -
when I looked through the team, everyone contributed and that was
why it was such a good performance.
</P>
<P>
"It's not over yet but there is a mountain for them to climb
now," said the manager.
</P>
<P>
Scotland manager Craig Brown said he thought the result
flattered England. "be 2-0 down at half-time. It was probably
slightly unfair."
</P>
<P>
Referring to obstructions by Tony Adams and Martin Keown on
Billy Dodds, he moaned: "We felt aggrieved not to get something
better in the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
"Our goalkeeper had nothing to save in the game and I think we
can go to Wembley and will be in the match if we get an early goal
we are in the match - we have always scored away goals in
difficult venues," he said.

<HEADLINE> Africa Can't Wait Longer For World Cup: Jordaan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Africa could no longer
wait on the world football governing body, FIFA, to offer it an
opportunity to host the world cup, the South African 2006 World
Cup Bid Committee said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The committee took its campaign to the Durban International
Conference Center where about 700 journalists gathered for the
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Our message is clear. We have the capacity, infrastructure and
organisational ability to host the World's greatest event in 2006,
" said bid committee chief executive officer, Danny Jordaan,
adding: "It is Africa's turn, and we are ready".
</P>
<P>
He said the Commonwealth leaders' gathering in Durban was a
reminder that "we live in a post-colonial world where Africa and
other developing nations can no longer be marginalised."
</P>
<P>
Awarding the world cup to South Africa would be a clear signal
of this new political and economic reality.
</P>
<P>
Jordaan said the economic and social legacy of the event in
this country would be enormous, as it would -- among others,
contribute 19.6 billion rand (6.5billion U.S. dollars) to the
Gross Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
It would further create 132000 new employment opportunities. "
It will provide an economic and symbolic focus for President (
Thabo) Mbeki's vision on an African Renaissance," said Jordaan.
</P>
<P>
The committee on Thursday held a meeting in Lesotho with sports
ministers from six neighbouring countries to stress the need for
their support, and to inform them of the benefits they would enjoy,
if South Africa won the bid.
</P>
<P>
Fifa will decide in July 2000 which country will host the event.

JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's dream of entering
in next year's European Championship finals had virtually ended
with a 0-5 disastrous defeat to Denmark in the first leg of their
play-off in Tel Aviv on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A second minute goal by Denmark's Jon Dahl Tomasson, who

Tomasson added his second goal 10 minutes before halftime.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel pick up their pace a little in the early stages
of the second half, the result was never in doubt once Israeli
midfield engine Haim Revivo got his red card and was sent off in

<HEADLINE> Greece Sends Rescue Team to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece Saturday sent a
25-member rescue team to Turkey to take part in the rescue effort
after a powerful earthquake registering 7.2 on the Richter scale
rocked the neighboring country Friday.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Greek medical staff, two mobile units, four earthquake
experts, four relief vehicles and three sniffer dogs also arrived
Saturday in the Turkish quake-stricken province of Bolu.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, which centered on the Turkish town of Duzce,
about 185 kilometers east of Istanbul, has left more than 269
people dead and hundreds injured.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the earthquake, Greece offered aid to Turkey, and
more medical aid will arrive in Turkey in coming days.
</P>
<P>
Strong earthquakes hit Turkey and Greece in August and
September respectively, and the rescue teams from the two
countries had rushed to the scene of the respective earthquakes to
help free people trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Their acts contributed to the improvement of the climate in
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In Athens Friday, the Greek and Turkish rescue teams received
this year's Abdi Ipekci prize for their acts in the earthquakes.

<HEADLINE> Adams Confident of Breakthrough in N.Irish Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams
said in Irish Republic capital of Dublin on Saturday that he was
confident a lasting peace would be cemented between Northern
Ireland's parties at last ditch talks on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to disclose the nature of reported new
concessions by Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas over their
disarmament, the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
Tight-lipped ahead of Monday's crucial meeting between the
pro-British Ulter Unionists and republican Sinn Fein on Monday,
Adams simply replied "Yes" when asked if he was confident an end
to 30 years of sectarian violence would be sealed.
</P>
<P>
Media reports have said the IRA offered an olive branch to
disarmament earlier this week in a bid to reconcile the majority
Protestant and minority Roman Catholic communities of
British-ruled Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
U.S. mediator George Mitchell, who has been chairing the peace
talks, warned both sides on Friday the talks were now in their
final and most critical stage.
</P>
<P>
In New York on Friday, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said
he would not ask Mitchell to extend his role as mediator in the
troubled Good Friday peace accord, but said he remained committed
to implementing the historic 1998 agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican rice producers
protested Saturday the import of 18,000 tons of rice from the
United States at a price lower than the local production.
</P>
<P>
The protest occurred in Caldera, the main port in the Pacific,
100 kilometers west of San Jose, where the grain shipment will
arrive Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The rice producers, supported by the opposition National
Liberation Party (PLN), called on the government to bar the
arrival of this cargo, saying the imports will cause bankruptcy of
14,000 local businessmen.
</P>
<P>
According to estimations, the price of imported rice could be
inferior to five dollars per quintal, compared to the nationally
produced grain, despite the application of a safeguard measure
that charges five percent to the import of the commodity to
protect the national product, and a 35 percent tariff.
</P>
<P>
President Minister Danilo Chaverri said he cannot bar the
arrival of this product, because rice imports have been liberated
since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Beats Holyfield to Unify Heavyweight Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Once again, Lennox Lewis
outboxed Evander Holyfield. This time, he came away the unified
heavyweight champion of the world.
</P>
<P>
In a rematch much better than their first encounter eight
months ago, Lewis posted a unanimous decision and added Holyfield'
s WBC and IBF titles to his own WBA belt on Saturday tonight in
Las Vegas, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Lewis won on all three judges' scorecards by
the margins of 115-113, 116-112 and 117-111. He improved to 35-1-1
and Holyfield fell to 36-4-1.
</P>
<P>
"I did all that I could," Holyfield said. "I wasn't judging the
fight. When things fall into the judges, the judges make a
decision as to who they want to give it to. I don't observe the
fight, I do all I can out there."
</P>
<P>
Relying on a consistent left jab, Lewis was able to keep
Holyfield at bay throughout much of the fight. He captured four of
the first five rounds and was never really in trouble at any point.
</P>
<P>
Much like their fight on March 13, which Lewis clearly
dominated but was forced to settle for a controversial draw, the 6-
5 Lewis was able to jab at will from the outside and used his
height advantage to tie Holyfield when necessary.
</P>
<P>
After a lackluster first round, Lewis began to take charge in
the second. Setting Holyfield up with the jab, he landed a big
right uppercut midway through the second. Lewis continued to peck
away at Holyfield and was able to land at will through the third,
fourth and fifth.
</P>
<P>
The crowd at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center began to grow restless in
the sixth round and Holyfield responded. Hoping to get inside, he
tried to bully Lewis and had his most success when in close.
</P>
<P>
The seventh round saw both fighters trade power punches in the
middle of the ring. Holyfield landed a strong right to the body
that buckled Lewis and was able to dig two uppercuts into the body.
In what was clearly Holyfield's best round of the fight, Lewis
closed the round by firing back just before the bell.
</P>
<P>
"He was able to come back when I was able to hit him with some
shots," Holyfield added. "I felt that I hurt him a few times and
he was able to rally back....I gave it all that I had today. The
fact is, when it fall into the judges hands, you get decisions."
</P>
<P>
Just as the momentum seemed to favor Holyfield, Lewis responded
with a strong eighth round. Using the jab, he was able to take
advantage of a tired Holyfield. Another very close round in the
ninth could have gone either way but Lewis positioned himself to
win by outboxing Holyfield in both the 10th and 11th.
</P>
<P>
"I was really concerned because he wasn't trying to do anything
at the beginning of the rounds, and trying to steal it at the end
of the round," Lewis said. "I didn't know what the judges are
looking for, so I was trying to bide my time and score punches at
the same time."
</P>
<P>
Holyfield put the pressure on in the 12th but a savvy Lewis
hung on at the right times and was able to avoid Holyfield's power
punches.
</P>
<P>
The victory put Lewis on a pedestal and should ease memories of
him claiming his first title after Riddick Bowe had dumped it in a
garbage can. He also should be able to erase memories of an
embarrassing second-round knockout at the hands of Oliver McCall
in September 1994.
</P>
<P>
The newly crowned champion has hinted at bringing the title
back to his native England and possibly facing the winner of next
week's Michael Grant-Andrew Golota bout.
</P>
<P>
"I think I went through some trials and tribulations and enough
people were trying to stop me," Lewis said. "The Americans didn't
want me to bring the titles over to Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, the money is big over here. I realize the casinos pay
big money. I may fight one fight over in Europe first and have
everyone have to come over there."
</P>
<P>
It marked the third straight time that Holyfield was forced to
go the distance. Unlike last time, when he appeared sluggish and
distant, Holyfield attempted to rise to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The fighters are expected to receive roughly $15 million each.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Huge Bells to Mark Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- China will make a huge set of
bells, the biggest of the kind, in a move to celebrate the arrival
of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The new set is named as "Zhonghua Hezhong" which means "Chinese
Bells of Harmony". The set will have three major parts -- "
niuzhong" (button bells), "yongzhong" and "bozhong" (large bells)
and will be arranged in echelon style, said sources from the
working group for making the new century bells of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"Bozhong", the main part of the Chinese bells of harmony, were
just finished in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The new "Bo" bells have 18 parts in all, with an average height
of one meter. The central bell has a weight of 340 kg.
</P>
<P>
"Bo" bells are made in five months by workers of three
companies including Wuhan Precision Foundry Co. Ltd. of Hubei
Province using both traditional techniques and modern high
technology.
</P>
<P>
The sources from Wuhan said that the new "Bo" bells have just
passed appraisal of experts and will soon be transported to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the Chinese bells of harmony will be placed
onto the rostrum of Tian An Men and will be rung on the start of
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
In addition to making the new bells, China has also built a
number of other projects to greet the new millennium, including a
rotating altar in the western part of Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Sub-clan Fighting Kills at Least One in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting broke out
late Saturday afternoon between rival militiamen in the natural
port of El-Ma'an, 30 kilometers northeast of Mogadishu, Somalia,
with at least one killed and more than 15 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, in which anti-tank B-10 guns, anti-aircraft heavy
machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and various other assault
rifles were used, took place between the Rer Matan and Warsangeli
subclans of the Abgal main clan loyal to faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
According to businessmen in the natural port, more than nine
battle wagons and nearly 120 heavily armed men from both sides
were involved in the fighting, which intensified after 17:00 local
time but died down when darkness befell.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting is not yet officially stated.
However, businessmen using the natural port at the time of the
conflict said the armed confrontation followed a serious dispute
between the owners of boats that transported imported goods from
the vessels to the main land and a major businessman, Hajji Abukar
Omar Addan.
</P>
<P>
Addan, one of the main backers of the recently announced
Islamic courts of North Mogadishu, also owns a large barge that
does the same job as that of the small boats. Therefore, the
fighting could easily be explained as a dispute over the control
of the natural seaport of El-Ma'an.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet known what would happen next, but the closure of
El-Ma'an would have a serious economical setback for the people of
North Mogadishu, businessmen said.
</P>
<P>
They said that if the trouble in El'Man continues, the business
communities of North Mogadishu would be forced to resort to the
Merca seaport under the control of Islamic militiamen supported by
businessmen in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
It is not only the natural port of El-Ma'an that is troubled,
but the whole area dominated by the Abgal clansmen of Mohamed is
plagued by rampant insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Two children and a woman were seriously wounded Saturday
morning when two rival groups from the Wa'aysleh subclan of Abgal
fought over a piece of land near the former main cemetery of
Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rate Drops to 2.78 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- After four weeks of steady
increase, India's inflation rate recorded a 0.17 percentage points
fall to 2.78 percent for the week ended on October 30, despite
marginal increase in the overall prices index.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve bank of India, the annual rate of
inflation, based on Wholesale Price Index (WPI), declined to 2.78
percent from 2.95 percent in the previous week, as against a high
of 8.64 during the corresponding week of the last year.
</P>
<P>
The drop in inflation rate was mainly on account of marginal
decline in the indices of food products and non-metallic mineral
products which fell 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate maintained an upward trend for the last four
successive weeks, following the hefty hike of 35 percent in diesel
prices.

In a statement, the ministry pointed out that the main cause
for the tragic crash in northern Kosovo last Friday was that the U.

government had neither been notified nor approved the plane flying
in Kosovo before the crash, the statement said. KFOR totally
ignored Yugoslavia's sovereignty and United Nations Security

<HEADLINE> Chops to Be Used in HK First District Councils Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- 30,000 "helping hands" will
be joining 10,000 government staff on November 28 to make the
first District Councils Election of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region a success, said a government press release
reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The "helping hands" are the chops to be provided to voters at
polling stations to mark their choices among the candidates in
their respective constituencies, the first of its kind ever used
in any election in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
About 2.28 million registered electors, who have to vote on
that day, will be requested to use the chops as the only means to
cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
Bearing a simple design of a tick, the chops, dressed in a
sharp but neutral color - the orange color, are however tasked
with an important mission to help reduce the number of invalid
votes and seed up the counting process.
</P>
<P>
So voting will be simple, easy and fun in the election on that
day. Each eligible voter going into a polling station will be
given a chop, which is attached to a pad, together with a ballot
paper.
</P>
<P>
What a voter needs to do is to stamp the chop in the circle
next to the name of the candidate of his (or her) choice in the
ballot paper, fold the ballot paper once and put it into the
ballot box afterwards.

<HEADLINE> Pollution in Tehran Exceeds Danger Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Air pollution in the Iranian
capital of Tehran exceeded the danger limits on Sunday morning
and would be worsened in the afternoon, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Weather Department announced in a report that the
density of the two air pollutants, the suspended particles and
carbon dioxide, exceeded the danger limits and other pollutants
were registered at high levels.
</P>
<P>
The department said that pollutants in the city would further
increase on Sunday with the possibility to grow as high as the
crisis limits.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian capital usually faces serious air pollution in
autumn and winter due to the reduced speed of wind blow and
increased number of travels in the city.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that 71.2 percent of the air pollution in Tehran
is created by motor vehicles, most of which are old and not
equipped with smog-control devices.
</P>
<P>
Over two million cars with an average life span of 20 years
travel in the capital city every day, which are mainly responsible
for the air pollution in Tehran, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Iranian traffic police announced an emergence
control on vehicles after serious air pollution forces schools
and universities to close down.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Major Lab for CTF Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 14 (Xinhua) -- China will soon build a major
state lab for the country's research in controlled thermonuclear
fusion, commonly known as CTF.
</P>
<P>
Details of the lab, including the location, are not announced,
but the new lab will be built on the basis of an existing
operational nuclear fusion experimental device -- a new system
from a modified HL-1 installation. The new system has been in
operation since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Chinese researchers have obtained a great number of physical
parameters and indexes from the experiments in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The new system is said to have met international advanced level
by a group of specialists who were specially organized in the past
several days to inspect the achievements in Chengdu, capital of
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
China's research in controlled nuclear fusion is expected to
enter a new stage with the operation of another nuclear fusion
experimental device -- Tokamak HL-2A, which is being built on the
outskirts of Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
Controlled thermonuclear fusion is thought to be a major energy
source for the future. Unlike fission, which leaves a large amount
of highly radioactive waste, fusion is similar to what happens
when the sun produces light and heat.
</P>
<P>
Tokamak HL-2A was a major overseas cooperation project using
equipment from Germany at the China National Nuclear Corporation's
Southwest Physics Research Institute, China's first and biggest
nuclear fusion experiment center.
</P>
<P>
China started work on controlled nuclear fusion in the 1950s
and developed the Tokamak HL-1 by its own efforts and put it into
operation at the institute in 1984, leading to improvements in
recent years. In 1994, a new system from a modified HL-1
installation was put into use for greater efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Despite the world recognized research results gained with the
help of existing equipment, Chinese researchers of controlled
nuclear fusion decided to build the more advanced Tokamak HL-2A
facility with German equipment, aiming to enhance their role in
the "sphere of nuclear fusion".

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Prepares to Replace Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid is preparing to get new candidates for
replacement of three ministers believed to have been involved in
the practices of corruption, collusion and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption should be fought from the highest level, then to
the lower level. Therefore, silently, I am preparing the
substitute for ministers," Wahid said in a meeting with Indonesian
students and citizens in Salt Lake City, the United States, on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian head of state, who is in the U.S. for medical
treatment of his poor eyesight, was accompanied by the Indonesian
Ambassador to the U.S. Dorodjatun Kuntjorodjakti.
</P>
<P>
Replying a question on how the new government will handle
corruption cases in Indonesia, Wahid was quoted by the Antara News
Agency Sunday as saying that corruption is happened as there is a
bargaining in the service, or license approval process.
</P>
<P>
The head of state insisted on the requirement that the
ministers in his cabinet be clean, modest and accepted by the
people.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a minister committing a crime, he should be
non-activated. While, if he proves to be guilty, he should be
replaced by another. And, I silently have prepared such
substitutes for the three ministers involved," he said without
identifying them.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Wahid said that he has ordered the attorney
general to investigate the three ministers who are allegedly
involved in corrupt, collusive and nepotistic practices in their
respective institutions.

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan's Airlines Chief Slams Ban on Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Chief of Afghanistan's
national airlines Ariana Mulla Mohammad Akhtar Mansoor Sunday
slammed the U.N. ban on the airlines from international flights,
saying the sanctions will affect its 1,700 employees worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"It is unjust and cruel to subject up to 20 million oppressed
Afghan population only for the sake of a single person (Osama bin
Laden)," Mansoor told the News Network International (NNI) of
Pakistan from southern Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-proposed sanctions were imposed by the U.N. Security
Council on November 14 to force the ruling Taliban to expel Osama
bin Laden, who is wanted by Washington on suspicion of involvement
in the bombings at two American embassies in Africa last year.
</P>
<P>
"The airlines was nothing to do with politics and was only
facilitating the people, who could not use land route to go and
come to Afghanistan as well as bringing dead bodies, medicines,
cargo and mail," Mansoor said.
</P>
<P>
After Ariana flights were banned from operating outside
Afghanistan, more than a million Afghans worldwide, including some
30,000 in the Arabian Gulf area will be affected.
</P>
<P>
With its three Boeing 727 aircraft, Ariana operates five weekly
flights between Dubai and Sharjah of the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) and Kabul and Kandahar of Afghanistan, carrying about 2,000
passengers per month.
</P>
<P>
The airlines forwarded most of the worldwide mail to
Afghanistan from UAE and dead bodies were brought to Afghanistan
free of cost because many Afghans want to bury their dead in their
homeland, according to Mansoor.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the U.N. Security Council will realize miseries of the
war-weary Afghans and will review its policy of sanctions on
Ariana," the airlines chief said.

BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Over 200 kinds of new naval
weapons have been tested for the Chinese Navy at an offshore
shooting range somewhere at sea, including a new-type anti-ship
missile that tested there early this month, according to military
sources.

warships, aircraft, missiles, and underwater and electronic
weaponry at the range.
</P>
<P>
This is the same location where China launched its first
coastal defensive missile, opened its first testing site for
warship-borne guns, and shot the first undersea rocket from a
nuclear-powered submarine.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, sailors and officers working at the shooting
range have made every effort to upgrade their equipment and
capability.
</P>
<P>
To date, the shooting range has introduced hundreds of advanced
types of equipment and a computerized system has been installed
there. Fiber optics are also in wide use there for communications.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 of the 1,700 achievements made at the shooting range
have been rewarded by the central government or the military
forces headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Bluetongue Hits Livestock In South India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Bluetongue, one of the most
feared viral diseases of sheep, had claimed more than 10,000 sheep
in the past three months in south India, the Press Trust of India
(PTI) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bluetongue was endemic to India and caused heavy losses
annually but this year's damage was the worst, PTI said, quoting
scientists at the Haryana Agricultural University (HAU) in Hisar,
164 kilometers northwest of here.
</P>
<P>
The disease caused losses over 300 million rupees (over 7
million U.S. dollars) in the southern state of Karnataka and
Andhra Pradesh in the last two years, said Gaya Prasad, head of
the Bluetongue Virus Laboratory in the Department of Veterinary
Microbiology at HAU.
</P>
<P>
Animals severely affected by bluetongue have high fever,
swelling of tongue and lips, salivation and frothing and
hemorrhage in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
The virus is present predominantly in sheep, while other
domestic cattle, goats and buffaloes act as its reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The virus is transmitted by the insect culicoides which breeds
in hot and humid climates, particularly near the edge of water
channels and ditches.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Diabetes Sufferers to Increase by Year 2025 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- People suffer from diabetes
mellitus worldwide may increase by the year 2025 from the current
number of 120 million to 140 million, the World Health
Organization (WHO) said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Much of this increase will occur in developing countries due to
population ageing, unhealthy diets, obesity and a sedentary
lifestyle, WHO said in a press release marking World Diabetes Day.
</P>
<P>
World Diabetes Day, created in 1991, is the primary global
alertness campaign of the diabetes world, aimed at raising public
awareness of the causes, symptoms, treatment and complications
associated with diabetes.
</P>
<P>
"By 2025, while most people with diabetes in developed
countries will be aged 65 years or more, in developing countries
most will be at the age of 45-64 and affected in their most
productive years," WHO said.
</P>
<P>
Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition, which develops when
the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or when the body
cannot use the insulin produced effectively. This causes a build-
up of glucose in the blood, which can seriously damage many body
organs, especially the blood vessels and nerves.
</P>
<P>
There are many ways of preventing diabetes or controlling its
progress, said WHO, adding that early diagnosis and treatment are
key factors, while public and professional awareness of the risk
factors and symptoms of diabetes is an important step towards its
prevention and control.

<HEADLINE> Japan Beats Philippines at Asian Women's Soccer Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ILOILO CITY, Philippines, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan
outclassed the host Philippines, 6-0, on Sunday to top Group C and
advance to the semifinals of the 12th Asian Women's Football
Championship at the Iloilo Stadium here.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese pounced on their foes from the start and never
gave the Pinay booters a chance to settle down, using all the
weapons in their arsenal to roar to their fourth straight victory
in the group.
</P>
<P>
Playing minus the intensity that marked its first two games,
the Philippine side took its second straight setback in three
outings.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan nosed out Thailand, 1-0, in the other match in
Barotac Nuevo for its second win in three games.
</P>
<P>
Japan joined defending champion China, which crushed Hong Kong,
China, 12-0, on Saturday to take first place in Group B, in the
crossover semifinals to be held in Bacolod on November 19.
</P>
<P>
Unlike their first two matches, the Philippines were sluggish
and looked like wooden figures as they completely allowed their
rivals to dominate the game.
</P>
<P>
Mito Isaka broke through the Philippine defense in the 10th
minute to volley in the first goal from 20 feet from the right
wing and added another marker six minutes later almost from the
same spot off a ball deflection to put Japan ahead 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Just about the only active players for the home squad were Fil-
Am sweeper Karem Esteva and goalie Llevelyn Llorente who had their
work cut out for them as they struggled to foil Japan's repeated
forays.
</P>
<P>
Veteran forwards Josephine Lloren and Sheila Barlovento were
hardly a factor in the first half as they virtually stood still
and seldom challenged the Japanese defense.
</P>
<P>
Starting where it left off, Japan jumped the gun with Yasuyo
Yamagishi scoring on a booming 30-yarder with just 45 seconds onto
the second half.
</P>
<P>
Teammate Mai Aizawa then added the fourth marker on a breakaway,
going one-on-one with Llorente to slot the ball in from the right
flank in the 52nd.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by Ayumi Hara's 63rd minute strike as she
slipped past three Philippine defenders and Llorente, who strayed
a bit too far from the net, to ram in the ball from point blank.
</P>
<P>
The only clear Philippine try came courtesy of Barlovento in
the 67th after the ball glanced off Japanese Goalie Nozomi Yamago,
but her shot from 40 feet sailed way over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
Isaka scored Japan's last goal on a follow-up during a goal
scramble in the 71st to complete a hat-trick.
</P>
<P>
In the match between Uzbekistan and Thailand, striker Nargiza
Abdurasulova knocked in the winning marker for Uzbekistan in the
84th minute.

KUWAIT CITY, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Secretary General
of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil Al-Hujailan is
expected to brief Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani
on the preparations of the 20th summit of the bloc.
</P>
<P>
Jamil Al-Hujailan arrived in Doha, Qatar on Sunday for a visit
to the country within a tour to GCC member states. He had already
traveled to Oman, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
</P>
<P>
GCC's 20th summit is due in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on
November 27.
</P>
<P>
The GCC chief will also brief Sheikh Hamad on the main issues
the GCC foreign ministers, who met in Riyadh last Sunday, decided
to submit to the GCC leaders for consultations, according to the
Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance established
in 1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The GCC leaders, during their last meeting held in Abu
Dhabi, the UAE last December, vowed to realize aspiration of
their peoples and boost inter-GCC cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Economic issues and regional security are likely to top the
agenda of the Riyadh's summit.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Belt Controversy Mars Lewis Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- One of the belts won by
undisputed heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis has not been handed
over in a disagreement about fees, according to the BBC report on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lewis was set to retain his World Boxing Council title and add
Holyfield's World Boxing Association and International Boxing
Federation belts to his haul.
</P>
<P>
But the 300,000 U.S. dollars cheque covering the IBF
sanctioning fee was rejected just before the rematch, technically
leaving the title vacant.
</P>
<P>
IBF president Bob Lee, who is under indictment for allegedly
accepting money to fix fighters' rankings, gave no reason for the
decision.
</P>
<P>
However, Holyfield made no reference to the dispute over the
belt and it seems unlikely anyone will contest Lewis's claim to be
the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.
</P>
<P>
The British fighter scored a unanimous points victory over the
Holyfield in Saturday's rematch of their controversial first bout,
staged in New York last March.
</P>
<P>
The first fight was judged to be a draw, when most observers
would have handed Lewis a clear points win.

<HEADLINE> Angry People Storm U.N. Office in Afghan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of protesters
Sunday broke into a U.N. office in the Afghan capital of Kabul and
marched on the streets to protest against the U.N. sanctions
against Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The protesters swarmed into Kabul's streets burning U.S. flags
and shouting anti-American slogans. The demonstration started
within hours of the U.N. sanctions taking effect, reports reaching
here from Kabul said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban soldiers fired automatic rifles in the air in a bid to
stop the protesters from storming the U.N. office building, the
reports quoted witnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban also tried to prevent the protesters from reaching
the U.S. embassy, but after 10 minutes the crowd marched forward.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were chanting slogans "Osama is a great
Muslim," "Death to America," said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council passed a U.S.-proposed resolution on
October 15, giving the Taliban one month to hand over the alleged
terrorist, Osama bin Laden. Otherwise, financial sanctions will be
imposed against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, however, have rejected the U.N. resolution, saying
the U.N. action is "unfair." The Taliban also said that "these
sanctions will hurt only the Afghan people who have already been
plunged into plenty of problems."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions started last night for the Taliban failed to
hand over Osama who is reported to be living in Taliban-controlled
area within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Kabul said that there was no immediate noticeable
change, although the state-run Ariana Airways was now banned from
flying outside the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
A senior Taliban spokesman said Sunday in Kandahar, the Taliban
headquarters, that the U.N. sanctions would have little impact on
the Afghans.
</P>
<P>
"The 20-year war has ruined Afghanistan and we do not have
official trade with foreign world," he was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Elephant Population Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's elephant
population has increased significantly over the past nine years
due to successful implementation of a series of management plans,
local media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Anne Lema, an education officer from the Tanzania Wildlife
Research Institute (TAWIRI), was quoted by the Guardian newspaper
as saying that an aerial survey taken in most parts of the country
shows trends of increasing elephant population in all areas and
even recolonization of areas where they have been wiped out.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Selous Game Reserve in the southeast of the country
as an example, the officer said the elephant population in the
reserve had increased from 52,000 in 1994 to about 60,000 until
last October, making it the leading protected area with the
largest number of elephants in the world.
</P>
<P>
The reserve had an elephant population of 110,000 in 1976, but
it decreased to the lowest mark in 1990, with only 35,000
elephants living in the area, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that in some protected areas, the elephant population
was once reduced to only 25 percent of the peak number or even
completely wiped out.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the elephant population, according to Lema, is
attributed to good management plans instituted by the government
and the international community in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government ratified in 1989 the Convention in
International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora
(CITES), which forbids any trade of elephant or elephant products.
</P>
<P>
The internal management measures include the elephant
conservation program carried out on a country-wide basis in 1991
and the Operation Uhai in which many poachers were arrested and a
large number of weapons used to kill animals were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from TAWIRI show that elephants inhabited almost 90
percent of Tanzania mainland until the 1950s, but by the 1980s,
their habitat areas had shrunk to less than 50 percent of the
country, mostly in the south.

forefront of the struggle against the notorious Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
The Party's grassroots units have played an important role
during the recent decisive battle against Falun Gong, says the
paper.
</P>
<P>
To win the decisive victory over Falun Gong, these units should
further channel their energy to become the leading force at the
grassroots level in the battle against the cult.
</P>
<P>
It requires political awareness and a sense of responsibility
to be good leaders leading the struggle, the paper stresses.
</P>
<P>
It also urges the grassroots units to further understand the
nature of the cult of anti-science, anti-humanity, anti-society
and anti-government, saying that the struggle is a serious,
political one, on which the destiny of the Party and China hinges.
</P>
<P>
"The units ... should further strengthen and improve their
ideological work and do a good job in educating the great majority
of Falun Gong practitioners so as to isolate and strike blows at
the very small number of die-hards followers," the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Grassroots units should be depended on to organize the struggle
against the cult, repair damage it has caused, and solve the
issues brought about by the cult, it says.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Diabetes Patients Spend Big Bucks for Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- About 50 million Chinese have
diabetes and are paying more than 170 billion yuan (20 billion U.S.
dollars) every year for treatment, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted among 40,000 urban and rural residents in
11 provinces and municipalities across China, found that Chinese
diabetes morbidity rate rose from 0.67 percent in 1980 to the
current 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that China has more than 20 million diabetics
at the age of above 20 years. About 30 million Chinese suffer from
impaired glucose tolerance, an early stage of diabetes, according
to Li Tianlin, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Preventive
Medicine (CAPM).
</P>
<P>
"Some 170 billion yuan in annual medical expenditures of the
patients undoubtedly pose a heavy burden on the government," said
Li, from the CAPM's Diabetes and Other Noncommunicable Diseases
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Diabetes and its related complications has ranked as one of the
major health risks in China, following cancer, and cardiovascular
and cerebral diseases, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that lots of Chinese are not diagnosed and
given early treatment because they aren't educated about the
problem or have taken no steps to prevent it," Li said, adding
that the morbidity rate will not drop for 50 years.

NEW DELHI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers continued to fish
out bodies and carcasses from flooded paddy fields in the coastal
belt of the cyclone-devastated Orissa as the death toll has
increased to 9,504 till Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Reports of sporadic cases of cholera caused alarm in the state
administration as some of the samples of stool taken for
examination were found to be positive on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted a state health official
as saying that 32 of 60 fecal samples collected from three
districts were found to be positive and 35 diarrhea deaths had
been reported in the affected districts.
</P>
<P>
The official asserted that there was no cause for panic and the
situation was under strong surveillance to ensure that it would
not become an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said the Orissa authorities have
mobilized over 800 doctors into services in areas devastated by
the cyclone and floods that followed.

industries along the coastal belt.
</P>
<P>
Subrat Ray, chairman of eastern region chapter of the
Confederation of Indian Industry, told the Indian Express
Saturday: "The setback in terms of infrastructure is about 20

The loss to small, medium and large-scale industries along the
east coast were estimated around 5 billion rupees (approximately
117 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
Local officials have appealed to the central government to
declare an interest holiday for at least one year in loans from
commercial banks and other financial institutions and set a target
for repayment.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, fresh working capital should be pumped into the
affected units to enable them to start operations within a period
of 60 to 90 days.
</P>
<P>
The state has asked the central government to provide some 25
billion rupees (583 million dollars) as central assistance for

KUWAIT CITY, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad
Bin Khalifa Al-Thani received a letter Sunday from President of
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nuhyan
on bilateral ties and regional issues of common interest.
</P>
<P>
The message was conveyed by UAE Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nuhyan, who arrived in Doha,
capital of Qatar, earlier in the day on a whirlwind visit, the
Kuwait News Agency reported, without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
The visit came less than two weeks before a summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC), which is to be held in the Saudi
capital Riyadh on November 27.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the GCC member states -- Bahrain, Kuwait,
Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE -- used to launch their
customary shuttle diplomacy within the alliance ahead of a GCC
summit in attempts to drum up support for their own causes or
coordinate stances over important GCC issues.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, which is locked in a territorial dispute with Iran, is
counting on a clear and firm support from other GCC states.
</P>
<P>
Qatar is member of tripartite GCC committee, which is charged
with mapping out a mechanism for a peaceful solution to the
UAE-Iranian dispute over the strategic Gulf islands of Abu Mussa
and Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Kuwaiti Minister of State for Foreign Affairs
Sulaiman Majid Al-Shaheen flied to Riyadh for a short visit, and

<P>
SHENYANG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Major railways and
expressways in northwest China's Liaoning Province remained open
today despite slippery conditions from the winter's first heavy
snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
Local meteorologists said today's snowstorm was the earliest of
any winter in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
"On average, it snowed nine centimeters a day today across
Liaoning," said a local meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
Bao Sixue, head of North Shenyang Railway Station, said trains
leaving and arriving Shenyang operated on schedule today, thanks
to the work of about 500 people to sweep snow off of 340 rail
points in the city, the biggest communications hub in the
northeast.
</P>
<P>
Yang Changchun, director of the Liaoning Province Expressway
Bureau, said six expressways totaling 887 km in the province also
remained open today. More than 150 snow blowers were used to clear
the roads, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 150 tons of salt were used on the expressways.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Headquarters to Remain in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, South Africa, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The headquarters
of the 54- member Commonwealth would remain in London for the
foreseeable future for practical reasons, outgoing
Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a pre-recorded interview on South African Broadcasting
Corporation's newsmaker program, Anyaoku said he believed that
Marlborough House in London would remain the headquarters for some
time as most Commonwealth countries had diplomatic representation
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Forty-six of the member countries are represented in London,
Anyaoku said, noting that London is also centrally located for the
Commonwealth countries of the East and the West.
</P>
<P>
An independent British think-tank, the British Policy Center,
has suggested that the secretariat should move to either Cape Town
or New Delhi, fuelling rumors that if the Commonwealth
headquarters were based in South Africa this would give President
Thabo Mbeki an excuse to move the parliament to Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
However, this has been denied by the president's office.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku will retire in April 2000 and be succeeded by New
Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The African National
Congress (ANC) and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leadership Sunday
urged their supporters to preserve the peace they had yearned for
so long.
</P>
<P>
They made the call while attending the funeral of slain ANC
councillor and KwaZulu-Natal royal family member Prince Cyril
Zulu, which took place in Nongoma in Northern KwaZulu-Natal, an
IFP stronghold, but his coffin was draped with the ANC's green,
gold and black flag, according to the South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
IFP and ANC dignitaries, including former President Nelson
Mandela and Public Enterprises Minister Jeff Radebe, attended the
funeral.
</P>
<P>
Both parties have lost thousands of supporters in political
violence lasting more than a decade in KwaZulu-Natal because of
rivalry between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The leadership of both parties signed a peace pact just before
the June 2 election, in which they committed themselves to
ensuring a peaceful co- existence among their supporters.
</P>
<P>
This agreement has been tested on many occasions, highlighted
most recently by the fatal attack on Zulu in Lamontville at the
beginning of this month, which sparked claims that his death was a
political assassination.
</P>
<P>
Both parties' leadership, speaking at the Sunday funeral,
reiterated the importance of not pointing fingers until the law
took its course.

<P>
Some 500 companies from over 30 countries are participating in
the Dubai 2000 aerospace exhibition, which was opened on Sunday at

20 years.

maintaining our leadership position in the Middle East, and
creating superior value for our customers by offering the most
complete line of products and services," said Mark Cooper, Boeing
regional communications director.

that carriers in the Middle East and North Africa will acquire
620 aircraft worth some 50 billion U.S. dollars by 2018, and said
it aims to win at least half of this market.
</P>

that cults like Falun Gong should be banned and punished according
to law, as Falun Gong spreads superstition, disturbs social order,
and some practitioners have gone so far as to steal state secrets
and plot to subvert the central government.
</P>
<P>
Teachers from Hangzhou Business College said China's struggle
against Falun Gong is an ideological as well as a serious
political fight, because the cult led by Li Hongzhi has committed
crimes that go against science, society, humankind, and the
government.
</P>
<P>
A teacher from Zhejiang Finance and Economics College called
for efforts to boost education in faith and ideology, saying that
Falun Gong represents a problem of belief among some people in the
community.
