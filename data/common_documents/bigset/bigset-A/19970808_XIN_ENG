<HEADLINE> Japan to Cut Defense Equipment Spending Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Defense Agency plans to
slash spending on major defense equipment by about 5 percent in
fiscal 1998 to maintain zero growth in overall defense spending,
Kyodo News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The cut will translate into a reduction of some 40 billion yen
(339 million U.S. dollars) from the 841 billion yen (7.1 billion
dollars) budgeted on equipment spending in fiscal 1997, the
report quoted Defense Agency sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a decision by the Japanese government in
June to rein in growth in defense expenditure and to cut spending
on key equipment by 920 billion yen (7.8 billion dollars) over the
fiscal 1998-2000 period as part of efforts to balance the state
budget.
</P>
<P>
Besides major equipment, the agency will also cut spending on
logistics facilities, training and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
To further curtail costs, the agency will shift purchases from
special defense-designed sources to the general market.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the agency decided to slash the so-called sympathy
outlays given to United States troops in Japan over the next three
years. The cut will be the first since Japan began to partially cover
such costs in 1978.

ISLAMABAD, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia today insisted that they would not enter into negotiations
with rival factions unless the militia's prisoners of war are
released.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's deputy foreign minister, Abdul Jaleel, said the
Taliban want some confidence-building measures in the form of
release of prisoners before they could begin meaningful peace
talks with the rival northern alliance, according to reports
monitored here today.
</P>
<P>
"The northern alliance leaders should create an atmosphere of
mutual trust to make talks meaningful and substantive," Jaleel
said after a meeting with U.N. Special Envoy Norber Holl in
Kandahar, about 450 km southwest of the capital Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance, based in Mazar-e-Sharif and led
mainly by Afghanistan's former military chief Ahmad Masood and
Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik, has refused the Taliban's such demand.
</P>
<P>
The northern alliance would not release any Taliban's prisoners
before a negotiated settlement of the Afghan conflict, Malik said
on Tuesday after talks with Holl in Mazar-e-Sharif, around 300 km
northwest of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance has demanded the demilitarization of
Kabul before they could agree to a ceasefire, while the Taliban
have laid the release of their prisoners as a pre-condition for
entering into peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Turkmenistan Push for Talks on Caspian Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Turkmenistan's President Saparmurat Niyazov today called on
the Caspian countries to speed up negotiations over the disputed
oil fields in the Caspian Sea, Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting here today, the two presidents said that the five
littoral states - Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and
Iran - should accelerate negotiations on the legal status of
the oil-rich Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that their foreign ministries should quickly work
on a draft treaty defining the Caspian Sea's status, Yelstin's
press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov said he appreciated Russian oil companies' withdrawal
from a one billion dollar deal with Azerbaijan's state oil company
to develop the disputed Kyapaz offshore oil and gas field, which
Turkmenistan also claims.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told Niyazov that the accord had been signed "without
consultation with the government and president" and had been since
annulled.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also agreed to resume work on a joint
Russian-Turkmen gas company and to cooperate closely in the world
gas market.
</P>
<P>
The countries bordering the Caspian Sea are divided over the
ownership of the resources in the sea, with Russia insisting five
countries share the resources and the others arguing that each
country should exploit fields lying within the waters off its coast.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A French court in Bordeaux today
decided to put former Gaullist minister and suspected Nazi
collaborator Maurice Papon under judicial control, in preparation
for his trial which will begin on October 8.
</P>
<P>
Papon was accused of "crimes against humanity" by
collaborating with German Nazis in deporting 1,560 Jews --
including many children -- to Nazi death camps, when he was
secretary general of the Gironde prefecture under the Vichy
collaboration regime from 1942 to 1944.
</P>
<P>
Under the measure which is aimed at preventing him from
escaping, Papon was forbidden to leave France, was ordered to hand
over his identity card and passport, and was ordered to pre-inform
his destinations before traveling out of Paris.
</P>
<P>
The request to put Papon under judicial control was first
presented by the lawyer of the Association of the Sons and
Daughters of the Deported Jews of France, Arno Klarsfeld, and was
supported by the public prosecutor of Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
Papon will be the second Frenchman to be tried for crimes
against humanity after former Lyon militia chief Paul Touvier was
convicted of the crime in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women's Volleyball Team Aims at Olympics: Lang Ping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- "In participating in this year's
World Volleyball Grand Prix, we aim at the 2000 Olympic Games in
Sydney," Lang Ping, head coach of the Chinese national women's
volleyball team, said in Macao on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spiker-turned-coach brought her team to Macao after a fresh
reshuffle, which was the first since they won the silver medal in
last year's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Macao is the opening stage of the five-stage preliminary rounds
of the three-day World Grand Prix series, which starts on Friday
and draws four teams including China, Russia, Italy and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Lang said at a press conference that the Grand Prix offers a
good chance for the five new recruits of her team, who average
19.8 years in age and 1.82 meters in height.
</P>
<P>
The head coach admitted that in doing so, she hopes to lift the
team's spiking power and efficiency in blocking.
</P>
<P>
Also on the team are such Olympic stars as Lai Yawen, Wu
Yongmei and Sun Yue.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have an edge over others now. We have to make every
effort trying to edge our way into the grand final," Lang said.
</P>
<P>
The American team also came out brand new, with 10 out of the
12-strong line-up being new faces. The United States finished a
poor seventh at last year's Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Team coach Mick Haley said it is really a new and young team,
but they might have a different style.
</P>
<P>
Russia, fourth at the Atlanta Olympics, showed up with almost
the same side as at the Olympics. "Our goal is to be among the
top four of this year's Grand Prix," said veteran Russian coach
Nicolai Karpol.
</P>
<P>
Italian team's coach Julio Velasco said his team needed time to
be well-coordinated in the game as they also include some new
players.
</P>
<P>
This year's World Grand Prix includes preliminary stages in
Macao, Seoul, Taipei, Hong Kong and Gifu of Japan, before the
tournament going into the grand final slated for August 29-31 in
Kobe.
</P>
<P>
The opening-day's fixtures in the Macao stage see United States
face Russia and China play Italy.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 21 non-aligned countries
restated here today a proposal for the establishment of a negotiating
committee on nuclear disarmament within the Conference on Disarmament
(CD).
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the group at the CD plenary, Ejoh Abuah,
representative of Nigeria, said the non-aligned countries placed the
highest priority on the issue of nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
They regretted that its proposals on June 5, 1997 for an ad hoc
committee on nuclear disarmament had been rejected out of hand as
inappropriate by certain delegations, he added.
</P>
<P>
In those proposals, the group recalled its suggestion for the
re-establishment of ad hoc committees on the prevention of an arms
race in outer space and on effective international arrangements to
assure non-nuclear-weapon states against the use or threat of use
of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Certain delegations had asked for time to obtain instructions from
their competent authorities in that regard," Abuah said. "The group
would now wish to be able to benefit from those instructions, which
should have been received by now, so that work on those committees
could go forward."
</P>
<P>
The call for the establishment of an ad hoc committee on nuclear
disarmament was echoed by representatives of Cameroon and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The CD is yet to find agreement on a program of work for its 1997
session. It will have another plenary on August 14.

<P>
ATHENS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Annarita Sidoti of Italy led all the
way home to win the women's 10,000-meter walk gold medal at the 6th
World Athletics Championships here today.
</P>
<P>
Her winning time was 42 minutes 55.49 seconds, a world best this
season. World Cup silver medal winner Olimpiada Ivanova of Russia
finished second in 43:07.63 and Olga Kardopoltseva of Belarus took the
bronze in 43:30.20. It is the first gold for Italy at the current
meet.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion and world silver medallist Yelena Nikolayeva of
Russia finished a poor 10th, and World Cup winner Irina Stankina of
Russia disqualified during the race.
</P>
<P>
Sidoti, the fourth fastest walker this year behind the three
Russian entrants, set a fast pace from the start and passed the first
5,000 meters with only Ivanova and Stankina hanging tough in her wake.
</P>
<P>
With 11 laps to go, the small Italian leader changed to a higher
gear to drop Ivanova 10 meters behind. The following four laps saw
Stankina, the world leader this year, walk closely at Sidoti's heels,
waiting chance to overtake her.
</P>
<P>
But Stankina got three warnings in a row within the next 400 meters
and had to quit the battle.
</P>
<P>
Sidoti met no challenge in the remaining distance, heading home for
a surprised victory.

WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno Thursday said she would at least keep an open mind when she
reads a commission's recommendation to abolish the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) and reassign its functions to other
agencies.
</P>
<P>
But Reno said her natural inclination works against "taking
things apart."
</P>
<P>
The report containing the recommendation by the U.S. Commission
on Immigration Reform is due out next month.
</P>
<P>
At her weekly news conference in the Justice Department, Reno
said, "We will obviously keep an open mind..."
</P>
<P>
"My sense is...that things don't get solved by taking them
apart and putting them back together again, she added.
</P>
<P>
Reno said INS has done "an incredible job with limited
resources," adding, "at the same time, we need to read the
report."
</P>
<P>
Reno intends to look carefully at the commission's
recommendations and will not dismiss them out of hand, according
to department officials.
</P>
<P>
Republican lawmakers have criticized INS with regard to its
efforts to protect U.S. borders and keep illegal aliens out of the
country. But Administration officials have defended progress at
INS.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Criticises Strike by Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today criticised teachers going on a strike for
salary increase, saying he appreciated their concerns but did not
believe in action that disputed schooling.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks at a media briefing after a two-hour
meeting with the Federation of Unions of South Africa (FEDUSA) in
Northcliff, Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of members of the South African Democratic
Teachers Union (SADTU) began a two-day nationwide strike on
Wednesday, demanding for a salary increase of up to nine percent.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said: "I would have expected them to appreciate the
problems of the government. We have been in government for three
years and have been working on improving the education system."
</P>
<P>
It was just unfortunate that a section of teachers believe
they can just press for demands without appreciating what the
government has been doing, he said.
</P>
<P>
He praised FEDUSA for it playing a pivotal role in building
the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
SADTU has threatened to ballot its 160,000 members for an
indefinite strike unless the government approved a nine percent
salary increase for teachers.

<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- France today hailed the
authorization by the United Nations Security Council allowing six
African states to continue a peace-keeping operation in the
Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council authorized on Wednesday the
continuation of the peace-keeping mission being conducted by
Burkina Faso, Gabon, Mali, Chad, Senegal and Togo in Bangui, the
capital of the Central African Republic which has been troubled by
a series of mutinies over the past one year.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also authorized these countries and
France, which is providing logistical support to them, to resort
to the use of force to ensure the security and freedom of movement
of their personnel.
</P>
<P>
"The experience of the MISAB shows the determining role that
the African capacities can play to benefit peace," said French
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Created in January 1997, the peace-keeping operation, formally
called Inter-African Mission of the Bangui Agreements (MISAB), is
aimed at helping restore peace in Central African Republic, and
supervising the surrender of arms by the former mutineers.
</P>
<P>
"In this spirit, France, in close collaboration with Britain
and the United States, puts into place a partnership (with MISAB
participants) aimed at reinforcing, in terms of training and
logistics, the capacities of the African countries," said the
French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
France announced last week the closure of the Bouar military
base in the Central African Republic, and plans to gradually
withdraw the rest of its 1,400 troops stationed in the country.

GENEVA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of two Cypriot communities
will resume their face-to-face talks on August 11 in a Swiss town,
according to a press release issued today by the United Nation
Office at Geneva (UNOG).
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus talks under the auspices of the United Nations were
opened by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on July 9 in Troutbeck,
New York. The talks between the leader of the Greek Cypriot
community, Glafkos Clerides, and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot
community, Rauf Denktash, are aimed at achieving a peaceful
solution to the Cyprus problem. The objective is for the parties
to craft new constitutional and institutional structures which
would allow the people of both Cypriot communities to live
together in peace.
</P>
<P>
The talks in Glion-sur-Montreux, about 100 kilometers east of
Geneva, are the second round in that process. In a statement to
the press on July 14, the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General
on Cyprus, Diego Cordovez, said that he expected that the second
phase would be a "defining moment". Cordovez said that the leaders
had taken back to Cyprus for discussion suggestions about the
modalities for a sustained negotiating process, which would begin
after the elections in Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Continue Export of Arms: Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG,August 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will continue
its arms deals with Middle East countries, Defense Minister Joe
Modise said in a press conference in Pretoria today.
</P>
<P>
Joe Modise said South Africa was in danger of losing two major
arms deals because details about the countries involved had been
published in the media.
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper last weekend reported that South Africa's
state-owned arms manufacturer, Denel, was finalizing a major
contract for the sale of sophisticated artillery pieces and
anti-aircraft systems to a Middle East country.
</P>
<P>
In doing so, the newspaper ignored an interdict obtained by
Denel to prohibit the paper from publishing the name of the
country involved. According to the newspaper, the country is
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he intended to visit the client countries in
a bid to save the deals.
</P>
<P>
Asked which countries he was referring to, he said: "I will
not confirm anything. Enough damage has been done."
</P>
<P>
Modise said he felt ashamed that client confidentiality had
been broken in South Africa, adding he feared the countries
involved might decide to refuse him a visa.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa might lose billions of Rand and thousands of job
opportunities as a result," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Denel's Acting Managing Director Seshi Chongo told the press
today that last year his company generated a turn-over of 666
million U.S. Dollars. It showed a net profit of 84.2 million U.S.
Dollars, of which 22.2 million was declared as dividend in favor
of the state, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the company's exports accounted for 30 percent of its
revenue, compared with 16 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Export markets are therefore critical to Denel's business, and
the company hoped to expand its international market by 20
percent a year, said the director.

PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- France today deplored the signing
of an "association agreement" by Turkey and the self-declared
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" which calls for the
partial integration of northern Cyprus into Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"We think that the association agreement signed by Turkey and
the representatives of the Turkish community of Cyprus goes
against the efforts deployed in the search for a negotiated
solution," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into two parts after Turkish troops invaded
the island in 1974 following a coup d'etat in Nicosia staged by
Greek Cypriot nationalists supported by Greece.
</P>
<P>
"France wishes the reunification of Cyprus in the framework of
a federation uniting two regions and two communities, in
conformity with the resolutions of the United Nations Security
Council," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots will
begin meeting in Switzerland next week to find a solution to the
division of the island.

ATHENS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Marie-Jose Perec of France pulled out
of the women's 200 meters semifinals at the 6th World Athletics
Championships here today.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic champion didn't make a start in the first group for
unknown reasons. Perec, who took both the 200m and 400m golds at
Atlanta Games last year, and announced that she wouldn't take part in
the current meet due to poor condition, changed her mind later just
shortly before the meet. She had competed in the first and second
rounds in a good form.
</P>
<P>
With the absence of Perec, Merlene Ottey of Jamaica, defending
champion in the 200 meters, has a very good chance to retain the world
title.
</P>
<P>
In the second group minutes earlier, the 37-year-old Ottey romped
home in style to clock the fastest time of the day in 22.26 seconds,
the world second best this year.
</P>
<P>
Ottey, who finished a disappointed 7th in the 100 meters on August
3, eased her speed obviously in the final 50 meters today, but the
time is much faster than the 22.47 clocking, her best this year before
the race.

Kenya's main airports ended their five-day go-slow this morning
after reaching an agreement with the government.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is back to normal. We have explained what the
government is trying to do and they (controllers) have understood
and cooperated," Kenyan Labor Minister Philip Masinde told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
He failed to reveal details of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The air traffic controllers started their go-slow at midnight
on Friday in the capital Nairobi, the Indian Ocean port of
Mombasa, Kisumu ashore Lake Victoria and Malindi, 125 kilometers
north of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
However, the controllers here were quoted by a local source as
saying that they were assured that a report on their working
conditions had been presented to President Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
The controllers asked the authorities to raise their monthly
pay by 50 folds from about 90 U.S. Dollars to almost 5,000
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"They are asking too enormous a figure," and their demand thus
can not be met by the government, a senior official at Nairobi's
Jomo Kenyatta International Airport told Xinhua on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official also denied any relation between the go-slow of
the airport staff and the national strike set for Friday, saying
Kenyan airport staff launch go-slow almost every year. The
lastest one lasted also just a few days in December, 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the go-slow, flights into Kenya were delayed in the sky
for one to two hours before they were allowed to land. Departing
flights had been delayed for anywhere between three and 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that about 40 airlines use Kenyan airports,
bringing the country millions of Dollars in annual revenue.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Hits Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Shilling hit a record
low against the U.S. Dollar today, a day before the planned
nationwide strike called by the opposition for pressing for
constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling was down 4.08 percent from Wednesday to close at
a commercial average of 70.26 to the dollar today. The closing
rate on Wednesday stood at 67.50.
</P>
<P>
A new round of violence is widely predicted in the eastern
African country tomorrow as the government has already announced
illegal the strike.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling has lost 18.08 percent against the dollar since
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced last Thursday the
suspension of its 215-million-dollar aid package to Kenya, citing
the country's high-level corruption.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Governor Micah Cheserem expressed
deep concern on shilling's rapid depreciation on Wednesday,
saying his bank will intervene in the foreign exchange market
whenever the need arises,
</P>
<P>
Several importers were rushing to pay their foreign bills in
order to minimize exchange losses while exporters were holding
back Dollars in anticipation of further shilling losses, he said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem noted that foreign investors in government treasury
bills and stocks were in the market following the IMF move,
buying foreign exchange to repatriate their investments.
</P>
<P>
The combination of the above forces has caused the current
turbulence in the foreign exchange market.

Four of them were Italian peacekeepers, and one Irish. UNIFIL

<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain raised official interest
rates to 7 percent from 6.75 percent today in a bid to put the
economy on track for achieving the inflation target of 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth rate rise since the Bank of England was
empowered by the Labor government in May to determine monetary
policy. The increase puts rates at their highest level for more
than four years.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that the strong pound was putting severe
pressure on exporters and the rampant consumer spending would lead
to a resurgence in inflation.
</P>
<P>
Britain's gross domestic product grew an annual 3.4 percent in
the second quarter, a level which most economists believe cannot
be sustained for long without higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
But the British trade unions said the rate rise could put jobs
at risk.

<HEADLINE> More Civilian Casualties amid Escalation in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 7 (Xinhua) -- One civilian was killed and 16
others were wounded in Israeli bombardment at south Lebanese
villages today, in response to Katyusha attacks at northern Israel
overnight.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery focused the bombardment at Iglim Al-Toffah,
a ridge some 60 kilometers southeast of Beirut, which is often
used by guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God,
to launch attacks on the Israeli occupation forces in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The official Lebanon News Agency (LNA) reported that more than
30 shells hit Kfar Melki, killing a villager and wounded 13 others
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Three people in Joun were also injured when their village was
showered by 35 155mm shells fired by Israeli troops in a hilltop
position overlooking the village, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
More than two dozens of houses were damaged in today's
bombardment which came after Hezbollah guerrillas fired volleys
of Katyusha rockets and mortar shells at Israeli positions in the
so-called "security zone."
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio claimed this morning that more than 10 Katyusha
rockets and mortar shells landed in the Galilee panhandle in
northern Israel without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
The LNA also quoted security sources in the border strip as
saying that a mother and her two children were killed, and a
fourth person was wounded, in the explosion of a roadside bomb at
Markaba inside the buffer zone self-carved by Israel in 1985.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut, Sheikh Nabil Qawoq,
Hezbollah's senior officer responsible for affairs in the south,
accused Israel of behinding the Markaba accident, adding that his
party was committed to protecting civilians, especially in the
occupied areas.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the five-nation committee overseeing
the implementation of a cease-fire agreement between Lebanon and
Israel indefinitely postponed a meeting, which had been scheduled
to be held today at the south Lebanese border town of Naqoura.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the
United States had planned to hold the meeting to look into
three complaints filed by Lebanon over Israeli bombardment at
Lebanese villages earlier this week in which two civilians were
killed and nine others wounded, and another complaint lodged by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was postponed after five servicemen, an Irish and
four Italians, of the U.N. peacekeeping forces died when their
helicopter on a routine flight crashed inside the border strip
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The south Lebanon-based U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)
suspended flights of all its helicopters following the incident,
making it impossible for the Lebanese and Syrian delegates to
reach Naqoura to attend the monitoring committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the helicopter crash, Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz told reporters that "this incident should draw the
world's attention to the pains which Lebanon is suffering from
the Israeli occupation in the south and to the high price which
Lebanon and the international community is paying as a result of
this occupation."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the current escalation in south Lebanon
"expresses the stalemate caused by (Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin) Netanyahu and his country after ruining the peace
process."

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Unionists, Sinn Fein to Debate on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Spokesmen for Sinn Fein and the
Ulster Unionist Party are to hold a live debate on British TV for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
UUP security spokesman Ken Maginnies and Sinn Fein negotiator
Martin McGuiness will face each other on BBC2's Newsnight
programs next Tuesday, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
It will bring together the two adversary parties in Northern
Ireland who have been sharply critical of each other for much of
the past three decades and who have yet to sit at the same
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British UUP decided last month to take part in
television debates with Sinn Fein, IRA's political wing, because
UUP officials feared that they were losing a propaganda war
against their long-time foes by refusing direct talks with them.
</P>
<P>
Irish Republican Army, which has been fighting against the
British rule of Northern Ireland, called a ceasefire on July 20,
which allows Sinn Fein to take part in the multi-party peace talks
scheduled next month.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein wants the peace talks to start dismantling British
rule of Northern Ireland. But the British government says this can
only happen if a majority of people in the province, currently 60
percent pro-British, voted for it.
</P>
<P>
The UUP, which is opposed to have direct talks with Sinn Fein,
wants guarantees that the IRA will start surrendering arms when
the peace talks begin on September 15 because UUP does not want to
negotiate with Sinn Fein under military threat of the IRA.

LUANDA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Foreign Minister
Leonardo Simao today ended his four-day visit to Angola which was
aimed at strengthening cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Angola, the Mozambican minister had wide
contacts with Angolan leaders and discussed with them on how to
expand bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a news briefing before leaving for home today, Simao said
the two sides agreed that bilateral cooperation should be
expanded into every field after peace is realized in the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the governments of Angola and
Mozambique will review cooperation agreements signed by the two
countries in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In view of new situations in both countries, the two
governments will take steps to expand bilateral cooperation,
especially cooperation between private businesses, he added.
</P>
<P>
Simao also expressed his optimism over the Angolan peace
process, saying that the day when final peace comes true in
Angola is not far off although the opposition UNITA had delayed
in fully implementing the Lusaka peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican foreign minister arrived here Monday for
visit to Angola.

<HEADLINE> UK's Largest Insurer Raises Fund for Pensions Payback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Prudential Corporation, Britain's
biggest insurer, has raised its provision of paying compensation
to 720 million US dollars for pensions misselling in an effort to
hasten the review.
</P>
<P>
The move follows pressure on the pensions industry from the
government to make faster progress in clearing up the mis-selling
scandal, which has dragged on for several years.
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Prudential yesterday follows a warning from
the Association of British Insurers that compensation and other
costs from mis-selling are likely to exceed 6.4 billion US
dollars, partly because of the recent Budget's abolition of tax
credits for pension schemes.
</P>
<P>
The corporation is now offering guarantees that misselling
victims will not suffer any financial loss on retirement, nor will
they have to prove that they were missold a pension.
</P>
<P>
Sir Peter Davis, Prudential's chief executive, said: "We just
want to get the whole thing sorted out." Prudential has dealt with
16,000 compensation claims from a total of 60,000 priority cases.
</P>
<P>
Critics attacked the Prudential for hiding behind
technicalities to avoid paying up and Sir Peter admitted there had
been a change of heart last night.
</P>
<P>
He said: "There has been a shift in thinking. All of us feel
that the issue is a big one. This is overhanging the industry...We
have a lot of people working on it."
</P>
<P>
Only last month the Prudential was still arguing that it was
not liable for much of the compensation critics said it owed
customers.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the event, economic observers here said, it was
only after the scandal came to light, the corporation tried to
shift responsibility for the way people were persuaded to move
from occupational pensions into personal pensions.

<P>
ATHENS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Aleksandr Bagach of Ukraine, who won
the men's shot put gold medal here on five days ago, was stripped of
his world title due to positive doping test at the 6th World Athletics
Championships Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Also failed in the doping tests were men's 400m hurdler Pascal
Maran of France and women's triple jumper Oxana Zelinskaya of
Kazakhstan. Maran and Zelinskaya didn't enter the finals here.
</P>
<P>
The three athletes have tested positive for taking the stimulant
ephedrine, according to a laboratory analysis announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent decision by the IAAF Congress, these athletes
will be issued a public warning and disqualified from the competition.
</P>
<P>
The results they achieved at the current championships have been
cancelled. As a consequence of this, the revised medal placings for
the men's shot put are John Godina of the United States (gold),
Oliver-Sven Buder of Germany (silver), and C. J. Hunter of the United

<HEADLINE> Sidoti Wins Women's 10,000m Walk World Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Annarita Sidoti of Italy led all the
way home to win the women's 10,000-meter walk gold medal at the 6th
World Athletics Championships here today.
</P>
<P>
Her winning time was 42 minutes 55.49 seconds, a world best this
season. World Cup silver medal winner Olimpiada Ivanova of Russia
finished second in 43:07.63 and Olga Kardopoltseva of Belarus took the
bronze in 43:30.20. It is the first gold for Italy at the current
meet.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion and world silver medallist Yelena Nikolayeva of
Russia finished a poor 10th, and World Cup winner Irina Stankina of
Russia disqualified during the race.
</P>
<P>
"During the last three kilometers my legs were terribly aching.
This medal is for Rossella Giordano. She was supposed to compete here
but didn't feel in shape, and so I replaced her," said Sidoti after
her win.
</P>
<P>
Sidoti, the fourth fastest walker this year behind the three
Russian entrants, set a fast pace from the start and passed the first
5,000 meters with only Ivanova and Stankina hanging tough in her wake.
</P>
<P>
With 11 laps to go, the small Italian leader changed to a higher
gear to drop Ivanova 10 meters behind. The following four laps saw
Stankina, the world leader this year, walk closely at Sidoti's heels,
waiting chance to overtake her.
</P>
<P>
But Stankina got three warnings in a row within the next 400 meters
and had to quit the battle.
</P>
<P>
Sidoti met no challenge in the remaining distance, heading home for
a surprised victory.
</P>
<P>
Ivanova said after the race:"It has been my first world
championshis, so I had to be careful. First I had tried to understand
what the Italian girls were doing, then to watch out for warnings. I
would like rather to compete on the road."
</P>
<P>
A disappointed Kardopoltseva exclaimed:"You are asking for my
pre-race plan? Simply suffer!"

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Criticizes Amnesty International Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
today characterized the 1996 Amnesty International Report as
biased and aimed at sowing seeds of hatred among the Tanzanian
population.
</P>
<P>
This stand was included in a press release issued by the
Tanzanian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation, which said the report is one-sided narration derived
from hear-say and wild allegations made by some disgruntled
members of the Tanzania community bent on furthering their
personal and political ends.
</P>
<P>
The press release accused the Amnesty International of
portraying a negative image of Tanzania as a hostile country to
refugees while internationally omitting the great care it has
always undertaken to uphold conventions governing the
accommodation of refugees.
</P>
<P>
On the allegation that there were acts of human rights
violations in Zanzibar, the release deplored the organization's
report for relying only on complaints made by the opposition
party in Zanzibar without carrying any considerations or views of
the government and the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the press release of the Tanzanian Foreign
Ministry said the Amnesty International report seriously lacks
probity and in-depth scientific research, an absolute essential
for the credibility of any presentation on social work.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Major Step to Curb Crimes in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's cabinet, in
response to strong appeals to stop rampant crimes in the country,
has approved a draft legislation, which will prevent hardened
criminals from obtaining bail.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed bail law approved on Wednesday, courts
will refuse bail to unsentenced prisoners previously convicted of
serious offense, like murder, rape and armed robbery, etc.
</P>
<P>
Courts will also be entitled to cancel bail if it is
discovered that the accused was previously convicted of serious
offense. In addition, judges will have the right to refuse bail
where it appears that the release of a suspect will undermine
public peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Describing this as a very tough measure, South African Justice
Minister Dullah Omar said the bill will "make a dramatic impact
on the hearing of bail applications".
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which abolished apartheid system in 1994, has
been a country where increasing crime has become a very serious
social problem.
</P>
<P>
Murderers, robbers and rapists often take advantage of the
lenient bail law to avoid legal punishment, thus having resulted
in public complaints and no confidence in the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet's go-ahead to the new bail law has apparently won
comprehensive support from all walks of life, including
opposition parties, who describe it as "an improvement of
judicial system".
</P>
<P>
However, while expressing welcome to the draft legislation,
many people are not satisfied with the simple change on the bail
issue, stressing that more urgent steps are essential to the
fight against crime.
</P>
<P>
A comment by "The Citizen" daily pointed out that "tougher
bail laws are not in themselves the final answer" to curbing
crimes.
</P>
<P>
The article urged the ruling African National Congress to bow
to public opinion over death penalty, noting that as death
penalty is an effective weapon to deter evil crimes, it must be
reintroduced.
</P>
<P>
Some legal experts pointed out that crime in South Africa has
become so serious that simply changing the law would not fully
solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Martin Schonteich, parliament analyst for the South African
Institute of Race Relations, warned that criminal justice system
in the country as a whole is disintegrating due to lack of
resources, staffing and training.
</P>
<P>
Most detectives have no specialized training while 25 percent
of the policemen are functionally illiterate, he said, adding
that evil crimes cannot be controlled unless the deficiencies are
overcome.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Appoints Head of Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar Bashir
today issued a republican decree, appointing Rayak Mashar as
chairman of the coordination council of southern Sudan (southern
government).
</P>
<P>
Mashar was sworn in here today in the presence of the Sudanese
president. The appointment of a deputy chairman and other council
members will follow soon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after the swearing-in ceremony,
Mashar said that legislative councils (parliaments) of Sudan's 10
southern states will be formed.
</P>
<P>
These legislative councils, he said, will elect the heads of
the southern states. Subsequently, governments of the southern
states will be instituted, and governors of the various states
appointed.
</P>
<P>
Mashar said that the four-year transition period of southern
Sudan will begin once the 23-member coordination council is
appointed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the functions of the council during the
transition period primarily call for the establishment of peace,
prevalence of security and stability in southern Sudan, and
reconstruction, rehabilitation and development of the war-torn
territories.
</P>
<P>
Mashar appealed to John Garang, leader of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA), to join the peace process, saying that
negotiations with Garang remain the only possible option.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government signed a peace agreement with four
small southern rebel factions on April 21 this year in a bid to
put an end to the 13-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
However, the SPLA, the largest anti-government group operating
in southern Sudan, refused to sign the accord, creating
uncertainty over whether the peace can be holding.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's rebels in the south have fought the government since
1983, seeking a greater say in Sudan's affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mashar joined the Garang movement in 1983, but quit the
movement in 1991 to form his own separate movement.
</P>
<P>
In April 1997, he signed with the Bashir government the
Khartoum peace agreement.

ATHENS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Beatrice Faumuina of New Zealand won

Her winning distance was 66.82 meters ahead of Ellina Zvereva of

first gold medal for New Zealand.
</P>

Faumina, 1997 world leader with a personal best of 68.52 meters,
fouled her first two tosses, but her heave in the third round was good
enough to settle the gold.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Zvereva threw her longest in the second round,
but posed no threat to the winner.
</P>
<P>
"It was almost like what I had done in the qualifying. I can
honestly tell you I didn't want to start out like that, but it was
good to come back in the third," Faumuina said at the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Zvereva told the press:"Throughout the whole final I was waiting a
good 67-meter-throw, but I didn't put together a good one."

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Militia Captures Junta Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The military group of Sierra
Leone's traditional hunters, known as Kamajors, said today they
have ambushed a truck, seizing a batch of arms, ammunition and
armed guards of the junta who seized power in a coup on May 25.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors have been fighting the military junta led by
Major Johnny Koroma and its allies, the ex-rebel group of
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), since the coup.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kamajor leadership, fighting is continuing
around the southeastern Sierra Leone town of Zemin after the
junta sent reinforcement of men and artillery to the area six
miles west of the Liberian border.
</P>
<P>
The arms captured on a road leading to Zemin include 50 AK47
rifles, four cartons of ammunition, 50 rounds of anti-aircraft
mortar shells and a large number of hand grenades, said a Kamajor
regional coordinator, quoted by the British Broadcasting Company.
</P>
<P>
He said the arms were captured Wednesday evening when a truck
believed to be part of the junta's reinforcement was ambushed.
</P>
<P>
The weapons gave the Kamajors a good opportunity to properly
arm themselves for the on-going battle with Koroma's Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council (AFRC) and RUF, the Kamajor spokesman
noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to use the arms collected from the so-called
People's Army in Freetown to battle them out," he said, adding
that up to now his forces has advanced beyond Zemin and begun
attacking other positions of the AFRC.

ATHENS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Astrid Kumbernuss of Germany retained
her title in the women's discus final at the 6th World Athletics

</P>
<P>
Her winning toss was 20.71 meters, the third best this year in the
world. Vita Pavlysh of Ukraine chased Kumbernuss hard, but she
finished five centimeters short of the winner. Stephanie Storp of
Germany landed the bronze at 19.22. China's Huang Zhihong, world
champion in 1991 and 1993, was beaten into the fourth place.
</P>
<P>
Kumbernuss, defending champion and Olympic gold medal winner, led
the opening round with a mighty 20.59 meters, and landed her winner in
the next try.
</P>
<P>
Pavlysh, Olympic silver medallist and world indoor champion this
year, got a 20.57 heave in the same round. The 28-year-old went all
out in the final round, but her 20.66 toss was not strong enough to
bring her the gold.

thinking too much," revealed Kumbernuss at the press conference.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The new Latvian coalition
government today enjoyed confidence of the Sejm that passed a
vote, according to a report from Riga, Latvia.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass said that in the new cabinet which replaced the
Andris Skele cabinet resigned on July 28, Guntars Krasts, 39, has
become prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Krasts, who was economics minister in the former cabinet,
represents the Fatherland and Freedom national-conservative party
that recently merged with the Latvian National Independence
Movement.
</P>
<P>
From the 18 former ministers only five were dismissed from
theirs posts. Three ministers sacked by Skele for violating
anti-corruption law have not been recalled to their posts.
</P>
<P>
It was said that an exception was made for Vilis Kristopans,
railways minister, whose performance was favorably commented on.
The Skele cabinet fell because of a conflict with the parties that
aggravated after dismissals of the ministers they had nominated.
</P>
<P>
The new government was backed by 73 deputies, while 13 voted
against and three were absent.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet formed by four major factions of the Sejm will
work till the autumn of 1998 when parliamentary elections will be
held.
</P>
<P>
Krasts, the new premier, made assurances that the government
will go on with reforms and will preserve previous priorities in
executive authorities' activity.
</P>
<P>
The new coalition government in a declaration said that it
intends to continue establishing good-neighborly relations with
Russia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The document signed by four major parliament factions outlined
the program of the cabinet's activity. It is planned to balance
a budget, to rein in inflation at a level not above nine percent,
to complete privatization in the summer of next year and so on.
</P>
<P>
Latvia's entry into the European Union and NATO remains top
priority in the foreign policy area. It is planned to strengthen
ties with these organizations, to prepare armed forces for the
participation in the military alliance, and to ensure that Latvia
has diplomatic missions in every EU member-country.

LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- All the three major stock markets

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Privatize Power Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will soon privatize the
Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) to attract private
capital to the development of the power sector, a government
minister announced today.
</P>
<P>
Suresh Desai, minister of energy and water development, said
the on-going privatization process in the country will result in
significant economic expansion and improvement.
</P>
<P>
In view of this prospect, the government has recognized the
need for a vibrant and healthy electric utility system to drive
the economy, Desai said when he opened a two-day workshop on
hydro-power and transmission line policy near Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged all participants from Europe, the Americas,
Asia and the sub-Saharan Africa, to discuss the issue frankly and
constructively to help the government draw up an energy policy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a World Bank representative said that energy sector
is not only a source of power vital to the development of the
country, but one of revenue.

medal, but anyway this was the time and place for my top performance.
</P>
<P>
"I'm back to my best and Allen is at his best. A few more weeks of

encourage the military region to enter into meaningful political
dialogue with the leaders of the democracy movement," the

<P>
With these actions, Canada joins the United States and European
Union in imposing selective economic measures against Burma.

entering into further investment agreements or commercial ventures
in Burma.

JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa National

"Whatever equipment we do away with, we have to make sure that
there is equipment to take its place so as to ensure South Africa
remains protected all the time," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Striking Steamsters, UPS Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The striking Teamsters union
and the United Parcel Service resumed talks today, the fourth day
of walkout that involves more than 185,000 union members through
out the United States.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to a request by Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service Director John Calhoun Wells to meet, and
talks began around 2 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
Teamsters President Ron Carey said he was willing to bargain
all weekend, but questioned whether the company was ready to
negotiate seriously on issues important to the union.
</P>
<P>
UPS chief executive officer James P. Kelly said he was
"perplexed" that the union had refused to let its members vote on
the company's proposal.
</P>
<P>
The two parties face unresolved issues, including pay and
benefits, the company's use of part-time workers and pensions.
</P>
<P>
"UPS remains committed to its final contract offer and is
encouraging the union leaders to let UPS Teamsters vote on the
proposal," the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Teamster President Ron Carey said that if UPS was unwilling to
negotiate big changes to its offer, there could be no contract.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen no sign that the company has changed its
attitude, so we are not particularly optimistic about these new
talks," Carey said late on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The union blamed the strike on the company's refusal to create
thousands of full-time jobs each year from part-time positions and
to stop handing union work to outside suppliers. Between 120,000
and 130,000 union-represented workers are part-time.
</P>
<P>
But UPS said the real issue was the Teamsters' refusal to let
the company withdraw from a pension plan that includes 30 other
companies. It said with its own pension program, it would save
money in the long run.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian PM Urges Israel to Lift "Collective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri urged here today Israel to lift a "collective
punishment" it imposed on the Palestinians following last week's
suicide bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters upon his arrival at the Beirut Airport,
Ganzouri said "the collective punishment" will only lead to more
violence rather than solution of problems.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the Jerusalem suicide bombings in which 15
people were killed and 170 others wounded, Israel has closed the
Palestinian self-ruled areas of the West Bank and Gaza strip and
imposed crippling economic sanctions upon them.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli collective punishment practiced in the
Palestinian case could not resolve the problems, but will lead to
the increase of violence," the Egyptian prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to pave the way for a resumption of the
peace talks, "Israel must totally and immediately review the
collective punishment on the Palestinian people in the past few
days."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Israeli government should also reconsider
its policy on Jewish settlements because of which the peace
negotiations were suspended last March.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian premier added that the Middle East situations
were not a problem of Egypt, nor a problem of Lebanon and all
the Arab states, but had become a "regional international
problem" and "it was not a secret that the Jewish settlements
had become an obstacle to the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri arrived here today for a two-day official visit to
Lebanon, during which he and his Lebanese counterpart Rafik
Al-Hariri will preside meetings of the Lebanese-Egyptian Highest
Joint Council.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri spoke highly of achievements made by Hariri's
government in rebuilding its country, noting that Lebanon "is
returning to a natural situation."
</P>
<P>
Hariri, on the other hand, welcomed his Egyptian counterpart's
"historical" visit, and expressed appreciation for the support
Egypt has extended to Lebanon since President Hosni Mubarak came
to power.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Ganzouri's visit will contribute in
consolidating the friendly ties between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> US Economic Boom to Continue, Manufacturing Group Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The current U.S. economic
expansion is the "best economic performance since the 1960s" and
is giving no indication that it will soon end, U.S. National
Association of Manufacturers (NAM) said today.
</P>
<P>
""We are witnessing the most amazing economic performance...
due to the increased competitive and technological vigor of the
private sector," said President Jerry Jasinowski of the NAM in
releasing the group's economic forecast.
</P>
<P>
He said the group "can expect sustainable noninflationary
growth of 2.5 to 3 percent annually." At the same time, the
inflation rate should remain under 3 percent annually and the
unemployment rate below 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The NAM anticipates ongoing growth, fueled by high
productivity and a low inflation rate, for the foreseeable
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NAM president said that the biggest threat to the U.S.
economy is high consumer debt that "could jeopardize purchasing
patterns and, in turn, cause a downturn." But he said the problem
is manageable because increased household wealth will permit debt
repayment.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the growth "could also be diminished should
the Federal Reserve raise interest rates to any significant
degree" and the U.S. Fed "should not raise rates again this year."
</P>
<P>
Although a temporary rebound in consumer spending will help
boost economic growth from a 2.2 percent annual rate in the second
quarter to almost 3 percent in the third, the economy will settle
back to a modest pace, the NAM forecasted.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Defends Its Anti-drug Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today rejected the
dissatisfaction by the United States with its efforts in drug
control, saying it is uncalled for and beyond the lines of its
recent efforts.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Musa Bamaiyi, chairman of the National Drug Law
Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), said Nigeria has been "doing well in
the drug war" and achievements have been made since 1994.
</P>
<P>
But the United States is keen on the past, particularly in the
period of 1991 to 1993, the reported high time that drug
traffickers actively used Nigeria for drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
"What is currently taking place, from 1994, they close their
eyes against it. They don't want to see," Bamaiyi said.
</P>
<P>
"It is common knowledge globally that Nigeria is doing well in
the drug war," he said, adding that the country should otherwise
be commended.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said the United States, the biggest drug market
in the world, should look at its own serious situation instead of
criticizing other countries.
</P>
<P>
The performance of NDLEA has been evident as an increasing
number of foreigners were caught with drugs in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest edition of NDLEA's magazine "Drug
Salvation Force", nine foreigners were arrested between January
and June this year, compared to four in the same period a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 foreigners were captured between January 1996 to
June this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Of the foreigners arrested, Ghana tops the list with 13,
followed by Benin with four and Togo with two, while Lebanon,
Guinea, Liberia, India, France, Netherlands and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea recorded one person each.
</P>
<P>
According to the magazine, the quantity of seized drug has
reduced, adding while 264.54 kg of drug was found on the four
foreigners arrested last year, only 33.29 kg was discovered on
the nine arrested so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The magazine disclosed that the majority of the arrests were
made at Nigeria's land borders which, it said, had become the
favorite routes for drug traffickers in the west African
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
With the increasing removal of all restrictions on free
movement of persons and goods in the sub-region, more traffickers
would be likely to shift to the land routes, it noted.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Pakistan Discuss Situation in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish and Pakistani leaders
today called for a peace solution to conflicts in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz held talks with Pakistani
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayup Khan, who arrived here earlier today
on a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Yilmaz said that Turkey and Pakistan should
coordinate closely in finding a peaceful settlement to the Afghan
issue.
</P>
<P>
In his part, Ayup Khan said that Pakistan, as a neighboring
state of Afghanistan, has an advantage to hold dialogs with all
waring parties in the country, but added that Islamabad "favors
none of the clashing sides in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Pakistan intends to hold a U.N.-supervised
international conference on the Afghanistan plight, Ayup Khan said
that Pakistan would keep Ankara very well informed on this
development.
</P>
<P>
Although there is a traditionally friendly relationship between
the two Muslim nations, Turkey and Pakistan hold opposite views on
the settlement of the Afghanistan problem.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been supporting Uzbek Militia General Rasit Dostum,
who fled to Ankara after his headquarters in Mazar-e-Sharif fell
to the Afghan Islamic militia Taliban in May.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, however, has long been known as a major supporter of
the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Calling Pakistan a friendly nation of Turkey, Yilmaz expressed
his hope that the two countries will further expand their
relations in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani foreign minister also said his government hopes
more Turkish businessmen to invest in Pakistan, a country with a
bright prospect of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem also
met the visiting Pakistani foreign minister and entourage.

Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, issued a
statement Tuesday expressing his welcome for Thailand's policy
package which was aimed at overcoming present economic problems in
the country.
</P>
<P>
"The economic package is rightly focused on immediate and
sweeping measures aimed at assuring the solvency and strength of
Thailand's financial system and on supporting fiscal measures and
other welcome initiatives aimed at re-establishing a strong
macroeconomic basis for stability and growth of the economy,"
Camdessus said. "I found particularly appropriate the adoption of
a comprehensive restructuring of troubled financial institutions,
as this is essential to lay the basis for the re-establishment of
a sound financial sector and to set the stage for effective
recovery," he added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief also expressed his confidence that the strong
actions taken by Thailand Tuesday and the financial support that
could be extended to it will decisively contribute to stability in
financial markets in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo meeting is called in a bid to invite a number of
industrial nations and other international institutions to take
part in a financing package for Thailand to support the
stabilization program now being discussed with the IMF.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Hails Albright's Statement on Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul Meguid said he "followed with interest" the statement by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that calls on Israel
not to take unilateral measures.
</P>
<P>
Meguid said he has seen many positive points in the comments
made by Albright Wednesday, who had largely been criticized for
aloofness to the Mideast peace-making since she took office early
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leader expressed his hope that Albright's expected
tour of the region will "seriously" push forward the peace process
on the Palestinian track as well as the Syrian and Lebanese tracks
in order to defuse the explosive situation and achieve a just and
comprehensive peace for all the peoples of the region.
</P>
<P>
Albright called on in Wednesday's statement both the Israelis
and Palestinians to do more to advance the Mideast peace process
and said she may travel to the region by the end of the month if
there is "progress on the security issue."
</P>
<P>
Meguid condemned all acts of violence and cleared the
responsibility of the Palestinian National Authority for these
acts.
</P>
<P>
"The hardline Israeli stance as well as Israeli provocative
measures in Jerusalem and Arab occupied lands are the direct
reasons behind them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks which had been deadlocked since
March over Israel's construction of a new Jewish settlement in
East Jerusalem suffered another fatal blow when the July 30 twin
suicide bombings killed 15 people in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
A strongly-worded communique issued after an emergency meeting
of the Arab League Tuesday said Israel's failure to abide by the
peace agreements with the Palestinians has invited violence to the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is sending its envoy to the Mideast Dennis Ross back
to the area for talks this weekend in a bid to defuse the
tension.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Police Transfers, Mere Routine: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Police Force said
today that the recent transfers of some 98 senior officers out of
Lagos were mere routine and should not be interpreted otherwise.
</P>
<P>
The police, like all institutions, transferred its officers
when necessary and should not be construed to mean anything else,
said Young Arebamen, the force's public relations officer.
</P>
<P>
In a major reorganization earlier this week, more than 1,500
senior police officers were transferred by the Force
Headquarters, with all the affected officers in the south
deployed to various northern states and their counterparts in the
north asked to report in the south.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that those sent on transfer had spent not less
than four years in the south, while others were being moved out
because of the re-location of force headquarters to the capital
Abuja in the center of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police, worried by accusations that its
officers are unrepentantly corrupt, have set up a special task
force to rid the organization of bad eggs.
</P>
<P>
Arebamen, who is also a deputy commissioner of police, said
the task force would also arrest and prosecute those who
"corrupt' police officers by offering them bribes.
</P>
<P>
According to him, hundreds of motorists had been arrested
across the country in the last one week for giving money to
policemen to avoid being asked to produce their vehicle
documents.
</P>
<P>
Urging the public not to ridicule the police, Arebamen said
the police were the only institution in the country that did not
protect its corrupt members and that people who wanted to help
should do so with positive criticism.

PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard reaffirmed today that France is committed to its policy of
no arms sale to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no new sale of French armaments to Taiwan,"
said Richard during an interview with Radio-Television Luxembourg

</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry also reaffirmed twice in June that
France sticks to the 1994 joint communique with China, in which
Paris promised not to sell arms to Taiwan from then on.

France sold 60 Mirage-2000-5 combat aircraft to Taiwan in 1993
at a value of 3.8 billion U.S. dollars. This paralyzed Sino-French
relations for one year.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Scholar On Religious Freedom in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lhasa, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Members and scholars of the Tibetan
Autonomous Regional Academy of Social Sciences today expressed
indignations over the unfounded accusations on the religious
situations in China included in a recent US State Department
report on religion.
</P>
<P>
At a forum organized by the academy, the scholars pointed out
that Tibetan people can prove whether Chinese people enjoy
religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
They shared the view that religion is experiencing a golden age
in Tibet which has 1,781 lamaseries and temples, 300 more than all
religious venues before Tibet was liberated by peaceful means in
1951.
</P>
<P>
The number of monks and nuns in Tibet is estimated at 46,000
but the actual figure is larger. It is a common sight that
pilgrims are walking in groups on almost all the main roads in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The scholars said that the central government has taken
effective measures to promote religious development in the region,
including allocating over 300 million yuan to finance renovation
of temples and lamaseries and open them to the public.
</P>
<P>
To train scholars for Tibetan Buddhism and promote local
religion, the autonomous regional government invested heavily in
building a research institute on Tibetan Buddhism, as well as a
printing house for sacred scripts.
</P>
<P>
As for the political rights of the people from the religious
community, the scholars said that these people account for 15
percent of all the members of the Standing Committee of
the Regional People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, all cities and counties in Tibet have set up their
own religious organizations or societies. Over 600 religious
people hold positions in local people's congress, people's
political consultative conference or Buddhism Associations at all
levels.
</P>
<P>
If people come to Tibet and see religious situation here with
their own eyes, they would disagree with the irresponsible
comments made by the US report on China's religious
freedom, the scholars noted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Enjoy Improved Living Standards (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese people are leading a
far better life than only a few years ago, with most citizens
enjoying a higher income level, abundant and less expensive
consumer goods, improved living conditions and access to at least
a modicum of luxuries.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita income for urban residents reached 4,300
yuan in 1996, up 3.3 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita income of rural residents hit 1,900
yuan, a rise of nine percent on 1995.
</P>
<P>
Only two decades ago, an ordinary worker earned a mere 40-50
yuan monthly, with most rural residents living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's reform and opening in
1982, questioned: "How can this be cited as an advantage of
socialism...especially since we have engaged in revolution for
decades and have practiced socialism for more than 30 years?"
</P>
<P>
After China's reform and opening scored monumental achievements
during the 1979-1988 period, Deng confirmed that "the living
standards of the Chinese citizens should gradually rise on the
basis of increased production."
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who also serves as general
secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China, told delegates attending the 14th CPC National Congress in
1992 that "ensuring a relatively comfortable life for one-fifth of
the world's population living in our country will represent an
extraordinary achievement."
</P>
<P>
The living standards of both urban and rural residents have
improved greatly in recent years due to booming production and the
accumulation of social assets.

<P>
The fact that supplies of many products have exceeded demand
since 1994 has created a burgeoning consumer's market.
</P>
<P>
While grain and clothing coupons were commonplace during the
14th CPC National Congress, related coupon's are now nothing more
than collectors items.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Engel Index for China's urban residents fell
to below 50 percent shortly after the end of the 14th Congress
indicated that the urban residents were able to spend more than
half their income for items other than food.
</P>
<P>
Economists point to related progress as being highly
significant in the history of the daily consumption habits of the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Engel Index for urban residents hit 48.6 percent, and
the goal for the year 2000 has been set at 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, Bank savings jumped to slightly over 3.85
trillion yuan, up some 886 billion yuan on the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese can now afford color TV's and
domestically-produced appliances on their monthly salary, and most
envision the time when they will be able to purchase personal
computers or automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Statistics through the end of 1996 show that each 1,000
households owned 935 television sets, 116 air-conditioners and 342
gas water heaters.
</P>
<P>
The per capita living space in rural areas at the end of 1996
stood at 21.7 sq.m., with the 8.4 sq.m. space for urban residents
representing a 1.7 sq.m. jump on 1990.
</P>
<P>
China's intensified efforts to help impoverished people escape
poverty over the past five years have attracted wide-ranging
international attention.
</P>
<P>
While seven million Chinese people escaped poverty in 1996, the
nation's poverty-stricken population dropped to about 58
million. China's rural poverty-stricken population currently
account for less than 20 percent of the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
The current number of college students per 100,000 Chinese
citizens stands at 247, a significant rise on the 186 student
figure for 1992.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Win Openers at World Volleyball Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Olympic silver-medalists China and
fourth placers from the Atlanta Games Russia won their respective
matches on the opening day at the three-day World Women's
Volleyball Grand Prix here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
China won over Italy 3-0 (15-6, 15-6, 15-11) and Russia beat
the United States 3-0 (15-1, 15-8, 15-3).
</P>
<P>
The taller Chinese won the opening set without any problem,
with veteran spiker Wang Ziling gaining one point after another
for her side.
</P>
<P>
The second set almost went the same way, as Chinese continued
their triumphant advance with powerfulspikes and successful
blocking.
</P>
<P>
The Italians fought fearlessly in face of tough opponents, but
lack of spiking power obviously cost them the game, as they lost
the third set 15-11 and the match three sets to null.
</P>
<P>
The Americans, who finished a poorly seventh at last year's
Olympic Games in Atlanta, seemed to be paying prices for their
recent reshuffle which resulted in a brand-new line-up here. 10
out of the 12-strong American players are newcomers to be led by
only two Olympians from the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Russians fielded the main body of its Olympic line-up here,
with three of the players standing at 1.90 meters. Their superior
height helped the team in making both effective spikes and
blocking.
</P>
<P>
And inexperienced Americans made too many unforced errors in
today's game -- nine in the first set and at least the same figure
in the second.
</P>
<P>
The Russians formed a solid defense throughout the game, which
was not much foiled even in face of powerful jump-serves launched
by some American players. The third and final set came out
totally lopsided in favor of the Russians.
</P>
<P>
Lang Ping, head coach of the Chinese team, said that her
players performed normally today and of course they had some weak
points to improve in the later competitions.
</P>
<P>
As for the fluctuation in the third set, she explained that
might be the result of fielding some newcomers. "It's normal in
any competitions like this, anyway," she said.
</P>
<P>
Italy takes on Russia and China faces United States on Saturday
and, on the event's third and final day on Sunday, Italy meets the
United States and China takes on Russia.

<HEADLINE> Russia's "Unbeatable" New Missiles Available Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia is to start selling its
newly-designed "Yakhont" missiles on the world weapons market
soon, the Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The missile, which destroys aircraft carriers, frigates and
surfaced submarines, has a range of up to 300 kilometers and is
equipped with an advanced radar homing system designed by "Granit"
research institute.
</P>
<P>
Russian navy experts believed that the missile is impervious to
attack.
</P>
<P>
It can be launched from submarines, from surface ships and by
coast guard launchers on the ground. Travelling at twice the speed
of sound and at very low attitude, "Yakhont" remains undetectable
until it explodes, they said.
</P>
<P>
Russian military experts say initial interest indicates sales
will exceed their expectations. Some Asia-Pacific countries and
Middle East countries have already shown interest in the new
missile, they said.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass said the Russian missile is far superior in
every way to the much advertised U.S. Tomahawk missile and its
French and British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Russian designers and navy specialists believe "Yakhont" will
have no competition in the world armaments market for at least a
quarter of a century.

NICOSIA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 400 Turkish Cypriots in
Turkish-controlled northern part of the island today came to the
southern government-controlled village of Kokkina to pay homage to
those killed there 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash also visited the area by
helicopter, while other Turkish Cypriots traveled by bus.
</P>
<P>
Kokkina, in the northwest of the island, is a Turkish Cypriot
enclave, some three miles west of the Turkish occupied areas.
</P>
<P>
Greek Cypriots living in the area welcomed their Turkish
Cypriot compatriots and Cypriot police officers accompanied the 18
small buses that took them to the region.
</P>
<P>
Waldemar Rokoszewski, a spokesman for U.N. Peace-Keeping Force
in Cyprus, said today that the U.N. force monitored the trip and all
ran smoothly.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the planned visit of some 600 Greek
Cypriots to the Turkish-controlled Monastery of Ayios Andreas on
August 15 will also run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits was agreed by Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Denktash during their meetings in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders had two meetings in Nicosia last month, under
auspices of U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave
Feissel, to discuss humanitarian issues and reached an agreement
on missing persons of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Last April some 450 Turkish Cypriots crossed to southern
government-controlled areas for a pilgrimage to Hala Sultan Tekke
mosque in Larnaca to hold a ceremony commemorating their
compatriots who died in intercommunal conflict in August 1964.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops
in and took over the northern third of the island following
a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
People from the two sides have been prohibited to cross the
180-kilometer-long U.N.-controlled buffer zone which separates
the island into two parts.

investigation into the suicide bombing which killed 15 people and
injured 150 in a Jewish market in Jerusalem on July 30.

The EU considered it "absolutely necessary" for the Palestinian
authorities to cooperate fully with the Israelis on security
matters and in the ongoing enquiry, Poos said.

The foreign minister of Luxembourg, which currently holds the
six-month rotating EU presidency, added that the EU was satisfied
with Arafat's condemnation of the terrorist act.

SINGAPORE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economy grew by
5.9 percent in the first half of this year, prompting the

"Manufacturing is recovering from the slowdown. All other
sectors did well. Reflecting our strong fundamentals, we attracted
4.8 billion US dollars of manufacturing investments in the first
half of this year," he added.
</P>
<P>
Given the better-than-expected economic performance, the
Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) expects the economy to

useful skills, such as Information Technology (IT) skills,
thinking skills and learning skills.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today called upon all member countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to continue to
nurture and nourish the spirit of ASEAN togetherness.
</P>
<P>
"In all our undertakings and ventures, the spirit of ASEAN
togetherness prevailed and has been our guiding principle," he
said in his message on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of
ASEAN aired by Radio and Television Malaysia (RTM) tonight.
</P>
<P>
He said much have been achieved due to the spirit of ASEAN --
doing things the ASEAN way which means practicing consultation and
seeking consensus by exercising self-restraint and maintaining
mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
"There have been times when our very existence and cohesiveness
had been put to the test, but we have always survived and come out
stronger," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He added that ASEAN shall continue to nurture and nourish this
principle to ensure greater prosperity and strength.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully committed to the goals and ideals of ASEAN and we
are confident that ASEAN will achieve greater progress in the
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader was also of the view that ASEAN youths
should be guided in the best possible way so that they could
contribute to the future of the region.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Let us guide them in the ASEAN way with the ASEAN
spirit so that they will become good, responsible and worthy
citizens of ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that as the world is more complex and demanding
ASEAN leaders should reflect on some of the past problems and
difficulties so that repetition would not occur.
</P>
<P>
"As we stand on the threshold of the 21st Century we must be
fully equipped to manage the challenges that will come with the
new millennium," he said, adding "with the right attitude,
knowledge and commitment, and drawing from ASEAN's past lessons we
will be able to surmount the challenges that may emerge."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia is proud to be a member of ASEAN and to
have contributed something towards the success of the association.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> HK New Airport Expected to Open Next April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's new international
airport and its related facilities are expected to open in April
next year as scheduled, a local government official said today.
</P>
<P>
In a report circulated here tonight, Billy Lam, director of the
New Airport Projects Coordination Office (NAPCO), said a total of
85 percent of the Airport Core Program (ACP) had been completed by
the end of June. Now, the works directly funded by the government
are close to completion, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are all working toward the target of opening the new
airport in April next year and the airport railway shortly after,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lam, the budgetary cost accounting for the program
is 156.4 billion Hong Kong dollars (about 20.2 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
NAPCO has been working closely with the Airport Authority and
the MTR (metro) Corporation to ensure that the airport and the
railway will, as with the government ACP works, be completed on
time and within the budget, the NAPCO director said.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the ACP projects at Chek Lap Kok, one of
the world's largest infrastructure programs, was designed to
provide modern, efficient air transport facilities, together with
associated road and rail facilities and new land, that will
support Hong Kong's continued expansion well into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and British governments signed a memorandum of
understanding in 1991, noting the "urgent need for a new airport
in Hong Kong" and requiring the Hong Kong government to complete
the ACP projects "to the maximum extent possible" by June 30,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the ACP projects started soon after the
memorandum was signed and the local government is responsible for
seven of the 10 ACP projects, which cover land reclamation and the
construction of highways and a new town near the new airport.

together with currency and flag.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement on ambassadors, 13 of Bosnia's

<HEADLINE> Major Coal Mines Enhance Profitability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- China's major state-owned coal
mines reversed losses and earned profits in the first six months
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Coal Industry attributes the breakthrough to
extensive efforts to expand structural reform, strengthen
management, reduce redundancies, and control both raw coal
production and storage, as well as to rectifying production order
and placing priority on safety.
</P>
<P>
Major state coal mines earned over 110 million yuan in profit
during the first six months. But, these mines lost more than 300
million yuan during the same period of last year. Fifty-seven
state-owned coal producers, or 61.3 percent of the total, are
currently earning profits.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the first six months of the year show that the
country's total raw coal output fell by 2.15 percent to 620.76
million tons, down 13.63 million tons when compared to the 1996
period. Production at major state coal mines for the period fell
by 1.25 percent to 256.38 million tons of raw coal, down 3.25
million tons.
</P>
<P>
End of June figures show the country had coal stockpiles of
73.72 million tons, down 23.93 million tons on January figures,
with large state coal mines recording stockpiles of 31.97 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Mines have laid off 188,000 workers, with some 106,000 of them
having found reemployment after completing retraining courses.
</P>
<P>
Major mines achieved a record mechanization rate of 72.73
percent and a production efficiency of 2.01 person tons/day.

The ethical progress China is advocating is the one focusing on
economic construction and based on the four cardinal principles as
well as the policy of the reform and open-up. It embodies the fine
tradition of the Chinese nation while reflecting features of the
times, and is based on China and oriented with the rest of the

<HEADLINE> China's Socioeconomic Development During 1992-1996 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved major advances
in socioeconomic development since the 14th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) was held in 1992.
</P>
<P>
A recent State Statistics Bureau (SSB) survey shows that gross
domestic product (GDP) has reached 6.78 trillion yuan, an increase
of 77.1 percent over the 1991 figure in real terms.
</P>
<P>
Thus the annual GDP increment stood at 12.1 percent over the
past five years. Such a growth rate represents one of the world's
most rapidly developing economies, and is also the highest one
since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
China has fulfilled economic development target five years
ahead of the central government's schedule, which was settled in
the beginning of 1980s and outlined a four-fold rise on 1980 GDP
figures by the end of century.
</P>
<P>
World Bank statistics indicate that China's 1996 GDP figures
ranked seventh in the world, up from the 10th place ranking in
1991.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's major supplier of grain, cotton, edible
oil, meat, eggs, textiles, coal, steel and cement, with the nation
ranking second in terms of power generation, fertilizer and
chemical fibers, and fifth in crude oil production.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report said that China successfully readjusted its
economic structure during the 1992-1996 period, while at the same
time maintaining stable agricultural growth.
</P>
<P>
The nation's secondary and tertiary industries have generated
80 percent of GDP, up 4.5 percentage points from 1991.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the emphasis on large-scale investments in fixed
assets since 1992 has further improved the nation's infrastructure
and forces of production, the report said.

into the fixed assets between 1992-1996 period, up an average 32.6
percent annually. The funds were used to complete 299,000
infrastructure and 218,000 technical renovation projects.
</P>
<P>
China has recorded two consecutive years of good grain
harvests, with output for the animal husbandry and fisheries
sectors growing on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Steel output exceeded 100 million tons in 1996, up 30 percent
from 1991. In addition, the output of raw coal climbed to 1.38
billion tons, and power generation surpassed 1,000 billion kw-hr..
</P>
<P>
SSB statistics also indicate a high growth rate for the auto
manufacturing, household electric appliance, computer,
telecommunications sectors.
</P>
<P>
The economic upsurge has also led to stable improvements in
living standards, with 1996 per capita earnings of urban residents
reaching 4,377 yuan, up 41.6 percent on 1991 figure when
considering inflationary factors.
</P>
<P>
The average income of rural residents has jumped 28.8 percent

<HEADLINE> China Urges End of Cold War Mentality in Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- China today called for the
abandonment of Cold War mentality in U.N. human rights bodies.
</P>
<P>
The most challenging task facing the United Nations human
rights bodies now is to seek ways of doing away with Cold War
mentality, Wu Jianmin, head of China's observer delegation, told a
session of the Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination
and Protection of Minorities under the U.N. Human Rights
Commission.
</P>
<P>
He called on the experts of the sub-commission, the
"think-tank" for the U.N. human rights program, to come forward
with new ideas and new thinking in place of the Cold War mentality
in order that substantial progress can be made in the cause of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
Each of the 185 member states of the United Nations is
different from the other in many ways, Wu said. Yet, in spite of
all the differences, many common grounds and interests between
nations exist.
</P>
<P>
"The typical feature of the Cold War mentality is to focus on
the differences," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"To those who stick to this kind of mentality, their values,
their concept of human rights, their views and approaches to the
human rights question are the gospels of the world. Any opinions
differing from theirs invites their open condemnation,
name-calling, even willful sanctions."
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Wu said, since the end of the Cold War in 1991,
"What we have seen is nothing but the aggravation of mutual
antagonism with the human rights cause as the ultimate loser."
</P>
<P>
"We should concentrate on the common grounds and interests
instead of differences," Wu suggested. "We should stop
finger-pointing and start exchanging our experience in the
promotion of human rights."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the cause of human rights can only be
advanced by developing cooperation on the basis of common
interests.
</P>
<P>
He said the most fundamental human right is subsistence.
</P>
<P>
"Protection of the basic human rights means first and foremost
the guarantee of the survival of a human being. This is common
sense," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. statistics, 1.3 billion people, or 23 percent
of the world's population, live below the poverty line, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
"If we can discuss these issues of human rights and share
experience with each other in order to find possible solutions,
and if we can help enable more people each year to enjoy the most
fundamental human right -- freedom from hunger -- through our
efforts, won't it be our most convincing achievement in promoting
human rights?" he asked.

<HEADLINE> France "Deeply Worried" About Tension in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it is "deeply
worried" by the escalating tension in southern Lebanon, as a series
of tit-for-tat attacks have been going on between Israeli troops and
the Hezbollah guerrillas for a few days which have killed at least
five people.
</P>
<P>
"We deplore profoundly that the civilian victims were attacked
several times, by both sides of the Israeli-Lebanese frontier. We
appeal to all the parties for the greatest restraint," said French
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
The truce monitoring committee consisting of France, the United
States, Israel, Syria and Lebanon will meet on Sunday to examine the
complaints presented by Israel and Lebanon on the violations of the
ceasefire understanding signed in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel should spare civilians in southern
Lebanon from violence, while the Hezbollah should stop attacking
northern Israel with rockets.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have been breaking the truce agreement for days in
tit-for-tat attacks upon each other around Israel's self-declared
"security zone" in southern Lebanon, after Israel launched commando
and bombing raids beyond the security zone against Hezbollah
targets.
</P>
<P>
Three rockets landed this morning in a village in northern Israel,
slighting wounding a woman and damaging a synagogue.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for an Israeli village to be attacked
since the "Grapes of Wrath" operation launched by Israel in April
1996, which killed 170 Lebanese civilians and caused hundreds of
thousands to flee the south.

TOKYO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus

in the first half of this year over the same period in 1996, the

Exports increased by 15 percent to 24 trillion yen (204.1
billion dollars), rising for the sixth straight half-year
period. Imports rose 13.8 percent to 18.9 trillion yen (160.2
billion dollars), also rising for the sixth successive half-year
period.
</P>
<P>
The merchandise trade surplus increased 20 percent to 5.18
trillion yen (43.9 billion dollars), also the first rise since
1993. But the services trade, including tourism, registered a
deficit of 3.2 trillion yen (27.1 billion dollars), down
marginally over 1996.
</P>
<P>
That translated into a surplus in goods and services of 1.98
trillion yen (16.8 billion dollars), 77 percent more than the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry officials say that the surplus will not
continue this rate of growth in the medium to long term, but
economists here are sceptical, predicting that this rate of
expansion will continue.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Calls on Iran to Develop Bilateral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
today called upon Iran to pursue a policy of cooperation,
stabilization of relations and development of bilateral ties on
the genuine and clear basis.
</P>
<P>
Saddam issued the call in his address on the occasion of the
lapse of nine years after the end of the Iraqi-Iranian war,
according to the Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Saddam demanded the release of Iraqi prisoners of war held in
Iran and the return of Iraqi properties, including civil and
military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
He said that this was a prerequisite for regional stability,
mutual respect and balanced interests.
</P>
<P>
Saddam made the appeal right after new Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami assumed office last Sunday. Khatami has
expressed Iran's intention to develop relations with other
countries, particularly with countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president, however, affirmed that "unless a policy
of cooperation and good intentions is pursued by Iran, we will
not be attracted by mere changes of headlines or the replacement
of one person by another or one party for the other."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-Iranian war lasted for eight years, from 1980 to
1988. One of the most serious residues of this war is the issue
of prisoners of war and those missing-in-action. It constitutes
the prime obstacle in the face of normalization of diplomatic
and political relations between Baghdad and Tehran.

<HEADLINE> China's Industrial Output Value Up 8.4 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Sustained summer heat and less
working days slowed down the growth speed of China's industrial
production in July.
</P>
<P>
The country last month posted a year-on-year industrial output
value growth of 8.4 percent, dropping 1.4 percentage points than
the figure in the first half year, according to a monthly report
on China's industrial production released here today by the State
Statistical Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that the country's industry at or above
the township-level posted added values totaling 162.5 billion
yuan, of which state-owned sector and enterprises controlled by
the state posted 93.1 billion yuan, or a rise of 5.8 percent than
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The added values generated by state enterprises increased 3.9
percent; the amount by the collective enterprises, up 7.7 percent;
and the values registered by other economic sectors, up 11.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Of China's 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
(excluding Tibet), only Liaoning, Anhui, Guangdong and Qinghai
witnessed faster growth than the previous year, while the rest
registered slower growth.
</P>
<P>
Added values in light industry stood at 66.3 billion yuan, up
8.3 percent, while the added values in heavy industry registered
96.2 billion yuan, registering an increase of 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Energy output also saw slower growth. In July, China produced
energy equivalent to 103 million tons of standard coal, a decrease
of 1.6 percent than the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The coal production in the month stood at 109 million tons,
down 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The output of crude oil in July reached 13.79 million tons, up
1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the hot weather and the rise of electricity
consumption, China generated 96.4 billion kwh of electricity in
July.
</P>
<P>
Raw material output saw smooth increase last month. Growth
rates of iron, steel, steel products, ten non-ferrous metals, and
ten major chemical materials, including sulphuric acid, nitric
acid, soda ash, ethylene and chemical fibers, ranged from 10.3
percent to 21.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sales to production ratio in the month hit 96.34 percent, a
year-on-year rise of 0.51 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the industrial profits kept upward
trend. The composite index for industrial returns stood at 88.04
percent, up 4.24 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises in the month had 63.4 billion yuan in
profits, up 34.5 percent; of which state enterprises earned 12.1
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts with SSB said that China's industrial economy has
geared up to the better turn, even though still in "the initial
and recovering period". One expert noted that the overall economic
returns are still in low level. "Efforts have still to be made on
deepening reform and optimizing the industrial mix in the future,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Peace in S. Leone Still Out of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- There might still be a long way
towards the resolution of the Sierra Leonean crisis arising from
the May 25 coup although the military junta has expressed
intention to resume peace talks with west African countries.
</P>
<P>
Faced with increasing international pressure for restoration
of the elected government in the troubled country, the military
junta said Thursday there was still room for further negotiations
despite the failure of the Abidjan talks, according to the Armed
Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC).
</P>
<P>
AFRC is currently the highest governing body in Sierra Leone
set up after the coup that toppled the civilian government led by
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
In his address over the state radio Thursday, AFRC chairman,
self-appointed head of state, Major Johnny Koroma offered to go
back with regional mediators, saying that his plan for a
four-year transition to civil rule was "not watertight".
</P>
<P>
He said he had "initiated moves for the resumption of
negotiations" with envoys of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS Committee of Four on Sierra Leone, made of foreign
ministers of Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire, have held
two rounds of talks with a delegation of the junta.
</P>
<P>
The first brought a ceasefire agreement in mid-July while the
second broke down following Koroma's announcement on July 30 of
his intention to stay in power until the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
In a swift reaction to Koroma's refusal to an immediate
step-down, ECOWAS Chairman, Nigeria's head of state, General Sani
Abacha announced "full-scale" sanctions against the junta last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, warned
Wednesday it would take reprisal to any ship and aircraft
attempting to enter Sierra Leone's territorial waters and
airspace, which it sees is in contravention of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
The warning was followed by a presidential statement of the
United Nations Security Council, expressing its readiness to
"take appropriate measures" to restore Kabbah's
democratically-elected government.
</P>
<P>
The council said the attempt by the soldiers in Sierra Leone
to set conditions for the restoration of Kabbah was
"unacceptable". It urged them to renounce their intention to
remain in power and resume negotiations with the ECOWAS Committee
of Four without delay.
</P>
<P>
While the council blamed the junta for the breakdown of the
talks held in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, for lack of good faith,
Koroma said the talks collapsed "because the ECOWAS committee
wanted to impose their mandate on the delegation" of the junta.
</P>
<P>
According to Koroma's four-year transition plan, the junta
will hand over power to a new government coming out of an
election to be organized by it at the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Koroma explained in his Thursday radio address that the plan
could "form the basis for further negotiations".
</P>
<P>
Although no reaction to Koroma's explanation has been heard
from ECOWAS, or the international community, analysts noted it
goes far away from the required immediate handover.
</P>
<P>
A military source here told Xinhua today that it could be
"impossible" for the talks to be resumed on the basis of the
junta's transition plan.

NANNING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese horticulturists
successfully bred their first batch of 60,000 ornamental plants,
"green giants", by introducing the new technology of cell
splitting.
</P>
<P>
Experts, from the Liuzhou Horticulture Research Institute in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, took cells out of
leaves, stems or stalks, to cultivate a new breed.
</P>
<P>
A research team of the institute has worked for plant asexual
reproduction since 1988.
</P>
<P>
The new breed is growing fast and is resistant to insect pests
and diseases while keeping the characteristics of the same kind,
according to the horticulturists.
</P>
<P>
They also said the first group of ornamental plants, now some
60,000 in number, are expected to extend to 200,000 plants by the
end of this year, and that they will have a bright market future.
</P>
<P>
So far, the new breed of "green giants" have been well
received by clients in south China's Guangzhou, Foshan and
Jinchengjiang cities.

<HEADLINE> Evacuees Return to German Flood Area As Water Recedes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Many people who fled the worst flood of
the century in eastern Germany during the past three weeks were
allowed to return homes as water levels on the flooded Oder River
continued to recede overnight.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that they had noticed no leaky spot along the
160-kilometer dike along the Oder River which separates Germany from
Poland. Water levels were retreating at a rate of about one centimeter
per hour throughout the flooded area.
</P>
<P>
In the southern region of the Oder, people were beginning to return
as the highest state of alarm was lift on Thursday. But in the
hardest-hit Ziltendorf flatland, where several villages had been
submerged up to rooftops, floodwaters were expected to take at least
one and half weeks to retreat completely from the current level of
1.80 meters.
</P>
<P>
Further downstream in the Oderbruch region in the north, the
situation remained serious enough to keep residents from returning to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
The water mass there still went down too slowly and continued to
mount high pressure on the sodden dike. The water levels should drop
at least one meter to justify a real relaxation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
After an unprecedented mobilization of rescue materials and
manpower, Germany has managed to escape the worst of the flooding
which has claimed over 100 lives of people in Poland and the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
In the next couple of days, many of the 11,000 German soldiers
brought in for the disaster will leave the flooded region, but others
will remain to help make the area livable.
</P>
<P>
The German government has set aside 500 million German marks (270
million U.S. dollars) to pay for the flood damage and to help rebuild
the region economically.

Biko died in police custody in September 1977 during the
apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
An official of the local government told a press conference in
King William's town that the Ginsberg cemetery in the city would
become a garden of remembrance because it was a resting place for
Biko's mentors and elders.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was attended by Biko's widow, Ntsiki,
members of the National Monument Council and councillors from
East London city and King William's town.
</P>
<P>
Ntsiki Biko said her late husband was banished to the house by
the apartheid regime. The house was now being used by her
Brother- in-law, Khaya Biko.

In 1976, an uprising by students in Soweto against the
apartheid education system spread throughout South Africa, on the
heels of a new black consciousness movement set up under Biko's
guidance to encourage black people to walk tall.
</P>
<P>
The arrest and killing of Biko in police custody created a
fresh outburst of the public anger.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Salvage Arms Deal with Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- South African Defense
Minister Joe Modise has said that he will visit the Middle East
to salvage two major arms deals with countries in the region,
which, he claimed, have been jeopardised by premature disclosure
in the media.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Business Day today quoted Modise as saying that
although he supported the concept of transparency, there were
limits to what the media should reveal.
</P>
<P>
Local mass media revealed in mid-July that South Africa
state-owned arms manufacturer Denel was trying to make a
1.6-billion U.S. dollar arms deal with a Middle East country,
believed to be Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The proposed weapons export deal, including mobile artillery
and anti-aircraft missiles, would be the biggest of its kind in
South African history, informed sources were quoted as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the report, Modise said that the disclosure in
the media might have resulted in loss of "thousands of jobs". "I
do not think our people want to pay such a high price for
information," he said.
</P>
<P>
Modise declined to identify which country South Africa is
making arms deal with, and refused to divulge when he would start
the Mideast journey.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Denel had spent millions over many years
to promote and market its products in the Middle East. Modise had
been involved in the promotion of the deals.

<HEADLINE> Australia, U.S. to Conduct Missile Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian Defense Minister Ian
McLachlan today declared a defense practice range in northwest
Western Australia for a series of surface to air missile launches
to be conducted by Australian and U.S. defense organizations next
month.
</P>
<P>
The planned launches aim to determine if the Jindalee radar can
detect missiles like the Iraqi Scuds fired during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The project, to be conducted by the Australian Defense Science
and Technology Organization and the U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization, has been named DUNDEE (down under early warning
experiment).
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the firing site was well away from any settled
areas.
</P>
<P>
He said four unarmed Terrier surface to air missiles would be
fired to splash down about 100 kilometers out to sea.
</P>
<P>
Access to the area near the launch site and impact zone will be
restricted at the time of firings, beginning in September, the
defense minister said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the aim is to investigate possible detection of
missile launches as soon after launch as possible and several
sensors would be used to collect data.
</P>
<P>
They include satellites, the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar at
central Australia's Alice Springs and the United States' own
portable over-the-horizon radar.
</P>
<P>
"Although Australia does not face a threat from such weapons
(Scuds missiles), it is prudent that we acquire an understanding
of ballistic missile defense technologies," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Project DUNDEE is an example of the strengthening of the
alliance relationship with the U.S. under the coalition government
and will add a significant contemporary dimension to the defense
relationship," he said.

<P>
LAGOS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will start exporting
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) next week from its Escravos Gas
Project in Delta State in the south, the Daily Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the project will be able to export 8,000
barrels or 1,509 tons of LPG per day, ensuring an annual income
of 92 million U.S. dollars, while the country's total gas export
stood at 15 million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Started in 1991, the Escravos Gas Project costs a total of 569
million dollars and is jointly financed by the Chevron Nigeria
Limited and the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
</P>
<P>
It marks the first substantial progress that Nigeria has made
in developing its rich gas resources, the majority of which is
flared into the air at various oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Much bigger than it is the 3.6-billion-dollar Nigeria
Liquefied Natural Gas Project financed by NNPC, Shell, Elf and
Agip, which is expected to be operational by 1999.
</P>
<P>
There are also the Oso Phase II Natural Gas Liquid by NNPC and

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Legislator Meets President Pro Tempore of US Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top legislator Qiao Shi
said here today he hoped that President Jiang Zemin's upcoming
visit to the US scheduled for this fall will achieve the
anticipated results and open up a new era of Sino-US ties oriented
to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC), made this remark during a
meeting today with Strom Thurmond, president pro tempore of the US
Senate.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, some positive progress has been made in
bilateral relations, with high-level exchange of visits increasing
and economic and trade co-operation advancing steadily, he said,
adding both sides are now making preparations for the visit, and
Sino-US ties are facing a good opportunity for further improvement
and development.
</P>
<P>
Qiao went on to say that China has always attached importance
to its relations with the US, and made unremitting efforts in this
regard. Although tremendous changes have taken place in the world
situation in the post-Cold War period, China and the US still
enjoy wide-ranging and important common interests, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the new historical conditions, he added, the demand of
maintaining and developing Sino-US cooperation has been kept
increasing, instead of being reduced, and there is a very great
potential for cooperation especially in their joint efforts to
safeguard world or regional peace, develop bilateral economic and
trade ties and promote the development and prosperity of the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
This is the basis for the continuous growth of Sino-US
relations and should become the common understanding of the two
countries and their people, Qiao noted.
</P>
<P>
China will never pose as a threat to the US, and at the turn of
the century, both countries should, proceeding from the need of
safeguarding the fundamental interests of the two peoples and
promoting the peace, stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific
region, strictly abide by the principles enshrined in the three
Sino-US joint communiques and maintain and constantly develop the
long-term stability, so as to contribute more in the new century.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Qiao gave the US visitors a briefing on the
structure and functions of the NPC as well as its legislative work.
</P>
<P>
Thurmond held that China and the US should combine efforts to
handle a number of major issues concerning trade, security, and
regional matters. Bilateral cooperation between the US and China
benefits not only the people of the two countries, but the people
of all countries in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thurmond also expressed the hope that the legislative bodies of
the two countries will enhance cooperation and dialogues, saying
this is conductive to the further development of bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Iran Lashes out at Latest U.S. Sanction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran's ex-president Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani today lashed out at the latest U.S. sanction,
terming it as "the declaration of psychological war against
Iran."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a large crowd of Friday prayers on the campus of
Tehran University, Rafsanjani said "the measure shows what kind
of people and what kind of power Iran is confronting."
</P>
<P>
The United States announced Thursday that it had dropped the
punishment ceiling from 40 million U.S. dollars of investment to
20 million dollars for foreign firms to invest in Iranian oil
and gas sectors.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the United States passed a law to punish no-
American companies which invest 40 million dollars or more in
Iranian oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the second largest oil exporter in the world, pumps 3.6
million barrels of oil per day and exports 2.5 million barrels
of crude per day.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry is the pillar of Iran's economy. Iran earns
about 14-16 billion dollars by exporting crude oil and the oil
export revenue accounts for about 70 percent of the total export.
</P>
<P>
However, Rafsanjani, who is now chief of the State Expediency
Council, said that nothing has happened to the Iranian industry
despite the U.S. sanction in the past year. "No development
projects has been affected," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was as if mosquito was making noise near to our ear," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Build Ethnographic Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
decided to build an ethnographic museum with a view to protecting
the country's diverse cultural identity, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The government has listed the construction of the museum in its
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002).
</P>
<P>
And land has been allocated for the museum in Champadevi, about
nine kilometers southwest of Kathmandu, capital of Nepal, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
A 21-member Nepal National Ethnographic Museum Management
Committee has also been established, including representatives
from the Sports and Culture Ministry, the Forests Ministry, the
Finance Ministry and other government departments.
</P>
<P>
Apart from preserving ancient culture and lifestyles of the 61
ethnic groups in Nepal, the proposed museum will also help
Nepalese and foreigners gain knowledge about all the ethnic groups
at one place, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of building an ethnographic museum in Nepal was
first discussed by anthropologists from the United States,
Germany, Britain, Norway, Sweden and India in Kathmandu about five
years ago, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Recalls Ambassador to U.S. for Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has recalled its
Ambassador to the United States Benjamin Kipkorir after he tabled
a wrong document on Kenya's constitutional reforms to the U.S.
congress.
</P>
<P>
Kipkorir was recalled at the end of his tour of duty on July
31 and replaced by Samson Chemai who has headed Kenya's mission
in Japan since August 1995, the Foreign Ministry confirmed in a
statement issued last night.
</P>
<P>
In a mix-up, Kipkorir presented to a sub-committee on Africa
in the U.S. House of Representatives last Wednesday draft bills
on Kenya's constitutional reforms from an opposition parliament
member instead of bills from the government.
</P>
<P>
The wrong document, which also bore Kenyan Attorney-General
Amos Wako's name, was part of two bills drafted by the opposition
seeking the repeal of laws charged as oppressive and review of
the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Reasons of such a gaffe are not available.
</P>
<P>
Disputes over constitutional reforms have become fierce in the
eastern African country. Clashes between the government and the
opposition pressing for reforms claimed 13 lives on July 7 around
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kipkorir, once the executive chairman of the Kenya Commercial
Bank, was appointed ambassador to the U.S. in March 1994. He was
also once the chief of the Institute of African Studies at the
University of Nairobi and a senior lecturer on history.
</P>
<P>
Chemai, a veteran engineer, was the Managing Director of Kenya
Posts and Telecommunication Corporation and the Director of Kenya
College of Communication Technology before he was moved into
diplomatic service.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- As more and more tourists are
coming, the scenic Wuyi Mountain has become more conscious about
the protection of its natural environment.
</P>
<P>
As part of the protection effort, a new organization -- the
"Wuyi Mountain Scenic Area Protection Association" -- will
formally go into business on August 18.
</P>
<P>
In coastal Fujian province, Wuyi Mountain draws over one
million tourists every year by its natural beauty and numerous
sites of historical interest.
</P>
<P>
"While welcoming tourists to visit the mountain, we've always
attached great importance to the protection of the forests, the
soil, the water and the environment", an administrative official
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Since the opening of the Wuyi Mountain Scenic Area in 1981,
efforts have been made to implement relevant State and local laws
governing the protection of the environment, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, over 20 sets of local rules and regulations
have been promulgated so far for the protection of the mountain's
environment.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the mountain was sited by visiting officials of
the World Tourism Organization in 1990 as a "good example of
environmental protection of the world".
</P>
<P>
Officials believe that the inauguration of the new association
will be conducive to environmental protection.

JOHANNESBURG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Cape Town's 2004 Olympic
bid received a huge shot in the arm on Thursday when the African
Amateur Athletics Confederation (AAAC) unanimously endorsed a
supporting decision.
</P>
<P>
The AAAC President Lamine Diack announced the decision in
Athens, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Diack said the body supports the bid, as the continent of
Africa deserves to be recognized for its contribution to
international athletics and the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
He was flanked by Ethiopia's 10,000 meter world champion Haile
Gebrselassie and South Africa's 400 meter hurdles silver medalist
Llewellyn Herbert.
</P>
<P>
Diack said the AAAC "pledged to be part of the process to
bring the Games to Africa for the first time".
</P>
<P>
"Africa must be given the opportunity to show that the
performances of its athletes can be matched by its ability to
stage the greatest sporting show on earth," he said.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A quick and cheap test kit for
the diagnosis of HIV (virus which causes AIDS) has been developed
by Kenyan and Japanese scientists in the eastern African country,
the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The kit, known as the Particle Agglutination HIV test (PA HIV
test), only takes some two hours to perform and costs about 60
Kenyan Shillings (around one U.S. Dollar), the scientists at the
Kenya Medical Research Institute were quoted as saying here.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the Elisa test which is widely used around the
world, the new method has a longer shelf life and does not
require sophisticated equipment or highly-skilled manpower, said
Dr. Davy Koech, the director of the institute.
</P>
<P>
The new kit thus can be used in rural health centers, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The kit has been tested on 300 samples with an accuracy of
more than 98 percent, said Koech.

CANBERRA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
weaker today following heavy selling by U.S. investment houses
overnight which pushed the unit down to levels not seen in just
over two years.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar hit a low of 72.93 US cents, a level not
seen since July 1995. It managed to close a little higher in
Sydney at 73.15 US cents, but down from 73.58 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Offshore players sold the currency following the release
Thursday of domestic labor force data, which showed there was
still a way to go before the jobs market improved.
</P>
<P>
The data was published amid some debate over whether the
Reserve Bank of Australia could cut the official cash rate a sixth
time, in the current economic cycle.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange traders said the risk was weighted toward some
further downside in the exchange rate in the near term.

The currency probably would hold between 72.80 and 73.30 US
cents in the near term, said John Radinoff, SBC Warburg Australian

NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has reaffirmed
its commitment to finance energy projects in Kenya and expressed
its willingness to fund more projects, Kenyan Energy Minister
Kirugi M'Nyjubdua was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister told a press conference held here Thursday that
the World Bank had approved some 136 million U.S. Dollars for
energy projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the suspension of aid by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) would not directly affect the funding of
energy projects by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that "we negotiate with the World Bank and
not the IMF for project support. We have no problem with the
World Bank. We have had meetings with them and they have been
very understanding."
</P>
<P>
A World Bank mission which is on a visit to Kenya has
reaffirmed its commitment to finance energy projects. he noted.
</P>
<P>
M'Mukindia pointed out that other donors had committed funds
for power projects as a result of implementation of reforms by
his ministry.
</P>
<P>
The IMF decided on July 31 to halt the three-year Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility because of the alleged corruption
in Kenya's government departments.
</P>
<P>
IMF's loan suspension has triggered a depreciation in Kenyan
Shilling, and raised speculations that some other international

SHENYANG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang city, capital of
Liaoning province, has provided assistance to over 230,000 local
employees, including 130,000 workers from state firms, through the
city government's program to help poor urban families.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang, with over 10,000 enterprises and more than two
million factory workers, is a major heavy industrial base in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the city government set up a special fund with
contributions coming from the government revenue, social security
funds and donations from profit-making companies and individuals.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the fund, dubbed as the "Warm Program", has
collected nearly 50 million yuan and will be used to help
"extremely poor workers" in the city, who are numbered at nearly
40,000 at present.
</P>
<P>
Poor families will receive help from the fund when they need
financial assistance. Officials in charge often visit poor
families and distribute relife money.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city government has issued a series of policies
to help these families. So far, over 10,000 poor families have
been covered by the official poverty-relief network which has kept
a file of all the poor families.

CANBERRA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Wool prices dropped sharply at
this week's sales before stabilizing, the Australian Council of
Wool Exporters (ACWE) said today.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Market Indicator closed at 696 Australian cents
(508 U.S. cents) a clean kilogram, down 22 Australian cents.
</P>
<P>
"Although prices stabilized on the last day of selling, with
more widespread competition evident at the lower price basis, the
extent of the drop in prices earlier in the week surprised most
exporters," the council said in its weekly market review.
</P>
<P>
A total of 87,841 bales were offered this week, with a pass-in
rate of 16.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The council blamed continuing relatively high offerings for
this time in the season, holidays in the northern hemisphere and
an appreciating Australian dollar against European currencies for
a short-term negative impact on the market.
</P>
<P>
"There was, however, a noticeable increase in Chinese inquiry
at the lower price basis as the week progressed, particularly for
coarser micron wool."
</P>
<P>
About 100,150 bales are roistered for sale in Sydney, Adelaide
and Fremantle next week.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- President Charles Taylor of
Liberia has signed into law his first bill which clarified the
role of the west African peacekeeping force operating in his
country.
</P>
<P>
By the enactment, which was in effect from last Tuesday, the
peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, has been limited to the
maintenance of security while the police and the judiciary handle
civil and criminal matters.
</P>
<P>
The legislation also empowers Taylor to contact the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on further ECOMOG
assignment, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was sent by ECOWAS to Liberia in 1990 at the heat of
the country's civil war, which was ignited by the then factional
leader Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Its efforts have brought to the successful disarmament and
demobilization of the warring factions, and finally ensured the
July 19 elections that put Taylor to the nation's top seat.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed in Abuja, Nigeria, by the
factional leaders a year ago, ECOMOG will help restructure the
Liberian army and police force in six months after the new
government is in place on August 2.
</P>
<P>
The stay of ECOMOG, however, may be extended because the
training of the forces has not begun.

KUALA LUMPUR, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and the Philippines
today agreed to take an immediate action to address the problems
of illegal activities in the Sulu Sea and upgrading communication
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the five-day fourth
Malaysia-Philippines Border Patrol Coordinating Group (BPCG)
Meeting which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian delegation was led by Rear Admiral Tuan Hashim
Tuan Mohamad, director of the Maritime Enforcement Coordinating
Center (MECC) in the Department of National Security, and the
Philippines by Commander of the Philippine Southern Command Lt-Gen
Romeo A. Padiernos.
</P>
<P>

<P>
The Malaysian delegation leader said "serious considerations
and actions should be undertaken to overcome this problem which
poses a threat to the economy and stability in this area."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and the Philippines held a joint operation
"successfully" in April. The meeting here agreed that such
operations should continue for the mutual benefit of both
countries, he said.

<P>
In addition to some large water conservation projects, there is

<HEADLINE> Australian Share Market Down Due to BHP Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
closed on a depressed note, dragging down at the close by troubled
blue chip resource company BHP.
</P>
<P>
Shaw Stockbroking's Jamie Spiteri said the market bellwether
had taken a big hit in trading following the announcement of BHP
Petroleum head John O'Connor's resignation just before the close.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest hit is BHP and it's reflected in the resource
stock and in the general index," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think it now requires very serious assessment. It seems
obvious there's quite a lot of animosity building on the board."
</P>
<P>
At the close, BHP's shares were down 45 cents to 16.99
Australian dollars, continuing their market slide in the wake of
BHP minerals head Dick Carter's shock departure and the company's
review of its global assets.
</P>
<P>
The turmoil was reflected in the all ordinaries index, which
fell 6.3 to 2711.4.
</P>
<P>
Coca Cola Amatil took a toll on earlier trading with a drop in
value, but clawed its way back, closing three cents down to 16.14
Australian dollars, following yesterday's 25.6 cent decline over
analysts' concerns over the group's European interim profits.
</P>
<P>
The soft drink giant revealed on Wednesday a 69.7 percent rise
in net profit to 98.1 million Australian dollars (72.59 million
U.S. dollars) for the six months to June 30, including a 40
million Australian dollar (29.6 million U.S. dollar) net profit
from its newly acquired Philippines operations.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index was up 1.6 points to 4383.8, compared
with a fall of 14.2 points to 1404.4 in the all resources index.
</P>
<P>
In the resources sector, Rio Tinto rose 45 cents to 21.30
Australian dollars, Western Mining dropped 16 to 7.49 Australian
dollars and Woodside Petroleum dropped 23 to 11.22 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index was up 3.8 points to 1283.6 after the precious
metal increased to 321.60 U.S. dollars in spot trading, from
318.85 U.S. dollars late last night.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector closed 12.6 points to 5174.7. ANZ dropped
eight to 10.40 Australian dollars and NAB was down three cents to
19.63 Australian dollars, while CBA was up 25 cents to 16.82
Australian dollars and Westpac rose three to 8.58 Australian
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Helps Southeast China Develop Aquatic Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong and China's Fujian
province are taking advantage of their geographic proximity to
develop Fujian's aquatic sector.
</P>
<P>
To Fujian, Hong Kong is the second largest aquatic market and
an important transfer point. In 1996, some 20 percent of Fujian's
exported aquatic products were sold on the Hong Kong market or
went to other countries and regions via Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
And Fujian imports 50 million US dollars worth of aquatic
products and related products through Hong Kong annually. About
200 million young eels go to Fujian via Hong Kong every year, for
example.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has invested heavily in Fujian's aquatic sector. By
the end of 1996, there were 480 Sino-overseas joint ventures
engaged in aquatic production in Fujian, with a total investment
of 360 million US dollars, including 183 million dollars from Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has also played a unique role in ties between the
mainland and Taiwan and has introduced funds and advanced
technology from Taiwan and provided temporary storage for aquatic
products being sold to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Fujian has worked hard promoting the aquatic
industry, and aquatic output was 2.85 million tons in 1996, or
1.66 million tons more than that of 1990.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Fujian's Xiamen city signed an agreement with Hong
Kong to build a fishing port at a cost of 64 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Parliamentary Speaker Denies Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Speaker of the
People's Assembly (Parliament) Ahmed Fathi Sorour has denied that
he would pay a visit to Iraq to mend Arab fences, according to
Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Sorour informed Kuwaiti Speaker of
National Assembly Ahmad Al-Saadoun during a telephone
conversation Thursday that he would not take up such a step
without notifying the parties concerned, including Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi newspaper reported Thursday that Sorour, who is
also head of the International and Arab Parliamentary Unions,
would soon visit Baghdad on a mission aimed at mediating to
improve the Arab relations soured since the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Sorour told his Kuwaiti counterpart that "such reports were
baseless."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait started this year a reconciliation process with
respect to relations with countries it regarded as pro-Iraq
during the Gulf War which liberated it from Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
But it refused to reconcile with Iraq under President Saddam
Hussein and as long as the issue of prisoners of war is not
solved.
</P>
<P>
Al-Saadoun said his conversations with Sorour were in line
with regular contacts with his Arab colleagues to follow up
the latest developments in the parliamentary arenas.
</P>
<P>
He again asserted the importance of a full Iraqi compliance
with the international resolutions related to its invasion of
Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Lifts Ban on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has lifted
its air travel ban on Burundi and allowed Burundi to purchase
"limited amounts" of fuel from Kenya "on humanitarian grounds",
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
This came after a petition by Burundian President Pierre
Buyoya and ahead of a ministerial technical committee meeting set
for Uganda's capital Kampala next week on Burundi situation.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs Sheldon Muchilwa
was quoted as saying that transport operators including U.N.
agencies are no longer required to seek clearance on flights
between Kenya and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"It is the government's view that the political situation in
the Great Lakes region has fundamentally changed and warrants a
fresh examination of the sanctions issue," said Muchilwa.
</P>
<P>
Following a regional summit on the Burundi conflict on April
16, 1997, sanctions on the tiny central African country were
eased on food, education, medicine, agricultural inputs and
construction materials.
</P>
<P>
The Great Lakes countries slapped economic sanctions on
Burundi last year when Buyoya wrested power from the civilian
government of former president Sylvester Ntibantunganya in a
military coup.

<HEADLINE> Artificial Rain Eases Water Shortage in Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xinin, August 8 (Xinhua) -- China induced 200 million cubic
meters of artificial rainfall over Qinghai province during the
past three months as a way to increase water flow in the Yellow
River.
</P>
<P>
The river, the second largest in China that provides irrigation
for seven provinces in north and northwest China, has been plagued
by frequent drought these last six to seven years.
</P>
<P>
The reduced water volume causes flowcuts in the lower reaches
of the river each year, which bring about heavy losses to
industrial and agricultural production alone the river banks.
</P>
<P>
Beginning late last April, the Qinghai Meteorological
Department started to make artificial rain in the region which is
in the upper reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
According to hydrological officials, the operation will
continue till the end of September, and the goal is to add another
280 million cubic meters of water to the Yellow River flow.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Sets Bottom Line for Workers' Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province in east China is
taking steps to guarantee the bottom line of the living expenses
for the workers.
</P>
<P>
The province decided in 1995 that wages employers pay to their
workers are not allowed to be lower than the local minimum wage
standard.
</P>
<P>
It then adopted a bottom-line policy and put forward three
monthly salary standards based on different jobs: 210, 175 and 140
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Now the figures have been raised to 280, 250 and 210 yuan. One
or two percent of the province's workers are benefiting from the
practice.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu began to carry out the unemployment insurance system in
the 1980s, which now have covered 6.38 million workers, accounting
for 88 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The province has raised 1.13 billion yuan of unemployment
insurance funds, and provided unemployment relief for some 200,000
workers, living subsidies for 837,000 laid-offs, and helped
440,000 find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
It began last year to provide 100-140 yuan aid to poor urban
residents, whose monthly income is lower than local minimum wage
standards. And those who lost labor ability and above 70 years old
will get 10-20 percent more. Financial departments have paid 10
million yuan to more than 70,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Continue its Peacekeeping Mission in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi has stressed his country's continuous commitment to
peacekeeping mission in south Lebanon despite the disastrous
helicopter crash Wednesday night, the Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
Prodi carried out a whistlestop visit in Beirut Thursday
night and held a meeting with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi in
the presence of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, according to the
English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"I came to Lebanon to express the sorrow of the Italian
people and government for the loss of the four Italian soldiers
and the Irishman who gave their lives in the defense of peace,"
Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
The five men died when their helicopter, an Italian Bell
Augusta, of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in which
they were serving, crashed in an Israeli-occupied border strip
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said the cause of the crash had not been determined,
adding that an Italian team had joined UNIFIL experts in the
search for clues.
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out sabotage, saying that "there is no reason why
there should be such an act against the Italians."
</P>
<P>
Insisting that Rome's commitment to the peacekeeping task
remains unchanged, the premier said that "we paid a price but our
continued contribution is essential for peace. This is our duty
and we will fulfill it."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Prodi was in Israel where he paid his last respects
to the five peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The victims' bodies, retrieved shortly after the incident
from the wreckage at At-Tiri village in the Israeli-controlled
buffer zone in south Lebanon, had been placed in coffins at Tel
Aviv's Abu Kabir forensic institute.
</P>
<P>
Recounting the incident, a UNIFIL officer was quoted as
saying that the helicopter apparently flew into the side of a
hill in the thick fog shrouding At-Tiri.
</P>
<P>
The crash has raised the number of U.N. peacekeeper's death to
214 since the 4,500-strong UNIFIL was first sent to south
Lebanon in 1978 under the U.N. Security Council Resolution
425.

<HEADLINE> Car Fuel Prices Rise to New High in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Strengthening U.S. dollars and
weakening petroleum markets have combined to pump up the car fuel
prices in Belgium to a new high since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Within two days, the Belgian Economic Ministry twice rewrote
the price tags and motorists now have to pay 40.10 Belgian francs
(1.02 dollars) for a liter of the Super 98 gasoline (unleaded) and
42.30 francs (1.08 dollars) for the Super gasoline, 0.4 to 0.5
francs more on a liter, the newspaper La Libre Belgique reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Local economists feared that car fuel prices may rise further
as they have always done in the past decade and may even shoot to
an all-time high in the near future.
</P>
<P>
But the newspaper quoted them as saying that the chance for a
down-spinning inflation is limited.
</P>
<P>
A liter of Super 98 sold at 28.10 francs (74 cents) per liter
in July 1989 when the exchange rate was at around 38 francs for a
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate was 38.975 francs for a dollar today as
against 37.60 francs for the dollar at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian francs have been losing ground against the dollar
ever since the Mexican peso crisis in late 1994 and early 1995.

<HEADLINE> 75 Percent of Ugandans Suffer From Goiter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- About 75 percent of Ugandan
population suffers from goiter due to lack of iodine in their
food and drinking water, local paper, The Monitor, reported
today.
</P>
<P>
According to John T. Kakitahi, an associate professor at the
Institution of Public Health, goiter causes severe brain damage
and stunted growth in children.
</P>
<P>
Kakitahi sponsored a survey with other experts in 1992 and
1996 on the theme. He said that the lack of iodine in their food
and drinking water has given rise to precocity, with girls' early
grown breasts, and boys' adult voice and dwarf bodies.
</P>
<P>
He enumerated districts of Kapchorwa in the east, Kabale and
Hoima in the west and Mubende in the center as the worst-hit
areas of goiter where the disease rate is as high as from 62 to
78 percent of the whole population.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, lack of iron also affects Ugandans. Many
miscarriages are caused by lack of iron.
</P>
<P>
He adviced Ugandans to add iodine in their salt.

ANKARA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) is to grant a
one-billion-U.S. dollar loan to support Turkey's eight-year
compulsory education reform.
</P>
<P>
The money is part of a total of 1.5-billion-dollar WB aid

</P>
<P>
The eight-year compulsory reform bill, proposed by Turkish
Education Ministry, are now under a white hot debate in the
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The controversial bill have triggered strong opposition from
the pro-Islamic Welfare Party led by former prime minister
Necmettin Erbakan since its adoption because it will possibly
lead to the closure of religious schools.
</P>
<P>
The Welfare Party vowed that they would use all means to
block the approval of the education bill.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Income of Beijing Residents Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The majority of the residents in
Beijing are living an ever better life as their income grows.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the Municipal Statistics Bureau divided the
three million-plus families in Beijing into five categories based
on their 1996 income:
</P>
<P>
Poor family -- this group of families numbers 16,000, or 4.4
percent of the total. With an income less than 10,000 yuan (about
1,200 US dollars) a year, they just wish to make their ends
meet. Some of the retirees, factory layoffs, or physically
disabled people are in this group;
</P>
<P>
Families able to feed and cloth themselves -- such families
account for 10.2 percent of Beijing's total. They include
wage-earners with no other source of income. Most of them live in
suburban counties;
</P>
<P>
Families with relatively comfortable living conditions -- this
refers to families making 16,000 yuan to 35,000 yuan a year. More
than 68 percent of the households in the capital belong to this
category. Most of them work in government departments and
organizations or are employees of large state-run enterprises;
</P>
<P>
Better-off families -- they include 360,000 households, or 15
percent of the total. They consist of self-employed businessmen or
people working as senior staffers in foreign-funded companies in
Beijing. Their income range from 35,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan;
</P>
<P>
Wealthy families -- two percent of Beijing households belong to
this category which make more than 100,000 yuan a year. They are
mostly private entrepreneurs, legal persons of share-holding
companies, construction project contractors, movie stars or pop
singers.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen Prepares for Property Rights Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The '97 China Enterprise Merger
and Investment Fair will be held in Xiamen, a port city in China's
Fujian Province early this September.
</P>
<P>
The fair, which is sponsored by the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economic System, the Industrial Development
Organization of the United Nations, and the Xiamen city
government, will provide a place for overseas investors to get
involved in state-owned enterprises and negotiating property
rights. And Chinese textile and cement producers who want to
invest in other developing countries will have an opportunity to
look for partners.
</P>
<P>
"The fair will provide a chance for China's large enterprises
to talk about merging smaller ones as well," local officials say.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to have more than 1,000 mergers this year,
since it has become a popular way for the state sector to get rid
of its heavy losses. But this has also triggered a sharp increase
in the number of unemployed workers who used to believe in "cradle
to grave" welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
There will be many investment possibilities announced at the
event, in the food, drink, chemical, electronics, auto-parts,
energy, transportation, telecommunications and environmental
protection industries.
</P>
<P>
The organization committee says that they have received various
feedback from both Chinese and overseas enterprises, saying most
of them will attend the event.

<HEADLINE> North China Province Preserves Ancient Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Shanxi province plans to
raise more money for cultural relics preservation and to increase
the number of ancient buildings being protected.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi has more than 18,400 historical sites, ancient
buildings, and cave temples. Over 9,000 of them are made of wood,
and more than a hundred were built before the 10th century. The
buildings are scattered all across the province, making the
maintenance work very difficult, experts say.
</P>
<P>
The province is a "treasure-house of Chinese ancient buildings"
and has already spent over 70 million yuan (8.75 million US
dollars) since the 1980s to preserve its historical buildings from
different dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, the province has had 16 state-level and
58 province-level cultural relics preservation projects.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Research Institute for Preservation of Ancient
Buildings, with the support of many prominent experts and advanced
computer systems, has been devoting itself to the study, design,
planning, and work of most of the preservation projects.

<HEADLINE> Israel Arrests 200 Palestinians in 10 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces
arrested 12 Palestinians in the West Bank Thursday night,
bringing the number of Palestinians picked up since the suicide
bombing attack on July 30 to over 200.
</P>
<P>
In the 10-day sweeping campaign to crack down on the
infrastructure of Hamas and other radical Palestinian
organizations in the areas still under Israeli occupation,
Israeli soldiers and undercover units raided mosques and other
institutions affiliated with Hamas and confiscated what Israel
believed inflammatory materials, according to a report of the
state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) even arrested those so-called
hostile Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Fearing an outbreak of violence at the end of today's
prayers in the mosques, security forces have beefed up their
positions in the West Bank including East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there has been no breakthrough in identifying the
two suicide bombers who killed 13 Israelis and wounded 168 in
their bombing attack at the Mahaneh Yehuda Market in Jerusalem
on July 30. Some reports said that they came from Ein Hilwe refugee
camp in Lebanon, while others claimed they were from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities originally concluded that the two men
were just the two Hamas activists in a village near Hebron,
who were missing more than a year ago. But blood-tests of
the families proved wrong.

HANGZHOU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hangzhou Railway Station,
believed to be the last old one of the kind in Chinese provincial
capitals, has been demolished to pave the way for the construction
of a new railway hub.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-two years ago, a group of local businesses collected
money to build Zhejiang province's first railway linking Hangzhou
with Ningbo and Suzhou, as well as the Hangzhou Railway Station.
</P>
<P>
The railway station was destroyed during the war years and
rebuilt in 1939.
</P>
<P>
A symbolic structure of Hangzhou during the past half century,
the railway station was inadequate to handle the increasing
passenger flows in recent years. The passenger flow at the station
was 1.324 million at the beginning of the 1950s, and the number
grew to 8.011 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The new station will be a modern one, with a designed capacity
of accommodating 5,200 passengers at the peak time.

<HEADLINE> Wiping Out Illiteracy in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of illiterate people in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has fallen from
1949's 90 percent to four percent of the total population after
several decades of work.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region has 16 million people, 76 percent of whom
are farmers and herdsmen. As a relatively backward region in terms
of economic development, it has been praised by the State and by
the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) in anti-illiteracy effort.
</P>
<P>
To wipe out illiteracy efforts, the regional government
allocates more than a million yuan (about 125,000 US dollars)
every year for the campaign, and laws and regulations related to
the work have been promulgated.
</P>
<P>
Technical training schools for farmers and herdsmen have also
been set up in more than 80 percent of the towns and counties in
the region. The local government has also worked hard to provide
education opportunities for school-age children, which has
successfully prevented an increase in illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the region's urban illiteracy rate has been
brought down to below two percent, lower than the state's
standards.

<HEADLINE> Peace in Angola Conducive to Regional Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The final peace in Angola will
enable the country to play a greater role in eastern and southern
Africa, an official with the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Erastus Mwencha, the acting secretary for the regional
organization, made the remark at a press conference at the end of
his four-day visit to Angola.
</P>
<P>
He said that the eastern and southern African region has a
strong desire for integration and earnestly hopes that the final
peace in Angola will be realized at an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
On his Angola tour, the official said that his visit has
achieved "positive" result and provided him with an opportunity
to know for himself that Angola has rich natural resources and a
great potential for future development, especially in
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Angola should make full use of the resources for development,
he said.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that the war in Angola has deterred the
country from fully carrying out the plan of the organization, and
forced the organization to waive its membership fees until a
final peace is materialized.
</P>
<P>
He said the Angolan entrepreneurs have a keen interest in
regional trade and so his organization will establish an
information center in the country to help them exchange
information with their regional counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The common market, he said, will send an expert delegation to
Angola to make market investigation.
</P>
<P>
The 23-member Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA), founded in 1994, is an organization that has grown from
the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa
(PTA). Its headquarters is located in Lusaka, Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Strike staged in Philippine Transport Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Transport and labor groups in the
Philippines started today a planned nationwide strike to pressure
the government to lower prices of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
In Metro Manila, the protesters took to the streets at as early
as 4 a.m. after government officials failed to persuade their
leaders to abandon the strike.
</P>
<P>
The protesters assured the public that their action would be
peaceful, but it inevitably caused serious traffic jams and had
many passengers stranded, especially in the southern part of Metro
Manila.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces and the Philippine National Police had sent
trucks to ferry trapped passengers in affected routes.
</P>
<P>
The strike did not affect Makati City, the commercial center of
the capital city, because two jeepny driver organizations in the
area had refused to join the strike.
</P>
<P>
Classes in all elementary and secondary schools had been
suspended while colleges and universities were given the option to
declare class suspension.
</P>
<P>
The police said there are so far no untoward incidents
reported. It is also unknown whether strikes were also staged in
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil prices of petroleum products went up as a
result of the recent devaluation of the Philippine peso.

the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
A bilateral air services agreement was reached this week by

The money is for navigation and other services.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also revised the existing route schedules and

<P>
The routes to be operated by Nigeria Airways are
Lagos-Douala-Entebbe-Nairobi-Bombay.

to cash flow problems.

SHANGHAI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The "Children's World"
Foundation of Shanghai, China's commercial and trade center, has
gained a reputation for itself over the past ten years for its
good results in working with children.
</P>
<P>
The non-governmental organization was started by several
prominent persons in 1987, and lists China's well-known writer, Ba
Jin, as an honorary chairman. It owns a part-time art school for
children and has 53 teaching centers for more than 6,300

city-level art competitions.
</P>
<P>
It has helped finance five kindergartens, which have provided
an education for nearly 4,000 children in four of the city's
districts and have won several honors given by the municipal or
district government.
</P>
<P>
While the number of children in other kindergartens generally
seems to be on the decline, these five kindergartens have had to
set up five more classes. One of them is even planning to expand
by building a branch kindergarten of 1,500 square meters.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the municipal government, the foundation set
up a children's museum that has had some 200,000 visitors since it

therapies to treat 89 comatose patients.

Zhang Keven, a young college student, regained consciousness
thanks to the hospital's treatment program. Zhang recovered from a
two-month coma and walked out of the hospital with the help of

and restricted eye movement, with medical terminology for the
symptoms known as a "continuous vegetative state".

including the use of high-pressure oxygen, herbal medicines,
surgery, nutrition, and physical therapy.

in a vegetative state for an average 40 days, some have regained
consciousness within only one week.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Closes Last Straw Pulp Production Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
metropolitan area, closed its last straw pulp production line on
August 1 to improve the water quality of the Huangpu River, the
major river bisecting the city.
</P>
<P>
The production of straw pulp, formerly one of the major raw
materials produced by Shanghai's paper mills, created heavy
effluent wastewater discharges into the Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
Heavy wastewater pollution sparked the closure of numerous
paper mills in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua Paper Mill failed to thoroughly solve related
problems despite investing more than 18 million yuan (2.2 million
US dollars) in wastewater treatment efforts.
</P>
<P>
The mill conducted two years of intensive research and decided
to close its straw pulp production line in order to promote
environmental protection, a decision which will most likely reduce
the mill's profits by a substantial margin.

<HEADLINE> More Ricefields to Be Affected by Drought in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The acreage of Indonesian
ricefields affected by drought is expected to reach some
250,000-300,000 hectares up to the end of this year, Agriculture
Minister Sjarifudin Baharsjah said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The affected areas would not be in as serious conditions as in

Antara news agency today quoted the minister as saying.
</P>

The minister said the acreage of ricefields totally damaged was
also smaller than that in 1994 but he made no prediction for this

<HEADLINE> Katyusha Rockets Fall in Israel's North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- In escalation of violent
clashes, several Katyusha rockets fell early this morning inside
Israel's north, injuring three people and damaging a Jewish
synagogue.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that some Katyusha rockets fell in
Israel's northern border town of Kiryat Shimona, no one was
injured in the shelling. But one rocket hit a populated area at
the so-called "pan-handle" of the Lake Kinneret (Or Sea of
Garlilee), damaging a synagogue and hurting one woman who was
injured by flying glass from shattered windows.
</P>
<P>
Local residents heard loud explosions at about 6 a.m. in the
morning. The shelling could have caused more casualties if it
came a bit late because many people usually go to the synagogue
to do the morning prayer.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Israel
suspected it to be carried out by the anti-Israeli Hezbollah
(Party of God) guerrilla forces which have been fighting
Israel's occupation of South Lebanon. But in the past, the
militant Palestinian groups based in south Lebanon also shelled
occasionally Israel's north in a bid to escalate the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Today's Katyusha shelling is a sign of escalated clashes
between Israel and the Hezbollah forces which have vowed to
retaliate for the Monday killing of five Hezbollah fighters,
including two commanders, in north of the Israeli-claimed South
Lebanon Security Zone. The five were killed in the explosion of
a roadside bomb planned by Israeli special army units.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Hezbollah forces heavily shelled Israeli army
positions along the northern border Wednesday night with rocket
and mortar bombardments. A number of rounds fell inside Israeli
territory, but there were no casualties.
</P>
<P>
One Lebanese mother and her two children were killed in the
security zone in the explosion of a roadside bomb suspected by
Israel to be planted by Hezbollah. Meanwhile, a soldier from the
pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army was killed when his car hit a
roadside bomb.
</P>
<P>
This morning's shelling was launched after Israeli defense
officials tried to calm the situation by sending out a message
that Israel did not intend to escalate the tension.
</P>
<P>
Both Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Northern Command
commander Amiram Levine, who visited Kiryat Shimona Thursday,
said Israel would try to avoid an escalation by ordering its
troops to exercise restraint following the Wednesday shelling.
</P>
<P>
But they warned Hezbollah against making a mistake by
carrying on the rocket attack in violation of the ceasefire
understanding reached in April last year after Israel's Operation
Grapes of Wrath. In the ceasefire accord, both sides have
promised to refrain from targeting civilians and using the civilian
cover for any military attacks.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Job Seekers Turn To New Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan job seekers are
turning to new labor markets instead of the traditional Middle
East, according to bank sector sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the number of Sri Lanka migrant workers to the
Middle East are declining while the number of migrants to the
Maldives, Singapore, Hongkong and Italy are increasing.
</P>
<P>
But still the bulk of Sri Lanka's migrant workers of about half
a million is in the Middle East. The majority of Sri Lankans who
go to the new destinations are low paid housemaids and unskilled
workers.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore 81 percent of Sri Lankan migrant workers are
housemaids while in the case of the Maldives development of the
tourist industry there has contributed to the increased demand for
foreign labor, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
The structure of the demand for labor is biased towards
unskilled labor. About 91 percent of the female migrants are
employed as housemaids while 44 percent of the male migrants are
unskilled laborers.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan workers have been employed increasingly in
Singapore, Hong Kong and Italy recent years, said the sources,
adding that Sri Lanka seeks to extend its labor market there.

<HEADLINE> Feature: ASEAN Starts Celebrating 30th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) today started a year-long celebration of its
30th anniversary with a flag-hoisting ceremony and the release of
30 white doves at the ASEAN Secretariat building here.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attempt to show the power of the regional
grouping, the marching band chosen to entertain the guests at the
ceremony is called the Bulldozer, which played the ASEAN theme
song and other music.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, which was attended by ambassadors and
diplomats from the nine members of the grouping, ASEAN Secretary
General Ajit Singh said the ASEAN has virtually realized the
vision of its founding fathers to establish a regional community
of all the 10 states in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
By realizing the 10-state ASEAN vision, the ASEAN would "bind
themselves together in friendship and cooperation and, through
joint efforts and sacrifices, secure for their peoples and for
posterity the blessings of peace, freedom and prosperity," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Laos and Myanmar joined the ASEAN last month and the entry of
Cambodia is merely a matter of time, he added.
</P>
<P>
Singh praised the achievements made by the ASEAN since its
formation 30 years ago, saying the ASEAN has become the fourth
largest trading entity in the world as well as the most dynamic
with a gross domestic product that boasts an average growth rate
of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Singh pointed out that the ASEAN is standing at a crossroads --
that of the conclusion of one generation and the commencement of
another. "Of the days to come, one thing is certain -- the
challenges before us are immeasurable," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow belongs to today's children," he declared.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN was established on August 8, 1967, in Bangkok,
Thailand, with the signing of the Bangkok Declaration by the five
original member countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Brunei Darussalam joined the grouping in 1984 while Vietnam
became the seventh member in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN admitted Laos and Myanmar as full members at a
ceremony held in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, on July 23 this year.
</P>
<P>
The accession of Cambodia, which was supposed to join the ASEAN
simultaneously with Laos and Myanmar, was postponed due to
problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the ASEAN Secretariat, besides activities arranged
by the secretariat, regional and country activities will be
organized to celebrate the ASEAN's birthday. ASEAN missions in
other countries as well as dialogue partner countries will also
hold a series of commemorative activities.
</P>
<P>
Official celebrations will be kicked off in earnest tonight
when Indonesian President Soeharto hosts a lavish reception here.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the year-long celebrations is expected to be
the commemorative ASEAN informal summit to be held in Kuala Lumpur
from December 14 to 16, 1997, and attended by the ASEAN heads of
state and government.

NEW YORK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from China, the

and South Korea ended here today their first session of the
preparatory meeting for the four-party talks on a peace mechanism
on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The second session is scheduled to be held in New York in

</P>
<P>
They also discussed procedural issues concerning the four-party
talks, including the date, participating levels, venue and agenda,
sources close to the session told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Agreements were reached on the date, participating levels and
venue although there are still some differences on the agenda of

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Embarks on Agricultural Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian agricultural reform is
underway to bring about more functional management, a senior
Ukrainian official told a news briefing today.
</P>
<P>
Yuri Karasyk, minister of the Ukrainian Agro-Industrial
Complex, said his ministry planned to introduce new economic
mechanisms to boost agricultural modernization. The granting of
long-term loans to farmers could be a concrete step.
</P>
<P>
Another important measure was the establishment of an Equipment
Lease Fund to develop agricultural engineering, said Karasyk.
</P>
<P>
The Fund would be set up with money from the state and
interested people. The money previously allocated for grain
purchases would also go to the Fund.
</P>
<P>
Sergi Ryzguk, deputy minister of the Agro-industrial Complex,
disclosed that the state has decided to cancel its contracts for
grain, sugar and sunflower seeds next year.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Again Suffers Setback in House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Front government was
severely embarrassed in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of
parliament) on Thursday when the opposition Bharatiya Janata party
(BJP) forced the defeat of a bill sponsored by the government, the
Indian Express said today.
</P>
<P>
The bill was brought about to amend the country's presidential
and vice-presidential elections act adopted in 1952.
</P>
<P>
This was the second setback that the government suffered in the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
The 13-party United Front government on Wednesday suffered a
major embarrassment when it was forced to withdraw a controversial
bill on insurance reform in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of
parliament).
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral went to the Rajya Sabha on
Thursday evening to plead with the BJP to pass the ordinance
designed to amend the presidential and vice- presidential
elections act but the BJP refused to accede to his request.
</P>
<P>
The BJP, instead, pressed for a voting on a statutory
resolution moved by the party earlier in the day disapproving the
bill introduced by the government.
</P>
<P>
The government was hopeless outnumbered because many members of
the Congress Party which supports the government from outside have
gone to Calcutta, West Bengal, to attend a crucial plenary of the
party on August 8-10.
</P>
<P>
The BJP resolution disapproving the government-sponsored bill
was passed in a voice vote without a division.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said Thursday that Ung Huot's election as Cambodia's first
prime minister is the country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Attending an Association of Southeast Asian Nations ceremony
here last night, Alatas said the recognition or non-recognition of
Ung Huot as Cambodia's first prime minister is nothing to
Indonesia, because Indonesia's recognition applies to the state,
not the government of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian's National Assembly on Wednesday approved the
nomination of Foreign Minister Ung Huot as the country's new first
prime minister in place of Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
Asked about ASEAN's attitude to Ung Huot's election, Alatas
said: "We must wait until a ministerial meeting convenes in
Singapore next Monday."
</P>
<P>
Cambodia was scheduled to join ASEAN last month, but was barred
from entry following the political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, is
making efforts to find a solution to Cambodia's political crisis.

<HEADLINE> More Disabled People In Shanghai Going to College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- When his long-time dream of
going to college finally came true two years ago, Yuan Jifeng, who
has a disability, decided to be number one in his class.
</P>
<P>
Yuan is a student at China's first college for people with
disabilities, which was started by Shanghai Television University
and Shanghai Disabled Persons' Federation in 1995. Its courses
include accounting, foreign languages, computers, and secretarial
training.
</P>
<P>
For convenience sake, the college has established branches all
over Shanghai, so that, in addition to television classes,
teachers provide one-on-one instruction. Tuition for disabled
students has been reduced, and they are provided with free video
tapes of the class.
</P>
<P>
One branch in the Huangpu District has opened four computer
classes for the hearing- and speech-impaired, where a professional
lectures from the podium, while another teacher translates using
sign language.
</P>
<P>
So far the college has 159 students, one of whom, Yuan Jifeng,
who has received high grades for two years, says, "I have never
missed a class even if it rains or snows."

<HEADLINE> Private Businesses Making Headway in NW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region has been leading the country in promoting the private
sector by maintaining annual increases of more than 30 percent in
employees, registered capital, output, and sales.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the region had more than 80,000
privately-run businesses, which have become an important
contributor to local revenues.
</P>
<P>
Ye Tingzhu, who owns a private business in Zhongning County,
made money through trade and transportation. Then he spent 1.6
million yuan on a 2.4-km water diversion project to cultivate
nearly 100 ha of wasteland.
</P>
<P>
Another example is Luo Fugui in Zhongwei County, who spent
three million yuan on a cattle farm that raises 1,000 head
annually.
</P>
<P>
This private sector has begun to shift from small-scale street
sales to large-scale technology-intensive operations. As a result,
there are 378 private businesses with over a million yuan in
registered capital, 51 of them have more than five million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Of those private businesses, 315 focus on science and
technology and have more than 200 million yuan in output value
annually, and 16 million yuan in profits.
</P>
<P>
The sector in fact adds 20,000 jobs every year and pays 600
million yuan in wages.
</P>
<P>
The region now has 299 farm produce markets, 80 percent of
whose managers are private business people.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Southeast Asia Sees Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- After a month-long turmoil,
Southeast Asian currency markets are becoming relatively quiet, as
countries in the region have taken a series of measures to deal
with speculations and maintain their economic growth.
</P>
<P>
A month ago, a property-related economic crisis and currency
speculations forced Thailand to allow its currency to slide
against the U.S. dollar, unleashing the world's worst financial
storm since the Mexico crisis in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The crisis spilled over to the rest of Southeast Asia, and the
Philippines was forced to float its peso, while Indonesia had to
widen the trading band for the rupiah. Most currencies in the
region, including the Malaysian ringgit and Singapore dollar, have
devalued to their lowest in years during the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Now the currency markets have calmed down although some
currencies remain under pressure. On Thursday, the Philippine
currency, which devalued to 30 pesos to the U.S. dollar four weeks
ago, appreciated to 28.494 pesos against the greenback from 28.514
pesos in the previous day, while other currencies also gained
ground.
</P>
<P>
Why did the economic clouds pass the region violently but
quickly? Analysts hold that there are three main factors behind
the gradual stabilization of the currencies in the region.
</P>
<P>
First of all, a series of new anti-speculation regulations
adopted by the countries concerned have forced speculators to make
a retreat.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the Malaysian Central Bank ordered domestic banks
not to lend more than 2 million U.S. dollars in ringgit through
the swaps market to any offshore counterpart.
</P>
<P>
By introducing capital control, economists said, the bank
intends to cut off the supply of ringgit for offshore investors to
sell short.
</P>
<P>
Short-selling involves the sale of borrowed currency with the
intent of buying it back at lower prices; it can be used to hedge
against movements in the currency markets or for speculative
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Since May this year, short-sellers have been instrumental in
forcing depreciation of most Southeast Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the central bank tightened rules two weeks
ago on foreign exchange trading to reduce speculative demand for
dollars.
</P>
<P>
All non-deliverable forward contracts of onshore banks to sell
dollars to non-residents must get the approval of the central
bank. The rules will remain in effect for three months.
</P>
<P>
The second main factor is that the countries concerned seek
loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other
official lenders to increase their foreign exchange reserves and
strengthen confidence of investors in the regional economies.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government's decision to accept an International
Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout of the country's flagging economy has
promoted currency stabilization in the region.
</P>
<P>
Announcing an economic recovery plan Tuesday, the Thai
government said that it would seek 12 billion to 15 billion U.S.
dollars from the IMF and other official lenders as part of an IMF
standby arrangement.
</P>
<P>
On July 18, the IMF already approved a 1.1 billion dollar
package to shore up Philippine foreign currency reserves, which
were reduced to 9.6 billion dollars after the central bank spent
1.9 billion dollars to defend the peso against speculators.
</P>
<P>
The third main factor behind the gradual stabilization of
currencies in the region is the virtual abandonment of fixed
exchange rate system by Thailand, the Philippines and other
Southeast Asian countries during the turmoil period.
</P>
<P>
Since Southeast Asian nations have allowed their currencies to
float, speculators are risking potential losses in their
activities if they act unwisely, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Romania Shuts Down Loss-Making Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Victor
Ciorbea said today that he was shutting down 14 large-scale
loss-making factories in a major step to readjust the nation's
industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing on Romania's economic reform programs,
Ciorbea said 21,000 workers will lose their jobs as a result of
the shutdown.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he will also soon close three of the
nine oil refineries in the country due to their poor performance.
</P>
<P>
The current oil processing capacity in Romania is over 30
million tons a year. However, only half of the refineries'
productive potential has been tapped.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea said previous economic reforms have succeeded in
bringing the nation's inflation rate from 20.8 percent during the
January to March period down to only 1 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade deficit in the first six months of this year
dropped to half of that in the same period last year. The total
trade deficit in 1996 was 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said his government also plans to provide equal preferential
policies to investors both at home and from abroad, in a bid to
encourage domestic investment.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Leading In Privatizing Small State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A brewery in Yibin County, in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, used to be a wholly
state-owned enterprise, but not any more.
</P>
<P>
The state now only owns 350,000 yuan of its property, which is
valued at 3.28 million yuan, the larger part having been sold to
employes.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has taken the lead in the country's efforts to save the
large number of poorly-managed small state-owned enterprises through
public sales. More than 3,700 state-owned companies have changed
hands.
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised at the enthusiasm shown by others in purchasing
state properties," an employee at the brewery said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the property rights system of China's state companies
has been a sensative issue, explains Prof. Liu Maocai, director of
the provincial Academy of Social Sciences, who noted that at
present most local small state firms' new owners are from the
private sector. "This is without doubt, a profound socio-economic
revolution," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In the process, many of these firms have gone from money-losers
to money-makers, something that has, interestingly, added value to
state assets, increased local revenues and the number of
employees, according to the Prof.Liu.
</P>
<P>
Governor Song Baorui recently told Xinhua that all of the
nearly 5,000 small state enterprises in Sichuan will mosty likely

However, he explained, the change in ownership of these firms
can't shake up the state-owned sector, which is the country's
economic base. "We have yet to think about introducing reforms of
a similar kind to large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Argentine's Infant Mortality Rate Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Argentine's infant mortality
rate dropped from 25.6 per thousand in 1990 to 22.2 per thousand
in 1995, Health Minister Alberto Mazza said today.
</P>
<P>
Lastest statistics show that preliminary figures for 1996 had
also fallen, he said.
</P>
<P>
The mother-children project, which had helped improve the
health situation for mothers and children during recent years, had
contributed to the fall in the mortality rate, Mazza said.
</P>
<P>
The 160-million-U.S.-dollar project, intended to provide food,
milk and care for mothers and children, has entered its second
stage financed by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
During the new stage, about 500 health centers for mothers and
children will be established and seven hospitals be refurbished,
the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Argentina-Chile Gas Pipeline Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem and his Chilean counterpart, Eduardo Frei, today inaugurated
the Gasandes Gasoduct, a gas pipeline connecting the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The works constitute "a visible and material proof of the
brotherhood of the two peoples," Menem said at the inauguration
ceremony held at the Argentine end of the pipeline, on Gloria
mountain, in the province of Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
"The Andean mountain chain is not a barrier, but an open
passage between neighbors who love and respect each other," Menem
said.
</P>
<P>
The 465-kilometer Gasandes pipeline, a bilateral project with
an investment of 350 million U.S. dollar, starts from the La Mora
Station, south Mendoza, and ends in Santiago, the Chilean capital.
</P>
<P>
At present, the gasoduct carries three million cubic meters of
natural gas a day from Argentina to Chile, to supply a
thermoelectric plant and a housing network in the Chilean capital.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the volume of natural gas carried by the
gasoduct to Chile each day will reach 5.5 million cubic meters by
next March, 10 million by the year 2000, and 20 million by 2017.
</P>
<P>
The gasoduct, which was built under a 1994 gas protocol, is the
second gasoduct built between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The first pipeline, which was inaugurated in January this year,
carries gas from Argentina's Tierra del Fuego to Punta Arenas in
Chile. It has a capacity of 1.5 million cubic meters each day.
</P>
<P>
After the inauguration ceremony in Argentine, the two
presidents left for Chile to preside in the afternoon over the
inauguration of the same works in Chile.

<HEADLINE> Jury Reach Agreement on Match-fixing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The jury finally announced
Thursday on Winchester Crown Court, England, that footballers Hans
Segers and John Fashanu, and Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim
were not guilty of alleging match-fixing in the English
Premiership.
</P>
<P>
Lim, Fashanu and former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar
were also found innocent on a second count after the 10-week
retrial.
</P>
<P>
But the jury foreman said Grobbelaar alone had not been cleared
on a final separate count.
</P>
<P>
It is still possible that Grobbelaar will be charged of
corruption because he was paid 2,000 pounds (about 3,000
U.S. dollars) from his former business partner Chris Vincent to
deliberately let the goal in.
</P>
<P>
The four men were charged of corruption earlier this year, but
no charge was verdicted in the first trial.
</P>
<P>
A year-long investigation was carried out by British police on
an alleged betting syndicate based in East Asia. The prosecution
claimed Lim was its representative in Britain.
</P>
<P>
During the trials, Lim admitted paying Grobbelaar and Segers
for help in forecasting the results of games, but all three
strenuously denied there was ever any plot to fix matches. None of
them admitted giving and accepting corrupt payments.

WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. space shuttle Discovery
today released a satellite for a health check on earth's ozone
layer hours after it soared into orbit.
</P>
<P>
The satellite was hauled overboard by the shuttle's robot arm
as the spaceship, with a total of 24 payloads, sailed 175 miles
(280 kilometers) above the earth, just south of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the satellite took place at 6:27 p.m. EST,
delayed about half an hour because of minor communications
difficulties between the spaceship and the the control room at the
Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
The satellite is supposed to spend nine days flying free of
Discovery, measuring atmospheric gases and temperatures.
</P>
<P>
During that time, NASA and the German space agency will launch
66 small rockets and weather balloons as well as a research plane
to examine the same piece of sky at the same moment as the
satellite.
</P>
<P>
Findings of the satellite will help scientists better
understand ozone depletion and develop more precise meteorological
models.
</P>
<P>
Among the six astronauts aboard is Iceland's first astronaut,
Bjarni Tryggvason, who was born in Iceland and is now a Canadian
citizen.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Between 1990 and 1995 more
than 200 state and federal prisons were built to cope with a
quickly expanding inmate population now exceeding 1 million for
the first time, an official report said today.
</P>
<P>
As of June 30, 1995, state or federal correctional facilities
held 1.02 million people, up from 715,649 in 1990, said the report
released by Bureau of Justice Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Authorities built 168 state and 45 federal prisons to increase
the number of such institutions to 1,500. The number of prison
beds rose 41 percent to 976,000, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, state prisons operated at an average 3 percent
over capacity and federal prisons 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
The nation's 3,300 local jails and county or municipal
detention centers were not covered by the census, which the bureau
conducts every five years.
</P>
<P>
The prison census showed that the state and federal prison
population exceeded 1 million for the first time in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Separate Justice Department figures said the number of inmates
as a percentage of the population also rose. In 1990, prisons
held 293 per 100,000 Americans. By 1995, the figure had risen to
409 inmates per 100,000, and figures already released this year
put 1996's number at 427 per 100,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The consumer credit in the
U.S. remained unchanged in June, the first time in four years, the
U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed said that consumer debt outstanding was unchanged
at a seasonally adjusted 1.22 trillion dollars following increases
at annual rates of 2.5 percent in May and 8.9 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the consumer debt outstanding in the
country hasn't grown since May 1993.
</P>
<P>
The report said that credit-card debt in June grew at an annual
rate of 5.8 percent, compared with rates of 4.1 percent in May and
6.8 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Auto loans outstanding fell at an annual rate of 0.2 percent
following gains at rates of 0.4 percent in May and 11.7 in April.

Other kinds of consumer debt, which includes loans for mobile
homes, education, boats and vacations, shrank at a 9.5 percent
annual rate, the steepest decline since December. The decline
followed increases at a 2.5 percent rate in May and an 8.8 percent
rate in April.
</P>
<P>
The report doesn't include home mortgages or home equity loans.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-backed Firms Contributing to East China Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The port city of Weihai, in
Shandong Province on China's east coast, no longer depends solely
on foreign trade companies to export goods.
</P>
<P>
The city's overseas-financed firms exported 750 million US
dollars worth of goods in the first half of the year, accounting
for nearly 65 percent of the city's total exports for the period.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, foreign trade companies exported only 230 million
dollars worth goods during the same period, accounting for only
20.3 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Less than a decade ago, the city was still counting on its
foreign trade companies for all its exports.
</P>
<P>
A number of enterprises with export licenses are now playing an
increasingly important role in the city's foreign trade, and
exports of 16 enterprises exceed 10 million dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The city has trade relations with 83 countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> "Grape City" to Promote Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Turpan City, a unique natural and
cultural beauty spot in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, has
made it a point to improve its infrastructures to become an
outstanding tourist city in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Xie Tianxi, a local official in charge of tourism, noted that
Turpan has made tourism a pillar industry and will invest huge
funds in this sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central and regional governments have
allocated 50 million yuan from their tight budget and 180 million
yuan in interest-deducted loans to help Turpan develop its tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Turpan is rich in tourist resources,
with 170 historical and scenic sites and mouth-watering grapes of
over 300 varieties.
</P>
<P>
The local tourism industry has been developing rapidly in
recent years. More than 300,000 overseas tourists visit Turpan
annually, as against merely 79 in 1978, the year China launched
its reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
But tourism still lingers at a low level in the city, owing to
its backward traffic condition and lack of tourist facilities,
said Xie.
</P>
<P>
According to another local official Yu Changsong, Turpan plans
to invest 100 million yuan in five years to build or renovate 15
urban roads.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city is also expected to receive a 30 million
yuan investment from a Hong Kong company to rebuild a star-rank hotel
and an outdoor swimming-pool.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, this year, the local government has invested
200,000 yuan in developing tourism-related goods, mainly
handicrafts and artistic articles with ethnic characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the country's first grape museum is now
under way.

<HEADLINE> Henan Grain Prices Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhengzhou, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Prices on the Zhengzhou
wholesale market, one of the country's major grain markets, edged
up during July following a central government decision to purchase
grain at protected prices.
</P>
<P>
Grain prices for late July averaged 1.28 yuan/kg., up 18.5
percent on June levels, with prices for wheat futures also on the
rise.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts attributed rising prices to the implementation
of the State Council circular calling for open-ended grain
purchases at protected prices.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Henan, one of the country's major grain production
bases, harvested over 23.89 billion kg. of summer grain, up 3.4
billion kg. on the previous year's harvest.
</P>
<P>
However, the record harvest sparked falling prices, with the
lowest price for wheat hitting 0.98 yuan/kg..
</P>
<P>
Farmers are delighted that rising wheat prices have been
accompanied by rising prices for rice and corn.
</P>
<P>
As of August 5, the province had doubled last year's figures by
purchasing 3.2 billion kg. of grain beyond state quotas at
protected prices.

China's Tibet Autonomous Region has emerged as a dynamic force in
the development of agricultural and pastoral areas, with related
activities yielding 1996 revenues of 59 million yuan, or 7.1
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The region is now home to 38,000 private businesses, a dramatic
rise on the mere 489 enterprises in 1980. These businesses
employee 57,000 people, up 10-fold increase on 1980, and have
average capital of nearly 10,000 yuan (1,200 US dollars), up
substantially from 1,000 yuan (120 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The private sector's retail sales accounted for 42 percent of
total retail sales for the region, with private businesses
occupying the major part of the market.
</P>
<P>
Private enterprises are involved in more industrial sectors and
hand in better economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Private enterprises in the transportation sector are enjoying
the most rapid development, with success spilling over into the
trade and hospitality sectors, as well as various other
industries.
</P>
<P>
The transportation sector's goal of "building more roads and
gaining prosperity" has had a profound influence on rural workers
who account for near 20 percent of the total number of employees
in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The education level of self-employed people has jumped by five
percent annually since the 1980s, with people attaining either a
middle and high school education lelel accounting for more than 60
percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> US to Do Business With New Cambodian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that it will do business with the newly-elected first prime
minister of Cambodia and the process of the elections was not
"democratic."
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's National Assembly members voted Wednesday to accept
Foreign Minister Ung Huot's nomination as first prime minister to
replace Prince Norodom Ranariddh who was ousted by Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen on July 6.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be meeting with him in order to do business with the
government of Cambodia.... But we do not believe that he was
chosen democratically," State Department spokesman James Rubin
said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Rubin noted that Hun Sen had told U.S. envoy Stephen Solarz and
a delegation from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) that Ranariddh's royalist party FUNCINPEC could present a
new prime minister candidate if it chooses to do so.
</P>
<P>
The United States has suspended aid to Cambodia for 30 days of
review because of the crisis in that Southeast Asian country. With
the period reaching its expiration, Rubin said the United States
"will not provide funds to go through the government of Cambodia,"
but humanitarian aid would continue to go to Cambodia through
non-governmental groups "to help the people of Cambodia."

</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>

<P>
-- A breakthrough in the transport dispute should result in
full rail services on all suburban lines by early next week, but

<HEADLINE> US Denounces Turkey, Turkish Cypriots Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
criticized Turkey and Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus for
their agreement on partial integration.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots signed the agreement Wednesday
to establish a committee on coordinating better relations.
</P>
<P>
"We do not think this announcement was helpful and we don't
want to see any steps taken which undermine the U.N. negotiation
process or which move toward the permanent partition of the
island," State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots established a republic in 1983, but was
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the Turkish Cypriots reached the agreement
with Turkey in an attempt to counter the European Union's decision
to start membership talks with the Greek Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Germany Reports Strong Growth in 1st Half-Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Coal imports by Germany increased by
a robust 25 percent in the first half of 1997 from the same period
of 1995, the Association of German Coal Importers announced today.
</P>
<P>
The increase, mainly due to the expanded demand from power
plants, boosted German coal imports in the first six months to 11
million tons, amounting to 29 percent of the total coal
consumption in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The association meanwhile expected a much less growth in coal
imports for the second half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Coal currently covers about 14 percent of the total energy
supply in Germany.

<HEADLINE> German FM Rejects Karadzic's Offer to Face Trial at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
today rejected an offer by former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic to stand trial in a Serb court under the supervision of
the international war crime tribunal at Den Haag, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel stressed that the international tribunal at Den Haag had
indicted Karadzic as a war criminal and therefore had priority
over any national court.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no jurisdiction a la carte as imagined by
Karadzic," Kinkel added.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic, who has so far refused to face trial at Den Haag,
indicated in an interview with the German newspaper Sueddeutsche
Zeitung Wednesday that he would be willing to answer questions
concerning the war crime charges at a Serb court under the
supervision of the international tribunal and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
"This would be the only respectable way out of the present
dilemma," he said.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A Ukrainian diplomat committed
suicide here Wednesday by jumping from his apartment, said reports
today.
</P>
<P>
Borys Polyachenko, 44, jumped from a 19th floor window
Wednesday afternoon and landed on a balcony 17 floors below.
</P>
<P>
Police are treating the diplomat's death as a suicide, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian diplomat was due to return to his country this
weekend with his family as his posting at the embassy was ending,
police said.
</P>
<P>
He had been at the embassy for three and a half years as first
secretary in charge of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Police said the downtown building is Polyachenko's residence
and his family was home at the time but didn't witness the
incident.
</P>
<P>
"It was an unfortunate incident.... We deeply regret it," said
Andriy Marchenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian embassy, here today.

<P>
NEW YORK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street turned
sharply lower this afternoon as the bond market began to slide
again, lifting interest rates further from last week's 17-month
low.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 71.31 points to
8,188.00, after it flirted the 8,300 mark in earlier trading.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 576.03 million
shares as against 565.22 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 9.13 to 951.19, and
the NYSE composite index fell 4.38 to 492.62.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 6.28 to 1,624.16. It failed to
extend its streak of six consecutive closing highs. The American
Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.99 to 652.07.
</P>
<P>
All four measures had closed at record highs Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As bonds turned lower in the afternoon following a
less-than-enthusiastic auction of new 30-year Treasury securities,
the yield on the long bond jumped to 6.53 percent, up from late
Wednesday's 6.49 percent.
</P>
<P>
The yield fell to a 17-month low of 6.29 percent last week as
bonds traders celebrated the federal budget deal. But rates shot
higher Friday after the release of some economic data that made a
tame inflation outlook less certain.

<HEADLINE> US Faults Netanyahu, Arafat on Accusation Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
criticized both Israeli and Palestinian leaders for trading
accusation that it said was not in the spirit of partnership for
the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier
today accused the Palestinian Authority of behaving "like a regime
facilitating terror, like Iran or Iraq or Libya,"
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said today, "It is hard
to fathom how one could compare Chairman (Yasser) Arafat to
Colonel (Muammar) Gaddafi. Chairman Arafat was on the White House
lawn with the president. He signed a peace agreement with the
Israelis. We regard him as a partner in our effort to find peace
in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
He also criticized Palestinian leader Arafat for his remarks
which he said were "meaning battle with Israel."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Arafat's speech to the Palestine Liberation
Organization's Fatah faction when he said measures imposed by
Israel against the Palestinians following last week's suicide
bombing at a Jerusalem market amounted to a declaration of war,
and he was preparing "for battle" accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said, "To the extent that it (Arafat's remarks) is...
interpreted as meaning battle with Israel, we regard them as
counterproductive. And we think they should not be made."
</P>
<P>
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross is traveling to the Middle East
starting this weekend to make a new drive to revive the stalled
negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians, suspended
since the Israeli government decided to build Jewish homes in Arab
East Jerusalem several months ago. And the situation is further
deteriorating in the region in the wake of Jerusalem's suicide
bombing last week that killed 15 people and injured more than 100.
</P>
<P>
Ross hopes to get agreement on resuming Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations on a timetable aiming for settlement ahead of the May
1999 goal set in the Oslo Accords, the basic document of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will also travel to the
Middle East at the end of this month provided there is progress to
be made after Ross's mediation.

<HEADLINE> Allen Johnson Shines, Bagach Cursed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Allen Johnson of the United States
shocked the world with a year's world best in the men's 110-meter
hurdles, while Ukraine's men's shot put gold medallist Aleksandr
Bagach lost his world title after a positive doping test at the 6th
World Athletics Championships here today.
</P>
<P>
The United States boosted their lead on the medal table with five
golds, two silvers and five bronzes. American John Godina couldn't
stop laugh when he was given Bagach's stripped world title.
</P>
<P>
Germany added one more laurel after Astrid Kumbernuss triumphed in
the women's shot put, making her country place second with a 3-1-2
medal combination. Kenya still remains third overall with a 2-2-1.
</P>
<P>
The day also saw Robert Korzeniowski of Poland win the men's
50-kilometer walk, Annarita Sidoti of Italy bring her country the
first gold in the women's 10,000m walk, and Beatrice Faumuina of New
Zealand seize her first world title in the women's discus.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, defending champion and Olympic gold winner, bolted off the
blocks first to clock 12.93 seconds, the third best all time and only
0.02 seconds off the world record.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Colin Jackson of Britain, who had been tamed 18
months by poor form, hit his season's best to finish second in 13.05,
ahead of Igor Kovac of Slovak Republic.
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to make sure I was out of the blocks ahead of
Jackson., so that he could not disturb my rhythym, " said Johnson
after the race.
</P>
<P>
Jackson wasn't disappointed. "I thought I might have enough for the
gold medal, but anyway this was the time and place for my top
performance. I am back to my best and Allen is at his best. A few more
weeks of training and we could have a great head-to-head battle to
crack the world record."
</P>
<P>
The athletics world was shocked by the scandal that three athletes
- Bagach, the men's 400m hurdler Pascal Maran of France and women's
triple jumper Oxana Zelinskaya of Kazakhstan - have been tested
positive for taking the stimulant ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent decision by the IAAF Congress, these athletes
will be issued a public warning. The results they achieved at the
current championships have been cancelled.
</P>
<P>
Another world leading performance was produced by Sidoti, who led
all the way to win the women's 10,000m walk final in 42:55.49.
Olimpiada Ivanova of Russia and Olga Kardopoltseva of Belarus took the
silver and bronze.
</P>
<P>
"During the last three kilometers my legs were terribly aching.
This gold medal is for Rossella Giordano. She was supposed to compete
here but didn't feel in shape, and so I replaced her," said the small
Italian winner.
</P>
<P>
Kumbernuss, defending champion and Olympic gold medallist, took a
sweet revenge when she beat her nemesis Vita Pavlysh of Ukraine in the
women's shot put final by five centimeters. Her winning toss was 20.71
meters.
</P>
<P>
Pavlysh, who upset Kumbernuss at the World Indoor Championships
this year, tried hard to turn the table but finished in vain.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to show who is the boss in the ring. I knew it would be
difficult and I couldn't get into the competition relaxed," said the
beamed German.
</P>
<P>
A disappointed Pavlysh said:"Here the difference between me and the
first was five centimeters. In the last competition the gap was 10
centimeters. But I am sure that I will break these bloody centimeters
to my favour eventually!"
</P>
<P>
In the day's most grievious battle - the men's 50km walk final -
Olympic champion Korzeniowski proved his victory at the Atlanta Games
was no fluke. He braved the hot sun to win the world title in 3:44:46,
leaving Jesus Angel Garcia of Spain in grimace for the second place 13
seconds behind him. Mexico's Miguel Angel Rodriguez finished third in
3:48:30.
</P>
<P>
Faumuina beat defending champion Ellina Zvereva of Belarus to win
the women's discus with a 66.82m toss. Natalya Sadova of Russia came
third.
</P>
<P>
In today's qualifications, France's Olympic champion Marie-Jose
Perec withdrew from the women's 200m semifinals due to an injury. That
gave Jamaice's Merlene Ottey's a good chance to defend her title.
</P>
<P>
Ottey, 37, showed a red hot form in the semifinal, clocking the
second fastest time in 22.26 seconds with a slow down pace in her
final strides.

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Minister of State in charge of
economy and finance Edouard Mfoumou has called on Camerounians to
make concerted efforts to preserve economic achievements attained
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Mfoumou made the appeal at a press conference Wednesday on the
1997/1998 state budget here in Yaounde.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, a fight against unemployment and
poverty in Cameroun will be given priority in the 1997/1998
budgetary year.
</P>
<P>
Mfoumou insisted that Camerounians should have confidence in
government's efforts to re-launch the economy which has witnessed
steady growth of 5.5 percent since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that the 1997/1998 state budget of 1,256
billion CFA Francs (about 2.4 billion U.S. Dollars) is realistic,
especially as Cameroun has renewed its confidence with world
financial institutions by signing a letter of intent to the
International Monetary Fund last month, outlining the country's
economic, financial and social programs for the next three years.
