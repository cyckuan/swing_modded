Bush Attacks Gore for Clinton Veto
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SCHOOLCRAFT, Mich. (AP) -- George W. Bush, campaigning by train across an
important midwestern battleground state, Saturday sought to portray rival Al
Gore as both anti-family and timid. The GOP nominee seized on President
Clinton's announcement earlier in the day that he would veto legislation to
repeal the so-called marriage penalty in the tax code. ''Al Gore had a chance to
stand up to President Clinton and say don't veto that bill. But he was silent.
He had nothing to say,'' Bush told a railside rally in East Lansing. Gore
dismissed Bush's accusations, saying the congressional proposal would only have
benefitted the wealthy.

   HAMILTON, Mont. (AP) -- Choking smoke veiled homes and businesses here
Saturday as flames turned forest to ash a few miles away in one of dozens of
blazes that have made Montana a leading hot spot on the West's fire map.
President Clinton is expected to tour the area Tuesday and speak with some of
the more than 1,500 military troops who have been sent in to help exhausted

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Convention protesters say the detention

to force him to submit to fingerprinting, and that a woman on a hunger strike
writhed on the floor from lack of water and food. Police deny the accusations
and say they have treated the nearly 400 protesters arrested during the
Republican National Convention fairly. Civil-rights attorneys who visited the
detention center said they found no evidence to confirm abuse.

painfully swollen for several days, but it quickly returned to normal size after
today's operation, said Dr. Richard Hayden, chief of the ear, nose and throat

   BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji thinks both major U.S. political
parties are wrong in their approach to China and doesn't care who wins this
year's presidential election, a U.S. senator who met with the premier says. Zhu
said the election ''basically doesn't make any difference,'' because the
Republican and Democratic Party platforms are essentially the same on relations
with China, Rhode Island Democrat Jack Reed said Zhu told him. Reed met with Zhu

Japan Recalls Atomic Bombing
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) -- In a solemn annual rite, Japan paused Sunday to
recall the day 55 years ago when the dropping of a U.S. atomic bomb ''created a
hell on earth.'' Broken only by the steady chirping of cicadas and the tolling
of a bell, 60 seconds of silent prayer commenced at 8:15 a.m. -- the exact
moment the bomb exploded above Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945. Many in attendance on
the grounds of Peace Memorial Park bowed their heads, while some held Buddhist
prayer beads. The city of Hiroshima estimated that 50,000 people attended the
event, held amid hot, muggy weather. Police put the number at 30,000.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Calm After Speight Arraignment  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The Fijian capital, Suva, was calm Sunday, a
day after coup leader George Speight was charged with minor
offenses linked to his May 19 takeover of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that law and order have largely returned to the South
Pacific nation, there was no protest following a prosecutor's
decision Saturday to ignore an amnesty previously promised to
Speight and his rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Although Speight was arraigned on minor charges of unlawful
assembly, firearms offenses and illegally burying a dead rebel in
the grounds of Parliament, prosecutors are investigating treason
charges that carry a maximum sentence of death.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his supporters all pleaded innocent to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing took six hours as lawyers argued about whether the
key players in the coup were immune from prosecution on charges
directly related to their armed raid on Fiji's Parliament and a
hostage standoff that toppled the government.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and 12 key supporters were remanded in custody and
ordered to reappear Sept. 1, although their lawyers will have an
opportunity to seek bail at an interim hearing on Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   They were visited Sunday by relatives who were taken to the
island by a patrol boat.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's lawyers told the court the rebels now ''accepted
totally'' Fiji's new government, and wanted to lead reconciliation
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Before his arrest on July 26, Speight had threatened to stir a
new campaign of civil unrest and allegedly threatened the life of
President Ratu Josefa Iloilo unless the new government was stacked
with his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, a failed businessman, held dozens of lawmakers in
Parliament for two months until the military met rebel demands for
an amnesty, discarded the multiracial constitution and ousted the
hostage government -- led by ethnic Indian Mahendra Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claimed that ethnic Indian Fijians have too much power
and threaten indigenous Fijian culture.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Indian Fijians -- whose ancestors were brought here in the
1870s by British colonialists as indentured laborers -- make up 44
percent of the nation's 814,000 people and dominate business and
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The raid cast Fiji into turmoil and sparked international
condemnation of the South Pacific nation's abandonment of
democracy.

<HEADLINE> Six Anwar Protesters Freed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Police released six supporters of
Anwar Ibrahim who were arrested while protesting the postponement
of a verdict in the jailed politician's sodomy trial, news reports
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Kuala Lumpur police chief Kamarudin Ali, quoted by the Sunday
Star newspaper, said that the six people, including three women,
were ''released unconditionally'' on Saturday, one day after about
500 protesters defied a government ban on public rallies and
demonstrated outside the High Court.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities, however, were still holding Lokman Noor Adam, a
prominent youth leader in the opposition National Justice Party,
for handing out anti-government leaflets during Friday's protest.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration occurred after the High Court, in a surprise
move earlier this week, announced that Judge Ariffin Jaka was not
ready with his decision, which he had been scheduled to deliver on
Friday. No new date was set for the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders and at least one local human rights group
have condemned the crackdown against Friday's demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Government leaders have repeatedly warned Malaysians not to
demonstrate, saying that street rallies would cause chaos and
undermine the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-government protests have shaken Kuala Lumpur sporadically
since Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar as his deputy in
September 1998. Anwar was soon arrested and eventually sentenced to
six years imprisonment for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, who turns 53 on Thursday, faces an additional 20 years in
jail if found guilty of sodomizing his former family driver. Anwar
accuses Mahathir of scheming with a cabal of senior politicians to
hatch the charges against him.

<HEADLINE> Texas Church Van Crashes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A church van returning from a mission trip in
Mexico slammed into a guardrail Saturday, injuring nine children
and one adult.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-year-old girl was in critical condition, and two other
children were listed as stable at University Hospital in San
Antonio. Four others were treated and released, and another was
awaiting release from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   An adult and another child were listed as stable at Wilford
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the victims, all from Brook Hollow Baptist Church
in Desoto, just south of Dallas, were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the driver, the Rev. Ed Warrick, lost control of the
van before running into the grass and then hitting a guardrail
along Interstate 35. The van flipped across an I-35 access road,
collided with another vehicle and flipped again.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers were returning from a mission in Monterrey,
Mexico, where they were building a church.

<HEADLINE> Suharto Court Papers To Be Filed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Charges and documents alleging massive
corruption by Indonesia's ex-dictator Suharto are to be filed in a
court sometime this week, but the defendant will not be obliged to
appear, a senior prosecutor said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The technical procedure is the latest step in bringing the
ex-leader to justice.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Suharto, 79, was formally charged with siphoning $570
million in state funds through a complex network of tax-free
charities controlled by him.
</P>
<P>
   The money was allegedly used to finance the creation of huge
business empires for his family and cronies during his 32-year
reign.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had planned to file charges Monday in the South
Jakarta District Court.
</P>
<P>
   However, Barman Zahir, who heads that district's prosecution
office, said the court filing would be delayed while state lawyers
put finishing touches to the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys want a trial to start within weeks, but
Suharto's legal team says he is too ill and have raised doubts that
a hearing would start soon.
</P>
<P>
   They claim a series of strokes has damaged Suharto's brain and
impaired his memory and ability to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto was forced to quit office in May 1998 amid bloody
student protests and riots.
</P>
<P>
   He has denied any wrongdoing, but has been under house arrest
for the past four months.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted he could be sentenced to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Current President Abdurrahman Wahid has offered to pardon
Suharto if the stolen money is surrendered.

<HEADLINE> New offer extends talks  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - A last-minute offer by Verizon Communications
resulted in at least a temporary extension of contracts talks and
averted an immediate strike of more than 87,000 workers in 12
eastern states early Sunday, even though a few workers started
picketing right after a midnight deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not officially on strike, we're still at the bargaining
table,'' said Jim Spellane of International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers. ''The company handed in a new package at the
last minute and the unions are looking at it now.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a Communications Workers of America union official in
Albany, N.Y., said pickets went up there at one minute after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bit of a fluid situation,'' said CWA spokeswoman
Candice Johnson in Washington. ''There was a lot of late progress
in the last hour of negotiations, and we're still continuing to
negotiate with the company.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to be telling members to go ahead and report to
work in the spirit of a mutual agreement to stay at it and to try
to reach a settlement in a few hours,'' said Jim Miller, another
CWA official in Washington. ''That's the hope. Even though some
people no doubt left the job at midnight and are on strike, we're
urging others who are going to be on shifts in the morning to ahead
and report to work. We hope to have this wrapped up during the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said Verizon offered a ''comprehensive proposal'' after
11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears to address our major issues,'' said Miller.
''There's definitely progress being made.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can say that we're talking all through the night,'' said
Verizon spokesman Eric Rabe.
</P>
<P>
   Of Verizon's last-minute proposal, Rabe said, ''Obviously all
this stuff is very sensitive and very fluid, and it's just not
appropriate to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the apparent appearance of some pickets, it
would be difficult to immediately assess the reality of any strike
because there was not expected to be any immediate impact on
telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   A strike by operators and technicians likely would eventually
delay repairs, new service orders, billing inquiries and directory
assistance for 25 million Verizon Communications customers from
Maine to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, the nation's largest local and wireless telephone
company, was formed in June by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The CWA which represents about 72,500 Verizon workers, and the
IBEW, which represents 14,700 more, had authorized a strike to
begin at 12:01 a.m. EDT Sunday, when the unions' contract with
Verizon expired.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe told reporters late Saturday that company managers would
''work very long hours, seven days a week'' taking over customer
service jobs if a strike occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll do whatever we have to do to provide service in the face
of the strike,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe said the company was not considering hiring nonunion
workers to fill strikers' slots, but added that ''anything's
possible'' were a strike to continue for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon says its needs flexibility deciding what it pays
wireless workers in the rapidly emerging field. Verizon on Friday
submitted a proposed five-year contract that included a 3.5 percent
annual raise and various workplace concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the proposed contract did not cover the unions'
request for an easier way to unionize wireless workers because
Verizon owns only 55 percent of the wireless operation, which is a
separate company run through a joint venture with Vodafone
AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials want assurances the company will let union
workers take jobs in the expanding wireless operation and will give
the unions more opportunity to organize the 32,000 current wireless
workers, virtually all of whom are nonunion.
</P>
<P>
   Along with higher wages and concessions on working conditions
and job security, the unions also want Verizon to stop contracting
work in other rapidly growing areas, such as installation of
Internet service lines, to nonunion companies.
</P>
<P>
   Union negotiator Vince Maisano said the major stumbling block
was Verizon's refusal to allow union workers to take jobs in the
wireless operation and to end contracts with nonunionized
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Union members in the company's conventional telephone operation
lose union benefits if they take jobs in Verizon's wireless
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The unions want Verizon to allow organization of wireless
workers through a ''card check,'' an informal process labor leaders
say is less cumbersome than representation elections, which can
take months.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say the company must also raise union wages and
improve job security and stop forcing employees to work overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The states involved are Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, along with the
District of Columbia.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A last-minute contract offer by Verizon

service jobs if a strike occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll do whatever we have to do to provide service in the face
of the strike,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe said the company was not considering hiring nonunion
workers to fill strikers' slots, but added that ''anything's
possible'' were a strike to continue for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon says its needs flexibility deciding what it pays
wireless workers in the rapidly emerging field. Verizon on Friday
submitted a proposed five-year contract that included a 3.5 percent
annual raise and various workplace concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The company says contracts proposed earlier did not cover the
unions' request for an easier way to unionize wireless workers
because Verizon owns only 55 percent of the wireless operation,
which is a separate company run through a joint venture with
Vodafone AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials want assurances the company will let union
workers take jobs in the expanding wireless operation and will give
the unions more opportunity to organize the 32,000 current wireless
workers, virtually all of whom are nonunion.
</P>
<P>
   Along with higher wages and concessions on working conditions
and job security, the unions also want Verizon to stop contracting
work in other rapidly growing areas, such as installation of
Internet service lines, to nonunion companies.
</P>
<P>
   Union negotiator Vince Maisano said the major stumbling block
was Verizon's refusal to allow union workers to take jobs in the
wireless operation and to end contracts with nonunionized
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Union members in the company's conventional telephone operation
lose union benefits if they take jobs in Verizon's wireless
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The unions want Verizon to allow organization of wireless
workers through a ''card check,'' an informal process labor leaders
say is less cumbersome than representation elections, which can
take months.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say the company must also raise union wages and
improve job security and stop forcing employees to work overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The states involved are Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, along with the
District of Columbia.

Verizon Talks Reach Temporary Extension
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A last-minute offer by Verizon resulted in at least a
temporary extention of contracts talks and averted an immediate strike early
Sunday. ''The company handed in a new package at the last minute and the unions
are looking at it now,'' said Jim Spellane of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers. Spellane indicated that a threatened strike had not been
called off, but said the two unions involved were looking at the new offer. It
was difficult to immediately assess the reality of any strike, because there was
not expected to be any immediate impact on telephone service.

   WESTHAMPTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Al Gore will sweep into the Democratic National
Convention fresh from a tour designed to demonstrate he will ''go the distance''
on the environment, welfare reform, tax relief, health care and other issues,
his campaign said Saturday. The vice president and former senator of Tennessee
will travel from his hometown of Carthage through southern and Midwest states,
with a ''handing of the baton'' to Gore from President Clinton in Michigan on
Aug 15, spokesman Chris Lehane said. He then heads to the convention, Aug. 14

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Three power plants failed late last week during

in Northern California on Thursday and two in Southern California on Friday --
weren't noticed by consumers because other plants took up the slack, officials
said. Officials said the outages are indicative of a system which has been
pushed to capacity for a long time, by hot weather, a growing population and

week, but the defendant will not be obliged to appear, a senior prosecutor said
Sunday. The technical procedure is the latest step in bringing the ex-leader to
justice. Last week Suharto, 79, was formally charged with siphoning $570 million
in state funds through a complex network of tax-free charities controlled by
him. The money was allegedly used to finance the creation of huge business
empires for his family and cronies during his 32-year reign.

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The Fijian capital, Suva, was calm Sunday, a day after
coup leader George Speight was charged with minor offenses linked to his May 19
takeover of Parliament. In a sign that law and order have largely returned to
the South Pacific nation, there was no protest following a prosecutor's decision
Saturday to ignore an amnesty previously promised to Speight and his rebels.
Although Speight was arraigned on minor charges of unlawful assembly, firearms
offenses and illegally burying a dead rebel in the grounds of Parliament,
prosecutors are investigating treason charges that carry a maximum sentence of

Tribunal May Be Needed for E. Timor

<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- The United Nations may need to set up a war crimes
tribunal to prosecute those responsible for the death and destruction that
wracked East Timor last year, the top U.N. human rights official said Saturday.
Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said that if
Indonesia fails to punish the people behind the violence that followed Timor's
vote for independence in August 1999, the United Nations may have to.
Anti-independence militia, backed by elements in the Indonesian military, went
on a rampage after the U.N.-sponsored vote for independence ended 24 years of
Indonesian rule, killing dozens, destroying hundreds of buildings and leaving
thousands displaced.

won for the fourth time in a row and the 10th time in 11 games. Atlanta lost at
St. Louis earlier Saturday. Piazza sprained his left knee trying to beat out a
grounder in the fourth and was taken from the game. X-rays were negative and the
All-Star catcher will be re-evaluated Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Broncos 31, Cardinals 17  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- As nervous as a rookie, Terrell Davis
returned to the NFL on Saturday night and carried the ball on
Denver's first two offensive plays of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' comeback was solid, if unspectacular, in the Broncos'
31-17 victory over the Arizona Cardinals on a sweltering night with
the temperature at kickoff 101 degrees and thunderstorms looming in
the distance.
</P>
<P>
   In his first action since a season-ending knee injury last Oct.
3, the 1998 MVP played the entire first quarter with the rest of
Denver's first unit. He gained 24 yards in six carries, including a
long gain of seven.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a big step for me,'' Davis said, ''but it's not the
last step on this journey. There's still a ways to go, but I
definitely made some progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he was a bundle of nerves before the kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a thousand different emotions,'' he said. ''I was
extremely nervous and I couldn't figure out how to approach the
game, whether as a rookie or a 10-year veteran. I was real
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   That ended when he took a handoff from Brian Griese for a 2-yard
gain on the Broncos' first offensive play.
</P>
<P>
   ''The butterflies were gone,'' Davis said, ''and it was back to
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Griese, playing only the first quarter, was 5-for-8 for 61 yards
and a touchdown. Gus Frerotte, playing most of the rest of the
game, was 12-for-21 for 134 yards and two scores.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos lost two backup receivers with injuries. Chris
Doering went out with an ankle injury early in the second quarter,
and rookie Muneer Moore with a dislocated left ankle early in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Pittman, battling rookie Thomas Jones for the No. 1
running back spot for Arizona, had a strong first quarter. He
gained 52 yards in seven carries, including a 20-yard run on the
Cardinals' opening touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the sixth pick overall in the draft, had a rough night.
He gained 18 yards in eight carries. His longest run of 10 yards
ended when he fumbled the ball away, a turnover that led to Jason
Elam's 39-yard field goal in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, which didn't score a touchdown in the first quarter all
of last season, got one on a quick opening drive as Jake Plummer
tossed a 39-yard scoring pass to Rob Moore 1:45 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Denver tied it 7 on Griese's 18-yard pass to Rod Smith with 3:38
left in the first. The Broncos took the lead for good 14-7 on Jimmy
Spencer's 45-yard interception return 59 seconds into the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona used a fake punt on fourth-and-one from the Cardinals'
35 on the final play of the first quarter for a first down at the
40. But two plays later Plummer, falling backwards under the
intense rush of blitzing Eric Brown, threw over the middle and was
intercepted by Spencer, who raced untouched to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, who threw an NFL-high 24 interceptions last season, was
3-for-3 for 67 yards on the opening drive and finished 4-for-9 for
77 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays after Plummer's interception, Arizona backup
quarterback Dave Brown was picked off by Eric Brown at the
Cardinals' 40. Six plays later, on third-and-goal, Frerotte threw
seven yards to tight end Desmond Clark for a touchdown to make it
21-7 with 11:16 left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Frerotte also had a 24-yard touchdown pass to Andre Reed to put
Denver up 31-10 early in the fourth.

<P>
   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Heavy monsoon rains flooded hundreds of
villages in northern Bangladesh, killing at least four people and
leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless, the government
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At least 100,000 people were marooned in the worst-hit districts
of Kurigram, Gaibandha and Lalmonirhat, 150 miles north of Dhaka,
the Bangladesh capital, the flood control ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Four people drowned in swirling flood waters in Kurigram
district on Friday and Saturday. At least 10,000 people fled their
inundated homes in Kurigram and neighboring Gaibandha district and
took shelter on higher grounds, the ministry's Flood Information
Center said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, torrential rains flooded the capital, killing four
people and injuring at least 50 others.
</P>
<P>
   The government has yet to begin relief efforts. ''The situation
is still under control and there is no reason to panic,'' an
official at the center said.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation of 130 million people, is
buffeted by floods and cyclones every year. A cyclone had killed
140,000 people in 1991.

   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The driver of a pickup truck traveling
the wrong direction on a highway Saturday night smashed into
several vehicles, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Five people, including the pickup driver, were killed. Six
others were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup driver was apparently fleeing another wreck moments

killed when the pickup burst into flames after hitting a van
carrying 12 people, said Fort Worth police Lt. David Burgess.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately known in which vehicles the other dead
passengers -- a small child, a teen-ager, and two adults -- were
riding.
</P>
<P>
   Two girls and a boy, all between the ages of 3 and 7, were in
serious condition at Cook Children's Medical Center, said

   BEIJING (AP) -- A bus carrying 11 people along a mountain road in
southeast China fell into a ravine, killing nine and injuring two,
the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

   The accident occurred Friday as the bus was traveling through

   Eight people died on the scene and one died after being taken to

<HEADLINE> Army Corps Reform Has Little Success  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Longtime critics of the Army Corps of
Engineers thought lawmakers would flock to their cause after
allegations that top agency officials rigged data to favor costly
construction on the upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a half-year later, however, their goal of overhauling the
way major corps projects are approved remains elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ''There doesn't seem to be any real effort in Washington to fix
things,'' said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense.
</P>
<P>
   While the corps' reputation has taken a hit from allegations,
the fight for reform is having to overcome the cozy relationship
between Congress and an agency responsible for projects that are
popular in lawmakers' districts.
</P>
<P>
   The corps oversees a $4 billion public works portfolio, mostly
for commercial waterway navigation and flood control.
</P>
<P>
   In February, corps economist Donald Sweeney alleged in an
affidavit filed with the federal Office of Special Counsel that
corps officials had altered a study to make it appear that the $1
billion cost of doubling the length of seven barge locks on the
Mississippi and Illinois rivers would be justified by the economic
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Corps officials have denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   While the study is not expected to be completed until later this
year, its initial conclusions favor the construction that
politically connected agribusiness companies are pushing.
</P>
<P>
   The charges prompted investigations by the Army's inspector
general and the National Academy of Sciences, both of which
continue. Some lawmakers also have asked for reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Congress adjourned for its August recess, three
House Democrats introduced legislation that would require
independent review of the corps' largest projects, increase public
participation and add environmental safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., also sponsored
legislation to create a commission to investigate the agency and
review privatizing some of its functions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time to let the sun shine in ... early on in the process
so that some of the integrity and the trustworthiness of these
projects can be restored,'' said Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., who
sponsored the House bill with Democratic Reps. Tammy Baldwin of
Wisconsin and Earl Blumenauer of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Their proposal mirrors changes sought by environmental groups,
including putting environmental concerns on par with economic
benefits as projects are considered.
</P>
<P>
   These groups lament that corps construction, such as locks and
dams, often changes the natural flow of waterways and destroys
fragile bird and fish habitats. They fear more large-scale projects
would further endanger valuable ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   The House version of legislation authorizing corps projects is
still being written, but several lawmakers said it would contain
portions of the Kind bill. Those include a 3-year tryout of
independent review -- limited to five projects -- and a ban on
projects that cause environmental damage too costly to fix.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps declined to comment on pending legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The president of MARC 2000, an industry coalition pressing for
the lock expansions, said the project approval process already is
too long. Christopher Brescia also said more review would further
delay improvements needed to keep down transportation costs low and
help Midwestern grain compete worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version of the authorization bill contains no reform
language. Also in the Senate, environmentalists were put on the
defensive when GOP Sens. Ted Stevens of Alaska, the Appropriations
Committee chairman, and Pete Domenici of New Mexico, Budget
Committee chairman, moved to block any Clinton administration
efforts to increase civilian control over the agency.
</P>
<P>
   That restriction eventually was dropped, but the senators had
made their point that such reforms should not go forward without
input from Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the challenges ahead, Kind remains optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a consensus developing on the Hill on reform,'' Kind
said. ''I'm trying to tell people that this is not an anti-corps
effort.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Navy Exercises Protested  </HEADLINE>
By ISMAEL TORRES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Chanting ''No to the Navy!''
thousands of Puerto Ricans rallied in San Juan on Sunday to protest
new U.S. military exercises on the outlying island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Jets from the USS Harry Truman aircraft carrier began dropping
dummy bombs on Vieques on Thursday, and ships from its accompanying
battle group will begin shelling the island later this month.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 protesters marched in 90-degree heat to a rally at
the gates of Fort Buchanan, an army base in suburban San Juan.
There, organizers urged activists to redouble their yearlong effort
to force out the Navy. Police said the protest was peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Activists claim the exercises endanger Vieques' 9,400 residents
and have stunted economic development. But the Navy called the
rally ''part of a multi-million-dollar smear campaign'' directed by
groups who want independence for Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of these people have a political affiliation, and their
cause has nothing to do with Vieques,'' said Navy spokesman Jeff
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the protesters marched to the rally from the federal
prison in San Juan, where authorities are holding 19 activists --
including two local lawmakers -- on charges of trying to enter the
bombing range to halt exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at the rally -- organized hastily after the Navy
announced the new exercises last week -- fell far short of the
80,000 who marched at a similar event in February.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment over the Navy's presence in Vieques boiled over in
April 1999 after a U.S. Marine Corps jet dropped two bombs off
target, killing a civilian security guard working on the Navy
bombing range. A study by the Puerto Rican government revealed
other close calls and concluded the bombing has caused
environmental damage -- a charge the Navy denies.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters built camps on the range, halting exercises for one
year until U.S. Marshals cleared them out by force on May 4. Since
then, more than 450 people have been arrested trying to re-enter
the training ground.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has promised to order the Navy out by May 2003
if Vieques residents vote in a referendum to expel them. Until the
vote, expected next year, maneuvers are to continue with
non-explosive bombs and shells.
</P>
<P>
   But activists fear a new U.S. president may renege on Clinton's
deal if a military emergency arises. They want the Navy to leave
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the Harry Truman battle group was on the high seas
northeast of Puerto Rico, Gordon said. Its airplanes were dropping
25-pound metal bombs on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy and the Puerto Rican government have set up equipment
to monitor the noise of guns when ship-to-shore shelling begins
later this month, Gordon said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Vacation Turns Fundraiser  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton's working vacation
wound down Sunday with plans for two fund-raising parties to
benefit the Senate campaign his wife is waging in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were the guests of
honor at parties expected to bring in $400,000. The fanciest affair
was an intimate dinner for 65 with entertainment by singer Carly
Simon and a ticket price of $15,000 per couple.
</P>
<P>
   The president hoped to raise about $1.3 million over a long
weekend crammed with parties on Martha's Vineyard, the neighboring
resort island of Nantucket and the Kennedy family compound on Cape
Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also found time to play a round of golf Saturday and
meet with wealthy potential donors to his post-White House
presidential library.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his family have vacationed on Martha's Vineyard
every year of his presidency except 1996, when they went to
Wyoming. This year's was the shortest stay -- just three days.
</P>
<P>
   The first family decided not to take a full-fledged summer
vacation this year in order to concentrate on campaigning for her
Senate race and fund-raising for Vice President Al Gore and other
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returns to Washington on Monday.
